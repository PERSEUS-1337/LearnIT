It also includes enhanced penalties for alien smuggling and asylum abuse, along with definitions and an effective date. The \"Asylum at Ports of Entry System Improvements Act of 1993\" establishes expedited consideration and exclusion procedures for asylum claims by individuals with missing or fraudulent documents. The \"Admissions Fraud\" section of the Act is amended to include fraud, misrepresentation, and failure to present documents as grounds for exclusion. This includes presenting fraudulent documents or failing to present any documents when seeking entry to the United States. Any document determined by an immigration officer to be forged, counterfeit, altered, falsely made, stolen, or containing a misrepresentation of a material fact is grounds for exclusion for an alien entering the United States. Aliens entering the United States must present valid documents to immigration officers at ports of entry. Failure to do so can result in exclusion from the country. \"Expedited procedures for certain asylum cases have been implemented.\" The Attorney General designates senior asylum officers with 2 years of experience to work at US airports and ports of entry. Special Mobile Asylum Teams can be formed from these officers to manage large-scale asylum situations or conduct spot checks. Funds appropriated under section 404(b) can be used by the Attorney General to mobilize the Special Mobile Asylum Team in emergency large-scale asylum situations. Any alien suspected of being excludable but requesting asylum must be detained for further inquiry by a senior asylum officer. If an alien is potentially excludable under section 212(a)(6)(C) of the Act, they may be eligible to apply for asylum. The senior asylum officer will assess if the alien has a valid asylum claim and if they have been resettled in another country. The alien has the right to legal representation at no cost to the government. If the senior asylum officer determines that an alien's asylum claim is frivolous or they have been firmly resettled in another nation, the alien will be ineligible for asylum and excluded from the United States. The alien may be held in detention pending final disposition of their case, unless the Attorney General deems detention not in the public interest. Excluded aliens are also ineligible for withholding of deportation. The Attorney General may direct the exclusion of an alien to a country designated by the alien, if willing to accept them, unless deportation to that country is deemed prejudicial. The Attorney General may disregard an alien's country designation if no response is received within 5 days. An alien can file a petition for review within 48 hours of an adverse order by a senior asylum officer. The review will be conducted by an asylum immigration judge, limited to issues in subsection (g). The scope of asylum review includes determining if the applicant is an alien, used fraudulent documents for entry, has a frivolous asylum request, or has been resettled elsewhere. A senior asylum officer can refer non-excludable aliens for asylum adjudication if an exclusion proceeding is delayed. Judicial review is limited to habeas corpus petitions. The scope of asylum review includes determining if the applicant is an alien, used fraudulent documents for entry, has a frivolous asylum request, or has been resettled elsewhere. A senior asylum officer can refer non-excludable aliens for asylum adjudication if an exclusion proceeding is delayed. Judicial review is limited to habeas corpus petitions for individuals found excludable from the United States. Enhanced penalties for alien smuggling and asylum abuse apply to aliens arriving in the United States after the enactment of the Act. Enhanced penalties for alien smuggling and asylum abuse under Section 3 of the Act include increased prison terms up to 10 years for those involved in such activities for financial gain. The penalties can be up to 20 years or both if serious bodily harm is caused to the alien. These amendments apply to violations occurring after the Act's enactment. The amendment to Section 101(a) (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)) defines 'frivolous' as an asylum claim lacking substance or credibility. It also defines 'firmly resettled' as receiving permanent resident status or citizenship in a country of refuge. The amendment to Section 101(a) defines 'firmly resettled' as not establishing significant ties in a country or facing restricted living conditions. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 90 days after its enactment."
