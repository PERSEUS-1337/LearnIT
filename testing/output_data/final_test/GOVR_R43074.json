    "content": "Contractors have been crucial in U.S. military operations, comprising over half of the Department of Defense's workforce in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Balkans. With the shift towards preparing for future military operations, analysts and officials believe contractors will continue to play a central role. DOD must be ready to award and manage contracts quickly and effectively in diverse and unknown environments. The report provides background information on DOD's extensive use of contractors in military operations, highlighting potential policy and oversight issues for Congress. Congress' decisions on these issues could significantly impact DOD's reliance on contractors in future operations. DOD has increasingly relied on contractors to support overseas military operations due to budget cuts in logistics and support capabilities. Contractors have represented over half of the force in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. This trend reflects the increased reliance on contractors supporting U.S. troops in recent operations. As of March 2013, there were approximately 108,000 DOD contractor personnel in Afghanistan, including 18,000 private security contractors. DOD obligations for contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan totaled $160 billion over six fiscal years, surpassing all other U.S. federal agencies. The military relies heavily on operational contract support for large-scale and long-term operations. Contractors play critical roles in military operations, providing operational benefits such as freeing up uniformed personnel for combat, expertise in specialized fields, and surge support. DOD recognizes the importance of contract management as a mission-essential task, especially in large-scale and long-term operations. Operational contract support is considered a critical function for military operations, natural disasters, and unanticipated calamities. Contractors play critical roles in military operations by providing specialized expertise and surge support. They are responsible for tasks such as armed security, life support, intelligence analysis, and training local security forces. Hiring contractors can be more cost-effective than maintaining a permanent in-house capability, and they can fulfill critical manpower needs when troop numbers are limited. However, ineffective use of contractors can lead to delays in providing necessary support and wasteful spending. Troops may face delays in receiving necessary support due to ineffective management of contractors, leading to wasteful spending. Contractors can compromise the credibility and effectiveness of the military, as seen in Iraq and Afghanistan. Improved planning and management of contractors could mitigate risks during overseas operations. DOD admits inadequacies in executing large-scale contract support in these regions, with military commanders and service members lacking preparation and training to work with contractors effectively. The military lacked trained oversight personnel and infrastructure to manage contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates admitted to the failure in preparing for the use of contractors, leading to unsupervised and unstrategic contractor operations. The Department of Defense did not have a comprehensive plan for using contractors in combat environments, leading to ad-hoc decisions without proper oversight. This lack of planning resulted in poor performance, wasted billions of dollars, and failure to achieve mission goals. Observers noted that resources for oversight were insufficient, and using contractors became the default mechanism without considering the best solution or necessary management resources. During operations, contract support in operational environments is more complex than in peacetime, with strategic goals taking precedence over cost, schedule, and performance. In peacetime, success is measured by obtaining the required goods or services on time and at a fair price, while in operations, achieving military objectives or countering insurgency is the primary focus. For example, building a road in peacetime aims for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, but in operational environments, strategic goals may outweigh these considerations. During operations, contract success may be measured differently than in peacetime. In counterinsurgency or humanitarian crises, factors like winning local support or rapidly providing supplies may be more important than cost or technical specifications. Contract risks in operational environments differ from peacetime, requiring a broader evaluation beyond cost, schedule, and performance. In Afghanistan, evaluating contract success goes beyond cost, schedule, and performance. Operational criteria like impact on security, local dynamics, and the enemy are crucial. Contract support in operational environments is more complex than in peacetime. DOD contract obligations in Afghanistan in FY2012 were mainly for services, adding complexity to the process. The federal government acquisition process can be more challenging in operational environments due to weaknesses such as inadequate planning, poorly written requirements, and a lack of qualified personnel. In expeditionary settings, writing contracts that align with counterinsurgency goals, evaluating bidders, and overseeing projects become more difficult. Additionally, combating fraud and corruption in unstable countries poses further challenges. Contracting fraud and corruption in countries with weak law enforcement and judicial systems can be exploited by corrupt officials and warlords. Differences between using contractors in peacetime versus expeditionary operations were not apparent before military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Standard acquisition funding procedures hindered effective contract support execution. Peacetime contracting may not adequately prepare government personnel for operational contract support in DOD operations. Many analysts and DOD officials believe the military needs to change its approach to operational contract support, making it a core competency. Estimates suggest billions of dollars have been lost to fraud and waste in U.S. government contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan, highlighting the need for better planning and oversight to prevent squandering of funds. Abuses by contractors, including those working for DOD and U.S. civilian agencies, can aid anti-American insurgents. Incidents like summary shootings, abuse of prisoners, and payments to insurgents have been reported. Insufficient oversight of contractors can undermine military operations. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs found evidence of U.S. contractors making protection payments to local warlords in Afghanistan, potentially even to the Taliban. The Senate Armed Services Committee also found evidence of U.S.-funded contractors supporting the Taliban. These actions undermined the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and Iraq, leading to organizational changes by the DOD to improve contractor oversight. The DOD made significant organizational changes to improve contractor oversight, including establishing various commands and offices such as the Joint Theater Support Contracting Command, Army Contracting Command, Task Force 2010, vendor vetting cell, and Joint Contingency Acquisition Support Office. Additionally, existing organizations like the Joint Staff's Operational Contract Support Services Division and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Division were upgraded. The Functional Capabilities Integration Board was created as a forum for senior leaders to address operational contract support issues. DOD has expanded regulation, policy, and doctrine related to operational contract support, including the release of directives and updates addressing various aspects of managing operational contract support from 2009 to 2013. DOD has increased its acquisition workforce by 21% since 2008, with over 150,000 personnel, including 30,000 contracting professionals. Efforts to combat contract fraud include introducing an electronic payment system, reducing cash payments to vendors in Afghanistan from 39% in 2008 to 1% in FY 2012. DOD has significantly improved operational contract support by increasing the number of Defense Contract Management Agency professionals. Military commanders and service members were unprepared for the extent of contractor support but quickly recognized the critical role of contractors in military operations. The abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison and the shooting of a handcuffed Afghan led to internal efforts to examine contractor support, such as the Gansler report. Senior leaders have made efforts to elevate the importance of operational contract support, with General David Petraeus issuing contracting guidance in 2010. Contracting is a crucial aspect of military operations, with clear goals to improve oversight and support mission objectives. General John Allen updated contracting guidance to emphasize its critical role. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recognized contractors as integral to military forces, echoing the Secretary of Defense's memorandum on operational contract support responsibilities. DOD has assigned general/flag officers to key positions to improve operational contract support since 2008. This includes new positions in acquisition and operational contract support-related roles like Task Force 2010 and Task Force Shafafiyat. Training and exercises have been expanded to address the role of contractors. DOD has expanded training and exercises to address the role of contractors, incorporating operational contract support into Professional Military Education. A curriculum guide was completed in 2012 to inform Joint Professional Military Education. The Army launched an Operational Contract Support course in 2009, with over 1,500 DOD personnel graduating in the last five years. A Joint Operational Contract Support Planning and Execution Course is being developed based on the Army's training model. The fourth annual Joint Contracting Readiness Exercise was held in January 2013, attended by over three hundred contracting professionals. The Joint Contracting Readiness Exercise (JCRX) was attended by over three hundred contracting professionals from various Army Contracting Command units and other Services. Planning is underway for next year's exercise with U.S. Northern Command, marking the first such exercise with a combatant command. Congressional actions have been instrumental in improving operational contract support, including legislation establishing key positions within the DOD. The establishment of key positions within the DOD, oversight hearings on contractor abuses, and the creation of Task Force 2010 have improved operational contract support. However, challenges remain in effectively utilizing and managing contractors according to the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. Improving the Department's ability to manage contractors on the battlefield is a priority, with ongoing efforts to institutionalize operational contract support. Concerns exist about future funding for these efforts, but DOD officials believe that modest investments in education, training, and exercises will lead to significant cost savings. Training and exercises in the near-term are expected to save billions of dollars and increase operational success. Analysts believe Congress will influence DOD funding for initiatives. Poor planning for contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan was attributed to a lack of value for contracting within the military culture, leading to oversight issues. According to various reports, transforming the military culture to appreciate the role of contractors is crucial for operational success. DOD has taken steps to change its culture by establishing key positions and expanding education curriculum. DOD has made efforts to elevate the role of operational contract support by establishing key positions and expanding education curriculum. Recommendations include senior leadership consistently emphasizing the importance of contract support, integrating courses on operational contract support in military education, and expanding training exercises to include contractors in battlefield roles. These efforts are seen as crucial post-Afghanistan drawdown to maintain awareness of the critical role of contract support. Senior leadership must consistently articulate the importance of contract support to drive cultural change in the military. Analysts emphasize that when management sets priorities, communicates a vision, and aligns incentives with organizational structures, real change can occur. Actions like contracting guidance from Generals Petraeus and Allen have increased awareness of the impact of contracting on operations. This guidance signifies a shift towards operational commanders taking a more active role in contracting. A philosophical shift is needed for operational commanders to be more involved in contracting decisions and integrate contracting with logistics, operations, intelligence, and strategy. Analysts stress the importance of senior leadership maintaining focus on operational contract support to institutionalize cultural change beyond current conflicts. Increased education for non-acquisition personnel is seen as crucial for improving operational contract support and reinforcing cultural change. Increased education for non-acquisition personnel is crucial for institutionalizing how the military approaches the use of contractors in overseas operations. Observers argue that integrating contractor support into Professional Military Education is essential to prepare the military to manage contractors effectively. Training for commanders, senior military personnel, and contracting officers' representatives is essential to effectively utilize contractors in deployed locations. Despite progress in developing courses on operational contract support, some analysts believe these courses need further expansion and integration into Professional Military Education. A 2012 GAO report highlighted the lack of training for commanders in Afghanistan on contract management responsibilities. The military's principle of 'train as you fight' emphasizes the importance of preparing for future operations involving contractors. Some analysts suggest incorporating contractors into military exercises to better prepare for future operations. Despite some progress, reports indicate that the Department of Defense has not fully included contractor roles in battlefield exercises. Including contractors in field exercises could increase warfighter awareness and improve military-contractor coordination in actual operations. Changing the culture to embrace the importance of contract support is seen as an important step. Analysts argue that changing the culture to prioritize contract support is crucial for improving operational contract support. However, they emphasize the need for an effective infrastructure to facilitate good contracting decisions. Key weaknesses in contractor support include poor planning, lack of reliable data, and insufficient workforce capabilities. Building infrastructure to address these weaknesses is essential for enhancing contracting processes. Many analysts argue that systemic changes are needed in DOD's approach to operational contract support to meet military needs. Failure to involve contractors in planning and strategy can lead to risks and challenges, such as inadequate oversight and coordination. Anticipating the reliance on private security contractors in conflict zones like Afghanistan and Iraq is crucial to avoid issues like insufficient housing for deployed contractors. The DOD had to quickly find alternative housing for contractors, leading to increased costs. GAO found that contract support integration into operational plans of combatant commands does not always happen. The Commission on Wartime Contracting noted DOD's inadequate planning for using contractors for contingency support. Analysts suggest a lack of planning results in a reactive rather than strategic approach to managing service contracts. DOD officials believe more planners are needed to include contracted support in future plans. Data reliability is crucial for informed policy decisions. The DOD faces challenges with unreliable data in tracking and assessing contracting effectiveness, leading to potential policy mistakes and resource wastage. Concerns exist over the accuracy and customization of current databases for tracking contract data in Afghanistan. This lack of reliable information could hinder strategic decision-making. The central database lacks reliable data for strategic decision-making in tracking reconstruction spending. Efforts are being made to improve data reliability, including establishing an Acquisition Accountability Office in Afghanistan. Data analysis from recent operations could benefit development efforts beyond Afghanistan. GAO concluded that data analysis from recent operations in Afghanistan could help develop a strategic plan for future contractor involvement. This data can assist in determining future contractor support requirements and provide timely access to critical information for commanders and policy makers. Section 844 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 requires guidance on data collection for contract support in future operations. Insufficient resources and personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan led to inadequate contractor oversight. The lack of resources and personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to inadequate contractor oversight, resulting in poor contract performance, waste, fraud, and abuse. The Army Audit Agency reported that contracting offices did not have enough personnel to ensure quality goods and services at the best value. DOD has recognized the need for sufficient resources to provide effective oversight. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized the importance of an appropriately skilled acquisition workforce and highlighted the need for enhanced training and retention programs. The reliance on contractors in post-Cold War operations has raised concerns about oversight and the allocation of responsibilities between contractors and government personnel. Despite criticisms of over-reliance on contractors, it is acknowledged that the Department of Defense lacked the manpower to fulfill its mission without their support. The Department of Defense acknowledges the necessity of using contractors due to manpower limitations. Congress may need to consider the impact of budget cuts and force restructuring on contractor reliance. Planning for effective contractor management is crucial, with challenges including defining contractor roles, anticipating future military operations, and adapting to budget changes. Key questions for Congress include the extent of DOD's planning for contractor use and integration into future force structures. Observers believe education and training are critical in preparing for future operations. Richard Ginman, Director of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, emphasized the importance of incorporating Operational Contract Support content into military education. Questions for Congress include the adaptation of military educational institutions to address operational contract support and the inclusion of contractor scenarios in exercises. DOD is being questioned on whether they are adequately preparing the operational force for the use of contractors in future operations. Analysts argue that more resources need to be dedicated to planning, managing, and overseeing the use of contractors. Congress is being asked if DOD has enough planners, acquisition workforce, and infrastructure to track contractor data and measure performance effectively. In light of potential budget constraints, will DOD sufficiently fund efforts needed to institutionalize operational contract support and prepare for the use of contractors in future military operations? Congress has held oversight hearings and enacted legislation to improve operational contract support. This includes developing joint policies for requirements definition and contingency programs. Section 854 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 directed DOD to develop joint policies for requirements definition, contingency program management, and contingency contracting during combat and post-conflict operations. Additionally, Section 841 established the Commission on Wartime Contracting to investigate federal agency contracting for reconstruction and logistical support in Iraq and Afghanistan. Section 1129 established the Special Inspector for Afghanistan Reconstruction to provide independent audits and investigations related to programs supported with U.S. reconstruction funds. Section 842 directed inspectors general to conduct audits on federal contracts for support in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify waste, fraud, and abuse. Section 861 required DOD, State Department, and USAID to collaborate on contract matters in Iraq and Afghanistan, using DOD's SPOT database. Section 849 mandated communication with the Secretaries of State and Defense on reconstruction issues and progress on corrective actions. Section 849 mandated contingency contracting training for non-acquisition DOD personnel, while Section 851 required DOD to develop a strategic human capital plan for the acquisition workforce. Section 852 established the Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund for recruitment, training, and retention of acquisition personnel. Section 862 directed DOD to regulate personnel performing private security functions under a covered contract in combat operations. National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 (P.L. 110\u2013417) Section 503 authorized five billets for Joint General Officer/Flag Officers in acquisition positions. Section 834 required DOD to establish policy for military personnel development in the acquisition field. Section 870 established a government-wide. The National Defense Authorization Acts for FY2009, FY2011, and FY2012 introduced various provisions related to the acquisition workforce and private security contractors. These included mandates for training, development, oversight, and certification of personnel in the acquisition field, as well as regulations for contractors performing private security functions in combat and other significant military operations. Section 820 of the National Defense Authorization Acts required DOD to address contractor support in planning documents. Sections 841 and 842 directed DOD to amend regulations for contracting in the Central Command theater of operations. Section 843 authorized a single contracting authority with 'reachback' capabilities. Section 844 mandated an annual review of omnibus contracts. Section 844 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 required an annual review of omnibus contracts providing support to contingency operations by a DOD competition advocate. Section 846 mandated combatant commanders to develop a contractor reliance risk assessment and risk mitigation strategy for operational or contingency plans. Section 861 stipulated that DOD, Department of State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development must have an independent suspension and debarment official. Section 1273 assigned sustainability requirements for capital projects related to overseas contingency operations. Section 843 directed DOD to issue guidance on responsibility and authority for operational contract support policy. Section 848 outlined responsibilities for certain entities. Section 848 outlines the responsibilities of inspectors general for overseas contingency operations, while Section 849 updates the oversight responsibilities of Chief Acquisition Personnel in DOD, Department of State, and U.S. Agency for International Development for contracts. Section 952 enhances the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's responsibilities regarding operational contract support in national military strategy. Additionally, Section 803 extends expedited hiring authority for defense acquisition workforce shortages, and Section 845 mandates the inclusion of operational contract support in certain DOD planning requirements. Section 847 extended and modified reports on contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2015, while Section 851 required agencies to establish a database on price trends of items and services under Federal contracts. Section 862 stipulated uniform contract writing system requirements."
