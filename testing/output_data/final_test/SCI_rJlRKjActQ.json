    "content": "Deep networks often struggle with generalization and domain shift, leading to incorrect and confident answers on unseen data. A proposed regularizer trains with interpolated hidden states to reduce confidence on points outside the training distribution, avoiding underfitting. Manifold Mixup addresses underfitting by ensuring hidden states dimensionality exceeds class number, improving earlier layer features' discriminative power. It outperforms baselines in supervised learning, robustness to adversarial attacks, semi-supervised learning, and Negative Log-Likelihood. Machine learning systems face challenges in noisy, shifting, and adversarial environments. Deep neural networks may give incorrect answers with high confidence when evaluated on data outside the training distribution, leading to failure cases like adversarial examples presenting security risks. Machine learning systems face security risks due to differences in training and testing distributions, leading to reduced performance. The Manifold Mixup approach leverages the manifold hypothesis to transform data non-linearly, allowing for valid data points through linear interpolations in hidden space. On the 2D spirals dataset, a baseline model with a fully connected neural network was trained with Input Mixup and Manifold Mixup applied only to the 2D bottleneck layer. Input Mixup may suffer from underfitting, while Manifold Mixup fits the training data better by concentrating labeled points from each class in a tight region in the hidden space. This approach assigns lower confidence classifications to broader regions. Manifold Mixup changes representations by training on convex combinations of hidden states, not achieved by other regularizers. Linear interpolation between hidden states is effective in combining factors, exploring more space with lower dimensions. Manifold Mixup changes representations by training on convex combinations of hidden states, leading to concentrated hidden states for real examples in local regions. This approach contrasts with deep networks that have widely distributed states in hidden space. The method introduces a novel regularizer that outperforms competitive alternatives and achieves a 50% reduction in test Negative Log-Likelihood on CIFAR-10. It also provides significant robustness to single-step adversarial attacks and a new method for semi-supervised learning using a Manifold Mixup based consistency loss. The Manifold Mixup algorithm improves error reduction on CIFAR-10 compared to Virtual Adversarial Training by 21.86%. It achieves consistent interpolations without requiring strong assumptions about data distribution, making it suitable for various applications. The algorithm involves selecting a random hidden layer for mixup, changing the target vector according to the mixup interpolation. The Manifold Mixup algorithm involves selecting a random hidden layer for mixup and changing the target vector according to the mixup interpolation using a beta distribution. Gradients are backpropagated through the entire computational graph, including layers before the mixup process is applied. Manifold Mixup involves selecting a random hidden layer for mixup and changing the target vector using a beta distribution. The algorithm aims to optimize the expectation by sampling different layers for mixup in each update. However, sampling a single lambda and a randomly chosen layer per minibatch was found to be more effective in practice. Compared to Input Mixup, Manifold Mixup significantly reduces loss along hidden interpolations. Manifold Mixup aims to optimize the expectation by sampling different layers for mixup in each update. It significantly reduces loss along hidden interpolations compared to Input Mixup. By performing mixup in a sufficiently deep hidden layer, a mixup loss of zero can be achieved if the dimensionality of that hidden layer is greater than the number of classes. The text discusses the minimization problem in neural networks, focusing on the solution when using the empirical distribution over a finite dataset. It highlights the minimizers in the problem and shows that the minimizer is a linear function from one space to another. The text discusses the minimization problem in neural networks, focusing on the solution when using the empirical distribution over a finite dataset. It highlights the minimizers in the problem and shows that the minimizer is a linear function from one space to another. The equality A^T h \u03b6i + b = y \u03b6i for i = 1, . . . , n is a key result in the proof. The text discusses the minimization problem in neural networks, focusing on the solution when using the empirical distribution over a finite dataset. It highlights the minimizers in the problem and shows that the minimizer is a linear function from one space to another. The result shows that data points in the representation space have degrees of freedom to move independently as long as dim (H) > d \u2212 1. This implies that if the Manifold Mixup loss is minimized, then the representation for each class will lie on a specific space. The Manifold Mixup loss minimization leads to representations for each class lying on a subspace of dimension dim (H)\u2212d+1. This flattening of the class-conditional manifold encourages effective representation learning and reduces the measure of the true manifold in hidden space, resulting in non-zero entropy classification scores. Manifold Mixup encourages the network to learn discriminative features and assign low-confidence classification decisions. It builds on research about linearly interpolating between examples and labels, allowing lower layers to learn concentrated features for easier linear changes in upper layers. Manifold Mixup encourages linear changes between hidden states for better results. It complements regularization methods like dropout and batch normalization. Zhao & Cho (2018) explored improving adversarial robustness through classification using nearest points. Manifold Mixup improves adversarial robustness by classifying points using nearest neighbors in a fixed feature space. It involves applying mixup between nearest neighbor examples. Significant improvement is seen in Negative log-likelihood (NLL) compared to Zhao & Cho (2018). Manifold Mixup backpropagates gradients through earlier network layers, unlike Zhao & Cho (2018). Refer to Appendix C for implementation details and results on SVHN. AdaMix and AgrLearn are methods that aim to improve the learning process in deep neural networks. AdaMix focuses on better mixing distributions to avoid overlap, achieving low error rates on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. On the other hand, AgrLearn adds an information bottleneck layer to achieve substantial improvements in conjunction with Input Mixup. These methods offer complementary approaches to enhancing network performance. In conjunction with Input Mixup, Manifold Mixup based regularization using the PreActResNet architecture BID11 achieved a 2.45% test error on CIFAR-10. The method showed significant improvements when evaluated on test sets with artificial deformations, suggesting potential for future work in this area. Manifold Mixup demonstrated significant improvements on variations in the input space not seen during training. The number of epochs needed for good results was not significantly affected. An experiment blocking gradients after mixup showed improved test errors compared to the baseline, but not as good as Manifold Mixup or Input Mixup. The method improves results by changing layers before and after mixup is applied. Manifold Mixup improves results by changing layers before and after the mixup operation. It outperforms other strong regularizers with test error averages for CIFAR-10. The method also shows strong regularizing effects and achieves low test errors when evaluating representations learned. Manifold Mixup improves representation learning in PreResNet18 for CIFAR-10, with test errors of 5.16%. It is effective across a range of \u03b1 values and should not be performed in layers close to the output layer. Semi-supervised learning combines labeled and unlabeled data for better model performance in challenging label acquisition scenarios. The Manifold Mixup approach for semi-supervised learning involves minimizing loss on labeled and unlabeled samples by controlling the tradeoff with a consistency coefficient. Targets for unlabeled samples are soft target outputs from the classifier. Oliver et al. conducted a systematic study of semi-supervised algorithms using a fixed wide resnet. Manifold Mixup was evaluated using a fixed wide resnet architecture \"WRN-28-2\" and showed improvements over Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and Mean-Teachers for CIFAR-10. It was also competitive with VAT and Mean-Teachers for SVHN. Manifold Mixup does not require additional computation compared to VAT and Mean-Teachers. Additionally, its regularization ability was explored in a low-data regime, achieving comparable results to fully-supervised models. Manifold Mixup, evaluated with a fixed wide resnet architecture, showed improvements over Virtual Adversarial Training and Mean-Teachers for CIFAR-10 and SVHN. It does not require additional computation compared to other methods and has regularization ability even in low-data regimes. The model achieves the same level of test accuracy as a fully-supervised regularized baseline, outperforming the baseline not regularized with state-of-the-art regularizers. Adversarial examples pose a challenge for models, but Manifold Mixup expands the set of points seen during training, potentially improving robustness. Manifold Mixup expands the training set points, potentially overlapping with adversarial examples. This could make attacks more computationally expensive. The Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) was tested against Manifold Mixup, showing improved robustness. Gradient masking is a challenge in evaluating adversarial examples, but Manifold Mixup passed a sanity check for gradient quality. Manifold Mixup improved robustness against the FGSM attack but did not significantly enhance defense against the stronger PGD attack. A study was conducted to explore feature combinations during mixup in hidden layers. A small decoder convnet was trained to predict images from the Manifold Mixup classifier's hidden representation, showing results similar to auto-encoders. The study explored feature combinations during mixup in hidden layers, showing that interpolated points correspond to images with a blend of features from two images. This justifies the training objective for mixed-up examples in hidden layers and addresses challenges in deep learning. Manifold Mixup is a new algorithm that aims to improve the representations learned by deep networks by encouraging low confidence classifications in most of the hidden space while concentrating the hidden states for real examples onto a lower dimensional subspace. Manifold Mixup improves test accuracy and likelihood on classification tasks, enhances robustness to adversarial examples, and boosts semi-supervised learning without added computational cost. Experiments with a synthetic dataset show the impact of input mixup and the effectiveness of Manifold Mixup in generating semantically meaningful augmented data points. The study demonstrates the importance of generating relevant augmented data points close to the data manifold. Three tasks were considered, each involving training and testing with different angle ranges for labels. Task A and B focused on angle ranges for labels 0 and 1, while Task C distinguished between the digits \"1\" and \"7\". In Task C, uniformly sampled data with angles from -30\u2022 to 30\u2022 were used. Input Mixup showed some improvements in likelihood but limited improvements in accuracy. Mixing in the ground truth attribute space resulted in larger improvements. An experiment on a network trained on the 2D spiral dataset with a 2D bottleneck hidden state showed the effect of concentrating hidden states for each class. The study compared the effects of Manifold Mixup and Input Mixup on neural networks. Analytical experiments were conducted on a fully connected network trained on MNIST data. The results showed significant improvements from using Manifold Mixup, with a focus on changing the behavior of layers before and after the mixup operation. Manifold Mixup was found to tighten representations, making real data occupy specific points with well-separated class margins. In supervised regularization with PreActResNets, mixing was randomly selected from eligible layers like the input layer and outputs from specific resblocks. Eligible layers for mixing in PreActResNet18 included the first and second resblocks with four layers each. In PreActResNet models, the number of layers in the first and second resblocks varies. Manifold Mixup involves mixing at specific eligible layers like the input layer and outputs from resblocks. Training involved adjusting learning rates and the results for the SVHN dataset with PreActResNet18 are presented in Table 6. In PreActResNet models, Manifold Mixup involves mixing at specific eligible layers like the input layer and outputs from resblocks. Performing Manifold Mixup in higher layers allows the train loss to go down faster compared to Input Mixup. Semi-supervised Manifold Mixup and Semi-supervised Input Mixup procedures are presented in Algorithms 1 and 3 respectively. Manifold Mixup involves mixing at specific eligible layers like the input layer and outputs from resblocks. The consistency coefficient \u03c0 is used to ramp up the weight of unlabeled loss during training. Psuedolabels are computed for unlabelled samples, and the models are trained on CIFAR-100 with novel deformations. Manifold Mixup (ours) enhances model robustness to random deformations like shearing, rescaling, and rotation. Rotation and shearing are performed with uniformly sampled angles, while zooming-in and zooming-out involve adjusting image size. Different mixup techniques are compared using CIFAR-10 train set. Manifold Mixup (ours) enhances model robustness to random deformations like shearing, rescaling, and rotation. The training loss is consistent over the course of training, with the lowest achieved by mixing in the deepest layer. WideResNet28-2 architecture is used for the experiments. We use the WideResNet28-2 architecture from (Oliver et al., 2018) and follow their experimental setup for fair comparison in Semi-supervised learning. Experiments were run for 1000 epochs on Cifar10 and 200 epochs on SVHN. Initial learning rate was 0.1 and annealed by a factor of 0.1 at specific epochs. Momentum parameter was set to 0.9 with L2 regularization coefficient 0.0005 and L1 regularization coefficient 0.001. Data pre-processing and augmentation were the same as in (Oliver et al., 2018). Standard train/validation split was used for CIFAR-10. For semi-supervised learning, 4000 out of 45,000 train images are used for SVHN, while 1000 out of 65,932 images are used. The best values for supervised and unsupervised loss were found to be 0.1 and 2.0 respectively. The consistency coefficient was ramped up to a maximum value of 0.4. For CIFAR-10, a max consistency coefficient of 1.0 was found to be the best, while for SVHN, a max consistency coefficient of 2.0 was found to be optimal. In experiments on WideResNet28-2, eligible layers for mixing were selected randomly. Unbounded PGD check showed mixup model's accuracy reduced to 1% and Manifold Mixup model's accuracy to 0%. Defense did not improve results due to gradient masking. FGSM is a simple one-step attack method. Mixup is a regularization technique for GAN training that adds extra data augmentation to the discriminator. It proposes an objective function where real and fake samples are mixed with a sampled lambda value. The label is determined based on the combination of real and fake samples. Mixing real samples with real samples did not yield meaningful results in practice. Mixup is a regularization technique for GAN training that adds extra data augmentation to the discriminator. The objective function involves mixing real and fake samples with a sampled lambda value, avoiding mixes between two real examples. The GAN objective is optimized by incorporating manifold mixup in the hidden space of the discriminator. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the quality of generated images on CIFAR10 dataset. The experiments evaluated the quality of generated images on CIFAR10 using JSGAN with spectral normalization as a baseline. The best-performing mixup experiments had an average Inception / FID of 8.04 \u00b1 0.08 / 21.2 \u00b1 0.47, showing mixup as a useful regularization on the discriminator, further improved by Manifold Mixup. The network learns hidden states to ensure consistent interpolations between points. The network learns hidden states to ensure consistent interpolations between points, where the interpolated point is based on a sampled \u03bb and soft-targets are interpolated accordingly. Points with the same label should have that label with 100% confidence, while points with different labels are assigned a soft-label based on the distance between them. The learned model assigns a single distribution over label values to each point, leading to inconsistent soft-labels at interpolated points. To avoid this, classes should have concentrated states and vary along distinct dimensions in the hidden space. The theory suggests that representations for each class should lie on a subspace of specific dimension. When performing mixup in a 2D hidden space for a binary classification task, inconsistent soft-labels can lead to underfitting and high loss. Manifold mixup helps avoid this by ensuring all interpolations give consistent labels. Flattening refers to reducing variability in class-specific representations. Training an MNIST classifier with a hidden state bottleneck of 12 units showed the importance of concentrated states for each class in the hidden space. Our architecture included three hidden layers with 1024 units and LeakyReLU activation, followed by a bottleneck representation layer with either 12 or 30 hidden units. Manifold Mixup was applied only in the bottleneck layer, resulting in most singular values becoming much smaller. Manifold Mixup significantly reduces the size of smaller singular values in class-specific representations, leading to a flattening effect. This occurs empirically without requiring a small number of hidden dimensions. The overall singular values across all representations remain unchanged, indicating a clear flattening trend. Manifold Mixup causes a flattening effect by reducing the size of smaller singular values in class-specific representations. This effect is observed without the need for a small number of hidden dimensions, and the overall singular values across all representations remain unchanged, indicating a clear trend towards flattening. In comparison, Input Mixup shows inconsistent effects on the singular values. Manifold Mixup outperformed Input Mixup across different alpha values when training a PreActResNet18 network on CIFAR-10. Input Mixup's results deteriorate with large alphas, unlike Manifold Mixup. The study evaluated mixing in different layers for Manifold Mixup, with a fixed alpha of 2.0. The study evaluated mixing in different layers for Manifold Mixup, finding that mixing in more layers generally improves performance, except for the later layers which can hurt test accuracy to some extent. This is consistent with the theory that the part of the network after mixing is a universal approximator, suggesting a case for not mixing in the very last layers."
