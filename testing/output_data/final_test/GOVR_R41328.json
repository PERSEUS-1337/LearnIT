    "content": "A federal trust fund is a long-term commitment to use specific funds for a certain purpose, often created to politically commit future Congresses to fund a specific program. The largest source of funds for trust funds usually comes from charges to users or future users, such as payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare trust funds. In FY2012, payroll tax receipts accounted for 67% of total cash income for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund, 76% for the Disability Insurance trust fund, and 81% for the Hospital Insurance trust fund. The Airport and Airway trust fund mainly receives funds from taxes on passengers and other users. The trust funds receive funds mainly from taxes on passengers and other users, with only about 26% of receipts for the Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund coming from premiums on current users. Congress' promise to fund a specific program in the future is a political commitment, not legally binding, but provides assurance to beneficiaries. Trust fund programs link benefits and costs closely, with their security dependent on the power of beneficiaries. President Franklin D. Roosevelt emphasized the importance of workers paying payroll taxes to create a strong constituency for Social Security and unemployment insurance. Earmarked revenues for trust fund programs help maintain annual surpluses, as taxpayers are more willing to pay taxes when they know how the funds are used. This system contrasts with general revenues, which often run deficits due to less transparency in spending. Alice Rivlin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, highlighted taxpayer concerns about wasteful or fraudulent spending of general revenues. Bills are regularly introduced in Congress to create new trust funds, which can be established by designating them in legislation. The distinction between trust funds and federal funds may not significantly impact how the funds are used or the program's operation. Prior to FY1969, the federal budget consisted of three different budget concepts: the administrative budget, the cash budget, and the national income accounts budget. The administrative budget, which did not measure all federal government activities, omitted receipts and expenditures of federal trust funds. Congress frequently changes programs created with trust funds to better align receipts with outlays, and in some cases, terminate programs like the General Revenue Sharing trust fund. In 1968, the Johnson Administration introduced the unified budget concept to encompass all federal government receipts and expenditures. This concept has been continued by subsequent administrations, focusing on the surplus or deficit of all federal and trust funds combined. Congress appropriates money in the annual appropriations process, granting agencies budget authority to incur obligations. Trust fund programs typically have permanent budget authority, with all funds available for obligation. Some trust funds are authorized to borrow, but most cannot exceed the funds available. The trust funds surplus in FY2012 was $89.9 billion, mostly invested in government obligations. Trust funds must invest in government obligations except the Railroad Retirement fund, which can invest in equities. Trust funds held $4,388.5 billion in government securities at the end of FY2012. The unified federal budget deficit for FY2012 was $1,087.0 billion due to the trust funds surplus. The trust fund receipts in FY2012 amounted to $715.4 billion, sourced from various channels including beneficiaries, general revenues, and inter-trust fund payments. These balances do not represent real resources available for spending but are future obligations of the federal government, requiring revenue diversion or borrowing to fulfill. The trust fund balances do not represent real resources available for spending, as they are future obligations of the federal government. Excluding interest payments, the trust funds would show a deficit instead of a surplus. Trust fund surpluses have been in place since FY1962, reaching a high of 2.4% of GDP in FY2000. The increase in surplus after 1982 is attributed to the 1983 Social Security amendments. The trust fund surplus increased after 1982 due to Social Security amendments, moving towards partial prefunding. The surplus decreased from FY2009 to FY2013 because of increased unemployment benefits and reduced payroll tax revenue during the recession. The surplus is projected to rebound but will decline again due to demands on trust fund outgo, mainly from the retirement of Baby Boomers. Interest payments to the trust funds have also increased over the years. The calculation of the trust funds surplus produces a modified trust fund surplus, comparing trust fund outgo with revenues. The modified trust fund surplus reflects the real resources available for spending and has been negative in certain years. The Office of Management and Budget estimated a surplus in FY2013, with projected deficits in FY2014 and FY2015 before a return to surplus. The Office of Management and Budget estimated a surplus of $67.6 billion in FY2013, but non-interest revenue to the trust funds would be $90.8 billion less than expenditures, resulting in a negative modified trust fund surplus. OMB projects an aggregate surplus of $690.0 billion over the FY2014-FY2018 period, with non-interest revenues projected to be $55.7 billion less than expenditures. The 13 largest trust funds had a combined positive balance of $4,368.5 billion at the end of FY2012, with nine trust funds having income exceeding outgo and four trust funds having a deficit. The Disability trust fund and the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund are projected to remain in deficit unless action is taken to increase revenue or decrease expenditures. In FY2012, 39 trust funds had a deficit totaling $58 billion, with a combined deficit of about $50 billion if interest payments were excluded. The combined deficit of 39 trust funds in FY2012 totaled $58 billion, with $80 billion if interest payments are excluded. The deficits are mainly from the Medicare Hospital Insurance and Social Security Disability Insurance trust funds. Efforts to reform the federal budget have focused on addressing entitlements and trust funds to ensure fiscal sustainability. Congress may consider significant changes to these programs as part of a comprehensive reform package. Congress has historically taken actions to address trust funds facing insolvency by increasing revenues, reducing outgo, or injecting general revenues. Policymakers can prevent trust fund insolvency by raising taxes, reducing spending elsewhere, increasing the federal deficit, or cutting payments to beneficiaries. Adjusting trust fund revenue and outlay structures requires difficult choices that impact current and future revenues and spending. In FY2012, total trust fund balances increased by $91 billion to $4,388.5 billion, with most trust funds showing a positive balance. Total trust fund balances increased by $91 billion to $4,388.5 billion at the end of FY2012. Fifteen trust funds had a zero balance, with eight having no income or outgo, three with equal income and outgo, and four with surpluses or deficits resulting in zero balances. Four trust funds had negative balances totaling $20.2 billion. The Administration estimates the status of larger trust funds for the upcoming fiscal year and the following five years in its annual budget submission. According to OMB projections, trust fund balances are expected to remain positive by the end of FY2018, with some funds decreasing. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds are projected to be exhausted within the next 30 years, with specific funds running out by 2035, 2026, and 2016. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds are projected to be exhausted within the next 30 years. Once the trust funds are depleted, Social Security will only have enough tax revenue to cover about 75% of scheduled benefits, leading to a 25% reduction in monthly benefits for beneficiaries. Trust fund programs have both short-term and long-term effects on the economy, as they provide monetary benefits that impact consumer spending. Government spending on unemployment compensation acts as a short-term fiscal stimulus during recessions. Unemployment compensation is an automatic stabilizer that impacts national saving, which can increase the nation's productive capacity and future income. National saving is the sum of private and public saving, with trust funds like Social Security potentially affecting both private and public sectors. Government spending on unemployment compensation acts as a short-term fiscal stimulus during recessions, impacting national saving. Trust fund programs like Social Security can affect both private and public saving. Research by Martin Feldstein initially suggested Social Security lowered personal saving, but subsequent studies questioned these findings. Overall, the impact of Social Security on personal saving remains debated in the literature. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that private wealth is reduced by up to 50 cents for each dollar of Social Security wealth, but effects could vary. Studies suggest trust fund surpluses, including Social Security, may increase federal deficits. Kent Smetters and Sita Nataraj estimated that Social Security surplus increases lead to higher federal deficits. The shift to the unified budget concept after FY1969 is blamed for this. Subsequent research has questioned these findings. After FY1969, research questioned findings on trust fund surpluses increasing federal deficits. Peter Orszag and Thomas Hungerford found mixed evidence, suggesting trust fund surpluses reduce government deficits and increase public saving. This is crucial when trust funds need to redeem Treasury obligations to cover outgo. The government must find resources to cover claims on the government when obligations are redeemed, by raising revenue, decreasing spending, or issuing more debt."
