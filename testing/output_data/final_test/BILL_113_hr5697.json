    "content": "The Act titled \"Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2014\" replaces the Windfall Elimination Provision with a formula that equalizes benefits for individuals with non-covered employment. The Social Security Act is amended to compute or recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals with noncovered service earnings after 1977. The primary insurance amount is calculated by multiplying the individual's primary insurance amount by a fraction of their average indexed monthly earnings. Noncovered earnings are considered in determining the individual's average indexed monthly earnings for Social Security benefits. The calculation of the primary insurance amount includes noncovered earnings from noncovered service performed after 1977, which are treated as wages for Social Security benefits. Recorded noncovered earnings are defined as earnings from noncovered service with satisfactory evidence. The Commissioner of Social Security determines adjusted total covered earnings by summing wages and self-employment income. Regulations are provided for determining satisfactory evidence for noncovered service earnings. The Commissioner of Social Security uses methods to treat noncovered service earnings as recorded noncovered earnings, based on information provided by employers and individuals. Documentary evidence of noncovered service earnings may also be considered, as long as it does not duplicate existing earnings information. The Commissioner of Social Security uses employer-provided information to calculate earnings for individuals, ensuring it does not reduce their primary insurance amount. Upon an individual's death, their primary insurance amount is recalculated. A modification to the Windfall Elimination Provision allows for adjustments in monthly insurance benefits for certain individuals after December 2016. The primary insurance amount of an individual calculated under subparagraph (B) is adjusted by an applicable percentage determined by the Commissioner, not exceeding 50 percent. This adjustment is based on the savings generated from the Equal Treatment provision. The Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2014 resulted in savings, with the Commissioner determining the applicable percentage by November 1, 2016. Individuals meeting specific criteria may have their primary insurance amount adjusted based on actuarial estimates. The Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2014 led to savings, with the Commissioner determining the applicable percentage by November 1, 2016. Individuals meeting certain criteria may have their primary insurance amount recalculated unless evidence is provided that no periodic payment from noncovered service has been received. The Commissioner will recover any excess amount from the individual and others receiving benefits based on their wages and self-employment income. The Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2014 resulted in savings, with the Commissioner recalculating the primary insurance amount for individuals meeting specific criteria. Any excess benefits paid before 2017 will be recovered from the individual and others receiving benefits based on their wages and self-employment income. Amendments were made to Section 215(a)(7)(A) of the Act to reflect these changes."
