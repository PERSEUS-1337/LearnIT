    "content": "H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, has been a focal point in Congress's climate change debate. The bill, introduced by Representatives Waxman and Markey, passed the House of Representatives in June 2009. Various analyses, including one by the Environmental Protection Agency, have been conducted on the impact of the cap-and-trade provisions in the bill. The report focuses on models ADAGE, IGEM, and IPM to analyze the impacts of H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. Another analysis was conducted by the Energy Information Administration on the same bill. The impacts of H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, were analyzed using EIA's NEMS model and CRA's MRN-NEEM macroeconomic model. The analysis included sensitivity analyses on offset supply and allowance prices. The impacts of H.R. 2454 were analyzed using various macroeconomic models. CRA conducted three scenarios: reference, high, and low. The Heritage Foundation and Congressional Budget Office also conducted analyses based on different models. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) conducted analyses on H.R. 2454, addressing budgetary and household impacts. A sixth analysis by the American Council for Capital Formation/National Association of Manufacturers used the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) to assess the bill's impacts on clean energy and security. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted a seventh analysis on the Waxman-Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, using the EPPA CGE model to assess the offset provisions. The analysis includes a sensitivity case with high-cost assumptions and restrictions on technology availability. The MIT/EPPA analysis of H.R. 2454 focuses on electricity price impacts and compares different stages of the bill's development, including versions analyzed by various organizations like the EPA, EIA, ACCF/NAM, and Heritage Foundation. The Heritage Foundation analyzed H.R. 2454, a comprehensive energy and environmental bill, with a focus on the cap-and-trade program and renewable energy standards. The analysis considered changes made during the legislative process that impact compliance costs and allowance distribution. The EPA, EIA, Heritage Foundation, ACCF-NAM, and MIT analyses of H.R. 2454 focus on various aspects such as renewable energy standards, cap-and-trade program, carbon capture, and energy efficiency provisions. The studies differ in scope, with some focusing solely on carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector. The MIT analysis of H.R. 2454 includes renewable energy and energy efficiency standards along with cap-and-trade provisions. The studies examined have varying levels of documentation, making comparative analysis challenging. To increase comparability, CRS converted all data to 2005 dollars and interpolated missing data. Assumptions from reference cases were maintained unless explicitly stated otherwise. The CRS attempted to present projections in a comparable fashion. Different studies had varying views on the impact of Renewable Energy Standards (RES). While some found no significant cost increases, others, like MIT, noted that RES could raise household costs, especially in the early years. The House passed Title III of H.R. 2454 to amend the Clean Air Act for a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program phases in covered entities over four years, aiming for a 17% reduction by 2020 and 83% by 2050. The World Resources Institute estimates potential net reductions in GHG emissions from the economy. The market-based approach of H.R. 2454 establishes an emissions cap on covered sectors, allowing trading of emissions permits. The bill mandates compliance on various entities, limiting greenhouse gas emissions from those producing or importing over 25,000 metric tons annually. Potential net reductions in GHG emissions could reach 33% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 81% by 2050. H.R. 2454 allocates allowances to energy consumers and low-income households to mitigate the regressive nature of greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Initially, allowances are provided at no cost to entities like LDCs to offset energy cost increases, while others are auctioned by the EPA with proceeds going to eligible recipients. From 2026 to 2035, energy cost relief and free allocations are phased out in favor of government auctioning, with proceeds mostly returned to households on a per-capita basis. H.R. 2454 allocates emission allowances to various industries and sectors to facilitate the transition to a less carbon-intensive future. Free allowances are provided to energy-intensive industries, coal-fired electric generators, and petroleum refiners, with bonus allotments for carbon capture and storage technology. These free allocations are phased out by the early to mid-2030s, except for carbon capture and storage. Additionally, allowances are allocated to address greenhouse gas emissions, prevent tropical deforestation, and fund climate adaptation activities. Allowance prices are managed through mechanisms to address potential price fluctuations. H.R. 2454 addresses cost control through mechanisms like unlimited banking, limited borrowing, strategic reserve auctions, periodic auctions, and limits on offsets. It includes design elements to reduce allowance price volatility, such as borrowing allowances from the following year and holding strategic reserve auctions. The EPA is directed to hold strategic reserve auctions to increase the availability of allowances early in the program while maintaining the overall emissions cap. These auctions have reserve prices set to create an allowance price floor and reduce volatility. The cap-and-trade program includes mechanisms for cost control through domestic and international offsets, limiting emissions to two billion tons annually. Analyses show that these offsets can reduce allowance prices by half. Concerns include market abuse and manipulation in a potentially large U.S. carbon market involving various financial instruments. The bill includes provisions for oversight of the carbon allowance market, with detailed regulations for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and enhanced oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for allowance derivatives. It also mandates clearing over-the-counter transactions through a clearing house and establishes position limits on energy contracts. Additionally, the bill contains measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and carbon leakage. H.R. 2454 includes provisions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, prevent tropical deforestation, set performance standards for high-emitting entities, and implement programs to reduce carbon leakage. The bill aims to achieve significant emission reductions through international projects and targets, with a goal of reducing emissions by 720 million metric tons in 2020 and 6 billion metric tons by 2025. The WRI study suggests that not all greenhouse gas emitting sources are covered by the Title III cap-and-trade programs. Uncapped sources could be subject to greenhouse gas performance standards, potentially reducing emissions by 115 million metric tons annually. The cap-and-trade program requires a discount on international offsets starting in 2018, which could result in up to 375 million metric tons of reductions annually. H.R. 2454 addresses carbon leakage to ensure net greenhouse gas reductions are achieved. The potential impact of carbon leakage on net greenhouse gas reductions under the bill includes the allocation of allowances to energy-intensive industries and an international reserve allowance scheme for importers of energy-intensive products. The effectiveness of the scheme is uncertain due to administrative challenges. The potential impact of carbon leakage on net greenhouse gas reductions under the bill includes an international reserve allowance scheme for importers of energy-intensive products. The daunting administrative, informational, and analytical resources necessary to implement such a program would create significant issues in any attempt to implement it. The World Trade Organization (WTO) implications of the provision have not been fully exposed and accommodated. There are six key changes between the cap-and-trade provisions of the bill circulated by its sponsors and the introduced version of H.R. 2454. The distribution of allowances in the bill was modified to include allocations for various stakeholders, with restrictions on the amount of allowances for electric LDCs. The International Reserve Allowance scheme was made mandatory in the House-passed version, expanding the definition of covered goods to include energy-intensive items. Significant changes were made to the offset provisions in the bill, including establishing separate programs for offsets from domestic agriculture and forestry, and the creation of \"term offset credits\" to address concerns over project permanence. During the Clean Air Act debate in 1990, analyzing the cost of the bill beyond the first 10 years was challenging, with state-by-state breakdowns of 2000 data considered not useful beyond illustrative purposes. Cost projections beyond the year 2000 are speculative and based more on philosophy than analysis. The history of SO2 cap-and-trade program costs has shown that 2010 cost estimates made in 1990 were substantially higher than the actual costs. The EPA-ICF low estimate for the SO2 cap-and-trade program costs in 2010 was 50% higher than the actual costs. The 2000 estimate was also off by almost the same 50%. The overestimates were due to the failure of models to fully incorporate the flexibility of the cap-and-trade program and to understand the economics involved. The cap-and-trade program provided flexibility to participants and led to lower costs than originally predicted. Factors contributing to the lower costs included productivity increases in coal production, cheaper transportation costs for low-sulfur coal, and new technological improvements. Title IV incentivized producers to find low-cost compliance options, and banking opportunities induced early emissions reductions for some facilities. The study by Harrington et al. (2000) found that predicted costs of regulatory programs, especially market-based ones like the SO2 trading program, tended to overstate actual implementation costs due to technological innovation and efficiency gains. Cost estimates for greenhouse gas reductions are likely to be less reliable than 1990 SO2 estimates. The reliability of cost estimates for greenhouse gas reductions may be uncertain, as they could be either too high or too low. The relationship between annual greenhouse gas emissions and key drivers like population, per capita GDP, and intensity of emissions is crucial in understanding the dynamics of emissions over time. The rates of change of key variables must sum to emissions. Table 2 shows assumptions from analyses of H.R. 2454 for 2050. Different assumptions lead to varying baseline GHG emissions, ranging from 8.4 to 10.1 billion metric tons. Disagreements in reference cases include per capita GDP. The reference cases for greenhouse gas reduction strategies show disagreements in per capita GDP and population projections. The H.R. 2454 scenario results in a narrower range of projected 2050 greenhouse gas emissions estimates, with a 19% difference between models. Assumptions about the U.S. economy's flexibility and responsiveness lead to interesting reversals in GHG intensity between the base case and H.R. 2454 scenario. The economic impact of H.R. 2454 varies among different models due to disagreements in GHG intensity assumptions. The EPA/ADAGE, NBCC/CRA, and MIT/EPPA models project higher 2050 GDP per capita under the bill compared to the EPA/IGEM model. The GDP per capita reductions range from 1.3% to 2.0% under H.R. 2454 according to different projections. The uncertainty arises from the reliance on 2009 EIA Annual Energy Outlook projections, which have changed over time. Projected 2030 greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by almost a quarter in the past four years due to less optimistic GDP growth assumptions and improved energy efficiency. If analyses were based on 2006 projections instead of 2009, compliance costs would be significantly higher. The uncertainty surrounding future greenhouse gas emissions and economic factors makes it difficult to accurately predict the costs of reducing greenhouse gases. Policy analysis can help identify factors that impact compliance costs and potential consequences on the economy. Models can indicate how sensitive a program's provisions are to economic, technological, and behavioral assumptions, aiding policymakers in designing effective greenhouse gas reduction strategies. The complexity of estimating the costs of a greenhouse gas reduction bill is highlighted by the limitations in modeling exercises. Implementing a CO2 tradable permit program is conceptually similar to the SO2 program, but differences in factors affecting global warming make modeling responses challenging. The acid rain program involved 3,000 electric generating units, showing the complexity of implementing greenhouse gas reduction strategies. The acid rain program involves 3,000 electric generating units contributing two-thirds of the country's SO2 emissions, making allowance trading manageable. Unlike the straightforward SO2 program, implementing a comprehensive greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program is more complex due to dispersed emission sources. The greenhouse gas emissions are distributed across various sectors, with only 34% coming from electricity generation. Transportation accounts for 28%, direct residential and commercial use for 11%, agriculture for 7%, and direct industrial use for 19%. This diversity of sources poses challenges for implementing a comprehensive cap-and-trade program. One alternative to address greenhouse gas emissions is to shift the imposition point \"upstream\" in sectors, as proposed by H.R. 2454. This complicates the economics of the program, as the price signal must navigate through various paths to reach the ultimate sources of emissions. The complexity of a cap-and-trade program's impact on the economy can lead to unintended consequences, with analysts struggling to capture the full effects on program design and implementation. The GHG cap-and-trade proposals offer more flexibility than the SO2 program. Acid rain prompted separate responses from the US and Canada. The US implemented a cap-and-trade program with flexibility mechanisms like banking, while Canada used various approaches codified by treaty. Offsets are not a major part of the SO2 program, and uncovered industrial entities must become covered entities to participate. The program includes a reserve of allowances for conservation and renewable energy efforts, but international trading is not allowed. The GHG cap-and-trade proposals, unlike the SO2 program, allow for international trading and a wide range of offset sources, increasing emission mitigation opportunities. This global trading expands the supply mix, leading to various compliance cost scenarios and complexities in verification and accounting processes. The three-driver analysis highlights the importance of reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of the economy to lower overall emissions. Technology development is key for long-term intensity reduction, supported by funding, incentives, and regulatory standards in greenhouse gas reduction bills like H.R. 2454. The effectiveness of these initiatives and price signals will impact the cost of any reduction strategy in the long term. Technology change is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the long term. The cost of meeting stabilization levels depends on future technology assumptions. Technology research and development play a significant role in policy options. Current studies assume no action by EPA until 2050, but future greenhouse gas reduction requirements may already be influencing decisions. Future requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are already impacting decisions by industry and consumers. Public and industry awareness of climate change can influence energy investment decisions, even without specific policy changes. Policy baselines for greenhouse gas emissions can be significantly shifted through new initiatives, as noted in the analysis of the Lieberman-Warner cap-and-trade bill. The passage discusses how new initiatives, such as the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, are impacting greenhouse gas emissions reductions. The ARRA includes energy provisions like federal funding, loan guarantees, and tax credits to promote investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) updated their Annual Energy Outlook 2009 to reflect the effects of ARRA, showing a projected increase in megawatt capacity. The ARRA resulted in increased renewable electric generating capacity by 27,700 MW by 2030, reduced nuclear power capacity by 4,900 MW, and decreased overall electric generating capacity by 11,300 MW. This led to a projected reduction of 36.5 million metric tons of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Estimating the cost of H.R. 2454's cap-and-trade program compared to the baseline without new legislation requires assumptions about the baseline level of regulation. The Clean Air Act (CAA) can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, including mobile and stationary sources, using existing legislative authority. EPA would need to determine that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution to regulate them under the CAA. The EPA proposed an endangerment finding in 2009 to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The agency intends to promulgate GHG emission standards for vehicles by March 2010, which will also trigger control technology requirements for new stationary sources like power plants. The Administrator has discretion in defining emission limits under the Clean Air Act for greenhouse gases, which could be categorized as criteria air pollutants. Different standards like NSPS, PSD, or MACT could apply to control emissions from various sources. The key question is how source categories are defined, which could impact the use of natural gas or cleaner fuels in power plants. The Administrator has discretion in defining emission limits for greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The best technology for coal-fired plants could be carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), with judgments on technology availability and achievability crucial for regulations. Regulatory approaches may be more expensive than H.R. 2454, making the latter a cost-effective option compared to EPA regulatory action. MIT's study highlights the importance of estimating the costs of H.R. 2454. The cost of H.R. 2454 is an important consideration due to potential EPA regulations on CO2 as a pollutant. H.R. 2454 could be a more efficient way to achieve emission reduction targets compared to EPA regulations. Analysts focus on estimating macro-economic effects, including direct abatement costs and general equilibrium effects. The cost of a greenhouse gas reduction program is a key consideration, along with the general equilibrium effects on the economy. GDP is commonly used as a measure of economic activity, but it does not reflect quality of life accurately. Consumption effects are sometimes considered, but models do not consistently measure welfare effects. The cost of a greenhouse gas reduction program is a key consideration, along with the general equilibrium effects on the economy. GDP is commonly used as a measure of economic activity, but it does not accurately reflect quality of life. Consumption and welfare effects are not consistently measured in current models. Allowance prices reflect the aggregate marginal cost of reductions, helping affected entities choose cost-effective reduction strategies. Allowance prices in greenhouse gas reduction programs do not always equal the marginal costs of achieving specified reductions due to factors like banking. Entities may bank allowances early and use them later, leading to higher prices initially and lower prices later. This ability to time-shift reduction requirements and compliance costs reflects the foresight of affected entities. In greenhouse gas reduction programs, allowance prices may not align with actual marginal costs due to factors like banking, reflecting entities' foresight. Aggregate welfare indicators like GDP may overshadow macroeconomic cost results for compliance strategies. Overemphasis on GDP can obscure insights into analyses' assumptions and conclusions about costs or benefits. For instance, a scatter-plot by the World Resources Institute shows that most estimates of CO2 abatement program impacts fall within a range of 0%-4% of GDP, regardless of the reduction requirement. The analysis warns against over-emphasizing GDP or other aggregate cost measures in greenhouse gas reduction programs, as it can obscure key insights and lead to a \"black box\" exercise. General equilibrium effects can complicate cost measures by interacting with pre-existing distortions, terms-of-trade effects, and other rigidities in the economy. MIT supports the use of aggregate welfare cost measures but cautions that GE effects are not easy to separately measure due to complex interactions in the economy. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of accurate compliance cost estimates in greenhouse gas reduction programs to provide transparency and clarity in policy decisions. It emphasizes the need to differentiate between direct abatement costs and general equilibrium effects to better understand the overall environmental agenda. The curr_chunk highlights the significance of using aggregate macroeconomic cost measures to assess the economic impact of proposed legislation, particularly in greenhouse gas reduction programs. It emphasizes the variability in cost estimates for reducing emissions and the influence of individuals' beliefs on the issue. The curr_chunk discusses different perspectives on global climate change issues and their impact on cost analysis, using the example of contrasting cost estimates from different analyses. The curr_chunk compares cost assumptions between different analyses regarding technology and efficiency provisions for achieving emission targets. ACCF/NAM's High Cost case assumptions differ from EIA's High Technology sensitivity analysis by restricting banking, offsets, and availability of low- and non-carbon technologies. This results in varied cost estimates within the 0-4% GDP range for greenhouse gas reduction. The analyses diverge in allowance price estimates by 2030, but this measure exaggerates differences and should not be confused with average or program costs. There is a lack of sensitivity analysis to determine the factors causing variations in results, such as economic, behavioral, and technology assumptions. Some studies have analyzed the importance of assumptions in greenhouse gas reduction proposals, with efforts dating back to 1997. Dr. Repetto's website allows users to assess key assumptions and their impact on GDP through meta-analysis. Seven key assumptions were found to influence results, including economic response efficiency and availability of non-carbon technology. The report reviewed different models for greenhouse gas emissions under H.R. 2454, showing a range of emissions due to factors like emissions growth in sectors not covered by the bill and the use of international offsets. The steepest reduction path is for HF/GI, with a note that international offsets would reduce global emissions but not emissions within the United States. The HF/GI emissions path under H.R. 2454 is stringent due to no banking and declining offset supply assumptions. It has the least baseline growth and requires the most emission reductions. The NBCC/CRA case results in the most reductions from baseline levels. The NBCC/CRA case under H.R. 2454 results in the most reductions from baseline levels despite generous offset availability assumptions. EIA/NEMS case allows for higher emissions levels due to substantial use of international offsets. Data on conventional and hazardous air pollutants effects of H.R. 2454 were not presented in the reports reviewed. The EPA/IPM analysis and EIA analysis data on pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are not presented in reports due to uncertainty about future regulations. EPA is expected to tighten regulations on air pollutants, with revisions to the Clean Air Interstate Rule and development of a Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule for mercury. The EPA/IPM projects reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in 2025 from H.R. 2454. The EPA/IPM projects reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in 2025 from H.R. 2454, along with a 15% reduction in mercury emissions. EIA/NEMS projects an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions but reductions in nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions under H.R. 2454. The uncertainty about the future economy size is greater than the impact of H.R. 2454, with consistent expectations of slower economic growth under the bill. The economy is expected to grow under H.R. 2454, but at a slower rate. Projections show GDP per capita reductions in 2030, with the HF/GI case having the highest reductions. This case used the most constrained offset supply and focused only on energy-related CO2 reductions. The HF/GI model only considered energy-related CO2 reductions and did not include potential low-cost emissions reductions from non-CO2 gases. The EIA/NEMS and ACCF-NAM/NEMS analyses show steep GDP per capita reductions between 2025 and 2030, with uncertainty on whether this trend will continue beyond 2030. The EIA/NEMS case builds up a 13 billion allowance bank in anticipation of more stringent caps and rising allowance prices, while HF/GI does not allow banking. The HF/GI model does not allow banking and has limits on offset use, resulting in higher allowance prices by 2025. Other cases show a shallower decline in GDP per capita by 2050, influenced by assumptions on offset use and banking. Figures 12 and 13 illustrate the estimated allowance prices for each case, highlighting the impact of these factors on projected prices. The ACCF-NAM/NEMS case assumes that domestic offsets will dominate, leading to a rapid increase in allowance prices between 2020 and 2030. Banking behavior varies among cases, with the HF/GI case not allowing banking, the ACCF-NAM/NEMS case limiting it to 5 billion metric tons, and the EIA/NEMS case allowing up to 13 billion metric tons by 2030. In contrast, the EPA/IGEM case projects a peak total bank of roughly 20 billion metric tons in 2029. Banking influences firms' ability to manage emissions. The EPA/IGEM case projects a peak total bank of roughly 20 billion metric tons in 2029, with allowance prices generally falling within a band between $13 and $21 in 2015 and increasing at a steady rate through 2050. The smooth allowance price curves for EPA, MIT, and CRA contribute to relatively smooth projections for GDP loss. Offset prices are well below allowance prices from 2020 onward in the HF/GI case, indicating more offsets would be purchased than assumed. The price curve is influenced by the utilization of low-cost offsets by 2018, leading to higher utility emissions control costs. Availability of offsets significantly reduces program costs, with the total value of allowances distributed each year potentially reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. A strategic reserve holds 1% to 3% of allowances annually to stabilize the market, with the rest allocated to various entities at no cost in earlier years. In 2016, 17% of allowances are auctioned, increasing to 65% by 2030. Table 7 shows the estimated value of allowance allocations and auction revenues under H.R. 2454. Total annual allowance value could reach $100 billion by 2040. Higher allowance prices lead to higher values and auction revenues. Figure 14 displays the annual total no-cost allowance value and auction revenues. Total allowance value represents potential wealth transfers, not GHG abatement costs. Under H.R. 2454, a significant amount of allowance value is allocated each year, with a shift towards greater auctions and phased-out no-cost allocations between 2026 and 2030. The bill allows covered entities to offset a large percentage of their emissions using offsets, increasing over time to 67% by 2050. Under H.R. 2454, covered entities can offset up to 2 billion tons of GHGs annually, with 1 billion tons from domestic offsets and 1 billion tons from international offsets. International offsets are discounted by 20% after 2017. The availability of offsets significantly impacts the program's cost. The availability and price of offsets play a crucial role in determining the costs of H.R. 2454. Higher allowance prices are expected if international offsets are unavailable, impacting the overall cost of the program. Offset limits in the bill may not be reached until 2025, and there is uncertainty regarding the quantity and pricing of offsets in the future. The availability and price of offsets are crucial in determining the costs of H.R. 2454. Higher allowance prices occur if international offsets are unavailable, impacting the overall cost of the program. CBO found that H.R. 2454's offset provisions significantly reduce allowance prices, with the use of offsets lowering the price by about 70 percent. Increasing the use of international offsets could further decrease the allowance price by about 30 percent. Excluding international offsets raises allowance prices in 2030 by more than half, with CBO's analysis showing a triple increase in price. The role of offset credits in reducing allowance prices is evident in Table 8 and Figures 15, 16, and 12. The HF/GI case has the heaviest constraint on offset supply, leading to a decrease in total offset supply after 2020 and a rapid increase in allowance prices. The ACCF/NAM/NEMS and HF/GI cases have the most limited offset supplies among all models. The HF/GI case has the most limited offset supplies among all models, resulting in the highest allowance prices. If offsets are not available as assumed, program costs may increase dramatically. Experience with the acid rain program shows participants bank allowances in the face of price uncertainty. The HF/GI case did not include banking, explaining its increasing allowance prices, while other cases include banking to some extent. Banking in greenhouse gas reduction programs allows participants to control reduction efforts and delay major capital investments by buying and using allowances strategically. Entities in various cases heavily bank allowances until around 2030, supported by domestic and international offsets. This strategy ensures a significant allowance bank remains at the end of 2030 to meet post-2030 needs. Some cases assume the strategic reserve auction never occurs, resulting in a slight tightening of the emissions cap. MIT's case ignores the provision altogether. Technological advancements play a key role in emission reduction, driven by the free enterprise system and policy levers. The text discusses how induced technological change can be influenced by various policy levers, such as prices, subsidies, and technology mandates. It emphasizes the importance of considering multiple factors in technology development, including market incentives, research and development, learning-by-doing, and spillovers from other industries. The text cautions against relying on models that assume only one source of technological progress or overlook critical factors like spillovers. The text highlights the need for comprehensive treatments of technological change and more research to understand distortions in policy conclusions from models with limited representations of technological change. It points out that current models cannot reliably project technological change, leading to over- or under-estimation of costs. The text also mentions the difficulty in predicting the availability of lower-carbon electric generating technology, including current and emerging technologies like nuclear, wind power, and carbon capture. The text emphasizes the importance of detailed technology descriptions in models to accurately project technological change and costs. It mentions various low-carbon electric generating technologies like wind, biomass, nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas, highlighting their potential under H.R. 2454. The text discusses the availability of different technologies under H.R. 2454 for meeting electricity demand to 2030. Some cases heavily constrain alternatives to natural gas generation, leading to a substantial amount of natural gas capacity being built. Sensitivity analysis shows a shift to natural gas when nuclear power, renewable power, and coal with CCS are constrained. In contrast, some cases indicate little to no new construction of natural gas capacity. The EPA/IPM and EPA/ADAGE cases show limited new construction of natural gas-fueled generating capacity, opting for a mix of renewable, nuclear, and coal with CCS. The EIA/NEMS and NBCC/CRA cases suggest a moderate role for natural gas. The need for low-carbon electric generating capacity is emphasized, with a significant amount required under H.R. 2454. The amount of capacity built depends on future supply and demand assumptions, consumer response to rising prices, and incentives in H.R. 2454. Between 1963 and 1985, the United States added significant generating capacity, including nuclear, coal, hydropower, natural gas, and oil-fired capacity. There were also conversions between coal and oil-fired units during this period. From 2001 to 2005, the U.S. added about 180 GW of new capacity, mostly natural gas-fired. Between 2001 and 2005, the United States added approximately 180 GW of new capacity, primarily natural gas-fired. Conservation efforts are expected to reduce the need for new construction under H.R. 2454. The importance of electricity and energy conservation in meeting future demand is highlighted, with a focus on carbon capture and storage technology for coal-fired electric generation. The viability of coal consumption is linked to the development and commercialization of CCS. The CCS bonus allowance provision under H.R. 2454 did not lead to significant increases in CCS deployment by 2030. Low allowance prices and the attractiveness of other alternatives like natural gas, renewables, and nuclear hindered CCS construction. Different scenarios showed varying levels of CCS deployment, with some cases not reaching the assumed restraints due to inadequate allowance prices. EPA's analysis of CCS deployment under H.R. 2454's bonus allowance scheme shows that a price of $40 per ton maximizes new capacity, depleting the bonus pool. Lower prices result in less deployment, while higher prices reduce incentives. The reverse auction provision in the bill should determine the financial incentive for CCS deployment. The discussion focuses on current perspectives on technological alternatives for deploying CCS, including new facilities like nuclear power, biomass power, or coal-fired IGCC with CCS. Retrofits to existing coal-fired powerplants are limited to biomass or natural gas cofiring, with very few CCS installations. MIT suggests the potential value of CCS technology for retrofitting existing plants to extend their life and reduce the need for new plants. The capital intensity of these technologies is a concern for investment. The capital intensity of post-combustion technologies for CCS is a concern as it crowds out investment in other areas of the economy. Retrofitable technologies like ammonia-based processes by Powerspan and Alstom are in development, with commercial demonstrations planned for CO2 capture from existing coal-fired facilities. CO2 injected in deep saline aquifers at Mountaineer for commercial viability demonstration. AEP plans to implement the technology at Northeastern Station in Oologah, OK. Other solvent-based post-combustion processes in pilot stage. Future retrofittable technologies could reduce projected costs. Research funding crucial for technology availability. H.R. 2454 provides substantial funding for technology development. H.R. 2454 will provide substantial funding for technology development, focusing on specific technologies for electricity and vehicle technology. Questions arise about the amount of funding needed and whether it is directed towards the right technologies. The bill exceeds current efforts but may not prioritize broad technology development and deployment. Two proposed strategies for improving the electricity system are discussed. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Coal Utilization Research Council (CURC) have proposed funding needs for various electricity technologies to meet greenhouse gas reduction targets. EPRI's targets for 2030 include efficiency improvements, renewables, nuclear power, coal-plant efficiency, CCS deployment, plug-in hybrids, and distributed energy resources. CURC and EPRI also outline public funding needs for commercializing \"clean coal\" technologies over 18 years. The strategy proposed by the Coal Utilization Research Council (CURC) and EPRI aims to fund carbon capture and storage demonstration projects, improve combustion technology, and develop CCS retrofit technology over 18 years (2008-2025). H.R. 2454 allocates over $7 billion annually in 2012 and over $10 billion annually by 2030 for technology development and deployment, exceeding previous estimates. Organizations like EPRI and the Pew Center for Global Climate Change call for increased funding for advanced coal options. The bill focuses on specific technologies, with a large share (over 40% by 2020) dedicated to certain technologies. The bill, H.R. 2454, allocates funding for specific technologies such as CCS and advanced technology vehicles, with a focus on plug-in vehicles. The allowances provided for research and development are designated for advanced vehicles, with an average annual funding of $1.25 billion between 2012 and 2025. H.R. 2454 allocates funding for advanced vehicle and hydrogen fuel R&D, with an average annual funding of $1.25 billion between 2012 and 2025. Other stimulus programs have had billions in appropriations but were short-term, unlike the 14-year span of H.R. 2454. The effectiveness of these funds in accelerating technology development could impact the program's overall costs and success. Additionally, H.R. 2454 includes provisions for zero- or low-carbon electricity technology and advanced technology vehicles like plug-in hybrids. The combination of energy efficiency and conservation provisions in H.R. 2454 could significantly impact energy demand and costs. The bill includes incentives to encourage their expansion, with analyses showing the importance of energy demand reduction for compliance strategies. The impact of H.R. 2454 on electricity generation shows reductions in billion kilowatt-hours and percentage reduction from both a \"business as usual\" and a 2007 baseline. Demand reduction increases as a percentage of an increasing baseline projection from 2020 to 2030. Total energy consumption is reduced by about 3-11% in 2020 under H.R. 2454, with coal consumption reduced by 15-30% from projected 2020 and historic 2007 levels. In 2020, total energy consumption is reduced by 15-30% from projected 2020 and historic 2007 levels, with higher reductions in fossil fuel consumption. In 2030, total energy is reduced by 6-16% from projected 2030 levels and historic 2007 levels, with increased natural gas consumption in the MIT/EPPA case. Gas and oil consumption continues to decrease, leading to significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, mainly from reduced coal consumption. Market-based systems control greenhouse gas emissions through a price signal, efficiently reducing emissions until the cost equals the price of buying an allowance. Cap-and-trade programs create allowances, each representing a license to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, which holds value and demand at a given price. This economic mechanism is illustrated in Figure 19, with two components to the program: compliance and allowances. The cap-and-trade program consists of compliance costs for reducing emissions and the value created by permits for emitting greenhouse gases. The allowance value is projected to be higher than compliance costs, leading to debates on allowance allocation and wealth transfer. This differs from traditional regulatory approaches for controlling emissions. Allowance markets offer covered entities the choice to reduce emissions or purchase allowances to meet the emission cap, creating value that can help offset program impacts. This market-based approach is more efficient than traditional regulatory methods, which limit flexibility and may result in less effective compliance programs. Market-based solutions are seen as more costly than traditional regulatory approaches, as any inefficiency introduced by the regulatory system would be offset by the allowance cost in the market-based system. The allocation of allowances does not reduce compliance costs, it only shifts who bears the cost. Free allocations can remove some or all of the cost of obtaining allowances, but the cost of actions to reduce emissions cannot be eliminated. The distribution of emissions to meet caps can reduce costs by eliminating the need to purchase allowances. However, this can shift costs around and may not eliminate the overall cost of reducing emissions. Free allocation of allowances can actually increase program costs by diluting price signals, making compliance less economically efficient. Redistribution of allowance value to consumers can prevent electricity price increases but make cap-and-trade more costly overall, requiring greater emission reductions from other sectors of the economy. The distribution of emissions to meet caps can reduce costs by eliminating the need to purchase allowances. However, free allocation of allowances can increase program costs by diluting price signals, making compliance less economically efficient. EPA's analysis of H.R. 2454 showed that the reported version had lower projected allowance prices compared to the discussion draft, primarily due to the inclusion of free allocation provisions that reduced electricity price increases. The reported version of H.R. 2454 has a less stringent 2020 emissions cap and allows for expanded use of international offsets, which can outweigh economic inefficiencies introduced by its free allocation scheme. The allocation system of H.R. 2454 becomes more efficient over time, with over 65% of allowances auctioned by 2030 and a significant amount allocated for other purposes. The bill H.R. 2454 allows for expanded use of international offsets and a less stringent 2020 emissions cap. Over 65% of allowances will be auctioned by 2030, with a significant amount allocated for other purposes. The bill contains provisions to prevent electricity and natural gas LDCs from using free allowances to incentivize increased energy use. EPA cases assume that allowances allocated to electricity LDCs dilute the price signal, necessitating increased emission reductions. The CRA International analysis assumes LDCs distribute allowances. The CRA International analysis disagrees with EPA's interpretation of the bill, stating that allowances should not be used for rebates based solely on electricity usage to prevent distorting incentives for conservation. The Heritage Foundation rejects the idea that allowance value can reduce energy prices and instead models macro-economic and pricing effects. The Heritage Foundation models the macro-economic and pricing effects of H.R. 2454, treating the allowance value as government revenue. Estimates of energy price impacts vary widely due to divergent projections. CRS highlights general themes from various cases to offer insights on assumptions and calculations. The impact of energy costs on households and industries is also discussed. The impact of H.R. 2454 on residential electricity bills is a contentious issue. Efforts to provide state-level data on electricity bill impacts are complicated due to a lack of data availability and difficulties in projecting impacts on a state-level basis. Various groups have attempted to project these impacts, including the National Mining Association's Electricity Costs Map. The National Mining Association's Electricity Costs Map shows state-by-state electricity cost increases under H.R. 2454. The map is based on electricity sales and carbon dioxide emissions, but does not follow the formula mandated by H.R. 2454. The M.J. Bradley and Associates' Residential Electricity Bills Map analyzes the impact of H.R. 2454 on monthly average residential electricity bills, focusing on cost-effective reduction strategies and compliance strategies of affected utilities. The map avoids pitfalls of the NMA map by not reflecting overall allocation or costs of H.R. 2454, its distribution across states, or likely compliance strategies. The M.J. Bradley and Associates map focuses on monthly residential electric bills in line with H.R. 2454, using a nationwide average consumption of 1000 Kwh per month. The analysis is transparent but lacks intra-state differences in electricity supply and consumption required by the bill. The NRDC Electric Bills Map summarizes state-level electricity bill impacts of H.R. 2454, estimating an average savings of $6 per month for Americans. Unlike other maps, NRDC's analysis includes modeling demand response to efficiency provisions and price signals. The NRDC Electric Bills Map estimates an average monthly savings of $6 for Americans due to H.R. 2454. The analysis includes modeling demand response to efficiency provisions and price signals, which differs from other analyses. The analysis by CRS adjusted figures to reflect residential consumer consumption and converted results to 2005$. The analysis by M.J. Bradley presented residential monthly bills in 2005$. The analysis by CRS converted figures to 2005$, projecting savings in later years. The U.S. average residential electric bill in 2012 would increase $2 a month under NMA and M.J Bradley, but save over $6 a month under NRDC. States show varying monthly cost changes, with outliers like North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming due to in-state generation exports. The NMA methodology for estimating state impact data on electricity bills may lead to inaccuracies, such as North Dakota's bills rising while South Dakota's decline. The data suggests that H.R. 2454's rebate formula could reduce the increase in average residential electric bills nationwide to about $2 a month. The energy consumer assistance in H.R. 2454 aims to reduce the impact of energy price increases on households through rebates and promoting energy efficiency. However, it does not aim to lessen the price signal from higher electricity or natural gas rates. Presenting only rate increases without highlighting the projected assistance provides an incomplete picture, especially in the short-term when rebates are at their maximum. The discussion needs to be placed in the context of H.R. 2454 and its energy efficiency incentives. Assistance can significantly impact energy bills, but not gasoline prices. Results for natural gas prices vary due to different baselines and indices. The cases do not agree on the effect of H.R. 2454's natural gas LDC free allocation scheme on rates. The incremental impact of H.R. 2454 on natural gas prices depends on future natural gas-fired generation levels. Three categories are identified: little to no increase, modest increase, or substantial increase in generation. The EPA/ADAGE case projects a small increase in natural gas rates, with rates rising steeply after 2030. The EIA/NEMS and NMA/CRA cases show varying residential rate results in the short-term but converge by 2030. The difference in natural gas rates between various cases in the short-term (2020) is partly due to the treatment of H.R. 2454's LDC rebate. By 2030, the rebate is phased out, leading to similar rates across cases. NBCC/CRA projects steeper rate increases, reaching 34% above baseline levels in 2050. ACCF-NAM/NEMS and HF/GI cases show minor increases in 2020 but substantial increases (over 50%) in both residential and industrial rates by 2030. These results align with high allowance prices and increased natural gas usage in the future. Table 15 shows projected gasoline price increases under H.R. 2454, with estimates ranging from around a quarter to 34 cents per gallon by 2030. Some cases project even higher prices due to higher allowance costs and the impact of low carbon fuel standards. Unlike natural gas or electricity costs, the bill does not provide rebates for increased gasoline bills. The ACCF-NAM/NEMS model did not include a provision in H.R. 2454 that would impact gasoline prices. Estimates show a projected increase of 59 cents per gallon by 2050. The bill does not allow for rebates on increased gasoline bills. In terms of residential electricity bills, the impact of H.R. 2454 is minimal for 2020 rates. The impact of H.R. 2454 on electricity rates is discussed, with projections showing rate increases up to 49% above baseline levels by 2050. Factors to consider include welfare measures, household definitions, and accounting methods used in estimating effects. The term \"welfare effects\" is not consistently defined across studies examining the impact of H.R. 2454. Different measures are used to determine household effects, including welfare change, consumption-based change, income-based change, and economy-wide costs. Comparisons across these measures can be challenging due to varying accounting methods. The broadest measure of welfare is \"welfare change\" used by MIT, which compares household welfare with and without H.R. 2454 enactment. This measure considers total economic costs of greenhouse gas abatement and other policy measures, taking into account GHG price, abatement amount, and interactions with other policies. Welfare measures go beyond CO2 price by considering that many reductions cost less than the last. The measure of change in welfare considers reductions in costs of greenhouse gas abatement and other policy measures. It includes changes in labor and leisure time, with consumption change being a major component related to welfare change. Leisure time is valued monetarily in models like EPPA, and household effects are often measured by consumption change. This measure focuses on market impacts and does not account for policy effects on leisure time. The impact of policy on leisure time is not captured in the consumption measure, leading to greater losses compared to the welfare indicator. Different models define consumption differently, making comparisons challenging. Income-based measures can vary in interpretation. National income reflects the total value of goods and services. National income measures the total value of goods and services, while personal income includes various sources like wages and investment income. Disposable income is personal income minus taxes, representing the amount available for spending or saving. However, it is challenging to reconcile disposable income with welfare and consumption measures due to its sensitivity to different assumptions. The allowance value created by H.R. 2454 can significantly impact the welfare estimate, especially when using disposable income as a measure of welfare. Economy-wide costs related to H.R. 2454 include purchase of international offset credits, cost of producing domestic offset credits, resource costs of reducing emissions, and allowance value directed overseas. Allowance value is assumed to flow back to U.S. households through direct relief and allocations to businesses and government. The U.S. Census Bureau's definitions of household and family differ, with a household including related and unrelated individuals sharing a housing unit. The average number of people per household is 2.56, while a family consists of two or more individuals related by birth, marriage, or adoption residing together. The average number of people per family household is 3.22, with a married couple household consisting of a husband and wife. The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as about 2.5-2.6 people. The HF/GI case uses a household with 4 people for calculations, representing about one-fifth of family households and married couple households in 2008. Discounting is used to account for program costs occurring over time. Discounting costs accounts for future program costs when incomes are higher. Household effects estimates are presented in the economic context of the year they occur. CRS focuses on effects estimated for the year 2020. The CRS focuses on effects estimated for the year 2020, with household effect estimates provided in Table 17. The data show a divide between lower estimates around $319 and higher estimates, particularly from NBCC/CRA and HF/GI cases. Estimates from MIT, EPA, EIA, CBO, and ACCF-NAM are significantly lower than the higher estimates. The estimates by EPA, EIA, ACCF-NAM/NEMS, and CBO are much lower than the higher estimates, with differences in measurement and accounting methods. CBO and NBCC/CRA estimates are based on the 2010 economy, scaled to represent an equivalent impact in 2020. CRS used a proxy real discount rate of 2% to adjust CBO's 2020 household effects estimates to the 2010 economy. The impact of price increases from H.R. 2454 on households, industries, and businesses would depend on their responsiveness to the price signal and other provisions of the bill. Sector-level baseline forecasts are less accurate than national forecasts. The accuracy of sector-level baseline forecasts is lower compared to national forecasts. Errors in sector estimates have not improved over the past two decades, with industrial sector overestimations and transportation sector underestimations. The impact of H.R. 2454 on industries is expected to vary depending on site-specific factors, primarily affecting energy costs rather than direct compliance costs. The impact of H.R. 2454 on industries is complex, as different companies within the same industry may be affected differently by energy price increases. This can hurt the competitiveness of firms, especially in energy-intensive industries. Individual facilities within the same industry will also be impacted differently by H.R. 2454 and other unforeseen events in the future. The potential impacts of H.R. 2454 on individual companies include affecting competitive balance, influencing investment decisions in technology, and potentially speeding up the development of more efficient technology. This could lead to improved competitiveness and reduced impact of H.R. 2454. The International carbon leakage issue is addressed in H.R. 2454 through free allowance allocation and an International Reserve Allowance scheme. EPA and EIA examined the impact of these mechanisms on energy-intensive industries. The EPA and EIA analyzed the impact of H.R. 2454's free allowance allocation on energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The free allocation scheme is projected to increase energy-intensive manufacturing output in 2015 and then decline by 2020. The EIA/NEMS analysis shows that the free allocation reduces the impact of increased energy prices on these industries. The free allocation of permits under H.R. 2454 has a positive effect on energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries by reducing the impact of increased energy prices. This allocation helps alleviate any disadvantage these industries may face from international competition. The overall impact can be seen in Figure 23 of the EIA report. The International Reserve Allowance (IRA) provisions in H.R. 2454 were not analyzed in the cases examined. EPA's sensitivity analysis of an IRA scheme in S. 2191 showed that maintaining emissions at 2015 levels by 2025 and returning to 2000 levels by 2050 could prevent international emission leakage. In a worst-case scenario, no international actions until 2050 were considered. The International Reserve Allowance provisions of S. 2191 were assumed triggered due to lack of international action. Emissions from countries without commitments were estimated to rise by 350 million metric tons of CO2e by 2030 and 385 million metric tons by 2050. This would result in minimal impact on leakage but significant impact on imports, with a projected increase of 5.4% in 2030 and 7% in 2050 without IRA provisions. Under the IRA provisions, imports were estimated to increase about 1% in 2030 and decline about 5% in 2050. U.S. exports declined as countries used more domestic manufacturing. The differential effect of IRA provisions on trade versus emissions leakage could present problems if brought before the WTO. None of the cases attempted to quantify or monetize the benefits of reducing greenhouse gases, highlighting the need for more research and resources devoted to benefits analysis. Monetizing benefits from reducing air pollutants has been attempted for decades. In the 1980s, EPA analyzed health benefits of controlling sulfur dioxide, estimating potential benefits between zero and $385 billion annually. Monetizing benefits from reducing greenhouse gases is challenging due to the global nature of climate change. Some view this effort as impossible or unethical. Monetizing benefits from reducing greenhouse gases is challenging due to the global nature of climate change. Discount rates used to value long-term damage from climate change range from 0 to 4-5%. Estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon span over three orders of magnitude. Most current attempts to monetize environmental benefits are incomplete. Attempts to monetize environmental benefits are incomplete, with studies focusing on market impacts of predictable climate changes. Only a few consider non-market impacts, extreme events, catastrophes, or socially contingent impacts. Studies estimating the Social Cost of Carbon often overlook the vast range of climate risks, painting an incomplete picture. The DEFRA review highlights that estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and other climate impacts often overlook important unpriced risks. Monetizing damages presents a moral dilemma, especially regarding intergenerational discounting and the perceived importance of future impacts. The UK government's attempt to put a price on climate change is criticized for these reasons. The UK government's attempt to put a price on climate change is criticized by the UK House of Commons Select Committee on Environmental Audit for moral reasons and the difficulty in valuing the social cost of carbon. One's valuation of the social cost of carbon depends on assumptions about emissions paths and the relationship between atmospheric concentrations of GHGs and economic impacts. The SCC declines as emissions result in less severe damages, increasing over time as damage gets closer. The UK Government has a shadow price for carbon in cost-benefit analyses, different from the SCC value. The UK shadow price of carbon is based on the Social Cost of Carbon of a 550 ppm stabilization goal as determined in The Stern Review, plus consideration of abatement costs and the value of UK leadership in encouraging global participation and developing new technology. The shadow price is about $45 a ton in 2012 (2005$), rising 2% annually thereafter. The net present value (NPV) of estimated reductions over the life of the program (2012-2050) would range from $4.3 trillion to $5.4 trillion in 2005 dollars. The EPA/ADAGE and NBCC/CRA cases estimate the net present value of the welfare effects of H.R. 2454 at $2.6 trillion in 2005 dollars. Critics argue that these estimates are either too low or too high, with some pointing out the discounting of future generations. The undiscounted flow of benefit estimates ranges from $8.6 trillion to $12.4 trillion in 2005 dollars. The Bush Administration's NHTSA valued carbon reductions at $7 a ton in its 2008 assessment of new fuel economy standards. The NHTSA valued carbon reductions at $7 a ton and used a 7% discount rate. The resulting NPV for reducing greenhouse gases under H.R. 2454 is significantly lower than UK estimates. Monetizing climate-related benefits reflects the assumptions of estimators, with estimates ranging from zero to $200 billion annually. The Stern Review emphasizes the tentative nature of such estimates. MIT conducted a study using the Integrated Global System Model to analyze climate response to different stabilization goals. Parameterizations of the model represented major atmosphere-ocean circulation models to illustrate uncertainty in translating emission trends into climate change estimates. MIT used the Integrated Global System Model to analyze climate response to different policy scenarios related to climate change. The scenarios included a reference scenario with no specific global climate policy, a global participation scenario, a scenario where abatement efforts in developing countries are delayed, and a scenario where only developed countries participate in abatement efforts. Developed countries, including the United States, were assumed to reduce emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 under scenarios 2, 3, and 4. The MIT Integrated Global System Model analyzed climate response to different policy scenarios related to climate change. Developed countries, including the United States, were assumed to reduce emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 under various scenarios. Developing countries had different emissions reduction timelines in the scenarios. The impact of these scenarios on global temperature was simulated by MIT IGSM. The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce global mean temperatures by 0.5 degrees C from a projected increase of 3.5 to 4.5 degrees C. The United States' greenhouse gas emissions were 40% of the developed world's total emissions in 2000. MIT states that specific U.S. policy targets cannot be directly linked to global temperature targets, as climate gains depend on global efforts. Leading by example in setting U.S. policy targets could encourage cooperation from other countries. The global context of H.R. 2454's climate-related environmental benefits and the need to engage developing countries in emission reduction efforts are key considerations. The credibility of H.R. 2454's greenhouse gas reduction program in the eyes of developing countries and its alignment with U.S. commitments to international agreements are crucial issues to address. The estimates of emission reductions from non-greenhouse gas air pollutants in H.R. 2454 may be incomplete, but values have been assigned to pollutants like nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. Other benefits may come from reducing pollutants such as carbon monoxide. The EPA estimated benefits of reducing mercury emissions by 70% at $400,000 annually, but did not include results of two studies estimating benefits at $1.3 billion and $5.2 billion annually. This report examines projected costs of cap-and-trade provisions of H.R. 2454 to 2030 or 2050, highlighting challenges in cost projections due to changing regulatory standards and unforeseen events. Long-term cost projections for H.R. 2454 are speculative due to unforeseen events like technological breakthroughs. Models can indicate sensitivity to economic, technological, and behavioral assumptions for designing a greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The ultimate cost of the bill depends on the economy's response to technological challenges. The bill H.R. 2454 provides incentives for technology innovation to address technological challenges. The potential cost reduction from new technology is not fully analyzed, and the distribution of allowance value will determine the program's cost bearers. The market value of allowances created by H.R. 2454 will exceed $100 billion annually, transferring value to various entities. This allocation scheme shifts the costs of emissions reduction, with the availability of offsets playing a significant role in cost determination. Eliminating international offsets could raise allowance prices by 60%. The studies show that eliminating international offsets could increase allowance prices by 60% or more. The need for low-carbon electric generating capacity is emphasized, with varying projections on the amount of new capacity required under H.R. 2454. The estimated amount of capacity constructed under H.R. 2454 depends on assumptions about new capacity needs, consumer response to rising prices, and technological development. Predicting household effects is challenging due to various factors, such as welfare measures and assumptions. Estimates vary significantly across studies, reflecting different philosophies and assumptions. The household effects in studies reviewed vary significantly, even when normalized by household size and accounting method. H.R. 2454's climate-related environmental benefits should be considered globally, especially in engaging the developing world in emission reduction efforts. The bill's greenhouse gas reduction program and provisions need to be credible to developing countries for future international agreements. The bill's reductions must align with U.S. commitments under the UNFCCC for global stabilization to occur at an acceptable level."
