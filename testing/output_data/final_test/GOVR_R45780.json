    "content": "The United States is currently experiencing the longest economic expansion in its history, with some uncertainty over how long it will continue. Predicting the transition from expansion to recession is difficult due to various factors, including those outside the country's borders. Countercyclical fiscal policy may help stabilize the economy during a recession by adjusting taxes and spending to stimulate demand. The report discusses options Congress may consider for fiscal stimulus to counteract economic contraction and return the economy to its potential. It highlights the use of automatic stabilizers and the distinction between countercyclical and growth-oriented policies in response to a recession. The report evaluates potential fiscal policy options for Congress to consider in response to economic contraction. Effective fiscal policy during recessions should be timely, targeted, and temporary to stimulate the economy at the right time and avoid severe downturns. The report discusses the risk of needing more fiscal stimulus during a severe downturn or risking overheating the economy with untimely stimulus. Timely implementation of fiscal policy is challenging due to lags in recognizing a recession, negotiating a response, and seeing the effects. Targeted fiscal stimulus with high multipliers is recommended for maximum impact on economic output. Economists use multipliers to estimate the impact of fiscal policy on the economy. Tax reductions targeted at lower-income households have the largest stimulative effects, as these individuals are more likely to increase spending in response. Business tax reductions also stimulate demand, but with smaller multiplier effects due to businesses being slow to respond to investment incentives. Business tax rate reductions primarily benefit existing capital rather than new investment, while hiring incentives do not directly address the main factor influencing the decision to hire more employees, which is the demand for businesses' products and services. Direct spending increases, such as unemployment benefits and food stamp assistance, are highly stimulative during a recession. Assistance to state and local governments and infrastructure spending are also effective in stimulating the economy. Spending on infrastructure is believed to have a significant impact on the economy but can take months to take effect. Temporary stimulus can help contain the budgetary impact of tax reductions and spending increases, increasing the effectiveness of the stimulus. Large and sustained deficits can lead to undesirable effects such as higher interest rates. Higher interest rates can counteract stimulus by crowding out private-sector investment and consumption, attracting borrowing from abroad, and reducing net exports. Deficits harm economic growth by reducing national saving critical for economic growth. It is important to distinguish between countercyclical fiscal policies and growth-oriented policies before discussing potential policy options for countering an economic downturn. Cyclical fluctuations are short-run phenomena caused by external shocks that temporarily move the economy away from its long-run growth path. During a recession, total spending falls below the economy's capacity, leading to unemployment and reduced capital utilization. Countercyclical policies aim to impact aggregate demand and mitigate economic fluctuations over the business cycle, while growth-oriented policies focus on enhancing the economy's productive capabilities in the long run. Growth-oriented policies target the supply side of the economy to influence sources of long-term growth like labor, capital, and technology. These policies aim to improve incentives for work, investment, and innovation by structuring tax and spending initiatives. Managing deficits and debt is also crucial to prevent high interest rates from hindering growth factors. This report focuses on countercyclical fiscal policy tools, including automatic stabilizers and discretionary changes, which can be enacted in response to economic conditions. Automatic stabilizers lower taxes and increase spending during economic downturns without requiring legislative action, while discretionary changes involve legislative adjustments to taxes and government spending. The distinction between the two can blur, as automatic stabilization policies can be modified through legislative action, and discretionary changes can be designed to take effect automatically based on certain criteria. The curr_chunk discusses specific policy options for responding to a recession, drawing from estimates by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Moody's Analytics. These options vary in their impact on the economy and administrative complexities. The presented policy options are commonly considered for fiscal stimulus packages, but policymakers may also consider the economy's potential to recover without intervention. The economy's potential to return to full employment without intervention is discussed, with fiscal policy's impact on the economy varying based on distance from full employment. Estimates from the Great Recession may serve as an upper bound for fiscal policy's stimulative effect, with improvements in estimation techniques over time. The relative magnitudes estimated by CBO and Moody's are likely to still hold. The estimates by CBO and Moody's are likely to remain relevant in the future, despite uncertainties in estimating the impact of fiscal policies on the economy. The focus should be on the relative magnitudes of policies' impacts rather than individual point estimates. The estimates presented in this section focus on how specific policies, such as the progressive income tax system and Unemployment Compensation benefits, act as automatic stabilizers during economic downturns. These programs help cushion the fall in spending and mitigate the negative impact of rising unemployment on aggregate demand. Other programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, may also serve as automatic stabilizers. Automatic stabilizers like SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF are designed to be effective countercyclical policies by providing timely support to individuals as the economy weakens. These programs target those with falling incomes, offering a significant impact. They gradually taper off as the economy improves, but some individuals may exhaust benefits before the recession ends. Automatic stabilizers like SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF provide timely support to individuals during economic downturns. However, some may exhaust benefits before the recession ends. Adjustments to these stabilizers may be necessary to counteract severe or prolonged economic downturns, potentially crossing into discretionary fiscal policy territory. Modifications to current automatic stabilizers are discussed in the report, along with estimates of their economic impact. Enacting individual tax relief to boost demand is an option for stimulating the economy, with tax cuts or rebates that are spent having the largest impact. Tax relief targeted at lower- and moderate-income households is seen as effective, but delivering it can be complicated. Careful consideration is needed to ensure that household incomes are increased as soon as possible. Table 1 summarizes the impact of tax policies enacted in response to the Great Recession, including tax rebates for lower- and moderate-income households. The rebates were structured as advanced tax credits based on prior year's income to offset future tax liabilities. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 provided lump-sum rebates to eligible filers. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 provided tax rebates as advanced credits for 2008 taxes, with some refunds for lower-income households. Eligible recipients received checks between July and October of 2001. The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 provided tax rebates to lower-income households, with checks distributed between April and May of 2008. Recipients could receive up to $600 ($1,200 for joint filers) based on their 2007 tax liability. Additional rebates of $300 per child under 17 were also available. An alternative approach was the Making Work Pay tax credit under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, spread over 2009 and 2010. The Making Work Pay (MWP) tax credit was introduced in 2009 and 2010, equal to 6.2% of earned income up to $400 for single filers and $800 for joint filers. It effectively eliminated the Social Security tax on the first $6,450 of a single filer's income and the first $12,900 of joint filers' income. The credit phased out for incomes exceeding $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers) and was not available for incomes over $95,000 ($190,000 for joint filers). The credit benefited lower-income households and expired at the end of 2010. The Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 enacted a payroll tax holiday, reducing workers' share of the Social Security payroll tax by 2 percentage points. The holiday did not benefit the lowest-income workers as much as the Making Work Pay (MWP) tax credit. The holiday was extended twice, ending at the close of 2012, and only assisted individuals who were working. Unemployed individuals received UC benefits, while the MWP tax credit and payroll holiday only helped those who were working. Lowering individual income tax rates could reduce taxes, with the IRS publishing new withholding tables for employers to adjust withholdings. However, an across-the-board tax rate reduction may not have the maximum effect on demand, as targeting lower- and moderate-income households would be more effective for stimulating spending. Tax reductions should target lower- and moderate-income households as their spending is most responsive to increases in after-tax income. An across-the-board income tax rate reduction is not well-targeted to these households, as they pay little to no income taxes and would not benefit much from it. The stimulative effect and cost-effectiveness of an across-the-board rate reduction are low, with the majority of the benefits flowing to higher-income taxpayers. The stimulative effect of an across-the-board income tax rate reduction is low, with most benefits going to higher-income households. Limiting the reduction to lower brackets or making it temporary could help reduce costs, but it would still be relatively expensive compared to other options. Another option for tax relief is reducing taxes on capital gains and dividends. Reducing taxes on capital gains and dividends is a potential option for providing individual tax relief. Currently, these are taxed at rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% based on the individual's tax bracket. Long-term capital gains and dividends receive preferential tax treatment and have been taxed at lower rates since the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The last reduction in these tax rates occurred in 2003 with the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 increased the top tax rate to 20% for high-income individuals, with an additional 3.8% tax on high-income individuals added by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The effectiveness of reducing taxes on capital gains and dividends in stimulating the economy is likely to be small, as the majority of income from these sources goes to taxpayers in the upper income brackets. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 increased top tax rates for high-income individuals. The majority of income from capital gains and dividends goes to taxpayers in the top income brackets. Stimulus measures should focus on increasing demand in the short run and boosting business spending, particularly new investments. Business tax incentives may be considered during recessions to stimulate the economy. Accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits are effective stimulus policies for encouraging new investments during recessions. Expensing allows a business to deduct the full cost of a qualified investment in the year it is purchased, increasing after-tax returns on eligible investments. Accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits are effective stimulus policies for encouraging new investments during recessions. The 2017 tax revision provided expensing for equipment through 2022, followed by a four-year phase-out period. An investment tax credit allows a business to offset its tax liability by a fraction of its investment, but total investment may not be highly responsive to tax incentives due to the nature of large, one-off expenditures involving durable assets. During recessions, investment incentives in stimulus packages are more effective if available for a short period to encourage businesses. Reducing the corporate income tax rate could stimulate new corporate investment, although historically not common in stimulus packages. However, the short-term stimulus effect of a corporate rate reduction is likely to be small compared to other options. Reducing the corporate income tax rate may not provide significant stimulus during a recession due to the long-term nature of investment decisions and the permanent reduction from P.L. 115-97. Allowing net operating losses to be carried back could offer tax relief for businesses experiencing losses. Prior to the 2017 tax revision, businesses could carry losses back to obtain a refund for past taxes paid. Losses were limited to a two-year carryback, temporarily extended to five years during the Great Recession. Businesses prefer carrybacks over carryforwards for immediate benefits. Carryback losses help firms with cash flow problems by providing an infusion of cash. Carryback losses provide firms with cash infusion to withstand economic downturns, benefit from immediate expensing, and stimulate investment. However, the stimulative effects are limited during recessions due to economic uncertainty. To target rising unemployment, a hiring tax credit could be used to reduce the cost of hiring and retaining workers. A hiring tax credit could reduce firms' payroll costs, but targeting effective hiring and retention is challenging. Complex administrative issues have hindered past attempts, leading to skepticism over the policy's effectiveness. The relationship between firms' employment decisions and economic performance limits the impact of hiring incentives during recessions. The government can boost aggregate demand directly with increased spending through various categories like direct payments to households, aid to states, and government purchases of goods and services. Examples include extending UC benefits and increasing SNAP benefits to boost disposable income during economic downturns. Extending UC benefits and increasing SNAP benefits can boost disposable income during economic downturns. Congress has a history of extending UC benefits in response to recessions, which gives unemployed individuals more time to secure employment. Additionally, increasing the benefit amount and providing tax exclusions can further support individuals in distress. The increase in standard deduction reduces the impact of excluding up to $2,400 of unemployment benefits. There is debate on the appropriate extension and enhancement of benefits. SNAP benefits were increased during the Great Recession, boosting food purchasing power for low-income households. The duration of the SNAP benefit increase was initially expected to last until 2018. The duration of the increase in SNAP benefits was shortened to March 31, 2014, and then to October 31, 2013, to offset costs. Aid to states and localities can help support aggregate demand during economic downturns, but balanced-budget requirements limit their ability to implement countercyclical policies. Aid to states and localities is predicted to be moderately effective at combating downturns by maintaining services, taxes, and employment. Aid to states, including Medicaid enhancement and federal infrastructure investment, can support demand during economic downturns by maintaining services, taxes, and employment. ARRA temporarily increased the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) to provide funding for state and local first responders, school systems, and other social policy programs. Government infrastructure investment can help stimulate the economy during economic downturns by offsetting the drop in private sector investment. Examples of infrastructure projects include roads, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, energy grids, and water resource management. While infrastructure investment may not be ideal for mild recessions due to the time it takes to start and complete projects, it can still provide a high return on investment. The United States' recent budget deficits and long-term outlook could impact the size of any stimulus package. The FY2018 real deficit was 3.8% of GDP, higher than the average since FY1969. Real deficits are projected to increase over the next 10 years, with public debt expected to rise from 77.8% of GDP in FY2018 to 92.7% in FY2029. Persistent budget deficits can hinder economic growth by reducing national saving and capital formation. Persistent budget deficits can hinder economic growth by reducing national saving and capital formation, potentially offsetting short-term economic stimulus. High levels of debt relative to GDP can constrain a country's borrowing capacity, but there are no immediate signs of federal borrowing capacity being exhausted. Congress should consider the consequences of fiscal space depletion when designing future stimulus packages to avoid increasing deficits and debt."
