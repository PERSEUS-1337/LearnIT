    "content": "Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated grant funding to states and localities for homeland security purposes since 1996, including the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program established in 1996. This program provided assistance to over 150 cities for biological, chemical, and nuclear security. The 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing spurred the focus on homeland security. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to administer federal homeland security grant programs. The report focuses on homeland security assistance programs for states and localities, addressing policy questions regarding program evolution, administration, and funding levels over the past 20 years. These programs aim to enhance state and local emergency management capabilities and have been administered by various offices and agencies. The Department of Homeland Security has evolved its preparedness grant programs over the years, allowing states and localities to use funding for law enforcement personnel costs such as overtime. This change was made based on DHS's evaluation of risks and threats, as well as at the request of states and localities. The Department of Homeland Security's funding for homeland security programs peaked around FY2009 and has since seen a slight decline. This report summarizes DHS's role in providing assistance, current programs, and policy questions regarding program funding. In 1996, the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act established the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program for defense against weapons of mass destruction. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program (NLD) was established to provide financial assistance to U.S. metropolitan areas for preparing and responding to terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. Initially administered by the Department of Defense, it was later transferred to the Department of Justice, which created the Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to manage NLD. By 2001, 120 cities had received assistance, and a total of 157 cities were trained and funded for protective equipment before the program ended in 2001. ODP was later transferred to the Department of Homeland Security with the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Office of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2002. Initially under the Border and Transportation Security Directorate, it was later moved to the National Preparedness Directorate and currently operates within FEMA's Grants Program Directorate. The DHS is responsible for preparing and responding to terrorist attacks and is the lead agency for homeland security assistance programs. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for preparing and responding to terrorist attacks, as well as man-made or natural disasters. Legislation such as P.L. 110-53 has authorized DHS grants and mandated allocation methodologies. DHS administers various homeland security grant programs, with 10 in FY2016. This report summarizes the programs and activities currently administered by DHS. The FEMA Grants Program Directorate administers 10 preparedness grants to enhance state and local emergency responders' capacity to prevent, respond to, and recover from various incidents. The Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) provides federal funds to states for all hazards preparedness. The EMPG and HSGP grants support state and local emergency preparedness for terrorism and other threats. HSGP consists of three grant programs\u2014SHSP, UASI, and OPSG\u2014to address high-priority preparedness gaps and core capabilities. Jurisdictions must have flexible capabilities to respond to specific threats. Communities require preparedness capabilities to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards. Federal investments are based on capability targets and gaps identified during the THIRA process, assessed in the SPR. THIRA helps assess risks and estimate capability requirements for various organizations and levels of government. UASI supports high-threat urban areas in building capabilities to prevent, protect against, and respond to terrorist attacks. Federal UASI investments are based on recipients' THIRA assessments. OPSG is also involved in enhancing preparedness capabilities. Federal UASI investments are based on recipients' THIRA assessments. OPSG supports cooperation among various law enforcement agencies for border security. IBSGP funds infrastructure security activities to prevent terrorist attacks. IPR supports the nation's rail system with funds for security measures. The NSGP and PSGP programs provide funding support for emergency management capabilities, physical security enhancements, and coordination activities to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. PSGP focuses on building and sustaining core capabilities in maritime port security. The PSGP program focuses on enhancing maritime domain awareness, IED and CBRNE prevention, cybersecurity capabilities, and supporting maritime security risk mitigation projects. The THSGP funds aim to increase tribal abilities to prevent and respond to terrorism, promoting a whole-community approach to security and strengthening cooperation among preparedness partners. The TSGP program supports transportation infrastructure security activities for transit systems to protect against terrorism and increase resilience. DHS grants follow a grant life cycle with four stages: pre-award, grant award, grant program administration, and post-award audit. Appropriations for DHS grant programs from FY2002 to FY2016 are detailed in Figures 3 and 4. The grant life cycle for DHS grants is how federal grants are administered, applied for, and allocated. Debate continues on policy questions related to homeland security assistance for states and localities, even years after the establishment of DHS. Some issues include the purpose and number of assistance programs, the use of grant funding, and the funding level for grant programs. Further oversight hearings and legislation may be needed to address these issues. The analysis of grant programs highlights the range of eligible activities and the discretion exercised by federal agency officials in selecting projects. Questions arise about the purpose and number of DHS grant programs, the balance between all-hazards and terrorism-focused assistance, coordination challenges, and the potential benefits of program consolidation for domestic security. An all-hazards assistance program like EMPG allows funding for various emergencies, including natural disasters and terrorism incidents. SHSG is an example of a terrorism preparedness-focused program. Despite most disasters being natural, homeland security funding mainly focuses on terrorism. The majority of homeland security assistance funding is dedicated to preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks, despite most disasters being natural. Federal preparedness assistance aims to support state and local efforts to build capacity for major events, especially terrorism. Emergency response capabilities for terrorism, man-made, and natural disasters are similar for response and recovery activities but differ for preparedness. First responder actions following a disaster focus on saving lives and mitigating the effects of the disaster, while preparing for a hurricane or natural disaster is different from preparing for a terrorist attack. Preparing for a terrorist attack involves security measures like barriers and counter-intelligence, while preparing for a natural disaster includes planning evacuations and stockpiling supplies. Legislation and directives post-9/11 emphasize terrorism preparedness, suggesting consolidating grants into a block grant program for flexibility. This approach would allow states to address unique threats and risks. The Obama Administration proposed the National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP) in its FY2013 budget request, but Congress denied it due to lack of authorization, detail, and stakeholder participation. The Administration made adjustments in FY2015, but Congress continued to oppose the grant reform proposals. Congress also maintained a provision barring the establishment of the NPGP without explicit congressional authorization. Congress may need to address how DHS's assistance to states and localities is being spent, particularly in evaluating the effectiveness of grant funding for homeland security. Grant recipients are required to audit their fund use, with the Single Audit Act serving as a primary oversight mechanism. The Single Audit Act is a key oversight mechanism for government grants, requiring nonfederal entities spending over $500,000 in federal awards to undergo audits. Auditors assess financial statements, internal controls, and compliance with grant terms or federal regulations. Audits are submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse for public access. Grant recipients must submit audits detailing federal grant expenditures if they spend $500,000 or more in a fiscal year. The Single Audit Act requires nonfederal entities spending over $500,000 in federal awards to undergo audits detailing federal grant expenditures. Audits are submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse annually, but do not necessarily determine if grants help recipients meet national preparedness goals. President George W. Bush issued HSPD\u20138 in 2003, directing DHS to establish measurable readiness priorities and targets for state and local first responder preparedness. Following Hurricane Katrina, the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) was enacted in October 2006, requiring FEMA to develop specific guidelines for preparedness capabilities. In September 2007, DHS published the National Preparedness Guidelines to strengthen national preparedness efforts, guide investments, and establish readiness metrics. President Barack Obama issued Presidential Policy Directive\u20138 (PPD\u20138) in March 2011 to assess the nation's preparedness for responding to major events, particularly acts of terrorism. PPD\u20138 replaced HSPD\u20138 and directed the development of a national preparedness goal and core capabilities. In 2012, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed SHSP, UASI, PSGP, and TSGP grant programs, finding overlap and duplication risks due to funding similar projects like training, planning, equipment, and exercises across different constituencies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found overlap and duplication risks in homeland security grant programs due to funding similar projects across different recipients. Questions remain about the effectiveness of these grants in meeting national preparedness goals, and Congress may need to consider the need for continued federal support given limited resources. Approximately $33 billion has been appropriated for state and local homeland security assistance in the past 13 years. Since 2003, Congress has allocated between $1.4 billion and $3.5 billion annually for state and local homeland security assistance. With over $33 billion allocated in total, some argue that states and localities should take on more responsibility for funding their own projects, potentially leading to a reduction in federal funding. The effectiveness of these grants in meeting national preparedness goals is questioned, with concerns about overlap and duplication in funding similar projects across different recipients. The status quo of maintaining present funding levels for homeland security may be influenced by a state or locality's financial conditions. The ever-changing terrorism threat and the constant risk of natural and man-made disasters are reasons cited for keeping funding levels steady. As new threats emerge, there is a need for updated homeland security capabilities. Some argue that funding should even be increased to address potential rises in natural disasters and associated costs."
