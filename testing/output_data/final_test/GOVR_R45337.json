Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube are now commonly used by Members to engage with their followers and gather opinions on policy issues. This shift towards social media began around 2009, with Members adopting new technologies to communicate more effectively. Members of Congress have embraced various social media platforms to share information and gather opinions on policy issues. Platforms like Instagram have seen increased popularity, while others like Vine have faded into obscurity. As social media platforms evolve, Members of Congress continue to explore new ways to enhance their communication strategies, ultimately improving their ability to connect with constituents. This report examines Member adoption of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Flickr, Google+, Snapchat, Medium, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Periscope, and Tumblr. It evaluates the adoption trends over time and the implications of using multiple platforms for Member communication. Members of Congress have been using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube since 2009. Today, almost all Members have accounts on these platforms, as well as on other social media services. The report analyzes the adoption of established platforms over time and newer platforms in recent Congresses. It also discusses the potential impact of using multiple platforms on Member communication practices and office operations. During the 2016-2017 academic year, CRS partnered with graduate students to analyze social media adoption by Members of Congress. Data on platform adoption were collected by visiting official webpages and searching the internet for accounts. Additionally, data were collected for the first session of the 114th Congress in 2015. The data collected by CRS for the 114th and 115th Congress sessions were used to analyze Member adoption of social media over four years. The analysis treats all Member social media posts as structurally identical, without distinguishing between personal or staff-generated content. The short timeframe covered in the analysis is noted as a limitation, as technology adoption and patterns can change rapidly. In the 114th and 115th Congress sessions, Member adoption of social media was analyzed. The data showed a rapid increase in the number of Members with official Twitter accounts, from 38% in 2009 to 78.7% in 2012. The analysis noted that technology adoption trends can change quickly, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions drawn from the data. In the 114th and 115th Congress sessions, Member adoption of social media was analyzed. Nearly all Members of Congress have accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, with high adoption rates. The percentage of Representatives and Senators with accounts on these platforms has remained consistent between 2015 and 2018. Members of Congress have high adoption rates for social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, with adoption rates between 86% and 94% for Senators. They also use additional platforms such as Instagram, Flickr, Google+, Snapchat, Medium, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Periscope. Among Members of Congress, Instagram, Flickr, and Google+ are the most popular new social media platforms. Instagram is the most widely adopted, with nearly half of House Members and almost 75% of Senators using it in 2018. The adoption of Google+ may indicate a desire to reach a broader audience beyond Facebook and Twitter users. Table 1 shows the percentage of Representatives and Senators who have adopted various social media platforms, including Instagram, Flickr, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Pinterest, Snapchat, Medium, and Vine. Vine was shut down in 2017, and platforms like Periscope, Storify, SoundCloud, and Picasa have low adoption rates among Members of Congress. Medium, Pinterest, and LinkedIn are among the top new platforms used by Senators and Representatives. New social media platforms like Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Periscope have low adoption rates among Members of Congress, possibly due to similarities with more established platforms like Facebook. Snapchat also has limited adoption despite offering unique features. Snapchat is growing in popularity among both the general population and congressional users, with data suggesting a slow increase in the number of Members of Congress using the platform. However, adopting and managing social media presence comes with potential costs, including allocating resources and creating policies for content sharing. Social media platforms can be divided into established ones like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and newer platforms with unique features. Members of Congress generally adopt multiple social media platforms to share information with followers, prioritizing dissemination over interactivity. As of December 2016, almost all Members had adopted at least one platform, with a median of six platforms adopted. Some Members even used up to 10 platforms for official business. In the 114th Congress, Members of Congress adopted multiple social media platforms for official business. A majority had six or more platforms, with some using up to 10. The quartile distribution showed that light users had 0-4 platforms, average users had 5-7, and heavy users had 8 or more. Despite the average Member using six platforms, data suggested that more platforms did not necessarily mean a more active presence. The data shows that Members of Congress adopt multiple social media platforms for official business, with some having up to 10 accounts. However, having more platforms does not necessarily result in a more active presence. Older social media sites like Google+, Flickr, and LinkedIn have a higher rate of \"zombie\" accounts. Members tend to use non-Facebook and non-Twitter accounts to evaluate content but ultimately return to Twitter and Facebook for social media communications due to the complexity of managing multiple platforms. Members of Congress prefer using Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube over other social media sites due to the larger number of American users on these platforms. The choice is influenced by the perceived usefulness of social media technologies for sharing information, with age, gender, and education playing a role. By focusing on these legacy platforms, Representatives and Senators can maximize their reach and connect with followers across multiple demographics. The choice to adopt multiple social media platforms introduces questions about usage, such as what content to post on which platform and how to coordinate messaging across services. Users aim to maximize reach and choices, but not all platforms are ideal for certain content. Deciding on the balance of platforms, posting frequency, and content type is crucial for effective social media utilization. Deciding on the balance of platforms, posting frequency, and content type is crucial for effective social media utilization. Some Members may want to post across multiple platforms for a broader reach, but without proper planning, the type of content may not match each platform's strengths. For example, auto-posting images from Instagram to Twitter used to be seamless until Instagram stopped supporting it, resulting in images being converted into links that often appear cut off. Research suggests that users should tailor content for each social media platform. For example, a Representative hosting a town hall event may want to use Facebook Live for live feeds, Instagram for still photographs, Twitter for brief summaries, YouTube for full videos, and Medium for post-event summaries. This approach can reach a variety of users with different content types, but it requires time, effort, and resources. Using a mix of platform types can help Members of Congress reach a broader audience on social media. They need to have a strategy for the type of content they post, how they engage with users, and which platforms they utilize. A recent study found that social media is often added on to existing plans for Fortune 500 companies, leading them to connect their social media strategies to business strategy. Members of Congress, on the other hand, have representational duties to keep constituents informed about their activities, with past research showing that direct mail communication boosts a Member's saliency within their district, potentially applicable to social media as well. The allocation of resources in congressional offices reflects the priorities of the Member, balancing constituent service, communications, legislative, and oversight responsibilities. The increased use of electronic communications has added pressure on resource allocation decisions, especially regarding social media engagement. The growth of social media staff in congressional offices reflects the increasing importance of electronic media in resource allocation. In the 113th Congress, 16% of Senators had social media staff, which doubled to 32% in the 115th Congress. This trend poses challenges in balancing resources for social media with other office priorities. When using social media for interactive purposes, existing staff levels may not be sufficient to handle timely responses. Consider time commitments when deciding who posts on social media, and establish office policies to align with legislative priorities. All records created by Members of Congress, including social media posts, are their personal property. Social media posts by Members of Congress are not stored on government servers but on private platforms. Congressional guidance on archiving social media posts is lacking, but decisions are based on content rather than format. The Senate Archivist and House Office of Art and Archives offer guidance on archiving, as each Representative and Senator owns their personal records. Members of Congress have the autonomy to decide how to archive their social media posts, with some choosing not to formally archive them due to their public domain status. Others may establish policies for preservation, considering factors like content type, post frequency, and technological best practices. The evolving nature of communication with constituents through various social media platforms adds complexity to archiving decisions. The adoption of multiple social media platforms has implications for archiving congressional history and future studies on Member use of social media. Social media provides a new opportunity to include online correspondence of individual Members for understanding policy development. Accessing personal papers of Members for studying public policy issues is often difficult due to scattered locations. The report focuses on social media adoption by Members of Congress and suggests using machine learning to analyze patterns of social media use. This could provide insight into how Members communicate and share information with constituents. Members of Congress have various platforms available to communicate with constituents, including legacy platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, as well as new platforms like Instagram, Flickr, Google+, Snapchat, Medium, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Periscope, and Tumblr. Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have been widely used by Members of Congress since at least 2009 for sharing text, video, and pictures with constituents. Twitter, founded in 2006, is a social networking service where users can send short messages called \"tweets\" of up to 280 characters. Users can also share videos, photos, and other media, direct messages to others, retweet, use hashtags for easier topic searching, and broadcast live events through Periscope. Facebook, launched in 2004, is the largest social networking service where users create profiles and pages to share content like pictures, videos, and messages. Other users can comment on posts, and privacy settings can limit visibility to specific users. YouTube, founded in 2005 and owned by Google, is a popular video platform that aims to give everyone a voice and show them the world. Users can watch and upload videos without needing an account, but must sign up to post content. Social media platforms are constantly evolving, with Members of Congress using a variety of platforms. Members of Congress use a variety of social media platforms, including Instagram, Flickr, Google+, Snapchat, Medium, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Periscope, and Tumblr, in addition to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Instagram, acquired by Facebook in 2012, allows users to post photos with text captions and edit them with various tools. Flickr, founded in 2004, is a photo library owned by Yahoo! aimed at sharing photos with others. Flickr's goal is to help people share photos and videos. Users get 1,000 GB of free storage. Google+ is Google's social network, allowing users to post photos and updates. Snapchat lets users send short-lived pictures and messages. Medium, launched in 2012, is a platform for sharing content. Medium, founded in 2012 by Twitter cofounder Evan Williams, is a social journalism platform that combines blogging with social media features. LinkedIn, established in 2003, is a professional networking site for connecting with others and potential employers. Pinterest, launched in 2010, allows users to collect and share things they are passionate about online. Pinterest, with over 200 million monthly users, allows users to share visual information through \"pins\" on \"boards.\" Periscope, founded in 2014 and now owned by Twitter, is a live video streaming platform. Tumblr, established in 2007, is a microblogging platform where users can create blogs, post content, and ask anonymous questions."
