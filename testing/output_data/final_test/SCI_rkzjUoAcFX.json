    "content": "We present a meta-learning approach for adaptive text-to-speech (TTS) with few data, using a shared conditional WaveNet core and independent speaker embeddings. The goal is to create a network that can quickly adapt to new speakers with minimal data. Three strategies are introduced and benchmarked: learning speaker embeddings while keeping the core fixed, fine-tuning the entire architecture, and predicting speaker embeddings with a trained neural network encoder. The experiments demonstrate the success of adapting a multi-speaker neural network to new speakers with just a few minutes of audio data. Training a large model with ample data is common in machine learning for tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, and image recognition. However, in text-to-speech (TTS) work, the focus is on few-shot meta-learning to rapidly adapt a prior TTS network for new speakers at deployment time. The goal is not to learn a fixed final model, but a model that can be quickly adapted with minimal data. The goal is to use few data to learn task-dependent parameters for new tasks rapidly in a meta-learning approach. The model has task-dependent and task-independent parameters, with the former discarded for deployment. This approach is inspired by biology's ability to rapidly adapt to new data during lifetimes. In neural networks, parameters introduce flexibility for learning task-independent parameters. Task-dependent parameters are useful for capturing speaker-specific voice styles in adaptive TTS using the WaveNet model. WaveNet BID6 is a generative model for audio waveforms that excels in speech synthesis. A new training procedure allows adaptation to new speakers with just 10 minutes of data. Various methods for adaptive TTS include non-parametric and parametric approaches for efficient synthesis of new voices. The network is trained to predict new speaker embeddings and can generate high-fidelity utterances resembling the vocal characteristics of a demonstration speaker with just a few seconds of recording. Fine-tuning the entire model achieves state-of-the-art results in sample naturalness and voice similarity to target speakers, even across different speech datasets. The generated samples can confuse the state-of-the-art text-independent speaker verification system BID8, reducing the need for hours of high-quality recordings for each new voice style in TTS techniques. WaveNet is an autoregressive model that factorizes the joint probability distribution of a waveform into conditional distributions using the probabilistic chain rule. To train a multi-speaker WaveNet, the conditioning inputs consist of speaker identity, linguistic features, and fundamental frequency values. Reducing the length of the training dataset could be valuable, especially for restoring voices of patients with voice-impairing conditions. The SEA-ALL architecture involves training, adaptation, and inference stages for a WaveNet model with speaker identity, linguistic features, and fundamental frequency values. Speaker embedding vectors are learned to capture voice characteristics for few-shot adaptation. The linguistic features and fundamental frequency values are upsampled for local conditioning variables using a transposed convolutional network. During training, these values are extracted from training utterances and transcripts, while during testing, they are predicted from text. Few-shot meta-learning involves training a prior and adapting to new speaker voice styles, followed by deployment for inference. In this paper, the focus is on inference, which involves training, adaptation, and inference stages for few-shot voice adaptation using multi-speaker WaveNet extensions. Two approaches are presented: non-parametric fine-tuning by adapting speaker embeddings or model parameters, and parametric training of an auxiliary network to predict new speaker embeddings. The WaveNet model is pre-trained on a diverse dataset and then fine-tuned with adaptation data to optimize conditional log-likelihood of generated audio. The method presented in the paper focuses on few-shot voice adaptation using multi-speaker WaveNet extensions. Two approaches are discussed: non-parametric fine-tuning by adapting speaker embeddings or model parameters, and parametric training of an auxiliary network to predict new speaker embeddings. The training processes differ, with the SEA-EMB method optimizing a low-dimensional vector to prevent overfitting. The method presented in the paper focuses on few-shot voice adaptation using multi-speaker WaveNet extensions. The SEA-ALL approach has more parameters that may overfit, so 10% of demonstration data is held out for early termination. Initializing e with SEA-EMB's optimal value improves generalization performance. An auxiliary encoder network can predict an embedding vector for a new speaker using their demonstration data. Training includes a randomly selected demonstration utterance from each speaker. The full WaveNet model and encoder network are trained together. The SEA-ENC approach involves training the full WaveNet model and encoder network together from scratch, with the advantage of being trained in a transcription-independent setting. However, the learned encoder may introduce bias due to limited network capacity, affecting its ability to leverage additional training compared to statistical methods. Inputs like linguistic features and fundamental frequencies contain speaker-specific information, such as voice pitch in the fundamental frequency sequence. To address speaker dependency in fundamental frequency sequence, normalization is applied for speaker independence during training. Few-shot learning is a key challenge in machine learning, tackled using deep neural networks for promising results in vision and language tasks. This approach can also be beneficial in reinforcement learning. Few-shot learning is addressed in reinforcement learning through meta-learning, which enables machines to learn rapidly from limited data. Model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) is an alternative approach that has shown promise in robotics. Generative modeling also explores few-shot learning through various perspectives like matching networks and variable inference. In the study, the focus is on extending the autoregressive WaveNet model to few-shot learning for adapting to new speakers. Previous attempts using attention models and MAML failed to learn informative speaker embeddings. The goal is to develop neural TTS models that can be trained end-to-end without hand-crafted representations. Recent neural TTS models like Tacotron 2 and DeepVoice have introduced multi-speaker variations to adapt to new speakers. While these models have shown high-quality results for known speakers, generalizing to new speakers with only a few seconds of audio remains a challenge. Various works, including the VoiceLoop model, are addressing this few-shot learning problem. The VoiceLoop model and BID40 addressed few-shot learning by introducing memory-based architectures for voice style adaptation. BID40 extended Tacotron for one-shot speaker adaptation using a speaker embedding vector. DeepVoice 3 also considered predicting embeddings and fitting them based on adaptation data. Evaluation of generated utterances included measuring naturalness and similarity using Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The study evaluates the similarity of generated and real samples using MOS test and a speaker verification system. Different adaptation dataset sizes are studied using a WaveNet model trained on a high-quality audiobook corpus. The naturalness of adapted voices is measured using a 5-scale MOS score on LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets. The few-shot model performance is evaluated on two hold-out datasets. The study evaluates the similarity of generated and real samples using MOS test and a speaker verification system. Different adaptation dataset sizes are studied using a WaveNet model trained on a high-quality audiobook corpus. The naturalness of adapted voices is measured using a 5-scale MOS score on LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets. Two hold-out datasets are used for evaluating few-shot model performance, including LibriSpeech test corpus and a subset of the CSTR VCTK corpus BID43. The WaveNet model was trained on LibriSpeech data and evaluated on VCTK dataset, showing effective generalization with undetectable artifacts. Synthetic utterances are available on the demo webpage. Evaluation includes a MOS test for naturalness rating. Adaptation time varies for different methods. The study compares few-shot TTS systems with varying adaptation dataset sizes. The best few-shot model achieves an MOS score of 4.13 using only 5 minutes of data from LibriSpeech. Fine-tuning models produce \"good\" samples for both LibriSpeech and VCTK test sets. The study compares few-shot TTS systems with varying adaptation dataset sizes, achieving good samples for both LibriSpeech and VCTK test sets. SEA-ALL outperforms SEA-EMB in all cases, with state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Additional adaptation data beyond 10 seconds improves performance on LibriSpeech but not VCTK, with a wider gap between the best model and real utterances on VCTK possibly due to different recording conditions. Voice similarity is a key evaluation metric for the voice adaptation problem. The study evaluates voice adaptation using a MOS test for subjective assessment and a speaker verification model for objective evaluation. Results show that the SEA-ALL model outperforms others, with improved performance on VCTK dataset with an average score of 3.97. The VCTK dataset achieved an average score of 3.97, showing good generalization performance. The BID40 system, on the other hand, achieved lower scores when trained on LibriSpeech. The model computes embeddings based on d-vectors, similar to the SEA-ENC approach, and performs well for one-shot learning but saturates with 5 seconds of adaptation data. There is a gap in similarity scores between SEA-ALL and real utterances, indicating that humans can distinguish between them. The TI-SV model of BID8 is used to assess if the generated samples preserve the speakers' acoustic features. The TI-SV model of BID8 is used to assess if the generated samples preserve the speakers' acoustic features. The generated samples show clear clusters with a large inter-cluster distance and low intra-cluster separation, making it easy to identify the speaker but difficult to differentiate real from synthetic samples. The method presented in this paper generates voices that are more indistinguishable from real ones. In the following subsections, the analysis continues on the generated utterances using samples from LibriSpeech and VCTK. The speaker verification process involves selecting enrollment and verification sets, computing cosine similarity between vectors, and setting a threshold for acceptance. Experiments are repeated with different data size settings. The study compares adaptation methods using different data sizes for speaker verification. Results show that SEA-ALL outperforms other approaches, with error rates decreasing as demonstration data size increases. Notably, SEA-ALL achieves lower error rates than real utterances on LibriSpeech. The study compares adaptation methods for speaker verification, with SEA-ALL performing better than SEA-ENC. More demonstration data has a less significant impact on both models. Comparisons are made between generated and real utterances, showing SEA-ALL performing best. In an adversarial scenario for speaker verification, SEA-ALL confuses the system by generating synthetic samples that are indistinguishable from real utterances, especially for the VCTK dataset. The ROC curve approaches the diagonal line, indicating the system fails to separate real and generated voices. This paper explores meta-learning for adaptive TTS on the VCTK dataset, achieving impressive performance with minimal new speaker data. The model matches state-of-the-art naturalness with a few minutes of adaptation and outperforms in voice similarity. Generated samples show similar voice quality to real utterances. The paper discusses adapting text-to-speech models to new voices using clean, high-quality training data. It highlights the potential for both beneficial and harmful applications of this technology, emphasizing the need for further research to prevent misuse. The encoding network in the study consists of two sub-networks: a pre-trained speaker verification model and a 1-D convolutional network. The first sub-network maps waveform sequences to a fixed 256-dimensional d-vector, while the second sub-network reduces temporal resolution and extracts residual speaker information from waveforms. The study involves an encoding network that includes a pre-trained speaker verification model and a 1-D convolutional network to extract residual speaker information from waveforms. DET and ROC curves are provided for speaker verification models with different training data sizes, showing the detection error trade-off and the ability to distinguish real from generated utterances."
