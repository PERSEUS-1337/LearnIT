    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The Act is titled the \"Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box Act\" and findings show serious fiscal problems with the trust funds associated with Social Security and Medicare Part A, with projected depletion of funds by 2033. The Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund assets will be exhausted by 2024, urging action to protect solvency. Social Security and Medicare aim to provide stability for older Americans to live in dignity. Protecting future surpluses of trust funds is crucial for ensuring the stability and dignity of older Americans. Meaningful reform by Congress is necessary to secure the future surpluses and ensure solvency. SEC. 2. INTERIM PROTECTIONS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND SURPLUS. Section 201(d) of the Social Security Act is amended to establish a Social Security Surplus Protection Account in the Trust Fund. The Managing Trustee will transfer amounts equivalent to the social security surplus for each fiscal year after 2013 to this Account. The Managing Trustee will transfer social security surplus amounts to the Account based on estimates, with adjustments made for any prior overestimates or underestimates. The term 'social security surplus' refers to the excess of taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on wages reported to the Treasury Secretary. The Secretary of the Treasury determines taxes on wages and self-employment income reported to them, applying the applicable rates of tax under the Internal Revenue Code, with adjustments for specified amounts. The balance in the Account is not available for investment by the Managing Trustee. The Managing Trustee cannot invest the balance in the Account. Starting from the first fiscal year after 2013, if a new law allows investments in assets other than US obligations, Trust Fund assets can be transferred to the Treasury's general fund. SEC. 3. INTERIM PROTECTIONS FOR MEDICARE PART A TRUST FUND SURPLUS. SEC. 3. INTERIM PROTECTIONS FOR MEDICARE PART A TRUST FUND SURPLUS. In General, Section 1817(c) of the Social Security Act is amended to establish a Medicare Surplus Protection Account in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The Managing Trustee shall transfer amounts equivalent to the Medicare part A surplus for each fiscal year after fiscal year 2013 to the Account. The Managing Trustee will transfer estimated amounts to the Account based on Medicare part A surplus calculations. Adjustments will be made for any prior overestimations or underestimations. The Treasury calculates taxes on wages and self-employment income reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. This is compared to benefits paid from the Trust Fund and authorized amounts from the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund balance in the Account is not available for investment by the Managing Trustee. For fiscal years starting from 2013, if a Federal law allows investment in assets other than US obligations, Trust Fund assets may be transferred to the Treasury's general fund. The Act is considered a provision of Federal law meeting the requirements of the Social Security Act. SEC. 4. SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE PART A INVESTMENT COMMISSION.
