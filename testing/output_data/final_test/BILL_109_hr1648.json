    "content": "Executive Order 12898, addressing environmental justice in minority and low-income populations, remains in effect until changed by law. This Act applies to the provisions of the executive order. Additional provisions related to environmental justice are also included. Environmental justice, as defined in Executive Order 12898, ensures fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, education, or income in environmental laws and policies. It aims to provide minority and low-income communities with access to public health and environmental information, preventing them from bearing a disproportionate burden of pollution impacts. Communities defined for Executive Order 12898's environmental justice criteria include demographic characteristics like minority and low-income percentages, health vulnerabilities (e.g., cancer rates, infant mortality), and environmental conditions (e.g., facility density, proximity to Superfund sites). Offices of Environmental Justice are to be established. The Executive Order 12898 requires the establishment of Offices of Environmental Justice in various government departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, Department of Agriculture, Department of Transportation, and others. Each agency designated by the President, including the Office of the Deputy Assistant to the President for Environmental Policy and the National Economic Council, must integrate environmental justice strategies into their operations. This includes addressing compliance with the Act in rulemaking activities, guidance development, and environmental reviews. The interagency Federal Working Group on Environmental Justice coordinates training, public participation, surveys, strategy development, and communication of research results for Federal agencies and offices. The Federal agencies listed in subsection (c) are required to carry out outreach activities to the Working Group, including responding to inquiries, maintaining websites, producing multimedia products, conducting briefings and press conferences, testifying before government bodies, and providing financial support for scholarships and internships. The Federal agencies are required to support various activities such as finance scholarships, fellowships, and internships, sponsor museum exhibits, contribute to meetings, provide content for K-12 education, and fund outreach efforts managed outside the Federal Government. Stakeholders, including affected communities, governments, environmental organizations, nonprofit organizations, and academic institutions, are encouraged to actively participate in environmental decision-making through enhanced partnerships and coordination with Federal agencies and the Working Group. Community Technology Centers are funded by Federal agencies to provide technical assistance in environmental justice issues. These centers aim to offer at least 10 hours of open access a week to help communities, especially those in low-income urban and rural areas, address environmental hazards. Community technology centers are located in various places like libraries, community centers, schools, and provide technical assistance to communities affected by hazardous waste contamination. They help community members participate in cleanup and environmental development activities. The community technology centers offer workshops, training, and technical assistance materials to educate community members on basic science, environmental policy, facilitation, and conflict resolution. They also tailor materials to meet the specific needs of each community."
