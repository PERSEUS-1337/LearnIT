    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Low-Income Housing Revitalization Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The Congress finds that the United States is facing a crisis due to the decline of affordable housing, with new construction for low- and moderate-income families stalled. A 1989 report states that 12.4 million housing units occupied by people in poverty, with 18% being substandard. By 1995, up to 900,000 federally subsidized low-income rental units could be lost, and existing low-income housing units are disappearing as older buildings are replaced with higher-priced rental units. Federal expenditures for low- and moderate-income housing declined significantly from 1981 to 1989, leading to a shortage of affordable housing. The possibility of homelessness for many Americans is increasing due to the lack of rehabilitation of existing low-income housing units and the construction of new units. The rise in ill-housed and homeless families is partly due to displacement caused by the gentrification of formerly low-income housing. The Act aims to encourage the development of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families by providing incentives for the rehabilitation and construction of low-income rental units. It also seeks to address the issue of owners claiming tax deductions without making necessary repairs to meet building codes. The Act aims to encourage the development of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families by providing incentives for the rehabilitation and construction of low-income rental units. It also addresses the issue of owners violating health, safety, and building codes in substandard rental housing units. The Act focuses on improving low-income housing credit to encourage affordable housing development for low- and moderate-income families. The Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to permanently extend section 42 and increase the credit for federally subsidized new buildings. It also exempts low-income housing credit from passive loss limitations and specifies effective dates for the amendments. The amendments made by subsections (b) and (c) apply to property placed in service after December 31, 1992. SEC. 4. ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION SCHEDULE FOR QUALIFIED RENTAL HOUSING. Amends section 168(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to change the depreciation recovery period for residential rental property placed in service after December 31, 1992. The amendment changes the depreciation recovery period for low-income residential rental property to 20 years and for other residential rental property to 27.5 years. Definitions for low-income and other residential rental properties are provided in the amendment. The amendments made by this section apply to property placed in service after December 31, 1992. SEC. 5. DISALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTIONS FOR EXPENSES RELATED TO SUBSTANDARD RENTAL HOUSING. This section adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code disallowing deductions for expenses related to substandard rental housing. SEC. 280I prohibits deductions for expenses related to substandard rental housing unless the unit is suitable for occupancy as per regulations. Effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 1992. SEC. 6. EXEMPTION FROM PASSIVE LOSS LIMITATION FOR CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS RELATING TO QUALIFIED RENTAL HOUSING. SEC. 6 amends subsection (e) of section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code to provide special rules for deductions related to rental real estate activities in which the taxpayer actively participates. It exempts certain deductions under sections 162, 163, or 164 for amounts paid during the taxable year with respect to qualified rental real estate activities. The taxpayer's income from qualified rental real estate activities is reduced by certain deductions to determine the applicability of other deductions. Qualified rental real estate activity refers to rental real estate activities related to a qualified low-income housing project in which the taxpayer actively participates. The amendment to section 469(j) of the Code relates to the allocation of passive activity loss and credit. It includes changes to the passive activity credit, the $25,000 amount under subsection (i), and adjustments for certain circumstances. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 1992."
