    "content": "President Trump signed the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 into law on December 20, 2018. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will implement the provisions in 2019. The 2018 farm bill includes 12 titles covering various program areas, with Title I focusing on commodities. This report outlines the major revenue support programs in Title I and reviews changes to administrative provisions. Appendices provide comparisons of provisions with prior law. Most grain and oilseed crops in the US are eligible for revenue support under Title I of the 2018 farm bill, excluding specialty crops. The support includes the Marketing Assistance Loan program and either the Price Loss Coverage or Agricultural Risk Coverage programs for additional revenue protection. The 2018 farm bill extends support programs for grain and oilseed crops through crop year 2023, including the Marketing Assistance Loan program, Price Loss Coverage, and Agricultural Risk Coverage. Separate federal farm programs support the sugar and dairy sectors, while disaster assistance is available for tree crops and livestock. The Noninsured Crop Assistance Program covers agricultural commodities not included in federal crop insurance. The 2018 farm bill extends support programs for grain and oilseed crops through crop year 2023, with modifications. The Secretary of Agriculture can make direct payments under the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. Programs like the Cotton Ginning Cost Share and Market Facilitation Program have been implemented. Title I program commodities and over 100 other crops are eligible for subsidized crop insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The 2018 farm bill includes Title XI\u2014Crop Insurance, which makes minor adjustments. The 2018 farm bill includes Title XI\u2014Crop Insurance, which makes minor adjustments to program implementation but does not alter the underlying authority of the federal crop insurance program. Federal farm support began in the 1930s to raise farm household income during low commodity prices. Support programs have shifted from supply control to decoupled revenue support based on historical program acres. Proponents argue federal involvement in farm revenue support programs is necessary to stabilize incomes by shifting production risks to the government. Critics claim these programs waste taxpayer dollars, distort producer behavior, and harm smaller domestic and foreign farmers. The USDA operates farm revenue support programs in lower-income foreign nations through three permanent laws. Congress updates these laws through omnibus farm bills to address market conditions and budget constraints. If a new farm bill is not enacted, programs would revert to higher support levels under permanent law, which is not compatible with current economic objectives and global trading rules. The 2018 farm bill (P.L. 115-334) supersedes previous farm bills and includes a provision suspending price support provisions for certain crops until 2023. Federal support exists for about two dozen farm commodities, with six crops accounting for 92% of program payments. Covered commodities eligible for farm revenue support programs include wheat, oats, barley, corn, and grain sorghum. The 2018 farm bill includes provisions for various commodities such as wheat, oats, barley, corn, grain sorghum, long-grain rice, medium-grain rice, seed cotton, pulse crops, soybeans, other oilseeds, and peanuts. Upland cotton regained covered commodity status through seed cotton under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Loan commodities include covered commodities, upland cotton, extra-long-staple cotton, wool, mohair, and honey, eligible for the MAL program with statutory loan rates. Commodities eligible for the MAL program have statutory loan rates (Table 1). Milk production is supported through subsidized protection for producer milk margins under the Dairy Margin Coverage program. Sugar support is indirect through import quotas, processor price guarantees, and domestic marketing allotments. Livestock, poultry, fruits, vegetables, nuts, hay, and nursery products are not eligible for Title I revenue support. Livestock and fruit tree producers may qualify for relief from natural disaster losses. Federal crop insurance is available for over 100 crops, including fruits and vegetables. Federal crop insurance covers over 100 crops, including fruits, vegetables, and selected livestock activities not supported by Title I farm programs. It is designed to protect against natural disasters, disease, and price or revenue declines within a season. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program is available for crops not covered by crop insurance. The definition of a farm for program payment purposes differs from common perceptions based on size or output, as defined by the USDA's Farm Service Agency regulations. A farm is considered one or more tracts of land that are operated separately, and registration with USDA is required for each farm operation. Land in a farm does not need to be contiguous. Base acres represent historical planted acreage on each FSA farm for program payment calculations under PLC or ARC. USDA reported 273 million base acres in 2015, with 254 million acres enrolled in ARC or PLC. Base acres are tied to the land and transfer to new owners, making them eligible for farm programs. Base acres on a farm can increase or decrease based on various factors such as conservation contracts, easements, or planting flexibility rules under the PLC and ARC programs. Eligible payment acreage is reduced if fruits, vegetables, or wild rice are planted in excess of certain limits. The calculation of base acres for farm programs like ARC or PLC is one-for-one for every acre in excess of certain percentages. Participation in farm programs is not mandatory for farms with base acres, but conservation compliance is required. Changes to base acre calculations were made under the 2014 farm bill and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Program payments may not align with financial losses due to potential differences between actual plantings and base acres. The 2014 farm bill allowed farmers to update crop base acres to better match actual plantings, but disparities between base and planted acres still existed. Upland cotton was removed from ARC and PLC program eligibility due to a World Trade Organization ruling. Former cotton base acres were renamed. The 2018 farm bill made changes to base acres, including renaming former cotton base acres to \"generic base\" and allowing producers to allocate them to seed cotton or other covered commodities for potential payments under ARC or PLC programs. Upland cotton remained ineligible for PLC or ARC directly but could indirectly benefit through seed cotton. The 2018 farm bill made changes to base acres, renaming former cotton base acres to \"generic base\" and allowing allocation to seed cotton or other covered commodities for potential ARC or PLC payments. Base acres continuously planted to grass or pasture from 2009-2017 are ineligible for ARC or PLC payments during 2019-2023 but can be counted for future farm bills. Producers eligible for revenue support programs include owner-operators, landlords, tenants, or sharecroppers who share crop risks. Compliance with program requirements is necessary for eligibility. To be eligible for program payments, individuals must be actively engaged in farming, comply with conservation requirements, and meet adjusted gross income thresholds. Legal entities can also qualify if members collectively contribute labor or management. Landowners may be considered actively engaged if they receive income from the farm without providing labor or management. Adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold for program eligibility is $900,000 for combined farm and nonfarm AGI. Waivers may be granted for environmentally sensitive land. Producers on farms with 10 acres or less of base acres are ineligible for payments, except for beginning farmers, veteran farmers, and ranchers. Rental arrangements for farmland are common, with 39% of farmland rented in 2014, mostly owned by non-operator landlords. Under cash rental contracts, tenants pay fixed rent to landlords, who do not bear production risk and are ineligible for program payments. Government payments increase land rental value, benefiting landlords. Share rental contracts involve tenants providing labor and machinery, while landlords supply land and possibly management. The MAL program, in existence since the 1930s, provides short-term financing and a guaranteed floor price to producers through nonrecourse nine-month loans. These loans are based on commodity-specific rates for qualifying crops, known as loan commodities. The program's benefits are tied directly to harvested output. The Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program offers producers short-term financing and a guaranteed floor price through nonrecourse nine-month loans based on commodity-specific rates. Participation does not require pre-planting signup or ownership of base acres, but a harvested crop is needed as collateral. Producers can avoid selling into a weak market by using their crop as collateral for a loan valued at a fixed rate. The Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program offers producers short-term financing with a guaranteed floor price through nonrecourse nine-month loans based on commodity-specific rates. Producers can reclaim their collateral crops to sell at higher prices or forfeit them to USDA if market prices are below the loan rate, establishing a price guarantee. Additional choices for claiming MAL benefits are available under the 2018 farm bill. In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, producers often forfeited crops to USDA instead of repaying MAL loans at higher rates, leading to government-held stocks and market oversupply. Congress redesigned the MAL program in the 1980s and 1990s to prevent stock accumulation by offering alternative repayment prices. Producers can now compare repayment prices with loan rates before selecting from various program benefits. In the farm bill, a producer with a commodity under an MAL loan has repayment options based on USDA-announced rates. Options include Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP), Marketing Loan Gain (MLG), and Commodity Certificate Exchange. The MAL program offers repayment options for producers, including Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP), Marketing Loan Gain (MLG), Commodity Certificate Exchange, and Forfeiture. Producers can use commodity certificates to repay MAL loans at lower USDA-announced prices and keep price gains. The 2018 farm bill raised MAL loan rates for various commodities. The MAL program's usefulness as a risk management and marketing tool varies across program crops depending on the relationship between farm prices and statutory loan rates. Under the 2018 farm bill, MAL benefits are no longer subject to annual payment limits. MAL gains under commodity certificates and forfeiture were excluded from payment limits under the previous 2014 farm bill. PLC and ARC provide income support to covered commodities at levels above the price protection offered by the MAL program's loan rates. The 2018 farm bill extends ARC and PLC programs with modifications to increase producer flexibility. Participation is free, but producers must own or rent base acres and elect ARC or PLC for historical base acres. Payments are decoupled from harvested crops and proportional to base acres. Producers choose between PLC for price protection or ARC for revenue protection. PLC payments are triggered when the national market-year average farm price is below the effective reference price. Under the 2018 farm bill, producers can choose between PLC for price protection or ARC for revenue protection. ARC payments are triggered when crop revenue falls below the guaranteed level based on historical data, while PLC payments are triggered when the market price is below the effective reference price. Producers had a one-time choice between ARC and PLC under the 2014 farm bill, but the 2018 bill allows for more frequent program changes. Producers can select ARC or PLC coverage for crop years 2019 and 2020 on a commodity-by-commodity basis. Under the 2018 farm bill, producers can choose between PLC for price protection or ARC for revenue protection. Producers had a one-time choice between ARC and PLC for crop years 2019 and 2020, with the default being the program in effect during crop years 2015 through 2018. Starting in 2021, producers can annually choose between ARC and PLC for crop years 2021, 2022, and 2023 on a commodity-by-commodity basis. Additionally, producers can now electronically sign contracts for ARC and PLC. PLC payments are based on a fixed reference price and may be temporarily increased under certain conditions. The 2018 farm bill introduced an \"effective reference price\" for covered commodities, which can increase up to 115% of the statutory PLC reference price based on market conditions. PLC payments are made when the Market Year Average Price (MYAP) is below the effective reference price. The total PLC payments for a covered commodity are calculated based on the PLC per-unit payment rate and the PLC per-acre payment rate. The PLC total payment is determined by the PLC per-acre payment rate multiplied by 85% of base acres for the covered commodity. Payment yields under the PLC program are historical farm-level measures used for program payments. Producers had the option to update payment yields under the 2002, 2014, and 2018 farm bills, with the 2014 bill allowing updates based on 90% of average yields for 2008-2012 crop years. Under the 2018 farm bill, producers could update program yields using 90% of the average yield per planted acre for the 2013-2017 crop years. Unlike the 2014 farm bill, the 2018 update was subject to a commodity-specific adjustment factor to accommodate any national increase in trend yield. Producers could also use a \"plug\" yield in the calculation if the farm-level yield was less than 75% of the average county yield for a covered commodity during the 2013-2017 crop years. Under the 2018 farm bill, producers could update program yields using 90% of the average yield per planted acre for the 2013-2017 crop years. The yield update election must be made for the 2020 crop year. Producers can choose the county ARC program (ARC-CO) for revenue protection or the farm-level \"individual\" ARC (ARC-IC) program for farm-level revenue protection. ARC-CO triggers payments when county revenue is less than 86% of the recent five-year average, while ARC-IC provides a whole-farm revenue guarantee based on farm-level yields. The ARC-CO program provides a county revenue guarantee, with payments triggered by a crop revenue loss at the county level. The payment rate is capped at 10% of benchmark revenue, with producers absorbing the first 14% of any shortfall and the government absorbing the next 10%. The ARC-CO program offers a county revenue guarantee with payments triggered by crop revenue loss. Producers absorb the first 14% of any shortfall, and the government covers the next 10%. Losses can be backstopped by crop insurance or the MAL program. ARC-CO payment formula is based on payment rate, 85%, and base acres. Discrepancies in county-level payments were found in 2015 due to average county yield calculations. Under the 2018 farm bill, there was a debate about prioritizing RMA yield data over NASS data for ARC-CO calculations to minimize payment discrepancies. RMA yields were often higher than NASS yields at the county level, leading to lower payments in counties using RMA data. Congress aimed to address this issue by making RMA data the primary source for county average yield calculations for ARC-CO benchmark revenue. If RMA data are unavailable, USDA will consider NASS data or yield history from representative farms. The 2018 farm bill prioritizes RMA yield data over NASS data for ARC-CO calculations to minimize payment discrepancies. ARC-CO uses trend-adjusted yield for benchmark revenue, with modifications allowing separate yield calculations for irrigated and non-irrigated land. Payments are based on the farm's physical location, with up to 25 counties nationwide allowed to subdivide for yield calculations. The 2018 farm bill prioritizes RMA yield data over NASS data for ARC-CO calculations to minimize payment discrepancies. ARC-CO allows farmers to select a farm-level revenue guarantee based on a five-year moving average of farm-level yields for each crop year. The individual ARC payment formula is 65% times the number of total base acres for the farm multiplied by the difference between the whole-farm revenue guarantee and the actual whole-farm crop revenue. The 2018 farm bill prioritizes RMA yield data for ARC-CO calculations. Participating farmers do not need to plant or harvest a covered commodity to receive PLC or ARC payments. Payments are made on a portion of enrolled base acres rather than actual production, with a lag of approximately one year for USDA calculations. USDA is required to announce payments within 30 days after the end of each marketing year, with actual payments not made before October 1. The 2018 farm bill sets a $125,000 cap on combined PLC and ARC payments per person for all covered commodities except peanuts. Sequestration reductions must be applied before payment limit criteria are evaluated. The 2018 farm bill removed MAL program payments from payment limit criteria. Payment limits can be doubled for farm operators with a spouse. Family members over 18 on family farming operations are eligible for separate payment limits. The definition of family farm now includes cousins, nephews, and nieces. Producers of upland cotton can benefit from economic adjustment assistance and cotton storage cost reimbursements under the 2018 farm bill provisions. Economic adjustment assistance payments of $0.03 per pound are provided to domestic users of upland cotton monthly. A portion of the payment may indirectly benefit producers through increased demand. Cotton storage cost reimbursement, known as a storage credit, reduces loan repayment rates by offsetting storage costs. This reimbursement does not involve CCC budgetary outlay but reduces potential receipts from the CCC budget. Availability of the storage credit is based on the relationship between MAL rate, world price, and accrued costs. The MAL rate for upland cotton intersects with farm programs like ARC and PLC. Producers choosing PLC can get additional price protection with Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO). SCO covers part of the deductible on the producer's crop insurance policy. Dairy and sugar programs in the 2018 farm bill differ from MAL, PLC, and ARC programs. Dairy and sugar program benefits are not subject to per-person payment limits. The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program offers milk producers price margin protection levels based on historical milk production. It differs from other Title I commodities in output, processing, and markets. Dairy and sugar programs are discussed briefly here but in more detail in other reports. The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program offers milk producers price margin protection levels based on USDA-announced prices for milk and feed ingredients. Producers choose coverage levels and pay a premium based on milk production and margin protection thresholds. The 2018 farm bill revised the program, lowering premium rates for the first 5 million pounds of milk coverage and expanding the range of margin protection levels. The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program, authorized through December 31, 2023, offers milk producers price margin protection levels based on USDA-announced prices for milk and feed ingredients. Producers can now cover up to 95% of their historical base production with slightly higher premiums. Additionally, dairy producers may receive a 25% discount on premiums if they lock in coverage levels for the entire five years of the program. They can also apply for reimbursement of premiums paid during calendar years 2014-2017. Unlike the previous program, DMC allows producers to participate in both margin coverage and the Livestock Gross Margin-Dairy insurance program. The sugar program under the 2018 farm bill saw a 5% increase in the MAL rate for raw cane and refined beet sugar. U.S. producers of sugar and milk benefit from import protection under tariff-rate quotas, with costs borne by domestic consumers. The U.S. government provides sugar TRQ protection valued at over $1.4 billion annually without federal outlays. Four disaster assistance programs in the 2014 farm bill offer federal aid to livestock and tree crop producers affected by natural disasters like drought and floods. The Livestock Indemnity Program compensates producers for livestock losses at 75% of market value under specific conditions. The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) and Tree Assistance Program (TAP) provide payments to eligible livestock producers and orchardists/nursery growers, respectively, for grazing losses and tree damage caused by natural disasters. The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) offers payments for losses due to specific events like disease or insect infestation. The 2018 farm bill expanded ELAP to include Indian tribes, increased payments for livestock losses, and removed payment limits. LFP is now subject to a $125,000 per-person payment limit. NAP is available for all agricultural commodities. The 2018 farm bill amended NAP by increasing signup fees and expanding eligibility to include crops covered by certain crop insurance plans. It also adjusted payment calculations to consider the producer's share of the crop, offering catastrophic and buy-up coverage options. The 2018 farm bill made changes to farm commodity and disaster programs, including permanent buy-up coverage, separate payment limits, and increased spending projections. Annual outlays for PLC and ARC are estimated to be $4.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, compared to $1.8 billion and $3.3 billion under the 2014 farm bill. ARC enrollment preference for corn, soybeans, and wheat led to larger payment outlays. The 2018 farm bill projects a shift in participation from ARC to PLC, resulting in larger annual outlays under PLC ($4.1 billion per year) compared to ARC ($1.2 billion per year) for crop years 2019-2023. This shift is driven by projections of farm prices tracking near or below PLC reference prices, leading to greater potential for PLC payments. The 2018 farm bill projects a shift in participation from ARC to PLC, resulting in larger annual outlays under PLC compared to ARC for crop years 2019-2023. The BBA made substantial changes to the dairy program and the treatment of cotton under the PLC and ARC programs.
