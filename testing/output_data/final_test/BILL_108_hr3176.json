    "content": "The \"Ojito Wilderness Act\" designates the Ojito Wilderness in New Mexico under the Secretary of the Interior. The Act includes definitions for terms like Pueblo, State, and Wilderness. The \"Ojito Wilderness Act\" designates approximately 11,183 acres of land in the Albuquerque District-Bureau of Land Management, New Mexico, as wilderness. The map and legal description of the Wilderness will be filed by the Secretary with the Senate and House Committees. The Wilderness designated by the \"Ojito Wilderness Act\" will be managed by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. Newly acquired land, if added, will also be managed under this Act and relevant laws. The Mexico Principal Meridian designates land within the Wilderness boundaries to be added if the US acquires access to a specific section. Lands designated for release have been studied for wilderness designation and are no longer subject to certain management requirements. Grazing of livestock in the Wilderness is allowed. The Wilderness Act allows grazing of livestock in designated areas, fish and wildlife jurisdiction remains with the State, existing water rights are unaffected, and certain lands are withdrawn subject to valid existing rights. The Pueblo acquired land is withdrawn from public land laws, mining laws, and mineral leasing laws. The Secretary will seek to exchange State land within the Wilderness boundaries within 3 years. SEC. 4. LAND HELD IN TRUST. The United States will transfer lands to the Pueblo of Zia, depicted on a map as \"BLM Lands Authorized to be Acquired by the Pueblo of Zia,\" to be held in trust for the Pueblo as part of their Reservation. The boundary of the acquired lands will be 100 feet from certain roads. Consideration will be provided for the conveyance of these lands. The Pueblo of Zia will pay the fair market value for the lands conveyed by the Secretary, determined by an independent appraisal. The payment will be available to the Secretary for acquiring land from willing sellers in the State. The declaration of trust and conveyance under subsection (a) allows public access to the land for various uses, subject to regulations for land management and preservation of natural characteristics. The Secretary must ensure protection of these rights and establish a process for resolving complaints. The land conveyed under subsection (a) must be maintained as open space with preserved natural characteristics. Prohibited uses include motorized vehicles, mineral extraction, housing, gaming, and commercial enterprises. Existing rights of way and access for customary construction are not affected by this section. The Pueblo must maintain land acquired under subsection (a) as open space with preserved natural characteristics. Prohibited uses include motorized vehicles, mineral extraction, housing, gaming, and commercial enterprises. The Pueblo shall grant reasonable requests for rights-of-way for utilities and pipelines over designated land. Rights-of-way issued or renewed over authorized land shall be administered according to rules. The Department of the Interior's rules and regulations, including the Rio Puerco Resources Management Plan, must be followed for rights-of-way administration. Judicial relief can be sought in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico to enforce subsection (d) without the Pueblo asserting sovereign immunity. No civil action for money damages, costs, or attorneys fees is authorized against the Pueblo. The curr_chunk states that a civil action cannot be brought against the Pueblo for money damages, costs, or attorneys fees, unless provided for in paragraph (2) which abrogates the Pueblo's sovereign immunity."
