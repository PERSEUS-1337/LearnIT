    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Amendments Act of 1996\". It addresses leaking underground storage tanks. The \"Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Amendments Act of 1996\" amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to distribute funds from the Trust Fund to States for various purposes related to corrective actions and enforcement of programs. The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Amendments Act of 1996 authorizes State and local governments to enforce approved programs, corrective actions, and compensation programs for releases from underground storage tanks regulated under the Act. The Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund Amendments Act of 1996 allows State and local governments to implement corrective actions for underground storage tank releases without hindering business operations. Funds provided by the Administrator cannot be used for financial assistance to meet tank regulations. States with cooperative agreements must follow a specific allocation process. The Administrator distributes funds from the Trust Fund to States using an allocation process developed for cooperative agreements. The process can be revised after consulting with State agencies and considering revenue and confirmed releases. The Trust Fund distributes funds directly to State agencies for programs related to leaking underground storage tanks. Cost recovery by the Administrator is prohibited for these programs. Section 9003(h)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code is referenced for amendments. Technical amendments to the Solid Waste Disposal Act include corrections to spelling errors and subsection references. Amendments to Section 9005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act include corrections to spelling errors and subsection references. The House of Representatives passed the amendments to Section 9005 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act on September 25, 1996."
