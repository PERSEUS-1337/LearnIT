    "content": "The necessity of an automatic Emotion recognition system is increasing, with traditional approaches based on facial images, heart rates, and tones of voice. To detect genuine emotions, brain signals are measured using EEG, chosen for its cost-effectiveness. This study aims to analyze EEG signals in response to visual stimuli to detect emotions accurately. The study recorded EEG signals in a controlled setting to predict emotions in response to stimuli. Machine learning algorithms achieved average accuracies ranging from 74.76% to 82.46%. EEG applications were also used in neuro-marketing to detect customer color preferences based on logo colors. Emotion recognition systems are becoming increasingly important in daily life. Approaches to emotion recognition include facial images, heart rate measurements, and brainwave activity divided into five frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. EEG data was collected using Emotiv EPOC device with electrodes located at AF3, gamma band is responsible for arousal. EEG brain activity from parietal and frontal lobe is emotionally informative. Image data sets were prepared for stimuli presentation and classification. Top ranked features were identified for research questions 1 and 2. Top ranked features for each subject are extracted for research questions 1 and 2."
