    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Fishery Mitigation Coordination Act\" and includes findings related to fisheries. Congress finds that the operation of dams and water diversion projects benefit the American public, impacting water systems and fish populations, necessitating the construction and operation of fish hatcheries to mitigate these effects. This is in line with established policies to mitigate for fish, wildlife, and habitats affected by federal water resource development projects. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service operates fish hatcheries for mitigation fishery activities related to Federal water resource development projects. These activities are valued by State, Indian tribal partners, and the fishing community. Inconsistencies in authorities for water projects have led to various funding mechanisms for mitigation fishery activities. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service operates fish hatcheries to offset mitigation fishery costs incurred by Federal water development projects. The Service negotiates with sponsor agencies to provide goods and services for fisheries impacted by water projects, with the sponsor agency responsible for bearing the financial burden. SEC. 3. FISH HATCHERIES. A sponsor agency must agree to cover the costs of fish hatcheries conducting mitigation activities at various locations across the United States, including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and North Dakota. The National Fish Hatcheries at Valley City, Tishomingo, Gavins Point, Dale Hollow, Erwin, Jones Hole, and Jackson are located in various states such as Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The definitions for the Act include terms like \"sponsor agency\" referring to specific government bodies, \"Service\" for the Fish and Wildlife Service, \"mitigation fisheries\" for compensating impacts on aquatic resources, \"mitigation fishery activities\" for stocking fish, and \"mitigation fishery costs.\" Mitigation fishery costs refer to necessary expenditures for operating facilities for mitigation fishery activities, including personnel, transportation, utilities, supplies, equipment, maintenance, fish health, and planning. Mitigation fishery facilities are owned and operated by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for conducting these activities. Fishery mitigation plans are resource management plans developed for mitigation purposes. A fishery mitigation plan is a resource management plan developed between the US Fish and Wildlife Service and sponsor agencies, in cooperation with affected States and Indian Tribes, outlining long-term goals and annual targets for mitigation fishery activities. The plan must be approved in advance by a sponsor agency and the Service. The sponsor agency must pay the Service the necessary funds by October 1st each year to cover mitigation fishery costs for water development projects as outlined in the fishery mitigation plan. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will identify the funds to be used for this purpose in advance."
