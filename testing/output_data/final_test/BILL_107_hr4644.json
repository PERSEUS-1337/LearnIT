    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women and Children's HIV Protection Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that perinatal transmission is the main cause of pediatric HIV infections, with around 7,000 HIV-infected women giving birth in the US annually. Medical advancements have made it possible to almost eliminate perinatal HIV transmission through the use of antiviral medication during pregnancy, labor, and after birth, along with the option of a Caesarean section to further reduce transmission risk. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal HIV testing in prenatal care, but 15% of HIV-infected pregnant women receive no prenatal care. CDC recommends HIV testing for all pregnant women, yet nearly half are not tested. The American Medical Association recommends mandatory HIV testing for all newborns to identify those at risk and provide appropriate treatment. Testing pregnant women and newborns can significantly reduce pediatric HIV infections, improve access to medical care, and reduce transmission among adults. New York State has required mandatory HIV counseling. New York State mandates HIV counseling and voluntary testing for pregnant women, leading to a significant drop in perinatal HIV transmission rates. Universal routine HIV testing for pregnant women and newborns is recommended to be the standard of care by medical organizations and public health officials. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN GRANTS. Amended section 2616A of the Public Health Service Act adds a new requirement for certain grants.
