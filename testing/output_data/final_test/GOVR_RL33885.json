    "content": "Allegations of North Korean drug production, trafficking, and other criminal activities are a concern for Congress, the Administration, and the diplomatic community. The challenge is balancing anti-drug policies with other high-priority U.S. foreign policy objectives related to North Korea's weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missile production, terrorism, and humanitarian needs. The DPRK's criminal activities may have financed weapons of mass destruction and strengthened its nuclear weapons program. U.N. Resolution 1718 allows for economic sanctions against those supporting DPRK's nuclear-related programs. Illicit activities like counterfeiting are prevalent in North Korea. The DPRK's illicit activities, including counterfeiting, may have funded its weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons program. The U.S. prioritizes denuclearization in talks with North Korea, but concerns about illicit activities could resurface as diplomatic ties normalize. Congress plays a role in overseeing U.S. policy towards North Korea, including allowing them to join international financial institutions. They also provide funds for humanitarian assistance and address DPRK criminal activities such as drug trafficking and counterfeiting. Reports suggest North Korea may also be involved in insurance fraud and human trafficking. The Bush Administration raised concerns about DPRK's crime-for-profit activities in 2003, but public reports on the issue have decreased since then. While DPRK's drug trafficking has decreased, there are still concerns about organized criminal behavior providing foreign currency resources to the North Korean state. North Korean crime-for-profit activities, orchestrated by a special office under the ruling Korean Worker's Party, involve drug trafficking, counterfeit products, and counterfeiting of U.S. currency. Law enforcement agencies have linked North Korea to at least 50 incidents of drug trafficking over decades, with ongoing activities in methamphetamine production and counterfeit cigarette trade. Conservative estimates suggest these criminal activities generate up to $500 million in profit annually. North Korean criminal activity generates up to $1 billion in profit per year, with estimates varying. One study estimates drug trafficking at $20 to $35 million in 2005-2006. Another source suggests North Korea earns $700 million to $1 billion annually from weapons exports, drug trading, and counterfeit money. In 2003, U.S. Forces Korea estimated North Korea's revenue from illegal drug exports at $500 million and counterfeit bills at $15 to $20 million. Additionally, in 2001, North Korea exported ballistic missiles worth $580 million. In 2001, North Korea exported ballistic missiles worth $580 million to the Middle East. Recent reports indicate illicit exports of conventional military weapons to Burma in violation of U.N. prohibitions. The country's trade deficit fluctuated from $1.8 billion in 2004 to $2.7 billion in 2007, partly financed through aid, capital inflows, borrowing, remittances, and tourism. North Korea has been linked to illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking, with evidence suggesting state support for these activities. Since 1976, North Korea has been involved in over 50 incidents of drug seizures in multiple countries, often resulting in the arrest of North Korean diplomats or officials. Concerns about North Korean drug trafficking were highlighted in the International Narcotics Control Board's 1997 annual report. The 1997 annual report of the Narcotics Control Board expressed concern over North Korea's involvement in drug trafficking. Substantial seizures of North Korean methamphetamine occurred in Japan in 1999. The \"Pong Su,\" a North Korean vessel, delivered a large quantity of heroin to Australia in 2003. Despite little doubt of a North Korean connection, no direct links to the DPRK State apparatus have been found since 2003. The State Department's 2008 report notes a decline in North Korea's state-linked drug trafficking activity, possibly due to increased international scrutiny following the 2003 heroin seizure on the \"Pong Su.\" Some analysts believe the decrease in seizures is because North Korean methamphetamine is being mistaken for Chinese drugs due to growing Chinese criminal ties to North Korea's drug trade. North Korea has reportedly produced three main types of illicit drugs: opiates, synthetic drugs like methamphetamine, and counterfeit pharmaceutical drugs. In 2008, the country's illegal drug production and trafficking were not significant enough to be listed on the State Department's drug \"majors list,\" potentially avoiding trade sanctions and aid restrictions. Press reports suggest involvement of North Korean nationals in drug trafficking with Chinese criminals, but it is unclear if the drugs were of DPRK origin or if there were links to DPRK officials. North Korea has been reported to produce illicit drugs, including opiates, methamphetamine, and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. In 2006, it was estimated that North Korea cultivated 4,000 to 7,000 hectares of opium poppy, producing 30 to 44 metric tons of opium gum annually. The country's raw opium production capacity is estimated at 50 tons per year, with the ability to process 100 tons of raw opium into opium and heroin. Additionally, North Korea has a maximum methamphetamine production capacity of 10 to 15 metric tons for export. North Korea's advanced pharmaceutical industry is believed to produce knock-off erectile enhancement drugs like Viagra\u00ae and Cialis\u00ae. Speculation exists on whether North Korea or China is the actual manufacturer. Reports suggest that private scientists in North Korea are producing stimulants for domestic consumption as state control loosens. Reports indicate that private scientists in North Korea are producing stimulants for domestic consumption, funded by private investors. Drug abuse is reportedly widespread among senior military officials and the poor, with drug addiction spreading among cadres like the officer corps of the People's Army Security Department and high-ranking party officials. The country is also involved in the production and distribution of counterfeit foreign currencies, including U.S. $100 Federal Reserve notes. In an April 2008 hearing, Treasury officials mentioned the high-quality counterfeit bills produced by North Korea, known as the \"Supernote,\" which continue to circulate. Media reports suggest that counterfeit $100 bills are used in North Korean markets, valued at around $70. It is uncertain whether these counterfeits are from existing stocks or currently being produced. The U.S. has detected or seized approximately $45-$48 million in counterfeit currency since 1989, with new security features making counterfeiting more challenging. Estimates suggest that North Korea has profited between $15 million to $25 million per year from counterfeiting activities. At least 13 reported incidents between 1994 and 2005 show North Korean involvement in counterfeiting and smuggling U.S. currency, with connections to the government through the use of diplomatic passports and involvement of embassy personnel and state-owned trading companies. North Korea has been involved in counterfeiting foreign currency for years, with incidents dating back to the 1950s. Reports indicate that North Korea has forged and circulated U.S. $100 banknotes worth millions of dollars annually. The government operates three banknote forging agencies, with over $4.6 million in counterfeit bills uncovered between 1994 and 2005. Arrests and indictments point to North Korea's involvement in trafficking counterfeit currency. Between 1994 and 2005, North Korea was involved in counterfeiting foreign currency, with incidents dating back to the 1950s. In August 2005, federal law enforcement authorities completed two undercover operations targeting members of China's Triad criminal syndicates, seizing $4 million in supernotes believed to be of North Korean origin. Illicit narcotics, counterfeit brand cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals were also seized. The Banco Delta Asia (BDA) bank in Macau played a role in laundering money derived from North Korea. The Department of Treasury accused senior BDA officials of laundering money from DPRK's criminal activities, including accepting counterfeit currency and placing it into circulation. BDA clients, including a DPRK front company, were involved in distributing counterfeit money, smuggling tobacco products, and suspected drug trafficking. A rule under the USA PATRIOT Act prohibited U.S. financial institutions from dealing with BDA, leading banks worldwide to refuse business with them. North Korea traders have moved bank accounts to China, Austria, and Switzerland. Pyongyang enacted an Anti-Money Laundering Law to address concerns. The US released $25 million in blocked assets to DPRK authorities to resolve the Banco Delta issue. In June 2007, frozen funds were returned to North Korea via the U.S. Federal Reserve and a Russian bank as a condition for restarting the Six-Party talks. The decision was praised and criticized by observers for its impact on bringing DPRK back to the negotiating table. Some argued that returning the funds compromised international agreements, including U.N. Resolution 1718. The BDA issue raised questions about how the international banking community treats DPRK accounts and had larger financial effects than expected. The BDA action had significant financial effects, leading to a run on accounts and the government of Macau taking over operations. This caused other banks in the region to impose stricter regulations on North Korean account holders. Some wonder if business will return to normal, proceed with caution, or cease altogether. China allows North Koreans to open bank accounts in yuan for transactions. Counterfeit cigarette production in North Korea has become a major source of crime-for-profit revenue, possibly replacing illegal drug trafficking. Reports indicate that the country is involved in producing counterfeit cigarettes for export, including fake Japanese brand cigarettes like Mild Seven and U.S. brands like Marlboro. U.S. authorities seized over a billion fake cigarettes in California in 2005, with millions more intercepted in Taiwan. Enforcement against this organized criminal activity appears to be lacking. North Korea is a major producer of counterfeit cigarettes, with knock-offs of Marlboro and Mild Seven brands being seized in various countries. The DPRK's production capacity is over two billion packs a year, earning the regime millions in payoffs and generating hundreds of millions in revenues annually. Rajin is a key hub for this illegal activity. One of the main hubs for illegal cigarette production in North Korea is Rajin, a port city on the east coast. Chinese criminal groups reportedly own many cigarette factories in Rajin, while North Korean state-owned enterprises in Pyongyang also produce contraband cigarettes. DPRK manufacturers have shifted towards producing low-priced domestic brands instead of counterfeits, leading to a decrease in cigarette prices and an increase in quality. In 2007, North Korea imported $12.95 million worth of tobacco products from China. North Korean cigarette producers, including state-owned enterprises, are now focusing on producing low-priced domestic brands instead of counterfeits. Greek authorities seized millions of cartons of contraband cigarettes, with a significant amount found aboard North Korean vessels. In one instance, a North Korean freighter carrying 1.5 million cartons of contraband cigarettes was detained by Greek officials. Media reports from late 2006 suggested possible DPRK state involvement in insurance fraud, with concerns raised about overstated property damage claims, altered accident circumstances, and questionable death claims. An example cited was a ferry accident in April 2006 near Wonsan, where North Korea declared 129 deaths, all with life insurance coverage. Weather data contradicted hypothermia claims. In another case in July 2005, a medical rescue helicopter allegedly crashed. In July 2005, a medical rescue helicopter crashed into a government-owned disaster supply warehouse in North Korea, leading to suspicions of insurance fraud. The DPRK authorities quickly filed a claim with a detailed inventory of items, a process that usually takes months. Reports also suggest North Korean officials are involved in trafficking endangered species, violating international conventions. Industry estimates indicate fraudulent insurance claims by North Korea could exceed $150 million. The DPRK, not a member of CITES, has diplomats caught trafficking in CITES-protected species between treaty member states. Violations began in the 1980s, mainly involving elephant ivory and rhino horn. Confiscated shipments suggest government involvement in endangered species trafficking. North Korea is a source country for human trafficking, listed as a \"Tier 3\" country for trafficking by the U.S. State Department. North Korea is listed as a \"Tier 3\" country for human trafficking by the U.S. State Department. The country maintains force labor prison camps where prisoners are forced to work. North Korean women and children are trafficked into China and sold as brides in various countries. North Korean women and girls are trafficked into China and other countries, where they are forced into prostitution, marriage, or exploitative labor. U.S. policy addresses North Korea's crime-for-profit activities through diplomacy, law enforcement, economic sanctions, and incentives. Congress plays an active role in oversight and may consider evaluating efforts to reduce North Korea's illicit financial activities. Diplomatic strategies include using fora such as the Six-Party talks. The Bush Administration's strategy on North Korea has shifted towards denuclearization as a primary focus. There is a debate between using unilateral tactics like economic sanctions to pressure North Korea or engaging in negotiations to resolve the issue. The goal is to reduce North Korea's reliance on illicit activities for foreign currency. The United States aims to change North Korea's behavior through negotiations and bring the country into the circle of peaceful nations. The challenge is to get Pyongyang to commit to stopping its alleged crime-for-profit activities, which could be addressed in discussions on diplomatic relations with the US, Japan, South Korea, and China. Working teams have not yet addressed this issue. The United States is working to address North Korea's crime-for-profit activities through negotiations and law enforcement actions, including the Illicit Activities Initiative (IAI) established in 2003. The IAI involves multiple U.S. government departments and agencies, as well as international cooperation, to enforce laws and hold North Korea accountable. The Banco Delta Macau action was a result of the IAI's efforts. The United States and other nations are taking direct measures to halt illicit cargo shipments from North Korea through initiatives like the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The PSI aims to stop shipments of weapons of mass destruction and related materials by tracking and searching suspected ships. While 14 nations have signed on to the PSI, China and South Korea have not joined, complicating North Korean smuggling efforts. No North Korean ships or airplanes have been halted under the PSI. Congress may play a role in overseeing U.S. policy towards North Korea, including providing funding for energy and food assistance to reduce reliance on illicit activities. Congressional action may also be needed to help North Korea increase legitimate exports and attract investments from U.S. businesses. This could involve granting the DPRK normal trading nation status with respect to U.S. import duties. Analysts highlight the systemic criminalization of North Korea over the years and its close ties with organized crime in Asia. Income from criminal activities has become addictive for those involved, creating a class of criminal entrepreneurs. The unresolved question is whether the Pyongyang regime can effectively curb its crime-for-profit activities. Korean criminals are shifting towards large-scale production of counterfeit cigarettes and pharmaceuticals, including Viagra\u00ae, with reports of significant methamphetamine production capacity. This trend is not limited by agricultural constraints like opium production. The DPRK is importing ephedrine, a precursor for methamphetamine, indicating a growing criminal activity in the country. North Korea has developed a significant production capacity for methamphetamine, driven by the need for foreign currency and the expanding southeast Asian market. Efforts to reduce crime-for-profit activities face challenges as the regime diverts illicit earnings to sustain loyalty and fund weapons development programs. The prospects for decreasing such activities are deemed unfavorable. North Korea's significant production capacity for methamphetamine is driven by the need for foreign currency. Efforts to reduce crime-for-profit activities face challenges as the regime diverts earnings to sustain loyalty and fund weapons development. Pyongyang is finding other means to export and earn foreign exchange, reducing illicit activity."
