According to the Bureau of the Census, approximately 1 in 5 people in the United States lives with some sort of physical disability. More than 54,000,000 individuals report some level of disability, with approximately 34,000,000 classified as having a severe disability. An estimated 11,000,000 individuals aged 6 and older need personal assistance with everyday activities. Five percent of the US population over age 15 uses mobility aids. The number of individuals with physical disabilities is increasing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised the estimate of individuals with spina bifida in the US from 70,000 to 166,000. Studies show that people with disabilities face barriers in accessing healthcare, with 1 in 3 women with disabilities being denied services at a physician's office. Women with disabilities are less likely to receive preventive screenings and standard treatments for conditions like breast cancer. Individuals with disabilities face barriers in accessing necessary healthcare, including difficulty finding accessible providers. A volunteer with spina bifida died from late-stage cervical cancer due to a lack of a suitable examination table in her community. Organizations report that individuals with disabilities need more information on accessible healthcare providers and additional support to ensure they receive necessary care. Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include programs promoting accessible health care for individuals with disabilities, such as state grants for creating disability accessible provider directories. The Secretary will award grants to States for developing and maintaining State-based, Internet directories of health care providers accessible to individuals with disabilities. States must meet eligibility requirements to receive grants. Applications must detail how individuals with disabilities and healthcare providers can submit information for the State's Internet directory. Recipients of grants are required to use funds to create or update publicly available directories of accessible healthcare facilities in the State. The grant recipients must develop and maintain directories of healthcare facilities in the State that are accessible to individuals with disabilities. The directories should include the full name, address, telephone number, and specific accommodations provided by each facility. Improving provider and patient awareness of accessible healthcare facilities for people with disabilities. The Secretary will establish a pilot program to increase awareness among healthcare providers about the need for accessible environments and examination rooms for individuals with disabilities. Resources will be developed and distributed to support this initiative. The pilot program aims to raise awareness among healthcare providers about the importance of accessible environments and examination rooms for individuals with disabilities. Resources will include information on accommodating individuals with disabilities, modifying physical environments for accessibility, and training on safely accommodating individuals in wheelchairs. Targeted providers include primary care professionals and office staff. The pilot program targets various healthcare providers, including dentists, health care clinics, hospitals, and specialists like obstetricians and gynecologists. Program materials will incorporate information from the Federal Government's 'Right to Know Health Promotion Campaign'. The pilot program, part of the 'Right to Know Health Promotion Campaign' by the CDC, will be field-tested and evaluated for effectiveness. Resources will be developed for individuals with disabilities to find accessible healthcare providers. The resources for individuals with disabilities seeking healthcare providers will include a list of questions for scheduling appointments, suggestions for explaining special needs, and seeking accommodations. The materials will be culturally appropriate and at appropriate literacy levels. The `Right to Know Health Promotion Campaign' by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes field-testing and focus groups to ensure effectiveness, and dissemination through the Internet and other means to support individuals with disabilities in finding accessible healthcare providers in their communities. \"SEC. 399OO-2.
