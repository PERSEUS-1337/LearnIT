    "content": "Viruses are small genetic material in a protein coat that cannot reproduce on their own. Smallpox, caused by the Variola virus, has two types: Variola minor with a low fatality rate and Variola major with a high fatality rate. Smallpox is part of the Orthopox genus, which also includes other viruses like vaccinia and monkeypox. Smallpox was a deadly disease, killing millions in the twentieth century before the last reported case in 1978. Smallpox, caused by the Variola virus, killed millions in the twentieth century. The virus has an incubation period of seven to seventeen days followed by high fever, malaise, and characteristic sores. About 30% of unvaccinated victims die, with survivors often left disfigured. The CDC considers smallpox less contagious than other diseases like chickenpox and measles. Smallpox is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air or by contact with contaminated items. The vaccine provides immunity against the virus, reducing the severity of the disease and the likelihood of death, even if contracted years after vaccination. The vaccinia vaccine is the only known treatment for smallpox, with antiviral drugs showing promise in studies. Despite its effectiveness, the vaccine has a higher complication rate compared to other vaccines. Most vaccinees experience mild side effects, but serious side effects occur in 1 in 797 people. Inadvertent inoculation can spread the infection to other parts of the body, causing sores and scarring. Serious complications of the vaccinia vaccine include sores and scarring on the face, genitals, and rectum, as well as potentially fatal conditions like eczema vaccinatum, encephalitis, and progressive vaccinia. Experts estimate 1-2 deaths per million vaccinations due to these complications. Additionally, those who come into contact with vaccinated individuals may also develop complications, with up to 20% of cases occurring in unvaccinated contacts. The high rate of vaccine complications led to the rescinding of the recommendation for universal smallpox vaccination in 1971. Experts believe that up to 25% of the population may have conditions that make vaccination risky, such as eczema, pregnancy, or immunodeficiency. Transferring the virus to household members is a serious risk, so caution is advised. Due to the risk of virus transmission to household members, it is advised not to vaccinate individuals living with those with certain conditions. Vaccinia immunoglobulin (VIG) is the only proven treatment for some vaccine complications, but it is not effective for postvaccinial encephalitis. The CDC controls civilian supplies of VIG, estimated to be sufficient for 27 million vaccinations. The CDC is procuring more VIG to deal with complications from vaccinations. Cidofovir can be used as an Investigational New Drug if VIG treatment fails. Smallpox was officially declared eliminated in 1980, but some countries still have laboratory stocks. Only the US and Russia have declared stocks of smallpox, but other countries may have undeclared stocks. Some countries may have retained smallpox virus, including China, Cuba, India, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Yugoslavia, and possibly France. Obtaining the virus is a barrier for non-state terrorists, as all countries have stopped vaccination programs, leaving citizens vulnerable to an epidemic. Concerns exist about the security of Russian stocks due to economic collapse. Some fear Russian stocks may not be secure due to economic collapse post-Soviet Union. Acquiring smallpox virus from Siberian permafrost unlikely. American scientists created polio virus from DNA in 2002, but constructing Variola virus is challenging. Terrorist organization would need advanced knowledge and facilities to maintain virus. It is difficult to weaponize smallpox due to the advanced technical knowledge and facilities required. Terrorists could potentially use their own body as a delivery system to infect others. Iraq is suggested as a possible threat for using smallpox against the United States. Experts believe Iraq is unlikely to have smallpox as they did not use it during the Gulf War. Some argue Iraq may have the virus but did not use it due to its contagious nature. There are concerns that Saddam Hussein may deploy smallpox as a last resort, especially on US soil. The Administration has reserved the right to use nuclear weapons in response to weapons of mass destruction. Most experts believe a smallpox attack is very unlikely due to high barriers for acquisition and deployment. A terrorist organization would likely need a state sponsor to obtain and deploy smallpox. The President has ordered vaccination for 500,000 armed forces members and a voluntary program for 10 million medical workers and first responders. Vaccination will be available on demand for American adults by mid-2003, but not recommended for the general public due to high complication rates. Scientific research is crucial to limit the threat of smallpox. Developing a safer vaccine is challenging due to uncertainty in predicting its effectiveness and market demand. Some experts suggest focusing on treatments rather than preventive measures for potential biological attacks. Some scientists are researching antiviral drugs as a potential cure for smallpox, showing promise in preliminary studies. Improving animal models of smallpox is necessary to test the efficacy of new therapeutics. These drugs may also be effective against other viruses like influenza or AIDS, making them marketable treatments. Determining the status of undeclared smallpox stocks could better equip the United States to defend against an attack, shifting focus to preventing terrorist access to other sources. The United States is assisting in increasing security of former Soviet Union's biological weapon stockpiles by focusing on physical and economic security of agents and scientists. This helps reduce the threat posed by all agents in the arsenal.
