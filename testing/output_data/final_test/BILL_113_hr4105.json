    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Maritime Goods Movement Act for the 21st Century\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act titled the \"Maritime Goods Movement Act for the 21st Century\" defines \"commercial cargo\" as cargo transported on a commercial vessel, excluding certain items, and \"commercial vessel\" as any vessel used for transporting cargo by water for compensation or hire. The term \"ferry\" refers to a vessel that arrives in the United States on a regular schedule during its operating season, while \"international maritime cargo\" includes any cargo imported directly into the United States from a point outside the country by ship. The term \"port\" in the context of cargo transportation in the United States refers to any channel or harbor where commercial cargo enters the country, excluding low-use ports with limited cargo transport capacity. The term \"port\" excludes inland waterways and must be open to public navigation. Exceptions apply to facilities without recent federal funding or deauthorization by law. The Columbia River channels in Oregon and Washington are included up to the Bonneville Lock and Dam. A \"super donor port\" has above-average expenditures in a 5-year period. A \"super donor port\" refers to a port with expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund or Maritime Goods Movement User Fee below 10% of total harbor maintenance taxes collected in the previous 5 fiscal years. The term \"value\" refers to the amount of expenditures made at a port in the immediate harbor area for loading and unloading foreign waterborne commerce. The value for domestic commercial cargo is determined by standard commercial documentation, for imported commercial cargo it is the appraised value for duty under the Tariff Act of 1930, and for transportation of passengers for hire, it is the actual charge paid or prevailing charge for comparable service. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF MARITIME GOODS MOVEMENT USER FEE. Establishment of Maritime Goods Movement User Fee: A fee is imposed on all commercial cargo unloaded or loaded at a port or entering the US, starting on October 1 after the enactment of this Act. The fee amount is 0.125% of the cargo value and will be collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Maritime Goods Movement User Fee is imposed on commercial cargo unloaded or loaded at a port or entering the US. The fee is not applicable to exports from the US and does not apply if the vessel's fuel is subject to a specific tax under the Internal Revenue Code. The Maritime Goods Movement User Fee is imposed on commercial cargo unloaded or loaded at a port in the US, except for specific exemptions related to transportation to Alaska, Hawaii, or US possessions.

SEC. 4. EXPENDITURES OF MARITIME GOODS MOVEMENT USER FEE. The Maritime Goods Movement User Fees collected will be used for administrative costs and harbor maintenance programs. Up to $10,000,000 will cover administrative expenses, while the remaining funds will be allocated for harbor maintenance programs, with 95% for the first 5 years and 80% thereafter. The curr_chunk discusses the funding allocation for the maintenance of harbors and inland waterways in the United States, including various activities such as maintenance of navigation projects, disposal of dredged material, construction of placement facilities, and related studies. This funding is authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for harbor maintenance programs, with a special emphasis on low-use ports with Coast Guard presence or restricted navigation areas. Additionally, a competitive grant program is established for super donor ports to carry out specific projects using a portion of the Maritime Goods Movement User Fee. For each fiscal year, 5 percent of the Maritime Goods Movement User Fee not used for administration will be allocated to projects or activities described in subsection 5(e) paragraphs (4), (5), and (6). SEC. 5. COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR GOODS MOVEMENT.
