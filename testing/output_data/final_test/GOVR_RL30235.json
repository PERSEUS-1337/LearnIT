    "content": "When Congress created the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in the late 1930s, little thought was given to its impact on U.S. territories. Over time, the federal minimum wage was gradually applied in most territories, with special industry committees (SICs) used in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. By the late 1980s, SICs in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were phased out, while American Samoa's SICs had little effect on raising wages and were abolished in 2007. Guam immediately adopted the FLSA but only enforced it in the late 1950s. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) was acquired by the United States after World War II and entered into a Covenant of Association in the mid-1970s. They retained control over insular minimum wage and immigration policy, allowing for the use of low-wage alien contract labor and marketing goods as \"Made in America.\" The CNMI developed a substantial garment production industry using low-wage alien contract labor. Allegations of \"sweatshop\" conditions arose as the alien labor force equaled the native population. Despite business success stories, minimum wage issues remained unresolved in the CNMI. Various bills were introduced to increase the minimum wage and extend federal standards to the CNMI. Suggestions were made to modify the Covenant of Association regarding minimum wage, immigration, and marketing CNMI products as \"Made in America.\" The enactment of H.R. 2206 (P.L. 110-28) added procedures to the FLSA to bring the insular minimum wage up to mainland standards. The report provides an introductory overview of the role of the minimum wage in the territories and possessions of the United States, with no distinctions made between states and other jurisdictions under the FLSA. The FLSA concept evolved from the National Industrial Recovery Act, which was voluntary and relied on goodwill for success. The NIRA faced challenges with territories like Puerto Rico, but had flexibility. Despite being declared unconstitutional in 1935, it influenced wage/hour debates in 1937 and 1938. The FLSA set a minimum wage of 25 cents per hour in 1938, with increases to 30 cents and 40 cents per hour. Special industry committees were established for covered industries. The Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division could examine industries and make adjustments. The FLSA allowed the Department of Labor to gradually increase the federal minimum wage for specific industries through administrative processes, not exceeding 40 cents per hour. Industry committees were established, and the Administrator had the authority to reject recommendations or remand the matter. These wage rates were effective for seven years before the 40-cent minimum wage applied. Industry committees were slowly appointed as mandated by Section 8 of the Act. Industry committees were convened to recommend appropriate wage rates, considering economic conditions and not giving a competitive advantage. The age of the worker was not a factor, and the committees aimed for upward movement of wage rates within a range of 25 to 40 cents per hour. Factors considered included transportation, living, and production costs, with the goal of establishing the highest minimum wage rate without substantially reducing employment. The FLSA provision for industry committees aimed to recommend wage rates without giving a competitive advantage, ensuring minimum rates did not curtail employment. Puerto Rico initially had special treatment through industry committees but now aligns with states in minimum wage treatment. Puerto Rico, acquired by the United States after the Spanish-American War, developed institutions similar to states. In 1919, the Puerto Rican legislature adopted a minimum wage law, but wage rates remained low. With the FLSA in 1938, Puerto Rico faced challenges in increasing wages. Industry groups argued that even a 25 cent floor was too high for the island's economy. In 1940, Congress enacted new legislation for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, allowing special industry wage floors to replace FLSA minimum wage requirements. Industry committees, in cooperation with the US-DOL, were to develop these minima to reflect insular economic realities. Deviation from the national minimum wage was permitted only for employees covered by a wage order issued by the Administrator based on committee recommendations. The special industry committee system for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands aimed to bring wage standards in line with the mainland without giving any native industry a competitive advantage. In 1989, Congress eliminated this system as insular employers were meeting national standards, mandating step increases in the insular wage. The Virgin Islands, acquired by the United States in 1917, have a population of nearly 150,000 people spread across about 68 islands. The minimum wage for the Virgin Islands has been set at the national level since the mid-1990s. The relationship between the Islands and the mainland has evolved slowly over the decades following their acquisition. The Virgin Islands, acquired by the United States in 1917, have a population of nearly 150,000 people spread across about 68 islands. The relationship between the Islands and the mainland evolved slowly through the decades following their acquisition. Like Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands were covered under the original FLSA enactment of 1938, but their inclusion may have been more pro forma than the result of direct legislative intent. Industry became concerned about the impact of the wage/hour legislation, leading to appeals for an amendment to the statute on behalf of the islands. The 1940 FLSA amendment applied to the Virgin Islands as well, where the federal minimum wage could be met. In 1989, the Government of the Virgin Islands raised wage rates to meet the national standard, leading to the elimination of special treatment under the FLSA. Guam has been under FLSA coverage since 1938, enforced since 1959-1960, after being acquired by the US in 1898. In 1949, President Truman transferred administration of Guam to the Department of the Interior. In 1950, Congress established civil government for the island with a population of less than 200,000. Guam's capital is Agana. The island was allowed to elect its own governor in 1968 and a non-voting delegate to the U.S. Congress in 1972. Prior to World War II, Guam had different socio-economic and cultural conditions compared to the United States. Labor force and wage structure on the island remained multi-tiered with separate rates for different groups. Colonial administration was somewhat chaotic when the civil government was established in 1950. In 1950, colonial administration in Guam was chaotic with a mix of laws and regulations. Guam, as a territory of the United States, was not enforced under the original FLSA. Guamanian employers were not involved in discussions to alter the act in 1939 and 1940. During the war in the Pacific, Guam was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1944, leading to infrastructure devastation upon the U.S. reclaiming the island. After World War II, Guam's economy fell under government control with an expanded military population and Filipino workers brought in by American contractors. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1948 strengthened the case for enforcing federal minimum wage standards in Guam, citing the application of the FLSA to territories like Guam. In dissent in Vermilya-Brown, Justice Jackson suggested that the situation of a U.S. facility in Bermuda was different from \"our possessions\" as enumerated by the Court's majority. The applicability of the FLSA to Guam was confirmed in 1950 with the adoption of an Organic Act, but challenges arose due to the lack of a convenient Wage and Hour Division office. Chief Judge McLaughlin also affirmed the FLSA's applicability to Guam, Johnston Island, and American Samoa based on the Vermilya-Brown decision. Congress revisited labor standards for aliens employed in overseas bases in the late 1950s. In the late 1950s, Congress revisited labor standards for aliens employed in overseas bases. The FLSA applied to Guam and American Samoa, with amendments specifically including them in the act. Enforcement in American Samoa began in the late 1950s through a special industry committee structure, which was later repealed in 2007. Changes in the insular rate were to proceed under P.L. 110-28. Under P.L. 110-28, changes in the insular rate were to incrementally align with the federal rate in American Samoa, which consists of two segments: Western Samoa and American Samoa. The American presence in Samoa dates back to the late 19th century, with treaties and leases established after the Spanish-American War. President McKinley directed the Navy to oversee American Samoa until 1951, when authority shifted to the Department of the Interior. In the 1950s, an insular constitutional government was formed. In the 1950s, an insular constitutional government developed in American Samoa, and a constitution was approved in 1960. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) seems to have covered American Samoa since 1938, but enforcement did not occur until the late 1950s. A tuna canning operation started in 1953, becoming the island's main private sector employer. The Supreme Court's 1948 Vermilya-Brown decision raised awareness of FLSA standards in Samoan industry, leading to discussions in 1956 about amending the act. In the 1950s, an insular constitutional government developed in American Samoa, and a constitution was approved in 1960. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applied to American Samoa since 1938, but enforcement began in the late 1950s. Discussions in 1956 considered amending the act to allow the American Secretary of Labor to set wages for insular industries, creating a sub-minimum wage based on local economic conditions. This led to the establishment of an industry committee structure (SIC) in American Samoa, similar to those in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, to determine a rate lower than the national minimum wage. The SIC was meant to be a temporary measure as the insular economy progressed towards mainland standards, but it remained in place for over 30 years. In 1986, SIC No. 17 recommended raising the minimum wage for Samoa after investigating the condition of various economic sectors. The minimum wage for Samoa could be raised to the mainland level without risking employment in the island's industries. After an adjustment period until April 1988, Samoa's minimum wage would match the mainland's. This would lead to disbanding the special industry committee system, granting Samoa wage/hour equality with Guam. Litigation arose to challenge the wage increase, fearing a shift in the tuna industry's operations overseas. Congress intervened by adding language to the pending \"Insular Areas Regulation Act\" to address the issue. In response to concerns about raising the minimum wage in Samoa to match the mainland level, Congress intervened by adding language to the pending \"Insular Areas Regulation Act\" to address the issue. This included overturning the findings of Special Industry Committee No. 17 and retaining lower wage rates, as well as proposing legislation to reduce the evidentiary burden on employers in Samoa and phase out the industry committee system over a three-year period. In 2007, a provision in H.R. 2206 repealed special industry committee provisions of the FLSA for American Samoa, gradually increasing the minimum wage by 50 cents an hour each year until reaching the federal rate. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) was not initially covered by the federal minimum wage provisions of the FLSA, but in 2007, the minimum wage was extended to include CNMI. The CNMI, previously controlled by Spain, Germany, and Japan, became part of the United States after World War II. In the mid-1970s, a movement for self-determination led to the Covenant of Association between the Mariana Islands and the United States, establishing the current Commonwealth status. The Northern Mariana Islands, like Guam and American Samoa, are lightly populated and culturally different from the United States. Most of the population resides on Saipan, with other islands sharing in density. As a Trust Territory, the Mariana Islands were not initially considered part of the United States, leading to minimal imposition of U.S. standards. Western-style jobs were just beginning to develop when the U.S. took control in 1947. In 1947, the American government noted the Northern Marianas' transition to a cash economy and lack of trade unions and wage standards. The covenant divided labor standards responsibilities between CNMI and the United States, with the US handling overtime pay and child labor regulations. The CNMI took charge of alien labor immigration and minimum wage, with goods labeled as Made in America. The US-DOL was slow in implementing its responsibilities. The US-DOL's Wage and Hour Division in San Francisco had jurisdiction over the Pacific areas, but there was no regular US-DOL presence in the CNMI before 1986-1987. An investigation into overtime pay compliance in the garment industry revealed factors such as low minimum wage, importation of alien contract workers, and the ability to label products as Made in America. This led to a population increase in the CNMI. The insular population in the CNMI grew rapidly, with a significant number of non-citizen alien workers. Concerns about labor practices, including \"sweatshop\" conditions, led to extensive hearings in 1992 and 1995. Representative Ron de Lugo estimated that half of the 45,000 people in the CNMI in 1992 were \"temporary alien workers,\" with the garment industry experiencing significant growth. The US-DOL became involved, levying fines in 1991-1992. In 1991-1992, the US-DOL fined CNMI garment manufacturers for forced kickbacks, appalling living conditions, and underpayment of wages. In 1998, Senate hearings focused on unfair labor practices in the CNMI, discussing federal minimum wage and immigration laws. Senator Murkowski proposed a new 50% U.S. labor requirement for textiles and apparel manufactured in the Marianas. In 1998, Senate hearings discussed labor requirements for textiles and apparel in the Marianas, with a significant population growth noted. Unemployment was around 7.1%, with differences in rates between alien workers and resident islanders. Some suggested the need for a 'special industry committee' in anticipation of reform. In anticipation of reform, suggestions were made for a 'special industry committee' similar to American Samoa. Despite various legislative proposals in Congress, including a bill introduced by Representative George Miller, no action was taken on issues such as labeling, minimum wages, and immigration law in the CNMI. In the 110th Congress, George Miller chaired the Committee on Education and Labor. H.R. 2, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, aimed to raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour and apply it to the CNMI. The bill passed in the House and Senate but faced procedural issues in the Senate. In the 110th Congress, H.R. 976 and H.R. 1591 were bills addressing revenue measures and funding levels for the conflict in the Middle East. H.R. 1591 was contentious, approved by Congress but vetoed by the President. A provision in H.R. 2206 mandated an increase in the insular minimum wage in the CNMI. The federal minimum wage would increase by 50 cents an hour 60 days after enactment, with an additional 50 cents an hour increase each year until reaching the federal minimum wage level. Insular and federal rates would then be equal and rise or fall together."
