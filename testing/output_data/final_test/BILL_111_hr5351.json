Congress found that the United States voted against the final adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court due to unachieved negotiating objectives, as stated by Ambassador David Scheffer. Ambassador Scheffer informed Congress that multinational peacekeeping forces in a country that has joined the treaty could be subject to the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction, even if the peacekeeper's country has not joined the treaty. This could potentially lead to the prosecution of United States Armed Forces operating overseas, even if the US has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. This goes against fundamental treaty principles and could hinder the US military's ability to fulfill alliance obligations and participate in multinational operations, including humanitarian interventions. President Clinton directed the United States to sign the Rome Statute on December 31, 2000, despite concerns about its deficiencies. However, in a 2002 letter, Under Secretary of State John Bolton stated that the US does not intend to become a party to the treaty. On July 1, 2002, the Rome Statute entered into force, establishing the International Criminal Court. American citizens prosecuted by the ICC may be denied procedural protections guaranteed by the US Constitution. The US government aims to protect its Armed Forces from ICC prosecution while deployed worldwide. The United States Government aims to protect its Armed Forces and senior officials from potential criminal prosecutions by the International Criminal Court, especially regarding national security decisions. The Rome Statute poses a risk of ICC prosecution for actions related to terrorism, weapons proliferation, and aggression, despite US objections. The United States Government seeks to shield its Armed Forces and senior officials from International Criminal Court prosecution for actions taken to safeguard national interests. Any attempt to prosecute them could jeopardize national security and the ability of the US and other democracies to defend themselves. A bipartisan group of former senior US officials expressed concern about the threat to American sovereignty posed by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The signatories included Lawrence Eagleburger, Brent Scowcroft, Caspar Weinberger, and Zbigniew Brzezinski. A bipartisan group of former senior US officials, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, expressed concern about the threat to American sovereignty posed by the International Criminal Court (ICC). A bipartisan group of former senior US officials, including Zbigniew Brzezinski, raised concerns about Americans prosecuted by the ICC being denied constitutional rights and the need for US military personnel to be protected from an international prosecutor with inconsistent procedures. They emphasized the importance of enforcing US laws against human rights violations. The bipartisan group of former senior US officials raised concerns about the potential chilling effect of international criminal prosecution on US decision-makers. They highlighted the importance of protecting US personnel from ICC proceedings through bilateral agreements with over 100 countries. The American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002, signed into law as part of the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act, prohibits US cooperation with the International Criminal Court. It also restricts participation in UN peacekeeping operations and transfer of classified information to the ICC. In 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed regret that the US was not a signatory of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Ambassador Susan Rice noted the ICC's importance and credibility at a UN Security Council meeting. The US sent an observer delegation to the ICC Assembly of States Parties for the first time in November 2009. The United States, represented by Ambassador Stephen J. Rapp, expressed willingness to participate in the Review Conference of the International Criminal Court in Kampala, Uganda. President Obama announced sending additional troops to Afghanistan in December 2009. During a testimony before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the United States House of Representatives in December 2009, General Karl W. Eikenberry and General Stanley A. McChrystal affirmed their opposition to soldiers in uniform being tried before the ICC for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, considers all soldiers in Afghanistan subject to ICC jurisdiction. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over soldiers in Afghanistan, even those from nations not part of the Rome Statute. A preliminary investigation is being conducted to determine if NATO troops, including American soldiers, have committed war crimes. Israel has faced attempts to use the ICC to prevent it from defending itself against violent militant groups. Operation Cast Lead was conducted in response to rocket and mortar attacks from Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is considering a request by the Palestinian Authority to investigate Israel's Operation Cast Lead in the West Bank and Gaza. The United Nations Fact Finding Mission released the biased Goldstone Report, accusing Israel of deliberately attacking civilians during the operation. The United States House of Representatives adopted House Resolution 867 on November 3, 2009, criticizing the biased Goldstone Report for denying Israel's right to self-defense and ignoring the culpability of Iran and Syria in sponsoring Hamas. The resolution recommended further action to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor. House Resolution 867 was adopted by the United States House of Representatives, rejecting the biased Goldstone Report on the Gaza Conflict and reaffirming support for Israel's right to self-defense. The resolution also emphasized that the US does not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over its nationals. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress is that the US should not ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and should instead focus on diplomatic efforts to prevent the Court from proceeding against US personnel. The President and Secretary of State should lead diplomatic efforts to defend the right to self-defense of the US and its allies, explore alternative forums to combat impunity for war crimes, and respect the sovereignty of democracies with effective judicial systems. SEC. 4 prohibits the use of funds for US participation in the International Criminal Court. This includes any activities related to the ICC. The prohibition is meant to complement existing prohibitions in the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002. SEC. 5 of the Act defines key terms related to the International Criminal Court, including the definitions of \"International Criminal Court\" and \"Rome Statute.\""
