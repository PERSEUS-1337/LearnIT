This report explains earmarks in surface transportation finance and how federal funding is distributed with the ban in place. The FAST Act in December 2015 plays a significant role in federal transportation funding. The FAST Act of December 2015 significantly impacts federal transportation funding, with the majority distributed directly to states, local governments, and transportation authorities through formulas. State and local governments make funding decisions under formula programs, while discretionary grant programs distribute a smaller portion of federal transportation funding. Prior to 2011, transportation funding was heavily earmarked by Congress in authorization legislation and annual DOT appropriations acts. Earmarks were found in both authorization and appropriations legislation, with the FAA budget historically free of earmarks except for the Airport Improvement Program's discretionary funding. The magnitude of transportation earmarking is challenging to estimate. The Inspector General examined transportation earmarking in authorization and appropriations bills for FY2006, estimating that 13.5% of DOT's budget was congressionally directed. 80% of earmarks originated in authorizations and 20% in appropriations. Earmarks provide specific benefits for constituents but often go unused due to various reasons. Funding for earmarks may go unused for many years if state and local authorities cannot provide matching funds or if the project is misidentified in law. Congress has addressed long-term unobligated earmarks by redesignating them for other projects or rescinding budget authority. The current earmark ban does not allow for earmarks to be redesignated for other specified projects. Congress has allowed old unused earmark funding to be used for other transportation projects, such as redirecting long-term unobligated earmarks to a surface transportation project within 50 miles of the original project. This provision applies to earmarks over 10 years old with 90% or more of the funding remaining unobligated. The rules in both houses of Congress define an earmark as a provision included primarily at the request of. The rules define an earmark as a provision included primarily at the request of a Senator providing specific discretionary budget authority for a contract or expenditure targeted to a specific State or Congressional district. Earmarks can be found in authorization and appropriations bills as well as in committee reports, providing guidance to executive branch departments. The definition of \"congressionally directed spending item\" under House and Senate rules allows for \"soft\" transportation earmarks, which do not specify funding amounts. Two types of soft earmarks are place naming and road naming, commonly used to influence Airport Improvement Program spending. The report (H.Rept. 101-183) recommended prioritizing grant applications for airport construction and development, including Akron-Canton Regional Airport and Alexander Hamilton Airport. Place naming and road naming, considered soft earmarks, are used to influence spending. The definition of earmarks in congressional rules may exclude Capital Investment Grants (CIG) Program funding. The earmark ban excludes most Capital Investment Grants (CIG) Program funding distributed by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Congress no longer names specific projects in appropriations bills but may prioritize funding distribution. For example, in the FY2015 appropriations bill, Congress directed funding to projects covered by a full funding grant agreement. In the 112th Congress, an earmark ban was established through party and committee rules and protocols, enforced by chamber and committee leadership. The House Republican Conference's rules included a standing order prohibiting congressional earmark requests. In the 112th Congress, an earmark ban was established through party and committee rules and protocols, enforced by chamber and committee leadership. This ban was extended for the 113th, 114th, and 115th Congresses, with the Senate Republican Conference adopting a similar resolution. President Obama vowed to veto legislation containing earmarks in 2011, leading to a two-year ban on earmarks by the Senate Appropriations Committee. President Trump expressed support for limited earmarking in 2018, signaling a potential return to earmarking practices. Earmarking for highway projects increased in the late 1980s, with a significant rise to 152 earmarks in the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987. This led to a presidential veto and criticism from President Ronald Reagan. The House rule against specific road provisions was effective until the 1970s when waivers were granted within larger transportation bills. Highway earmarks were limited until the late 1980s. The number of highway earmarks grew significantly in the late 1980s, reaching a high of 5,671 in SAFETEA in 2005. The MAP-21 and FAST Act in 2012 and 2015 respectively contained no earmarks. The 1913 House ban on highway earmarks was repealed in 1999, leading to a rapid increase in earmarks from 96 in FY2000 to 614 in FY2010. DOT administers most federal transportation programs, with funding distributed through formula programs selected by states, local governments, or transportation authorities. The Department of Transportation's involvement in project selection is limited to funding in discretionary programs, with most highway funding distributed through formula programs controlled by states. Some funding is also distributed through discretionary programs like the INFRA program. The INFRA project awards are decided within the Office of the Secretary of Transportation. Highway funding goes towards transportation facilities on federal lands, research, training, and administrative expenses. All highway projects must be part of the planning process under a Metropolitan Planning Organization or state department of transportation to be eligible for federal funding. The State Transportation Improvement Plan lists planned highway projects in priority order. Federal transit funding is distributed by statutory formulas. Federal transit funding is distributed by statutory formulas, with over 75% of the $12 billion annual budget allocated this way. Transit projects must be included in a STIP or Transportation Improvement Program approved by an MPO to be eligible for funds. Most transit funding goes directly to local authorities, except for funds designated for urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 and non-urbanized areas, which are administered by states. The Urbanized Area Formula Grant Program and State of Good Repair Program are formula programs overseen by FTA, while the Capital Investment Grants and competitive Bus and Bus Facilities program are not formula-based. The Bus and Bus Facilities program receives competitive funding based on asset age/condition or low-emissions bus deployment. Amtrak is the largest intercity passenger rail program, receiving operating and capital support. Other smaller discretionary programs by the Federal Railroad Administration include funding for grade crossing improvements, positive train control, and passenger rail corridor planning. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) primarily spends federal aviation funding on air traffic control operations, equipment maintenance, safety programs, and research. About 20% of FAA's funding goes towards the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), which supports development projects identified in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). AIP funding is distributed through entitlements and discretionary grants. FAA oversees the distribution of AIP entitlement funds and enforces compliance with eligibility criteria. Entitlement funds are apportioned to airport sponsors, with leftover funds available for discretionary grants. Airports compete for discretionary grants based on high national priority ratings within the Airport Capital Improvement Plan process. The Airport Capital Improvement Plan process, part of the NPIAS, involves FAA, airport sponsors, states, and planning agencies. AIP discretionary funds were often earmarked before the ban, moving projects up the priority list. However, earmarking also pushed non-earmarked projects down. Discretionary funds have set-asides for nationwide priorities like the 35% noise set-aside and the 4% Military Airport Program set-aside. Some earmarks appeared in the FAA budget's F&E account, notably for projects under the Tower/Terminal Air Traffic Control Program and the Instrument Landing Systems Program. Earmarking delayed high-priority projects according to DOT's inspector general. The Department of Transportation's inspector general found that earmarking delayed high-priority projects, while funding lower-priority projects. Aviation earmarks mainly occurred in appropriations legislation. The Federal Maritime Administration supports maritime operations and vessel construction under specific criteria. Most marine transportation capital programs, like harbor dredging, are handled by other federal agencies, not DOT. The BUILD program, replacing TIGER, is a major discretionary program supporting impactful projects nationally, in metropolitan areas, or regions. The BUILD program, funded at $1.5 billion in FY2018, supports impactful transportation projects selected by DOT based on merit criteria. Projects include highways, transit, and intercity passenger rail, with funding appropriated from the general fund. The program aims to improve safety, economic competitiveness, quality of life, environmental protection, and state of good repair. Highway, transit, and rail projects are included in a multi-year surface transportation authorization bill. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (T&I) oversees highways, transit, and rail. In the Senate, different committees handle specific aspects such as highway provisions, transit, and rail. The Ways and Means Committee in the House and the Committee on Finance in the Senate manage highway trust fund and revenue issues. Aviation reauthorization falls under the T&I Committee in the House and the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in the Senate. Appropriations for highways, transit, and aviation are managed by the appropriations committees in each house. Members of these committees oversee federal transportation spending implementation through hearings. The implementation of federal transportation spending is overseen by committees through hearings where Members can address issues important to their state or district. The process of developing a transportation authorization bill involves hearings, discussions with committee members, and engagement with DOT officials. A ban on transportation earmarks mainly affects discretionary programs overseen by DOT, with little impact on formula programs. The ban on transportation earmarks mainly affects discretionary programs overseen by DOT, allowing Congress to set funding priorities within these programs. Without earmarks, DOT is responsible for setting priorities based on grant selection criteria. One alternative to earmarks is more detailed legislative language governing fund allocation. Divergences between congressional and Administration priorities for transportation funding have arisen in the past. The George W. Bush Administration consolidated discretionary funds in highway and transit programs to focus on congestion mitigation in metropolitan areas through urban partnership agreements. Roughly $850 million was divided among five cities, including unallocated bus program funds. The Obama Administration also used unallocated funds to support its \"livability\" policy priority, integrating transportation, housing, and environmental policies. Under an earmark ban, Congress does not prioritize specific projects. This increases the importance of the programmatic selection process and criteria set by Congress. Members of Congress must now focus on influencing transportation funding through traditional avenues like involvement in transportation budgeting and interaction with federal and state officials. Formula funding becomes more critical, requiring Members to ensure their constituents' projects are included in transportation plans. Appropriations committees can increase funding for specific programs to improve project chances without earmarking. Members also have the opportunity to include provisions in appropriations legislation. Members of Congress can influence transportation funding through traditional avenues like involvement in transportation budgeting and interaction with federal and state officials. The Federal-Aid Highway Program has the largest impact on highway spending at the state and local levels. Reauthorization bills may extend existing programs, create new or revised programs, or allow programs to lapse. Members may support increased spending for programs important to their state or district, such as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. In the past, Members would also support the creation of programs that benefit their districts, states, or regions. In the absence of earmarks, highway program formulas become more important in directing the flow of highway funding. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) added factors to funding formulas based on state motorists' contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. MAP-21, passed in 2012, limited Members' ability to change formulas to benefit their districts or states. MAP-21 changed the structure of highway program formulas, consolidating them into one large authorization that is divided among states. This eliminated individual program formulas and earmarking. To increase funding for a state or district, options include raising overall funding, adjusting state amounts, creating new discretionary programs, or modifying existing ones. Federal transit programs also rely on funding formulas, which are not neutral in fund distribution. The allocation of transit funding is influenced by formulas established in authorization laws. These formulas are not neutral and can have significant effects on fund distribution. For example, changes made to the formula in 1991 and 1997 widened the distribution of funds to include rail systems built in the 1970s and 1980s. The allocation of funding among transit programs becomes more crucial in the absence of earmarks. Transit systems benefit from State of Good Repair Program funds, while rural districts benefit from Rural Area Formula Program funds. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program was heavily earmarked in the past, but now funding is distributed based on FTA criteria. The earmark ban has little impact on intercity passenger rail funding. Aviation funding is less affected by earmark bans. Members can still advocate for funding without earmarks. Members can still advocate for specific aviation projects without earmarks by adjusting entitlement formulas, increasing set-asides for noise mitigation or military airfield conversion, and influencing FAA facility and equipment priorities. The Essential Air Service Program subsidizes commercial flights. The Essential Air Service Program subsidizes commercial flights to airports that lost service under airline deregulation, without earmarks but with criteria that can be altered by Congress."
