It accounts for 85% of global economic output, with meetings focusing on financial and economic issues, and increasingly on foreign policy. The 2017 summit was marked by contention, particularly involving the United States. The 2017 G-20 summit was contentious, with the United States disagreeing with other countries on trade and climate change. Argentina is hosting the 2018 G-20 summit on October 4-5 in Buenos Aires with a theme of \"building consensus for fair and sustainable development.\" Congress oversees the Administration's involvement in the G-20, analyzing policy commitments and potential legislative actions. The report examines the coordination of economic policies, historical origins of the G-20, its operations, past summit highlights, upcoming agenda, and debates on the U.S. role and effectiveness in the forum. Since World War II, governments have utilized international institutions and informal forums for economic policy coordination. With increased economic integration, coordination has become more active and significant. Globalization brings economic benefits but also exposes economies to the effects of other countries' policy decisions. Coordination can help prevent negative outcomes like currency devaluation or import restrictions leading to declining exports. Some argue that countries should coordinate to avoid implementing harmful \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" policies. Some countries coordinate economic policies to avoid negative outcomes and enhance effectiveness. They use formal institutions like the IMF, OECD, World Bank, and WTO, as well as informal forums like the G-7 and G-20 for discussions. Coordination is crucial in open economies to address challenges collectively. Before the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, international economic discussions were primarily among a small group of developed economies. The Group of Five (G-5) was formed in the mid-1970s, which later expanded to the Group of Seven (G-7) in the mid-1980s. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G-8, but discussions on international economic policy mainly occurred at the G-7 level. Meetings among finance ministers and central bank governors preceded summit meetings. The G-7 and G-8 meetings focused on macroeconomic policies like exchange rates, globalization, and economic relations with developing countries. Discussions expanded to include global issues such as the environment, crime, drugs, AIDS, and terrorism. The Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998 highlighted the importance of including emerging economies in economic and financial discussions. The G-20 was established in 1999 as an international economic forum to coordinate between advanced and emerging economies. Emerging markets gained more influence in discussions when the G-8 partially included them in 2005. Brazil's finance minister expressed dissatisfaction with their limited participation in G-8 meetings. The G-20 was established in 1999 to coordinate between advanced and emerging economies. Emerging markets gained more influence in discussions when the G-8 partially included them in 2005. Brazil's finance minister complained about developing nations being invited to G-8 meetings only for coffee breaks. The shift from G-7 to G-20 occurred with the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, recognizing emerging markets as significant players in the international economy. France's president and Britain's prime minister pushed for a G-20 summit to discuss the economic crisis. The G-20 summit was preferred over the G-8 summit to dilute U.S. dominance and showcase international presence. G-20 meetings among heads of state are the focal points of discussions, with leaders convening annually since 2011. Finance ministers and central bank governors also meet frequently to negotiate and implement agreements. The G-20 process involves frequent meetings among finance ministers, central bank governors, and other ministers at the request of G-20 leaders. These interactions have led to complex relationships among government officials, with some concerns about administrative burden. The Department of the Treasury leads U.S. participation in the G-20 process, working closely with other agencies on various issues.

The Department of the Treasury leads U.S. participation in the G-20 process, working closely with other U.S. agencies. The G-20 does not have a permanent headquarters or staff, with a member country serving as the chair each year. The chair hosts meetings and shapes the agenda. The G-20 has a temporary secretariat that handles administrative affairs and coordinates meetings. The chair rotates among members annually, with the United States never officially chairing. Some non-G-20 members attend summits by invitation, and in 2010, five non-members were formalized to participate. The G-20 summits include representatives from various international organizations like the IMF, World Bank, and WTO. Decisions are made by consensus without a formal voting system. Participation is restricted to members and invited participants, with agreements published online after each meeting. The G-20 agreements are typically published online as communiqu\u00e9s or declarations. Unlike the WTO, the G-20 lacks formal enforcement mechanisms for its nonbinding commitments. The summits announce major policy commitments that have evolved with changing global economic conditions, expanding to cover issues beyond the financial crisis. The G-20 has expanded its scope to cover issues like development and the environment. Major highlights from past summits are presented in Table A-1. G-20 policy announcements are nonbinding, with varying levels of implementation. Initiatives include coordinating fiscal policies during the financial crisis, increasing IMF resources, and strengthening the Financial Stability Board. Progress on commitments like correcting global imbalances and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies has been slow. Tracking progress on G-20 commitments can be complex due to extended timelines, reiterated commitments, or dropped discussions. The G-20 summits involve policy reforms and attract various protesters, including environmentalists, trade unions, and anarchists. Some summits have seen violent protests, while others have been relatively quiet. The G-20 leaders have been meeting to discuss various global issues. The G-20 leaders have met 12 times since 2008, with President Trump attending the 2017 summit in Germany. Speculation focused on potential discord between Trump and other leaders due to his \"America First\" platform. Trump clashed with other countries over trade and climate change policies, withdrawing from the TPP and the Paris Agreement. The G-20 summit saw an international agreement on climate change goals, criticized by France, Italy, and Germany. The U.S. was isolated in negotiations, with disagreements on climate change highlighted in the communiqu\u00e9. The G-20 summit highlighted divisions on climate change goals, with the U.S. advocating for a different approach while other members reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement. Efforts by the U.S. to persuade countries like Australia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey were unsuccessful. Trade discussions also showed significant differences between the U.S. and European countries, with leaders like Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron defending free trade. Angela Merkel noted the challenges in trade negotiations due to differing positions. The G-20 summit highlighted divisions on climate change goals, with the U.S. advocating for a different approach while other members reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement. Trade negotiations were difficult due to the specific positions taken by the United States. The communiqu\u00e9 reaffirmed a commitment to keep markets open, reflecting priorities of the Trump Administration on reciprocal and mutually advantageous trade frameworks. The G-20 summit reaffirmed opposition to protectionism in all forms and pledged to halt and reverse protectionist measures until the end of 2018. Other agreements included addressing steel excess capacity, launching the Women Entrepreneurs Financing Initiative, and establishing a G-20 Africa Partnership for growth and development. The G-20 summit outcomes are sparking debate about U.S. leadership under the Trump Administration. Some fear U.S. isolation and abandonment of allies, while others see Trump's policies aligning with his campaign promises. Administration officials argue the summit strengthened alliances, showcasing American leadership. Argentina chairs the G-20 in 2018. Argentina is chairing the G-20 in 2018 and hosting the annual summit on October 4-5 in Buenos Aires with a focus on three key issues: the future of work, infrastructure for development, and food security. They aim to build on previous G-20 work on various topics including empowering women, fighting corruption, and climate action. Discussions at the summit are uncertain following the contentious 2017 summit where the United States was isolated on trade and climate change issues. The G-20 summit, chaired by Argentina in 2018, has been marked by divisions on trade and climate change issues, with the United States increasingly isolated. President Trump withdrew support for the G-7 communiqu\u00e9, and trade tensions have escalated among G-20 countries. Argentina's financial crisis further complicates the summit, raising doubts about the country's ability to focus on G-20 matters. The summit's usefulness is debated, with some seeing it as a vital forum for diverse countries to address differences. The G-20 summit is a vital forum for diverse countries to discuss their differences. Three scenarios for its future effectiveness have been discussed, with some believing it will continue to be effective for international economic cooperation. This is due to its inclusion of major economic players and the involvement of national heads of state in negotiations. The G-20 summit, with heads of state facilitating commitments in major policy areas, may enable cooperation on issues like climate change and trade. Optimists highlight the G-20's success during the financial crisis, making major decisions on fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform. Other international organizations were also involved in response efforts. Some skeptics doubt the effectiveness of the G-20 as a forum for international cooperation due to diverse countries with different interests and inadequate leadership in crises like the Eurozone. They argue that the G-20's composition is skewed towards Europe. Some experts argue that the G-20 is ineffective due to overrepresentation of European countries, exclusion of important emerging markets, and lack of enforcement mechanisms. Critics point out that recent G-20 declarations often reiterate commitments made elsewhere without meaningful follow-up. Some argue that the G-20's effectiveness has diminished post-crisis due to broadening issues and lack of follow-through between summits. Previous commitments are reiterated without concrete policy actions, leading to concerns about the summit's impact. The G-20's effectiveness may vary depending on the economic situation. It could be effective during economic crises when cooperation is crucial but less so when the economy is stable. The G-20 may be successful in coordinating monetary policy but less so in other issue areas. The G-20 allows central banks to discuss monetary policy issues and task international organizations with various functions. However, coordination of fiscal policies may be challenging as control ultimately lies with national legislatures, raising questions about the effectiveness of G-20 decisions on these issues.
