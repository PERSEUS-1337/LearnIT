    "content": "In this work, the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation is addressed using a deep learning approach that focuses on aligning second order statistics between source and target domains. By minimizing entropy through geodesic alignment, a source-to-target regularizer is added to the classification loss for optimal alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on domain and modality adaptation benchmarks in computer vision. Training a model with full supervision on a labeled source domain and transferring it to an unlabeled target domain is desirable in unsupervised domain adaptation. This task involves adapting the model across domains in a fully unsupervised manner due to the absence of labels in the target domain. The challenge lies in dealing with domain shift during the transfer process. Domain shift can lead to different biases when transferring a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Entropy optimization has been widely used for unsupervised domain adaptation, either through entropy regularization, explicit entropy minimization, or implicit entropy maximization via adversarial training. This statistical tool has proven to be effective for adaptation purposes. Alternatively, some methods aim to align the source and target domains by learning an explicit mapping. In domain adaptation, methods align source and target domains by learning a transformation to match data distributions. Correlation alignment minimizes distance between covariance representations of features. This paper explores the relationship between correlation alignment and entropy minimization, showing their deep connection. Additionally, a solution for hyperparameter validation is provided. This paper explores correlation alignment and entropy minimization in domain adaptation, demonstrating their connection. It provides a solution for hyperparameter validation in unsupervised domain adaptation by showing that correlation alignment minimizes the sum of cross-entropy on the source domain and entropy on the target domain. The proposed method penalizes correlation misalignments by considering the structure of covariance matrices. The paper introduces a new loss function inspired by geodesic distance for aligning second order statistics in domain adaptation. It addresses the challenge of hyperparameter validation by using an entropy-based criterion and combines it with geodesic correlation alignment in a pipeline called minimal-entropy correlation alignment. The paper introduces a new approach called minimal-entropy correlation alignment for unsupervised domain adaptation in object categorization. It combines correlation alignment and entropy optimization methods to improve classification accuracy. The paper discusses classifying images into K classes using a deep neural network. The network's parameters are optimized by minimizing the cross-entropy loss function. The inner product computes similarity between the network prediction and data labels. In unsupervised domain adaptation, adaptation is performed at the feature level by aligning covariance representations between the source and target domains. This is achieved by modifying network parameters to promote portability from the source to the target domain. The covariance representations are computed through the centering matrix J on top of activations from a given layer by the network f(\u00b7, \u03b8). A S and A T stack d-dimensional activations from the source and target domains. \u03b8 is regularized with Euclidean penalization. The aligning transformation is obtained in closed-form but is not scalable due to matrix inversion and eigendecomposition operations. A loss function is used for optimization with stochastic batchwise gradient descent. Saenko (2016) uses a loss for optimizing covariance representations that are symmetric and positive definite matrices on a Riemannian manifold. Entropy regularization is applied to optimize cross entropy on the source domain and entropy on the target domain by using soft-labels to increase model confidence in predictions. Soft-labels increase model confidence in predictions. Ancillary adaptation techniques like additional supervision, batch normalization, and probabilistic walk on data manifold are used for domain adaptation. Min-max problem is devised to minimize H(X S , Z S ) and maximize entropy in binary classification. Techniques like reversing gradients and adversarial training are employed for parallel optimizations. In domain adaptation, selecting a validation set for hyper-parameter tuning is crucial due to domain shift. Previous strategies involve adding supervision on the target or aligning the target to the source before cross-validation. However, in fully unsupervised adaptation, a fixed \u03bb is needed before correlation alignment, requiring a different approach. In unsupervised adaptation, hyper-parameter tuning is a challenge due to the inability to use previous strategies or supervised cross-validation on the target domain. This work combines correlation alignment techniques in a unique framework to align covariance representations and introduces a novel unsupervised and data-driven cross-validation technique. The section on minimal-entropy correlation alignment establishes a mathematical connection between correlation alignment and entropy minimization, showing that optimal alignment of correlation also minimizes entropy. Optimal correlation alignment minimizes entropy, providing a perfect classifier with confident predictions. Aligning the target domain with the source domain reduces entropy in both domains. The alignment implies entropy minimization, but the converse does not necessarily hold. The answer is negative as shown by a counterexample. Fully supervised training on the source can always minimize cross entropy, but optimal correlation alignment is not achieved. Theoretical analysis relies on optimal alignment, but practical implementation may fall short. In practical terms, optimal alignment is crucial for deploying domain adaptation systems effectively. However, hyper-parameters still need to be cross-validated, which is challenging in unsupervised domain adaptation. To address this, a solution involving training a deep net for supervised classification on S with a loss term based on geodesic distance on the SPD manifold is proposed. The matrices V and U diagonalize C S and C T, with corresponding eigenvalues \u03c3 i and \u00b5 i. The geodesic alignment for correlation minimizes the problem min \u03b8 [H(X S , Z S ) + \u03bb \u00b7 log (C S , C T )]. Introducing the log-Euclidean distance between SPD matrices helps learn good features for classification without overfitting the source data. When dealing with covariance operators in computer vision, the choice of geodesic distance is crucial for efficiency and performance. The hyperparameter \u03bb plays a critical role in cross-validation, as a high value can lead to oversimplified representations while a low value may not bridge the domain shift effectively. Selecting the optimal \u03bb minimizes entropy and improves classification accuracy. The hyperparameter \u03bb is crucial for efficiency in computer vision tasks. By minimizing entropy on the target domain, the proposed MECA method aims to bridge the domain shift effectively in unsupervised domain adaptation. The objective is to minimize the functional H(X S , Z S ) + \u03bb \u00b7 log (C S , C T ) through gradient descent, with \u03bb chosen by validation to achieve minimal entropy. The loss function needs to be differentiable for back-propagation in deep learning. Gradients are calculated with respect to input features using polynomial functions and the Euclidean norm. The log function allows for closed-form gradients by applying the chain rule. Modern deep learning tools use computational graphs for numerical computation. Reverse-mode differentiation in deep learning utilizes gradients of single operations for backpropagation through a computational graph. The loss function can be easily written using mathematical operations implemented in TensorFlow or other libraries. Validation experiments confirm the effectiveness of entropy-based cross-validation and the superiority of the geodesic alignment in MECA over state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised domain adaptation. In adaptation experiments, source digits from SVHN are transferred to MNIST and from SYN DIGITS to SVHN. For object recognition, a model is trained on RGB images from NYUD dataset and tested on depth images from the same categories. Correlation alignment and entropy regularization are intertwined, with a gradient descent path for correlation alignment inducing a path for entropy minimization. When aligning source and target distributions using correlation alignment with Euclidean or geodesic penalty, geodesic alignment results in lower entropy, indicating better minimization of E(X T). The baseline without adaptation minimizes entropy through overfitting the source, leading to increasingly mismatched distributions as training progresses. Optimal correlation alignment does not guarantee entropy minimization. In an experiment comparing Euclidean and geodesic alignments for source-target distribution alignment, geodesic alignment outperformed Euclidean alignment by about 5% on SVHN\u2192MNIST. The geodesic alignment achieved better covariance alignment and lower entropy, indicating superior performance in minimizing E(X T). The closed-form solution for optimal alignment can be found analytically but is not scalable due to matrix inversions, requiring error backpropagation from a penalty function during training. Our proposed geodesic alignment outperforms Euclidean alignment by 5% on SVHN\u2192MNIST. The geodesic approach minimizes entropy and maximizes performance on the target without requiring labels from the target domain. The Minimal-Entropy Correlation Alignment (MECA) method is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches for unsupervised deep domain adaptation. MECA is benchmarked against state-of-the-art frameworks for unsupervised domain adaptation with deep learning, including DSN, DTN, GRL, ADDA, TRIPLE, and Deep CORAL. Standard baseline architectures are used for comparative analysis, reproducing source only performances. Published results are reported for all cases. In benchmarking MECA against other frameworks for unsupervised domain adaptation, published results from competitors are reported, even when they had more favorable experimental conditions. Our own implementation of Deep CORAL was run due to limited published results. Cross-validation of Deep Coral on the target directly was necessary as the original approach did not yield good results. Our entropy-based cross-validation method is not always compatible with Euclidean alignment, unlike MECA which naturally embeds the entropy-based criterion in its geodesic approach. MECA maximizes performance on the target with unsupervised cross-validation. It performs solidly compared to Deep CORAL, especially when domain shift is not prominent. The alignment type is less crucial in such cases, making MECA's performance comparable to state-of-the-art TRIPLE. MECA outperforms Deep CORAL and achieves better results than state-of-the-art TRIPLE in unsupervised domain adaptation. Performance improvements are seen across various datasets, with MECA showing a significant increase in accuracy. The method utilizes labels only from the source domain during training and incorporates a more powerful feature extractor along with extra SVHN data. In this paper, a novel method called MECA is proposed for unsupervised domain adaptation. It outperforms Deep CORAL and TRIPLE, showing significant accuracy improvements on various datasets. MECA combines covariance operator alignment and a novel cross-validation approach for hyper-parameter selection, achieving superior performance without access to target labels. In the context of unsupervised domain adaptation, various methods aim to align feature representations between source and target sets. Approaches include using auto-encoders, bi-shifting auto-encoders, dictionary learning, and geodesic methods to project datasets onto a common manifold for alignment. Some methods focus on learning a smooth transition between the source and target data manifolds. In unsupervised domain adaptation, methods aim to align feature representations between source and target sets by learning a smooth transition between data manifolds. Some approaches use Principal Components Analysis and Partial Least Squares to minimize the distance between covariances for correlation alignment. Other methods implement correlation alignment through backpropagation or entropy optimization for adaptation. In unsupervised domain adaptation, methods align feature representations between source and target sets by implementing entropy minimization and adversarial training to promote entropy maximization at the classifier level. This involves navigating data manifolds through closed cyclic paths and seeking invariant feature representations for visual recognition tasks. Entropy maximization is promoted at the classifier level in unsupervised domain adaptation. Techniques like Batch Normalization are used in low-level layers to align representations, with entropy regularization applied as a complementary step. Adaptation is further refined at the end of the feature hierarchy by introducing an entropy-based regularizer on the target domain. Pseudo-labels are generated using the network's predictions. The objective is to rewrite DISPLAYFORM2 by expressing the cross-entropy function H between ground truth source labels ZS and network predictions. The optimal correlation alignment allows transferring statistical properties from the source to the target domain without performance degradation, solving the domain shift issue. If ground truth labels are provided for the target domain, DISPLAYFORM4 holds for any scenario. The target domain labels z j are obtained using DISPLAYFORM4 for any x j in the target domain T. The optimal correlation alignment ensures perfect classification on the target by making the data distributions indistinguishable. The function f (x j ; \u03b8 ) assigns 1 to x j belonging to the k-th class and 0 otherwise, leading to DISPLAYFORM5. The non-negative function E(X T ) in (16) supports the thesis in (13). The text discusses optimizing a deep neural network for supervised classification. By using the same classifier on both the source and target domains without adaptation, it is shown that the classifier achieves minimal entropy on the target domain. The text discusses optimizing a deep neural network for supervised classification. By using the same classifier on both the source and target domains without adaptation, it is shown that the classifier achieves minimal entropy on the target domain. This is evidence that optimal correlation alignment does not always imply minimal entropy. Ancillary techniques and entropy regularization are used in domain adaptation, with entropy regularization acting as a boosting factor rather than a factual regularizer. The experiments involve datasets such as SVHN, SYN, NYUD RGB, NYUD depth, and MNIST for domain adaptation. The dataset used for domain adaptation includes SVHN to MNIST shift and NYUD RGB to depth adaptation. SVHN contains real-world house numbers while NYUD dataset consists of labeled RGB images and unlabeled depth images. MNIST images were resized to 32x32 pixels and SVHN was converted to grayscale. The adaptation task involves transferring knowledge between different datasets, such as SVHN to MNIST shift and NYUD RGB to depth adaptation. It is challenging due to the diverse data nature, limited examples, and varying bounding box sizes. MECA performs better than Deep Coral in discriminating between domains."
