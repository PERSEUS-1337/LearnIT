    "content": "The Historic June 2000 Summit between South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il marked the first-ever meeting between the two countries since their division in 1945. They signed a joint declaration pledging to work towards reunification, engage in economic cooperation, and allow family reunions. Kim Dae Jung stated that Kim Jong-il agreed to maintain U.S. troops in South Korea for regional stability. The New Inter-Korean Dialogue has seen alternating bursts of meetings and lulls in public activity since the North-South summit. Interchanges between the two Koreas rapidly developed in the summer and fall of 2000, with rounds of talks, economic cooperation discussions, joint participation in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and emotional family reunions. South Korean President Kim expressed his desire to negotiate a North-South peace agreement before leaving office in February 2003, under his \"sunshine policy\" of fostering cooperation. Numerous South Korean businesses and citizens also established contacts with North Korea during this period. In October 2000, North Korea slowed down dialogue with South Korea, leading to postponed family reunions and meetings. Inter-Korean activity resumed from November 2000 to January 2001, with talks shifting to ministerial-level meetings every quarter. Kim Jong-il's business trip to China raised hopes for breakthroughs in 2001, but these were frustrated in March. In March 2001, North Korea abruptly halted inter-Korean contacts for nearly six months, linking it to the Bush Administration's calls for stricter reciprocity. Economic talks had stalled over electricity demands, military talks produced an agreement on a railroad through the DMZ, but North Korea did not ratify it. Kim Jong-il did not fulfill his promise of a return summit visit to Seoul. Inter-Korean dialogue resumed later. Inter-Korean talks resumed in September 2001 but were disrupted by the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. North Korea showed signs of wanting to improve relations with South Korea and the U.S. to avoid being labeled a terrorist sponsoring nation. However, talks broke down in November 2001 due to Pyongyang's objections to Seoul's heightened security measures and insistence on holding all future talks in North Korea. North Korea's concerns about American attacks were heightened by the Bush Administration's broadening of the definition of terrorism to include WMD development. Kim DaeJung's Cabinet expressed pessimism about future talks, with growing naval and border clashes indicating North Korea's pressure on its neighbors. Despite worsening relations with Seoul, Washington, and Tokyo, North Korea has normalized relations with China and Russia, and established ties with Western European countries to diversify its diplomatic contacts. Civilian contacts between North and South Korea have continued to expand, with some South Korean firms taking tentative steps towards investing in the North. Samsung has established a software center in Beijing with North Korean programmers and applied to open an operation in Pyongyang. Southern civic groups have increased donations to North Korea. Criticism of South Korea's Sunshine Policy, especially from the opposition Grand National Party, has grown due to tensions with North Korea. The tension between North and South Korea escalated in 2001, leading to the forced resignation of South Korea's Unification Minister and the collapse of the ruling coalition. The Grand National Party criticized President Kim for not demanding reciprocity from Pyongyang and neglecting important issues like South Korean POWs and kidnapping victims in the North. The GNP also accused Kim of not consulting with the National Assembly and suppressing domestic criticism of North Korea. President Kim's domestic support has weakened due to being perceived as a \"lame duck\" president, with jockeying for the upcoming presidential elections in December 2002 already underway. The slowing economy in 2001 has added weight to warnings against providing significant economic assistance to North Korea. The financial difficulties of the Hyundai conglomerate, especially its North Korean ventures, have been accentuated by the economic slowdown. Inter-Korean trade in 2001 fell by 9.3% year on year to $363 million. North Korea's intentions post-2000 summit remain unclear, with speculation on whether Kim Jong-il's diplomatic opening signifies genuine change or tactical maneuvers for economic gains and military preservation. The divided North Korean ruling elite adds complexity to predicting their future actions. North Korea's ruling elite may be divided, with some favoring openness and others opposing it. North Korea has steered discussions towards economic assistance in the North-South dialogue. Key events include Kim Dae Jung's \"Berlin Declaration,\" signaling economic aid for dialogue, and the first inter-Korean summit announcement.
