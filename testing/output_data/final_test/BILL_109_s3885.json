The \"Lake Traverse Reservation Act Amendments of 2006\" amends the Lake Traverse Heirship Act by defining escheatment, Secretary, and small fractional interest as related to land ownership within the reservation. The Lake Traverse Reservation Act Amendments of 2006 amend the Lake Traverse Heirship Act to address small fractional interests in land ownership. Intestate inheritance is restricted, and small fractional interests may pass to the Tribe if not devised according to the Act. The Lake Traverse Reservation Act Amendments of 2006 restrict intestate inheritance and specify that small fractional interests in land ownership can only be devised to eligible tribe members or those eligible to be members who provide proof of enrollment within 180 days. The Lake Traverse Reservation Act Amendments of 2006 allow small fractional interests in land to be devised to eligible tribe members identified by name in a will approved by the Secretary. These interests will pass to the devisee upon the testator's death, with the United States holding title in trust. The Secretary must notify owners of trust and restricted interests within the reservation of these requirements within 180 days of the enactment of the amendments. The Lake Traverse Reservation Act Amendments of 2006 allow small fractional interests in land to be devised to eligible tribe members identified by name in a will approved by the Secretary. The Secretary must notify owners of trust and restricted interests within the reservation by posting written notice, publishing in newspapers, and sending mail. After providing notice, the Secretary must certify and publish notice of the certification in the Federal Register. The subsection establishes a process for compensating and ratifying escheatments, with each escheatment ratified and held in trust by the United States for the Tribe. No court shall have jurisdiction over a claim challenging escheatments. The Secretary shall provide compensation to individuals who would have inherited land or an interest in land, taking into consideration appraisal reports prepared during probate. The Secretary will compensate individuals for land or interests in land inherited from an Indian decedent, based on probate appraisal reports or appraised values at the time of probate. Compensation will include interest calculated from the date of probate in accordance with section 3116. The Secretary will compensate individuals for land inherited from an Indian decedent based on probate appraisal reports or appraised values at the time of probate. The determination of compensation amount is subject to administrative and judicial review as per regulations.

An action for judicial review must be filed within one year of the specified date. If the deadline for a determination by the Secretary is not met, it cannot be judicially reviewed. Compensation for escheatment is the exclusive remedy. The Secretary may create necessary regulations. This section applies to escheatments only under certain conditions. The section on escheatments outlines conditions for validity and appeals. It does not affect interests or wills before a specified date."
