    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2004\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that child well-being is a top priority for the nation and states, with programs managed locally. Well-being varies across groups and can be influenced by family circumstances, the economy, social environment, and public policies. States, including small ones, require specific, timely, and consistent data on child well-being. Regular state-level data collection is crucial for both federal and state decision-making. Regular state-level data collection is essential for tracking child well-being over time at both the Federal and State levels. Telephone surveys of parents offer a cost-effective strategy to gather information on child well-being, especially for small States lacking State-level data in other federally supported databases. This data is crucial for monitoring progress towards national goals such as immunization and identifying healthcare issues for children with special needs. A State-level telephone survey can provide information on children's social and emotional development, education, health, safety, family income, family employment, and child care, including marriage and family structure. The data collected would be representative of the entire State population, informing policymaking on child welfare, education, and other important issues. Research on indicators of child well-being is emphasized in Section 3. Section 413 of the Social Security Act is amended to include the development of comprehensive indicators to assess child well-being in each State. These indicators will cover education, social and emotional development, health and safety, and family well-being. The Social Security Act is amended to include indicators for assessing child well-being in each State, covering education, social development, health, safety, and family relationships. Data collected must be statistically representative, consistent, annual, expressed as rates or percentages, nationally representative, reliable, current, and oversampled for low-income populations. The Secretary shall establish an advisory panel to recommend measures and tools for assessing child well-being based on developed indicators and collected data. The advisory panel established under subparagraph (A) shall consist of members appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and the Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives. The advisory panel established under subparagraph (A) consists of members appointed by various entities including the Chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance of the Senate, the Chairman of the National Governors Association, the President of the National Conference of State Legislatures, and others. The advisory panel, appointed by various entities, including the Director of the National Academy of Sciences, shall meet at least 3 times in the first year after the enactment of the State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2004, and annually for the following 3 years. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 is set at $15,000,000 to carry out the State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2004."
