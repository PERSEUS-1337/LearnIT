    "content": "The Constitution mandates a population headcount every ten years to adjust representation in the House of Representatives among states. The U.S. Census Bureau, under Congress's authority, administers the decennial census and other surveys. The decennial population census data serves multiple purposes, including determining representation in the House of Representatives, establishing district boundaries, allocating electoral votes for presidential elections, distributing federal and state funding, and triggering voting rights provisions. All states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico receive census data for intrastate redistricting. States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico receive census data for reapportionment and redistricting via the P.L. 94-171 census program. The Census Bureau provides decennial census figures for state-identified areas and election precincts for intrastate redistricting activities. The President transmits figures for House of Representatives apportionment to Congress and each state. While Congress is required to use census data for apportioning Representatives, states are not expressly required to use census data for intrastate redistricting, but courts have ruled that states must use the best available data. Federal court findings have raised questions over whether the Census Bureau must provide states with adjusted census data in addition to census apportionment data. The best available data principle was established in the 1969 Supreme Court decision Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, where the Court indicated that federal decennial census data were the best data available. In Senate of the State of California v. Mosbacher, the Ninth Circuit addressed whether the Census Bureau was required to provide states adjusted census data for state intrastate redistricting activities. The Ninth Circuit found that the Secretary of Commerce had no duty to provide adjusted census data under the Census Clause of the Federal Constitution or federal law. Similarly, in City of Los Angeles v. U.S. Dep't. of Commerce, the Ninth Circuit held that the Secretary of Commerce had no obligation to provide adjusted census data to states. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Secretary of Commerce was not obligated to adjust census data for redistricting purposes. There is a division among circuits regarding the release of adjusted census data under the Freedom of Information Act. The Eleventh Circuit held that adjusted data was exempt from disclosure under the Act. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Secretary of Commerce was not obligated to adjust census data for redistricting purposes. There is a division among circuits regarding the release of adjusted census data under the Freedom of Information Act. The Eleventh Circuit held that adjusted data was exempt from disclosure under the Act. States may use non-apportionment census data for redistricting, but any adjustments must be well-documented and systematic. In cases like Young v. Klutznick and City of Detroit v. Franklin, courts have addressed challenges to adjusted census data and the use of such data for redistricting purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court in Karcher held that states must use official Census Bureau population counts for redistricting, as it is the most reliable indicator of population levels. However, the District Court in City of Detroit clarified that Karcher did not mandate the use of census figures, but rather emphasized the use of the best available population data for redistricting. Federal courts have examined whether state legislatures are required to use total population data for redistricting activities, with the Supreme Court holding that the Constitution does not mandate the use of total population figures derived from the federal census as the standard of measurement. The Court has left open the question of the appropriate population basis for redistricting activities, even though total population figures have been used to determine violations of the Equal Protection Clause in previous cases. The Supreme Court found in Burns that Hawaii's redistricting plan using registered voters as a basis did not violate the Equal Protection Clause due to unique circumstances with a transient population. Total population data was not as accurate as registered voter data in reflecting the state's true population distribution. The Supreme Court in Burns upheld Hawaii's redistricting plan based on registered voters, citing unique circumstances with a transient population. While federal census figures are not required, alternate data must be justified for accuracy in redistricting. The constitutionality of using total population versus voting population for intrastate redistricting remains unaddressed. In Garza v. County of Los Angeles, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the County's argument against using total population for redistricting. Justice Thomas dissented in Chen v. City of Houston, stating that the decision should be made through the legislative process. Many states lack statutory procedures for congressional redistricting, leading to ad hoc processes by state legislatures. In states where there are no explicit statutory requirements for using official federal decennial census data for congressional redistricting, state legislatures have the freedom to use other data sources. Even if a state's laws mandate the use of official census data, it is unclear how this would apply if the Federal Government releases multiple official data sets. This issue was discussed during oral arguments in census sampling cases. If the Secretary of Commerce transmits an official adjusted data set, it could potentially be considered official census data. The Supreme Court's decision in Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives clarified that official federal decennial census data is crucial for apportionment. While Congress has not mandated the use of this data for congressional redistricting, it could potentially do so under its constitutional powers. Congress has the authority to establish redistricting guidelines for Members of the House of Representatives, including determining the times, places, and manner of elections. While the accuracy of different data sets is uncertain, Congress could potentially require specific data types for congressional redistricting. However, this requirement would not apply to state legislative or municipal districts, as long as no constitutional voting rights are violated. Sampling and estimation techniques have been controversial in the past, especially concerning data released for redistricting purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court cases regarding sampling in the census for apportionment of the House of Representatives have been controversial. In 1999, the Court ruled in Department of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives that the Census Act prohibits sampling for apportionment. This decision followed two decades of litigation over the use of sampling and adjustment techniques in census data for redistricting. Opponents of sampling claimed victory and aimed to improve the traditional headcount methods. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against sampling for apportionment of the House of Representatives in 1999. However, the decision did not prohibit sampling for other purposes like intrastate redistricting and federal funding allocations. In 2002, the Court upheld the use of hot-deck imputation in the census against a challenge by Utah. The Court upheld hot-deck imputation in the census against Utah's challenge, stating it does not violate the Census Clause or the prohibition on census data sampling for House of Representatives apportionment. The technique was deemed distinct from sampling and had been used by the Census Bureau for many censuses without Congressional intervention. The term \"actual enumeration\" in the Census Clause was highlighted as distinguishing subsequent apportionments from the first Congress, which relied on conjecture and estimation. The Census Clause and Census Act authorize Congress and the Census Bureau to determine census methods. Congress could require adjusted data from the Census Bureau. Federal case law is based on statutory interpretation, not the Census Clause. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Secretary of Commerce's decision not to include expatriate U.S. citizens in the census. The Census Bureau did not include expatriate U.S. citizens in the 2000 census data for House of Representatives reapportionment. U.S. military and federal civilian employees abroad have been included in census data for apportionment in previous years. In Franklin v. Massachusetts, the Supreme Court upheld the inclusion of overseas federal employees in the 1990 census data, resulting in a loss of one congressional seat for Massachusetts. The Supreme Court upheld the inclusion of overseas federal employees in the 1990 census data, resulting in a loss of one congressional seat for Massachusetts. The Court found that the allocation of overseas federal employees to their home states was consistent with the \"usual residence standard\" of other censuses and promoted equal representation. However, the issue of distinguishing between overseas federal employees and other expatriate U.S. citizens was not addressed in this case. The court upheld the exclusion of overseas missionaries from the apportionment count, citing various laws including the APA, RIFRA, and the Census Act. The decision resulted in Utah losing a congressional seat to North Carolina. The court found that the President's report of apportionment data was the final act in apportionment, not the Secretary's conduct of the census. It also determined that the exclusion did not violate RIFRA or the Free Exercise Clause as it did not burden the missionaries' right to exercise their religion. The court upheld the exclusion of overseas missionaries from the census apportionment data, citing relevant laws and concluding it was a rational exercise of the Secretary's discretion. Factors such as reliable records for federal employees and military personnel overseas were considered in the decision. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted studies on counting all expatriate U.S. citizens, concluding it would not be feasible or cost-effective. Bills have been introduced in Congress to include all expatriates in the census, but none have been enacted yet. The authors have written several CRS reports on topics related to the census, including the constitutionality of excluding aliens for apportionment and redistricting purposes, the 2010 Decennial Census background and issues, house apportionment in 2010, analysis of proposals for changing the House of Representatives apportionment formula, and the U.S. House of Representatives apportionment formula in theory and practice."
