    "content": "The 1985 farm bill introduced conservation provisions to reduce crop production and conserve soil and water resources. The sodbuster provision aimed to stop subsidizing producers converting erodible land to cropland without conservation systems. The wetland conservation provision denied federal benefits to producers draining wetlands for agriculture. Subsequent farm bills have amended these provisions. Since the 1985 farm bill, conservation compliance provisions have been amended in each succeeding farm bill. The highly erodible land conservation provision requires producers to implement conservation measures in exchange for federal farm benefits. This provision applies to newly broken land and highly erodible land in production after 1990, requiring an approved conservation plan for USDA program benefits. The \"swampbuster\" provision extends conservation requirements to wetland areas, making producers ineligible for USDA benefits if wetlands are converted for crop production. Activities like draining or filling wetlands can trigger non-compliance, with crop insurance subsidies also at risk. The 2014 farm bill updates wetlands conservation rules, treating wetland conversion times differently. The amendment to the wetlands compliance provision extends exemptions for violators, allowing additional time for producers to remedy wetland conversion before losing crop insurance subsidies. Exempt lands include those converted before December 23, 1985, artificially created wetlands, and wetlands created by irrigation systems. The 2014 farm bill amended the \"sodsaver\" provision to reduce benefits for crops planted on native sod in certain states. Crop insurance premium subsidies are reduced by 50 percentage points for the first four years of planting on native sod, with higher fees and reduced yield guarantees. This aims to decrease the federal incentive for converting wetlands. The conservation compliance provision applies to most farm program payments, loans, or benefits administered by FSA and NRCS, affecting all land owned by the producer or their affiliates in the US or territories. Non-compliance on one portion of land results in non-compliance for all owned land. The NRCS and FSA implement conservation compliance for USDA farm programs. FSA determines producer eligibility, while NRCS handles technical determinations. NRCS conducts compliance reviews on farm lands receiving USDA benefits to ensure compliance with conservation provisions. Tracts are randomly selected for annual reviews based on data from FSA. The NRCS conducts compliance reviews on farm lands receiving USDA benefits to ensure conservation provisions are met. Tracts are selected for review based on various factors, and violations are reported by qualified NRCS employees. Penalties for noncompliance are determined by FSA, ranging from exemptions to ineligibility for government payments. The Risk Management Agency administers the federal crop insurance program with limited responsibilities in conservation compliance implementation. The Risk Management Agency and approved insurance providers are not allowed to determine eligibility for conservation compliance. Their duties are limited to providing compliance-related records to agents and reporting any fraud or misrepresentation to FSA and NRCS. Conservation compliance provisions, tied to farm program benefits, were created in the 1985 farm bill and have been amended in subsequent bills, including the 2014 farm bill. Issues related to conservation compliance may be debated by the 114th Congress. Increased wetland determination requests have been seen due to weather events and expanded production in the northern plains states. The NRCS is facing a backlog of over 4,000 pending wetland determinations in the Prairie Pothole region, which has been reduced to less than 3,000 as of July 2016. Efforts are being made to eliminate the backlog within three years by redirecting staff and resources, but budget restrictions are hindering progress. Changes to offsite methods for wetland determinations have been proposed in four Prairie Pothole states to expedite the process. The four Prairie Pothole states are implementing changes to allow initial wetland determinations based on new mapping technology instead of on-site visits. Producers can request on-site determinations if unsatisfied. Wildlife and conservation groups have raised concerns about the accuracy of off-site methods, but NRCS officials claim the new process will be faster, cheaper, and more accurate. USDA published an interim final rule in 2015 amending conservation compliance regulations. The 2015 rule amended conservation compliance regulations in response to changes made in the 2014 farm bill, including applying conservation provisions to federal crop insurance subsidies and modifying easement provisions. The level of interest and debate surrounding these changes is expected to continue as USDA implements them. Compliance calculations, application of provisions, and exemptions were not addressed in the rule. Producers must self-certify compliance with sodbuster and swampbuster provisions to remain eligible for crop insurance subsidies. USDA reported a 98.2% certification rate in July 2015, indicating most non-certified individuals may no longer be farming or have discrepancies in their forms. Compliance violators under wetlands conservation have options for resolution. The 2015 rule amends regulations related to wetland mitigation banking and defining wetland conservation violations. Wetland mitigation banking allows for the creation, enhancement, or restoration of wetlands, with credits sold to compensate for impacted wetlands. The 2014 farm bill changes the wetland mitigation banking provision to allow third parties to hold wetland mitigation easements. The 2015 rule amended regulations related to wetland mitigation banking and wetland conservation violations. It clarified two types of violations with different consequences: production on converted wetland can result in a graduated penalty, while conversion of wetland to production can lead to a denial of all benefits. This change aimed to address confusion among producers regarding USDA's discretion in issuing penalties. The USDA's Office of the Inspector General found weaknesses in NRCS's internal controls for wetland compliance. Inconsistent application of standards, particularly regarding gully erosion, led to varied noncompliance determinations. Guidance for wetland compliance reviewers also needed updating. The role of a wetland compliance reviewer needed updating to address inaccuracies in wetland inventory maps, leading to inconsistencies across states. NRCS selects a random sample of tracts for annual compliance reviews from FSA data, but in 2015, eligible tracts were not comprehensive. FSA had omitted 10 states historically accounting for 34% of eligible tracts. NRCS and FSA agreed with OIG findings, but stakeholders have varying views on USDA's enforcement of conservation compliance provisions. Environmental organizations call for more consistent reviews, while producer organizations advocate for flexibility and additional voluntary programs incentives. The reduction in soil erosion from highly erodible land conservation continues, but at a slower pace than after the 1985 farm bill. Policy questions remain on achieving acceptable levels of soil erosion, potential additional reductions, and how federal farm policy should encourage further erosion reduction. Environmental groups suggest tightening compliance requirements, while agricultural groups prefer financial incentives through voluntary conservation programs like EQIP. In 2012, 101 million acres (28% of all cropland) were eroding above soil loss tolerance. Between 1982 and 2012, farmers reduced total cropland soil erosion by 44%, with the bulk of the reduction occurring after the 1985 farm bill and the implementation of CRP and conservation compliance requirements. Compliance provisions and land use changes, including CRP enrollment, contributed to significant reductions in soil erosion. Additionally, wetlands converted to cropland were also reduced. The impact of wetland conservation provisions is difficult to measure, unlike highly erodible land conservation. Swampbuster and other policies discourage wetland conversion, while programs like Wetland Reserve Easements aim to restore wetlands. From 1997 to 2007, the US gained 250,000 acres of wetlands, with urban development causing 60% of the loss. Conservation compliance has been controversial, with producers preferring voluntary incentive programs like EQIP. Conservation compliance, a controversial issue among producers, aims to reduce soil erosion and maintain wetlands. While it has contributed to environmental gains since the 1980s, its effectiveness in furthering conservation goals is now being questioned. Producers prefer voluntary financial incentive programs like EQIP over conservation compliance, which restricts access to federal benefits. Funding challenges may hinder the ability to increase or maintain financial incentive programs. The 2014 farm bill debate saw changes to conservation compliance, adding to its contentious nature. Prior to the 1985 farm bill, numerous soil and water conservation programs existed, reflecting a pattern of voluntary cooperation and incentive-based programs established in the 1930s. The expansion of agricultural production in the 1970s led to increased soil erosion, attributed to producers expanding into \"marginal\" land. In 1977, Congress enacted the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act (P.L. 95-192), requiring USDA to appraise the nation's natural resources. The Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act (referred to as the RCA) required USDA to appraise the nation's natural resources on nonfederal land and provide Congress with an annual evaluation report. The 1980 RCA report highlighted soil and water resource issues, emphasizing the high societal cost of soil erosion and wetland conservation due to intense production. USDA proposed \"cross-compliance\" for farmers receiving benefits to meet minimum conservation standards. In the 1985 farm bill debate, Congress aimed to increase export markets and reduce domestic production to address large-scale commodity surpluses. The 1985 Farm Bill, known as the Food Security Act, introduced significant conservation provisions to reduce production and conserve soil and water resources. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was a key component, allowing for the removal of up to 45 million acres of land from production under multi-year rental agreements. Other provisions included highly erodible land conservation (sodbuster) and wetland conservation (swampbuster), with little debate at the time. The 1985 farm bill introduced the highly erodible land conservation provision, requiring producers to implement conservation measures on certain lands to receive federal benefits. Land classified as highly erodible had to be cultivated using an approved conservation plan to be eligible for USDA program benefits, with exceptions for active conservation plan implementation by January 1, 1990. The 1985 farm bill introduced the highly erodible land conservation provision, requiring producers to implement conservation measures on certain lands to receive federal benefits. Producers had until January 1, 1995, to be fully compliant with the approved conservation plan to maintain program benefits, including price supports, farm storage loans, crop insurance, and disaster payments. The \"swampbuster\" provision extended conservation requirements to wetland areas, making producers planting program crops on converted wetlands ineligible for USDA benefits. The debate over affected wetland areas led to exemptions for certain wetlands, such as those converted before December 23, 1985, and artificially created lakes or ponds. Since the 1985 Farm Bill, subsequent bills have amended compliance provisions for highly erodible land and wetland conservation. The 1990 Farm Bill expanded conservation provisions to include wetlands converted after November 28, 1990, where agricultural production became possible through activities like draining or dredging. The 1990 Farm Bill expanded compliance provisions for wetland conservation, adding penalties for non-compliance and protecting tenant farmers. The 1996 Farm Bill aimed to make compliance programs less intrusive on farmer activities. The 1996 Farm Bill amended conservation compliance provisions to be less intrusive on farmer activities. Changes included providing producer flexibility, removing crop insurance as a penalty for non-compliance, adding production flexibility contracts as a penalty, and allowing violators up to one year to meet compliance requirements. The 1996 Farm Bill amended conservation compliance provisions to provide producer flexibility, remove crop insurance penalties, and allow violators up to one year to meet compliance requirements. Changes included expediting variances for weather, pest, or disease problems, requiring erosion measurements before implementing conservation systems, allowing third parties to measure residue, permitting plan modifications while maintaining treatment levels, granting relief for economic hardships, and establishing a wind erosion estimation pilot study. Wetland conservation provisions were also revised for greater program flexibility. The 1996 Farm Bill made major changes to conservation compliance provisions, including exempting swampbuster penalties for wetland restoration, allowing prior converted wetlands for agriculture, giving discretion to the Secretary of Agriculture for program benefits, establishing a pilot mitigation banking program, repealing consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and expanding the definition of agricultural lands. The bill also increased mandatory conservation funding levels and expanded voluntary incentive-based programs for agricultural conservation. The 2002 Farm Bill (P.L. 107-171) increased funding levels for conservation and broadened the agenda to include wildlife considerations and nonpoint source pollution from agricultural sources. The 2008 Farm Bill (P.L. 110-246) made few changes to conservation compliance provisions, with the primary change being the requirement that USDA not delegate authority for highly erodible land determinations. The 2008 farm bill added a second level of review for conservation compliance provisions and introduced the \"sodsaver\" provision under the crop insurance title. This provision made producers planting crops on native sod ineligible for crop insurance and NAP for the first five years in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area. Governors did not opt to participate in the program. The 2014 Farm Bill made changes to conservation compliance requirements by adding crop insurance premiums as a benefit that could be lost for non-compliance. Governors did not participate in the sodsaver provision, which made producers planting on native sod ineligible for crop insurance. The 2014 Farm Bill amended conservation compliance requirements by adding crop insurance premium subsidies as a consequence for non-compliance. The sodsaver provision was also modified to reduce crop insurance subsidies, expand to six states, and remove the elective option."
