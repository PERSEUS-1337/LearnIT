    "content": "Medicare Part B premiums are calculated based on program costs and can rise or fall accordingly. Social Security COLAs affect Part B premiums, and if premiums increase but Social Security benefits do not, beneficiaries must still pay the higher premium. Those enrolled in both Part B and Social Security have their premiums deducted from their Social Security checks. Railroad retirees and civil service annuitants also have their Part B premiums deducted from their monthly checks. Part B costs have been increasing by an average of 8.3% per year over the past five years. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 set Medicare Part B premiums at 25% of program costs for the aged, with a 75% subsidy from general revenues. In 2009, the standard premium was $96.40 per month, and in 2010, new enrollees faced an increased premium of $110.50. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services project a 4.8% annual increase in premiums over the next five years. In 2011, Medicare Part B premiums remained at $96.40 for those held harmless in 2010. New beneficiaries in 2010 paid $110.50 and would also be held harmless in 2011. However, new beneficiaries in 2011 would face a monthly premium of $115.40 without legislative action. Medicare physician payments are updated annually based on the sustainable growth rate formula. The sustainable growth rate formula determines Medicare physician payments annually, with congressional action preventing cuts since 2003. Recent legislation has postponed payment reductions, with concerns about beneficiary access to services. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 increased Part B costs for high-income enrollees, with premiums ranging from 35% to 80% of projected expenditures for higher-income individuals. Income thresholds for premium categories were frozen at 2010 levels through 2019 by the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act froze income thresholds for Medicare Part B premiums at 2010 levels through 2019, potentially leading to more beneficiaries facing higher premiums if income levels rise. Low-income individuals may qualify for subsidies covering some or all of their Part B premiums, with about one in five beneficiaries receiving full subsidies paid by the federal-state Medicaid program. To qualify, beneficiaries must have limited income and assets, with full subsidies available for those with incomes below 135% of the federal poverty line and assets below $4,000 for individuals or $6,000 for couples. Social Security benefits are adjusted annually to maintain purchasing power over time. The Social Security Administration announces the annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) based on inflation measured by the CPI-W. COLA reflects the percentage change in CPI-W from the previous year. Automatic COLAs began in 1975, with the lowest implemented COLA at 1.3% in 1987 and 1999. No COLA was implemented in 2010 or 2011. In 2008, the CPI-W rose sharply triggering a 5.8% COLA in 2009. Moderate inflation resumed in 2009 and 2010, but not enough to offset price declines in late 2008. The next COLA will be triggered when the CPI-W exceeds its 2008 average. Social Security Trustees project a 1.2% COLA in 2012, while CBO projects a 0.4% COLA. The average retired worker benefit in June 2010 was $1,170. According to SSA's COLA projections, it would increase to $1,184 in 2012. The CBO's projections estimate it to be $1,175. This could result in a $5-$14 increase in Social Security benefits for the average worker. However, this increase might be offset by a small Part B premium increase in 2012. Social Security beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part B have the premium automatically deducted from their benefits. Social Security beneficiaries have Medicare Part B premiums automatically deducted from their benefit checks. This applies to about 63% of beneficiaries, including those under 65, receiving low-income assistance from Medicaid, or not eligible for Medicare Part B yet. Some Medicare Part B enrollees do not receive Social Security benefits, such as certain government workers. Certain government workers and other specific categories do not receive Social Security benefits but can still enroll in Medicare Part B and pay premiums directly to CMS. A hold harmless provision reduces the Part B premium for beneficiaries if the increase would cause their Social Security check to decrease. This reduction depends on the dollar amount of the premium increase compared to their Social Security COLA. The hold harmless provision for Social Security beneficiaries depends on their payment history and Part B premium deductions. Lower-income beneficiaries receiving subsidies are not protected from premium increases, but Medicaid covers the additional costs. In 2009, 17.5% of Part B enrollees received full subsidies, with an expected increase due to the economic downturn. Higher-income beneficiaries must pay income-related Part B premiums in full, affecting about 5% of enrollees. Beneficiaries without Social Security deductions for Part B premiums, including new enrollees, are not held harmless for premium increases. Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries may see a decrease in their Social Security checks due to an increase in Medicare Part D premiums. Part D premiums are not covered by the hold harmless provision, affecting some beneficiaries with low-income subsidies. 3% of Part B beneficiaries are new to Social Security or Medicare in 2010 and are not protected by the hold harmless provision. Another 2% of Part B enrollees do not receive Social Security benefits. Since 1975, a COLA has been paid every year through 2009, but there was no COLA in 2010 and 2011. Part B premiums have increased, but about three-quarters of enrollees are held harmless and will pay the same premiums as in 2009. This will not affect beneficiaries with low-income subsidies. In 2010 and 2011, there was no COLA, and Part B premiums increased. About 27% of Part B enrollees were not held harmless in 2010. This includes lower-income beneficiaries, higher-income beneficiaries, new enrollees, and those not receiving Social Security checks. The hold harmless provision could reduce SMI trust fund income unless beneficiaries are charged different premiums. The Social Security Act allows for adjustments to Part B premiums to ensure beneficiaries contribute 25% of program costs. In 2010, three-quarters of Part B enrollees were not affected by premium increases, resulting in a significant rise in costs for the remaining one-quarter. This led to a fourfold increase in premiums for those not held harmless. In 2011, different categories of Medicare beneficiaries will pay varying amounts for Part B premiums. Those held harmless since 2009 will pay $96.40, new beneficiaries in 2011 will pay $110.50, and others will pay $115.40. Income-related premiums could range from $161.50 to $369.10. In 2011, Medicare Part B premiums for beneficiaries varied based on different categories, ranging from $96.40 for those held harmless since 2009 to $369.10 for income-related premiums. Premiums were projected to decline in the future due to a smaller group being held harmless and the introduction of income-related premiums. In 2011, Medicare Part B premiums varied based on different categories, with seven categories in total. New beneficiaries in 2010 were protected at $110.50, while those in 2011 faced a premium of $115.40. Premiums needed to increase to prevent potential trust fund exhaustion. The CMS actuaries warn of a significant risk of trust fund exhaustion during 2010-2012. Congress may need to pass legislation to prevent substantial payment cuts to physicians, which could impact Medicare beneficiary access to care. The hold harmless provision assumes Congress will override cuts, impacting low-income beneficiaries. State Medicaid programs cover Part B premiums, leading to increased costs without a Social Security COLA. The complex interaction between Social Security benefits and Medicare premiums raises various issues for seniors. Several bills before the 111th Congress address Medicare Part B financing issues due to no cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits in 2010. Representative Wexler introduced H.R. 1832, the Medicare Prescription Drug Affordability Act of 2009, to limit premium cost increases. The Act of 2009 aimed to limit premium cost increases for Medicare beneficiaries under the prescription drug program. Representative Dingell introduced H.R. 3200, which proposed suspending the requirement for Part B premium revenues to cover 25% of Medicare Part B costs, using general revenues to cover the shortfall. CBO estimated this would require additional outlays of $1.8 billion in 2010. On June 19, 2009, a provision requiring $1.8 billion in additional outlays in 2010 and $0.6 billion in 2011 was not included in the health care bill. Representative Titus introduced H.R. 3631, the Medicare Premium Fairness Act, to freeze the 2010 monthly Medicare Part B Premium at the 2009 level. This freeze would be offset by transferring $576 million from the Medicare Improvement Fund. H.R. 3631 passed the House on September 24, 2009, by a vote of 406-18. Several bills in the 111th Congress focused on providing COLA for Social Security benefits or one-time payments to beneficiaries. Several bills in the 111th Congress aimed to provide a positive COLA increase in 2010 for Social Security beneficiaries, veterans, and retired railroad workers. Representative Kagen introduced H.R. 3211, the Cost of Living Equity Act, to ensure that the COLA for Social Security benefits would not be less than the increase in compensation for Members of Congress. Representative Jones introduced H.R. 3557 for a COLA increase equal to the average of the 10 years preceding 2009. Representative Alexander introduced H.R. 3572, the COLA Assistance Act of 2009, deeming the 2010 COLA to be 2.9%. Representative DeFazio introduced H.R. 2365, the Consumer Price Index for Elderly Consumers Act of 2009, to require adjustments based on the needs of elderly consumers. Several bills in the 111th Congress aimed to provide a positive COLA increase in 2010 for Social Security beneficiaries, veterans, and retired railroad workers. Representative Deutch introduced H.R. 5834, \"Preserving Our Promise to Seniors Act,\" which includes provisions for a CPI-E that accurately tracks changes in seniors' consumption over time and bases the Social Security COLA on the CPI-E. The Social Security Administration scored H.R. 5834, assuming a 3.0% annual COLA based on CPI-E, which would worsen the long-range balance by 0.34% of taxable payroll. Senator Lincoln introduced S. 2926, the Economic Fairness for Seniors Act, including a one-time $250 payment in 2010 and requiring a study on CPI-E. Other bills also proposed one-time additional Social Security payments in 2010. Representative McCarthy introduced H.R. 3536, the Social Security Act. In 2010, Representative McCarthy introduced H.R. 3536 and H.R. 3672 to provide a one-time $150 Social Security benefit increase. H.R. 3536 would benefit 50.2 million OASDI beneficiaries with a total expenditure of $7.5 billion. Additionally, Representative DeFazio introduced H.R. 3597 for emergency relief for senior citizens. Senator Sanders introduced S. 1685, a companion bill to the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act of 2009, which would provide a one-time $250 payment in 2010 to various adult benefit recipients. Additionally, Representative DeFazio introduced H.R. 3810 for a $250 payment funded by a temporary FICA tax increase, and Representative Granger introduced H.R. 3677 for a $280 payment to certain individuals who received benefits in late 2009 and early 2010. Retirement benefit payments in December 2009, January 2010, or February 2010 would be funded by unobligated ARRA funds. Several bills were introduced to provide additional payments to seniors and veterans in 2010, with funding from unobligated ARRA monies. Representative Deutch introduced a bill to provide a $250 payment indexed to the CPI-E to Social Security beneficiaries. The bill proposes a $250 payment (indexed to CPI-E) for beneficiaries of Social Security, SSI, railroad retirement pensions, and veterans disability compensation. It also includes changes to the Social Security COLA calculation, extends the payroll tax, and raises a point of order against privatization. H.R. 5987, the Seniors Protection Act of 2010, introduced by Representative Pomeroy, aims to provide a one-time $250 payment for all Social Security beneficiaries. Representative Richardson introduced H.R. 6294, the Social Security Safety Dividend Act, proposing a $250 one-time payment for Social Security beneficiaries, including children, disabled beneficiaries, SSI recipients, railroad retirees, and veterans in 2011. Representative Rothman has also called for a one-time payment of $500 to be included. The payment would not affect federal programs or be taxed as income. Senator Lincoln introduced S. 2926, the Economic Fairness for Seniors Act, proposing a one-time $250 payment for certain individuals who received a payment under ARRA (P.L. 111-5) and a $250 tax credit for government retirees. Senator Sanders introduced S. 1685, the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act of 2009, for a $250 emergency benefit payment to eligible individuals. The bill also includes a provision for the BLS to study the accuracy of CPI-E in reflecting the elderly's cost of living. In 2010, payments totaling $13.9 billion were made to 55.6 million individuals, including adult Social Security beneficiaries. Legislation proposed to fund a one-time $250 payment through applying the Social Security payroll tax to household earnings above $250,000. The bill had minimal impact on the federal budget balance. In 2010, a proposed amendment (S.Amdt. 3353) to H.R. 4213 aimed to provide a $250 emergency payment to seniors, veterans, and persons with disabilities. Another similar amendment by Senator Burr (S.Amdt. 3390) was rejected. Speaker Pelosi, Senate Leader Reid, and the President supported the $250 payment to beneficiaries."
