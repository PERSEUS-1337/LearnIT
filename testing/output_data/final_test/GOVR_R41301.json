    "content": "The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is significantly impacting federal spending, with a focus on expanding health insurance coverage through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduction payments. The IRS reports that spending on these totaled $79.2 billion for the first three fiscal years of the ACA exchanges. Preliminary data from the Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System also sheds light on the initial impact of the ACA. The CMS data shows that in 2014, 27 states spent $36.7 billion on newly eligible adults under the Medicaid expansion, funded entirely by federal money. Additionally, $10.5 billion was spent on adults previously eligible at traditional rates. The CBO projects that total spending on ACA insurance coverage expansion will reach $1.938 trillion over FY2017-FY2026, including $866 billion on exchange subsidies and $1.063 trillion on related spending. The ACA includes subsidies for premium tax credits, cost-sharing reductions, Medicaid, and CHIP, offset by revenues from taxes and fees. Mandatory funds support grant programs and other activities, with provisions for Medicare trust fund transfers. The report provides information on the status of funds allocated under the ACA, including details on obligations and impacts of sequestration. It includes tables and discusses discretionary spending categories. The report is periodically updated to reflect legislative developments. The curr_chunk discusses provisions under the ACA grouped into various categories. Each provision is detailed in a table format with information on ACA section numbers and whether it is freestanding or amendatory. The curr_chunk provides a brief description of amendatory provisions under the ACA, detailing new programs or modifications to existing ones. It includes information on funding obligations and the administering agency within HHS. The ACA established a central repository for grants awarded by HHS agencies and offices. It includes annual appropriations for specified fiscal years, with some funds available for multiple years. Most appropriations are temporary, ending in FY2014 or FY2015, with a few extending until FY2019. The ACA established provisions for annual or multiple-year appropriations until FY2019, including indefinite appropriations with \"such sums as may be necessary.\" Table 3 details the amount available for obligation over FY2010-FY2019, organized under the same headings as Table 2. The ACA established provisions for annual or multiple-year appropriations until FY2019, including indefinite appropriations with \"such sums as may be necessary.\" Table 3 shows the total amount of appropriations or fund transfers for each provision, with some amounts yet to be determined. The law funded a broad range of new and existing programs, including short-term health care programs for targeted groups before the health insurance exchanges became operational in 2014. Prior to the health insurance exchanges becoming operational in 2014, the ACA funded programs for targeted groups, including $5 billion for the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, $5 billion for a temporary reinsurance program for early retirees, and $6 billion for the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan program. Additionally, $2.4 billion was allocated for maternal and child health programs, and funding was provided for state grants to establish health insurance exchanges. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation was established with $10 billion in appropriations for testing and implementation. The ACA allocated $10 billion for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to test innovative payment models and established the Independent Payment Advisory Board to recommend Medicare spending reductions. It also funded the Community Health Center Fund with $11 billion over five years to support federal health centers and the National Health Service Corps. The ACA funded the Community Health Center Fund with $11 billion over five years to support federal health centers and the National Health Service Corps. Congress has appropriated additional funding for the CHCF, which has partially replaced discretionary health center funding and become the sole funding source for the NHSC program. The Prevention and Public Health Fund, with a permanent annual appropriation under the ACA, supports prevention and public health programs authorized under the Public Health Service Act. Congress has reduced the ACA's annual appropriation to the PPHF by $9.75 billion for FY2013 through FY2024. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) has been used to support new grant programs authorized by the ACA and supplement annual appropriations for established programs. In FY2013, PPHF funds helped cover CMS's administrative costs for exchange operations. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) supports comparative effectiveness research with a mix of appropriations and transfers from Medicare trust funds. The Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF) has helped cover administrative costs of implementing the ACA. Most ACA appropriations are temporary. The ACA appropriations are temporary, with funding extensions, reductions, and rescissions enacted through various laws since 2012. Federal spending on insurance expansion coverage under the ACA is mostly exempt from annual sequestration. The ACA appropriations discussed in this report are sequestrable at a capped rate of 2% for cuts in CHCF funding. Only new budget authority for nondefense programs is sequestrable, while unobligated balances from previous years are exempt. The ACA provided over $100 billion in mandatory appropriations and Medicare fund transfers over a 10-year period. The ACA appropriations from FY2010-FY2019 included funding for various programs such as CHIP, PPHF, CHCF, CMMI, CO-OP, PCIP, and others. Only four appropriations were permanent, while the rest were temporary. Congress extended funding for programs whose appropriations were expiring. The ACA appropriations from FY2010-FY2019 included funding for programs like CHIP, PPHF, CHCF, CMMI, CO-OP, and PCIP. Congress extended funding for programs expiring, including health centers, National Health Service Corps, graduate medical education, home visiting program, PREP, health workforce programs, abstinence education grants, and CHIP. Funding for IPAB, PPHF, and CO-OP program was partially reduced. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established budget enforcement mechanisms to reduce federal spending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years. It set discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense, created a Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, and mandated automatic spending cuts for FY2013 through FY2021. $109 billion must be cut annually from nonexempt budget accounts, divided equally between defense and nondefense spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established budget enforcement mechanisms to reduce federal spending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years. It set discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense, created a Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, and mandated automatic spending cuts for FY2013 through FY2021. The spending reductions are achieved through sequestration and lowering discretionary spending caps. Mandatory spending cuts are executed through sequestration of nonexempt accounts, while discretionary spending reductions are achieved by lowering spending caps for defense and nondefense. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established budget enforcement mechanisms to reduce federal spending by $2.1 trillion over 10 years. Congressional appropriators decide how to apportion cuts within lowered spending caps instead of applying them across-the-board through sequestration. The Office of Management and Budget calculates required reductions in mandatory and discretionary spending each year. Congress has amended the BCA multiple times since 2011. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 extended spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015, eliminated the requirement for caps to be lowered, and extended sequestration of mandatory spending in defense and nondefense categories to FY2022 and FY2023. It also applied the percentage reduction calculated for FY2021 to those years. Additionally, a provision in a 2014 law extended sequestration to FY2024 with the same percentage reduction. New discretionary spending caps for FY2016 and FY2017 were established, and sequestration of mandatory spending was extended to FY2025 using the FY2021 reduction percentage."
