    "content": "Deep neural networks can achieve successful learning even with massively noisy labels, as shown on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. Accuracy above 90 percent is still possible with 100 noisy examples for each clean example on MNIST. The required dataset size for successful training increases with higher label noise. The need for carefully annotated datasets restricts the problems that can be addressed with deep learning. Annotation can be expensive and difficult to obtain, especially for tasks with large numbers of classes or fine-grained classes. To address this limitation, other training paradigms have been proposed. To overcome the limitations of expensive annotations, alternative training paradigms like unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning, and learning from noisy annotations have been explored. Large datasets with partial or unreliable annotations can be obtained from web sources, allowing neural networks to be trained on a wider variety of tasks with less manual effort. Deep learning approaches have shown good performance even with noisy datasets, indicating tolerance to modest amounts of noise in the training set. This study examines the performance of deep neural networks under extremely low label reliability, envisioning a future where large amounts of data can be easily obtained but with labels only slightly above chance. Deep neural networks can effectively learn from data with noisy labels, even with label accuracy as low as 1 percent above chance. Performance remains high, exceeding 90 percent on MNIST, despite the presence of label noise. A large training set can accommodate varying levels of noise, with the minimum dataset size needed for effective training increasing with noise level. The size required for effective training increases with the noise level. A large training set can handle a wide range of noise levels. Adjusting batch size and learning rate can help neural networks operate in high label noise regimes. Dataset noise can be compensated for by larger batch sizes and scaling the learning rate. Learning from noisy data involves noise-robust algorithms and approaches to learn directly from noisy labels. The second group of methods focuses on label-cleansing to remove mislabeled data. They use semi-supervised approaches to combine noisy data with clean labels. Some models treat label noise as conditionally independent from input images, while others propose image-conditional noise models. This work does not aim to clean the training dataset or propose new noise-robust algorithms but instead studies the behavior of neural networks in settings with massive label noise. Neural networks can learn from data diluted by label noise without explicit cleaning or noise-robust algorithms. Research focuses on analyzing the robustness of neural networks, including the redundancy of network architectures with residual connections. Studies show that small changes in input during training can lead to misclassification, emphasizing non-adversarial noise. In contrast to previous studies on noisy training datasets, this work focuses on the impact of abundant data with poor label quality on deep neural networks for multiclass classification tasks. The study shows that a decrease in the number of correct examples is more detrimental to learning than an increase in noisy labels. In this study, the impact of adding noisy labels to a training set with abundant data is explored. By diluting the dataset with noisy examples, the total number of noisy labels increases, but the available number of original examples remains constant. Even with high noise levels, there is still valuable data to learn from. The study contrasts previous work by showing that a decrease in correct examples is more harmful to learning than an increase in noisy labels. The study explores the impact of adding noisy labels to a training set with abundant data. Even with high noise levels, valuable data is still present for learning. The experiments investigate different types of noise and suggest that unreliable labels are better modeled by a stochastic process rather than an adversary. Deep neural networks are shown to be sensitive to non-adversarial noise patterns. In this work, the study demonstrates that neural networks are resilient to non-adversarial noise, even when correct labels are outnumbered by randomly sampled labels. Experiments on image classification tasks using MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet datasets show varying levels of label noise do not significantly impact classification performance. In experiments with the dataset ImageNet, neural networks with different architectures were compared, showing high accuracy even in the presence of noisy labels. Results indicate over 90% accuracy on MNIST, over 85% on CIFAR-10, and over 70% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, demonstrating the resilience of deep networks to noise. The study shows that larger neural network architectures are more robust to label noise, with the ConvNet performing better than a perceptron or multilayer perceptron on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The accuracy of the residual network drops off more slowly than smaller ConvNets on CIFAR-10, indicating the resilience of deep networks to noise. The study demonstrates that larger neural networks, like ConvNets and ResNets, are more robust to label noise. Structured noise can impact neural network performance, with uniform noise showing a higher likelihood of correct labels. The study shows that larger neural networks are more robust to label noise, with structured noise impacting performance. Noise can be biased towards certain classes, parameterized by \u03b4 to induce structure. Three setups for structured noise are investigated on MNIST, varying \u03b4 from 0 to 1. The study demonstrates that deep neural networks are resilient to structured noise, with larger networks showing more robustness. Different models of noise structure do not significantly impact performance, but bias towards random classes slightly decreases performance compared to bias towards confused classes. This finding helps explain why real-world noisy datasets often yield good results. In experiments, label noise is biased towards related and confusing classes. Training sets were diluted with noisy examples from the same dataset, drawn from other categories. Performance is similar to uniform noise, except for highly skewed noise. Noisy labels from CIFAR-100 resulted in only half the drop in performance compared to CIFAR-10. In experiments, label noise is biased towards related and confusing classes. Training sets were diluted with noisy examples from the same dataset, drawn from other categories. Noisy labels from CIFAR-100 resulted in only half the drop in performance compared to CIFAR-10. Two alternative sources for noisy training examples are considered: diluting the training set with examples from a different dataset (CIFAR-10 diluted with CIFAR-100) and diluting with white noise. Results obtained by a six-layer ConvNet on different noise sources for varying levels of noise are shown in FIG5. The study compared the performance of a six-layer ConvNet on different noise sources, showing that alternative sources of noise outperformed noise from the same dataset. Performance dropped less with noisy examples from CIFAR-100 compared to CIFAR-10. White noise did not affect performance regardless of noise level, indicating a worst-case scenario in the experiments. In experiments with label noise, different learning rates were tested for optimal performance. Higher label noise levels required more clean training data to achieve high accuracy. For example, at \u03b1 = 10, 2,000 clean labels were needed for 90% performance, while at \u03b1 = 50, 10,000 clean labels were required. In experiments with label noise, different learning rates were tested for optimal performance. Higher label noise levels required more clean training data to achieve high accuracy. Specifically, noisy labels were drawn from the same dataset as the correct labels, either with repetition or without repetition. The results showed comparable performance between repeated and unique examples, supporting the setup in the preceding experiments. This highlights the ability of deep networks to learn from massively noisy data. The ability of deep networks to learn from massively noisy data is underpinned by the size of the data. Traditional deep learning relies on large datasets, especially true for noisy datasets. Performance of a ConvNet on MNIST varies with the size of the training set and the presence of noisy labels. More data benefits network performance regardless of noise level, with similar results achieved given sufficient data. The results suggest a critical amount of clean training data is needed for successful network training, which increases with noise level. Training networks for \u03b1 100 is not attempted due to the potential need for more than 60,000 correct examples. In real-world datasets, factors like training time and learning rate may be more limiting than data availability. Increasing batch size improves noise robustness in neural network training. Larger batches cancel out noisy label gradients while summing correct examples, aiding learning. This behavior suggests that larger batch sizes are more resilient to noise. In neural network training, larger batch sizes are more robust to noise as they cancel out noisy label gradients while summing correct examples, aiding learning. Theoretical infinite batch sizes can be simulated with an auxiliary loss function. When training with noisy labels, the label approximation to the true label improves with larger batch sizes. The noisy loss function H \u03b1 can be used for training without noisy labels, minimizing noise contribution as \u03b1 increases. Increasing noise in the training set reduces the effective batch size, as noisy signals cancel out, leaving only a small learning signal. Increasing batch size is a practical way to mitigate the effect of noisy training labels in deep neural networks. It has become common practice to scale the learning rate with the batch size. In experiments, noisy labels reduce effective batch size, leading to lower optimal learning rates. Performance of ConvNet on CIFAR-10 decreases with increasing label noise. Counterbalancing label noise can be achieved with larger training batch size and scaled learning rate. In experiments, deep neural networks show robustness to label noise with a sufficient number of clean labels. Noisy labels reduce effective batch size, but this can be mitigated by larger batch sizes and scaled learning rates. Clean labels consistently outperform noisy labels with the same amount of training data. Our studies focus on non-adversarial noise and suggest future directions for investigating how label-cleaning and semi-supervised methods impact network performance in high-noise environments. The results aim to provide a trade-off between data annotation and acquisition costs for training deep networks on noisy data."
