    "content": "The House and Senate approved the FY2010 budget resolution with reconciliation instructions to reduce the deficit by $1 billion. The House Education and Labor Committee reported H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, which passed in the House on September 17, 2009. H.R. 3221, passed by the House in 2009, would amend the HEA by terminating FFEL program loans after June 2010, resulting in significant mandatory spending reductions. All student loans under Title IV of the HEA would then be made under the DL program starting July 1, 2010. Beginning July 1, 2010, a new Federal Direct Perkins Loan would be offered under the DL program, with loan authority totaling $6 billion annually allocated among eligible institutions of higher education. Indefinite mandatory appropriations would be provided for the Federal Pell Grant program starting in FY2010, supplementing annual discretionary appropriations and increasing the maximum award. Starting in AY 2011-2012, Pell Grant award increases would be tied to CPI-U plus one percentage point. Simplification of HEA federal student aid analysis and elimination of asset reporting on FAFSA. Mandatory funding for HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions until FY2019. Creation of HEA College Access and Completion Innovation Fund with programs like College Access Challenge Grant and State Innovation Completion Grants. The proposal includes mandatory funding for various grant programs aimed at modernizing school facilities, improving early childhood education standards, reforming community colleges, and enhancing workforce development. The \"Defund ACORN Act\" aims to prevent organizations with violations in campaign finance, election, or voter registration laws from receiving federal grants. CBO estimates savings of $41.8 billion over FY2009-FY2014 and $86.8 billion over FY2009-FY2019 from terminating the FFEL program lending. Overall, H.R. 3221 would reduce mandatory spending by $13.3 billion over FY2009-FY2014 and $7.8 billion over FY2009-FY2019. CBO estimates that enactment of the proposals in H.R. 3221 would increase discretionary spending by $3.6 billion over FY2009-FY2014 and $13.5 billion over FY2009-FY2019. Most of these costs would be for administrative expenses related to DL program lending and Pell Grant awards. Table 1 shows authorized funding for programs under H.R. 3221. The report provides descriptions of programs amended or established by the bill, starting with changes to programs under the HEA. The report reviews changes to programs authorized under the HEA and new non-HEA programs funded by H.R. 3221. The Federal Pell Grant program is the largest federal grant aid source for low-income undergraduate students, providing around $25 billion to over seven million students. Pell Grants are need-based aid with no set income threshold for eligibility, primarily benefiting students with low incomes. The Federal Pell Grant program provides need-based aid to low-income undergraduate students. In the most recent award year, 83% of dependent recipients had parental income below $40,000, while 84% of independent recipients had income below $30,000. The program is funded through discretionary and mandatory appropriations, with the maximum award amount set annually. For AY2009-2010, the maximum award is $4,860, with an additional mandatory increase of $490. Students must qualify to receive the additional increase. The Federal Pell Grant program provides need-based aid to low-income undergraduate students. For AY2009-2010, the maximum award amount is $4,860 with an additional mandatory increase of $490. To qualify for the increase, students must meet certain criteria. H.R. 3221 includes provisions to change how future additional mandatory Pell Grant amounts are determined, increasing direct spending with permanent mandatory budget authority. The CBO baseline for mandatory spending on Pell Grants includes approximately $30.3 billion from FY2010 to FY2017. H.R. 3221 includes provisions to change how future additional mandatory Pell Grant amounts are determined, increasing direct spending with permanent mandatory budget authority. The CBO estimates an increase of $38.7 billion in direct spending from FY2010 to FY2019 due to these provisions. The bill includes provisions to increase the annual Pell Grant maximum award starting in AY2010-2011, with a new formula established for determining the additional mandatory amount each year. The additional mandatory amount for AY2010-2011 would be $690, and a new formula would be used for subsequent years. The bill includes provisions to increase the annual Pell Grant maximum award starting in AY2010-2011. A new formula would be established for determining the additional mandatory amount each year, with adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. The bill proposes increasing the annual Pell Grant maximum award starting in AY2010-2011 with a new formula based on the Consumer Price Index. Future total maximum award levels are uncertain due to factors like annual discretionary appropriations and CPI-U changes. A new rule for AY2012-2013 onwards ensures the additional mandatory Pell Grant award amount is not less than the prior year's mandatory award. H.R. 3221 proposes changes to Pell Grant award rules, eliminating specified award amounts and introducing a new formula for determining maximum award amounts starting in AY2010-2011. Qualification for Pell Grants would be based on the total maximum award amount, removing the requirement to qualify for a minimum appropriated Pell Grant award. H.R. 3221 proposes changes to Pell Grant award rules, eliminating specified award amounts and introducing a new formula for determining maximum award amounts starting in AY2010-2011. The new minimum Pell Grant award would be based on 5% of the total maximum Pell Grant award, expanding qualification parameters to allow more students to receive it. The requirement for the Secretary of Education to adjust additional mandatory Pell Grant amounts based on budget authority would be eliminated, affecting only AY2009-2010. Clarifications would be made regarding eligibility for Year-round Pell Grants. H.R. 3221 proposes changes to Pell Grant award rules, including clarifications on Year-round Pell Grants. Pell Grant recipients making satisfactory academic progress can receive up to two grants in a single award year. The Department of Education administers federal student loan programs under Title IV of the HEA, including the FFEL program, DL program, and Perkins Loan program. Changes to these programs are outlined in H.R. 3221. The FFEL program involves private lenders making student loans with federal government guarantees and subsidies. Approximately 4,500 institutions participate in the program, with an estimated $64 billion in new loans to be made in FY2009. The DL program, on the other hand, has the federal government directly lending to students and families. The federal government acts as the lender in the Direct Loan (DL) program, providing loans to students and families using funds from the U.S. Treasury. Schools or Department of Education contractors may originate the loans, with servicing and collections handled by contractors. Approximately 1,500 institutions participate in the DL program, with an estimated $21.8 billion in new loans to be made in FY2009. By the end of FY2009, outstanding DL program loans are estimated to reach $146 billion. The DL program offers Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. The Federal Perkins Loan program is part of the campus-based student financial aid programs, providing loans to students with exceptional financial need. Institutions receive federal capital contributions to capitalize revolving loan funds, offering 5% interest rate loans to eligible students. H.R. 3221 would amend the FFEL program by terminating new loans after June 30, 2010. All new loans would be made under the DL program starting in AY2010-2011. Existing FFEL program loans would still be serviced by holders, and guaranty agencies would continue to administer federal loan insurance. The termination of lending under the FFEL program and the shift to all federal student loans being made under the DL program would result in a reduction of $40.7 billion in mandatory spending over the period from FY2009 through FY2014, and $74.8 billion in mandatory spending over the period from FY2009 through FY2019. This change would also shift approximately $7.2 billion in administrative costs from mandatory spending under the FFEL program to discretionary spending under the DL program. Additionally, H.R. 3221 would change the index used in determining the SAP paid quarterly to lenders under the FFEL program. The 1-month LIBOR-based SAP rate would align with short-term borrowing costs for FFEL program loans, with a negligible impact on spending. It would apply to new loans made between enactment and FFEL lending termination, and as a substitute rate for the 3-month CP rate in participant yield calculations. H.R. 3221 would amend the Higher Education Act to transition new student loans to the Direct Loan program starting July 1, 2010. Changes include fixed interest rates for Subsidized Stafford Loans and reductions in interest rates for loans made in specific academic years. Interest rates on Subsidized Stafford Loans for undergraduate students are set to decrease to 4.5% for AY2010-2011 and 3.4% for AY2011-2012. H.R. 3221 proposes making loans for AY2012-2013 and later variable rate loans, adjusting annually based on Treasury bill rates. H.R. 3221 aims to amend contracting procedures for servicing federal student loans, including Direct Loans. The proposal includes set-asides for not-for-profit servicers in states where they operate, requiring the Secretary to contract with them to service loans for students attending in-state institutions. Each not-for-profit servicer must meet the Secretary's standards for loan servicing. The contract for servicing student loans by not-for-profit servicers would be compensated at a commercially reasonable rate determined by the Secretary. In states with one eligible servicer, they would have servicing rights for a certain number of borrowers annually. In states with multiple eligible servicers, they would share servicing rights based on the number of borrowers attending in-state institutions. H.R. 3221 requires the Secretary to award multiple contracts to eligible servicers through a competitive bidding process for servicing loans made to borrowers attending out-of-state and foreign institutions. The bidding process considers price, capacity, default aversion activities, and job retention incentives for hiring in the U.S. based on past FFEL program activities. H.R. 3221 authorizes the Secretary to award contracts for services under the Direct Loan program to entities that previously provided services under the FFEL program. These services include delinquency prevention, default aversion, financial aid counseling, and outreach services for eligible students enrolled in foreign schools. H.R. 3221 extends Direct Loan program loans to eligible students in foreign schools, provides funding for technical assistance, requires outreach activities to inform students about the transition, and terminates the authority for new Perkins Loans. H.R. 3221 would terminate new Perkins Loans under the HEA and establish Federal Direct Perkins Loans under the Direct Loan program with similar terms as Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. $6 billion in Federal Direct Perkins Loan aid would be allocated annually to participating IHEs. The Direct Loan program would establish Federal Direct Perkins Loans for participating IHEs, requiring them to pay matching funds quarterly. Loan authority would be allocated based on self-help need and a low-tuition incentive amount. The Federal Direct Perkins Loan program would allocate loan authority to participating institutions based on tuition and fees, Pell Grant recipients, and past Perkins Loan awards. No new federal capital contributions have been made in recent years. The proposed allocation formula for Federal Direct Perkins Loans would prioritize financial need, tuition affordability, need-based grant aid, and success in graduating Pell Grant recipients over base guarantees. Institutions previously in the program would receive new loan authority equal to their average annual Perkins Loan amount over the past five years. H.R. 3221 would amend the Perkins Loan program to require institutions to distribute assets from their revolving loan funds and assign all loans to the Secretary starting July 1, 2010. The Secretary would then be responsible for servicing and collecting these loans, refunding institutions for the proportion made from institutional capital contributions. H.R. 3221 would amend HEA provisions regarding the return of Title IV funds for students withdrawing due to military service, waiving the amounts to be returned and canceling outstanding federal student loan balances used for periods of enrollment without academic credit. This applies to service periods after the enactment date. The federal \"need analysis\" system determines financial aid for students based on FAFSA data, calculating the expected family contribution and financial need. Financial aid administrators package aid based on students' need and cost of attendance. The Higher Education and Opportunity Act (HEOA) amended the HEA to authorize the EZ-FAFSA for qualifying students, simplifying the federal student aid application process. The HEOA aims to reduce the number of questions on the FAFSA for certain applicants and streamline the application for reapplications, with a goal of reducing required data elements by 50%. The Secretary is tasked with determining how IRS data can be utilized in this process. The HEOA amendments authorize the use of IRS data to pre-populate the FAFSA, simplifying the need analysis methodology and removing certain information requirements. This would increase direct and discretionary spending for loan and grant aid by $7.1 billion from FY2011 to FY2019. Provisions in H.R. 3221 would limit eligibility for need-based federal student aid programs based on a defined level of net assets, effective July 1, 2011. H.R. 3221 would limit eligibility for Pell Grants and Subsidized Stafford Loan assistance based on a defined level of net assets, effective July 1, 2011. The combined total of net assets valued at $150,000 or less would be the threshold for eligibility. The Secretary would annually adjust the net asset cap level based on the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, the bill would eliminate the requirement for students to report asset-related information for federal student aid programs. Effective July 1, 2011, students no longer need to report asset-related information on the FAFSA for Federal Pell Grant and Federal Direct Stafford Loan eligibility. This change eliminates up to six questions on the FAFSA and simplifies the application process. The definition of untaxed income and benefits used in determining the EFC for need analysis was revised on July 1, 2011. The new definition includes only three elements: interest on tax-free bonds, untaxed portions of pensions, and payments to retirement accounts excluded from income for federal tax purposes. Several elements were eliminated from the definition, such as child support received, workman's compensation, veteran's benefits, housing and food allowances, cash support, and other untaxed income. This change eliminates up to nine questions from the FAFSA. The new definition of untaxed income and benefits, effective July 1, 2011, would result in a lower EFC for many applicants, leading to additional federal student aid. H.R. 3221 also clarifies that an employee pension benefit plan is not included in the definition of assets for need analysis. Additionally, periods of ineligibility for federal student aid due to drug-related offenses would be eliminated for students enrolled in college. Revising the FAFSA question to address only students convicted of selling controlled substances while receiving federal student aid would reduce follow-up correspondence. Students under 24 or enrolled at an IHE when their parent/guardian died in the line of duty as a public safety officer would have an automatic $0 expected family contribution for Pell Grant eligibility. H.R. 3221 proposes allowing an auto-zero EFC for qualifying students, potentially increasing their eligibility for federal, institutional, and state student aid. Changes to institutional eligibility requirements for Title IV programs are also included, with temporary adjustments to the 90/10 rule expiring in 2012. H.R. 3221 extends the period for compliance with the 90/10 rule by one year to July 1, 2012. It allows funds from the Federal Direct Perkins Loan program to count towards the 10% requirement from July 1, 2010, to July 1, 2012. Proprietary institutions get an extra year to comply before facing provisional status for two years. H.R. 3221 extends compliance period for 90/10 rule by one year. Proprietary institutions given three consecutive years to comply before losing Title IV eligibility. Establishes program for competitive grants to improve teacher excellence in schools. Grants for professional development, mentoring programs, and career advancement for teachers. Amends HEA, Title III, Part F for annual provision. H.R. 3221 would amend HEA, Title III, Part F to annually provide $255 million in mandatory funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving institutions (MSIs) for FY2010 through FY2019. Additionally, it would provide $100 million in mandatory funding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and the Yes Partnership Grants Program for the same period. The bill would allocate $100 million in mandatory funding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and the Yes Partnership Grants Program. HSIs would have expanded authorized activities, including those promoting STEM degree completion. The Yes Partnership Grants Program aims to encourage minority and low-income students to pursue STEM careers through matching grants to partnerships. Funds have not yet been appropriated for the program. ED would be instructed to add a mandatory allocation for predominantly Black institutions. The bill allocates funding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and the Yes Partnership Grants Program to promote STEM degree completion. Additionally, mandatory allocations are proposed for predominantly Black institutions, Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions (AANAPIs), and Native American-serving Nontribal institutions (NASNTIs) under HEA, Title III-F to administer a single grant program for each type of Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). The programs support educational opportunity and institutional capacity building through formula and competitive grants. H.R. 3221 proposes amending Part E of Title VII of the HEA to establish the College Access and Completion Innovation Fund (CACIF), which includes the College Access Challenge Grant Program (CACG) and aims to promote success in postsecondary education and improve employment outcomes. Private, nonprofit institutions of higher education could voluntarily participate in the fund. The College Access and Completion Innovation Fund (CACIF) under H.R. 3221 allows private, nonprofit higher education institutions to participate voluntarily. It does not grant state control over various aspects of education and allocates $600 million annually from FY2010 to FY2014. Funding is divided among different programs within CACIF. The College Access and Completion National Activities program allocates funding for various programs, including the CACG program and the State Innovation Completion Grants program. H.R. 3221 aims to increase funding for the CACG program to $150 million annually from 2010 to 2014 and establish the State Innovation Completion Grants program to improve postsecondary persistence and completion rates. The program aims to provide financial aid to students through partnerships with nonprofit organizations, guaranty agencies, and subsidiaries. States must match federal funds and allocate a portion to students in pre-baccalaureate programs. They must also submit an Access and Completion Plan to increase postsecondary persistence and completion rates, addressing labor market needs. H.R. 3221 aims to create an Innovation in College Access and Completion National Activities program to provide competitive grants to various entities for advancing policies that increase postsecondary degrees. Priority is given to applicants serving underrepresented students and public institutions offering pre-baccalaureate degrees. The Innovation in College Access and Completion National Activities program, established by H.R. 3221, provides grants to entities promoting STEM degree completion, postsecondary completion for veterans and dislocated workers, financial literacy, and support services for underrepresented populations. The minimum grant award is $1 million, and the program requires evaluation by January 30, 2016. Additionally, the bill amends the Model Programs for Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success program under the Higher Education Act to award three-year grants to institutions of higher education. The revised program under the Higher Education Act would award three-year grants to institutions of higher education to develop model programs or hire a Veterans' Resource Officer to support veteran student success in postsecondary education. Activities for grantees developing model programs include establishing support services, a veteran student support team, monitoring academic success rates, and creating a sustainability plan. The Veterans' Resource Officer would serve as a liaison between veteran students and staff, organize activities, and distribute information. The Model Programs for Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success program, authorized under the Higher Education Act, would receive $10 million for FY2010 for the Cooperative Education Program. This program awards grants to institutions of higher education to develop work experiences integrated with academic programs. No funds have been provided for the program since its authorization. H.R. 3221 would authorize funding for three categories of programs under the SAFRA, including Modernization, Renovation, and Repair programs for education facilities, the Early Learning Challenge Fund for early childhood education, and the American Graduation Initiative for community colleges. Additionally, the bill would establish new grant programs for the modernization, renovation, and repair of education facilities. H.R. 3221 authorizes new grant programs for school facilities modernization, renovation, and repair, as well as for community college construction. Funding of $2.020 billion annually for FY2010 and FY2011 is allocated for the school facilities program, with most funds distributed through formula grants to states based on previous ESEA Title I-A program allocations. H.R. 3221 allocates $30 million annually for FY2010 and FY2011 for Supplemental Grants for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. These grants are provided to LEAs based on the infrastructure damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina or Rita. Funds can be used for construction, modernization, renovation, or repair of public school facilities. H.R. 3221 includes provisions for elementary and secondary education grant programs, requiring LEAs to use American-made materials, adhere to Davis-Bacon Act wage rates, and allocate funds for green building projects. It also mandates collaboration between the Secretaries of Education and Labor for youth and community college students in green building programs. Additionally, the bill establishes a new Federal Assistance program for community college modernization and construction. The bill includes a new formula grant program for constructing, modernizing, renovating, and repairing facilities at two-year colleges and facilities used by students seeking pre-baccalaureate degrees at four-year institutions. $2.5 billion would be appropriated for FY2010, with funds available until expended. Grants could be used to reduce financing costs, provide matching funds for capital campaigns, or capitalize a revolving loan fund for facility projects. The bill proposes a grant program for constructing, modernizing, renovating, and repairing facilities at eligible institutions primarily used for instruction, student housing, or research. Funds must meet green building/energy rating standards and adhere to Davis-Bacon Act wage rates. Institutions cannot receive funding from this program and other programs under the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009 simultaneously. Funds would be allocated to states based on the number of students seeking pre-baccalaureate degrees or certificates. Grant amounts cannot exceed 25% of loan principal for reduced financing costs. H.R. 3221 authorizes the Early Learning Challenge Fund, providing competitive grants to states to improve early learning programs for children up to age five. The program would receive $1 billion annually for FY2010-FY2017, distributed as Quality Pathway Grants for states showing progress in early childhood education, and Development Grants for other states. Grant amounts cannot exceed 25% of loan principal for reduced financing costs or private donations raised in a capital campaign. The Development Grants would be for up to three years and nonrenewable, for states not meeting Quality Pathway Grants criteria. States receiving grants must submit annual reports, meet maintenance of effort and matching requirements. The Secretary must submit annual reports to relevant committees. Funds would be reserved for administration, research, evaluation, and competitive grants to Indian tribes. The remaining funds would be allocated as competitive grants to states. Beginning in FY2010, funds were allocated for Pathways Grants and Development Grants. Quality Pathways Grants could use up to 65% of remaining funds until FY2012, increasing to 85% from FY2013. States prioritized improving early learning programs for low-income children. States making progress could reserve up to 25% of their grant for expanding access to high-quality programs. At least 65% of the grant had to be used for initiatives to enhance early learning programs for disadvantaged children. Initiatives focus on improving early learning providers' credentials, program quality, financial incentives for quality improvements, classroom assessments, professional development, integrating standards, family involvement, and enhancing program capacity for screening and services. The Development Grants aim to support states in developing early learning systems to become eligible for Quality Pathways Grants. Grants can be used for activities such as enhancing data systems, oversight systems, and measuring school readiness. Priority is given to states improving early learning systems. The Quality Pathways Grants aim to improve the quality of early learning programs for low-income children. The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a national commission to review and recommend benchmarks for program quality. Additionally, a research collaborative will support in-depth research into early learning standards and licensing requirements. The national commission will evaluate barriers to increasing access to high-quality early learning programs within 18 months. H.R. 3221 aims to improve education and training for workforce development by establishing two major grant programs for community colleges. The first program provides $630 million annually for FY2010 through FY2013 to fund programs that improve completion rates and train workers for skilled occupations. The second program provides $630 million annually for FY2014 through FY2019 to states to implement effective reforms. Additionally, $50 million would be provided annually for other initiatives. H.R. 3221 includes funding for online education programs, research, evaluation, and data system programs, and grants for community college reform. The Secretary of Education would administer the funds in collaboration with the Secretary of Labor. The bill includes funding for innovative programs leading to postsecondary credentials in high-demand industries. Eligible entities for grant funding include community colleges, technical education schools, and four-year institutions. Grantees must carry out at least two of ten specified activities. The bill provides funding for programs in high-demand industries at community colleges, technical education schools, and four-year institutions. Grantees must implement at least two of ten specified activities to increase degree and credential completion rates. The legislation aims to address state workforce needs by providing IT training through community colleges, enhancing programs for skilled occupations in energy-related fields and occupations serving veterans. Priority will be given to applications focusing on collaboration with business or labor organizations, serving low-income or nontraditional students, and developing measurable benchmarks for program effectiveness. H.R. 3221 aims to provide $630 million in mandatory funds annually for FY2014-FY2019 for Grants to Eligible States for Community College Programs. The grants would support systematic reform of community colleges by implementing effective programs and policies, with a focus on measuring progress and transferability of credits. Additionally, a maximum of 2% of the funds would be allocated for program evaluations by the Institute of Education Sciences. H.R. 3221 would provide $50 million annually for FY2010-FY2019 for the Grants for the Open Online Education program. States receiving grants must allocate 90% to community colleges and develop benchmarks for program effectiveness. The Secretary of Education can award competitive grants for online education and training. H.R. 3221 aims to develop and evaluate freely-available online education courses with $50 million in annual funds for Grants for the Learning and Earning Research Center and State Systems programs. Grants would be awarded for evaluating community colleges, measuring student outcomes, and establishing statewide data systems for tracking community college data over time. The State Systems grant supports the development of longitudinal data systems and a model for credit transferability between colleges. Title VI of H.R. 3221 prohibits federal funding for organizations indicted for campaign finance violations. Title V applies these provisions to ACORN specifically. Title V of H.R. 3221 applies provisions regarding federal funding to ACORN and its affiliates."
