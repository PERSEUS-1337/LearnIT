Municipal governments issue bonds to finance capital facilities or for cash management. Taxpayers benefit from these facilities over time, making it financially sensible to pay for them gradually. Taxpayers benefit from municipal bonds used to finance capital facilities over time, matching payments to services. State and local governments must plan budgets in advance, balancing revenue forecasts with service demand. Unforeseen circumstances may lead to revenue shortfalls, requiring short-term borrowing. The federal government grants state and local governments a unique privilege by exempting interest income earned on bonds from federal income tax. This lowers the cost of capital for state and local governments, encouraging an increase in capital formation. State and local governments can raise capital from investors at a lower interest cost by issuing tax-exempt bonds, which offer a 6.5% return equivalent to taxable bonds with a 10% rate before taxes. The difference in interest rates between taxable and tax-exempt bonds, known as the yield spread, has decreased over time. The yield spread between tax-exempt and taxable bonds has decreased as interest rates have declined. The yield ratio adjusts the spread for interest rate levels, with a lower ratio indicating greater savings for state and local governments. Demand for tax-exempt bonds depends on factors such as the number of investors, their wealth, and alternative investment opportunities. The demand for tax-exempt bonds is influenced by factors such as the number of investors, their wealth, and alternative investment opportunities. Federal tax policy and fiscal policy play a significant role in affecting both demand and supply. The direct cost to the federal government of the interest exclusion on tax-exempt bonds results in forgone income tax revenue. The annual federal revenue loss from the exclusion of interest income on public-purpose tax-exempt bonds is substantial, amounting to $20.5 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $422.8 billion over the 2017 to 2026 budget window. This tax expenditure is reported in the Budget's Analytical Perspectives section every year. The federal income tax excluded interest income on public-purpose tax-exempt bonds from taxable income since 1913. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected claims of constitutional protection in 1988. The subsidy for this exclusion is based on economic theory, suggesting that certain goods and services may not be provided optimally by the private sector. The public provision of goods and services by state and local governments can increase the nation's welfare. Some services benefit both residents and nonresidents, leading to potential under-provision by state and local governments. The exemption of interest income on public-purpose tax-exempt bonds compensates taxpayers and encourages optimal provision of public services. State and local governments had $3.043 trillion in debt issuances outstanding as of the third quarter of 2017. Total debt issuances have slowly increased in the past few years, but have been relatively flat since 2008, when debt outstanding equaled $2.968 trillion. Municipal debt outstanding increased from 2008 to 2010, possibly to cover unexpected shortfalls post the Great Recession. The lack of growth in recent years could be due to budget challenges and economic uncertainties. State and local debt can be classified based on maturity, security type, use of proceeds, and the type of activity being financed. State and local governments issue bonds to finance various activities, with the risk of default being a key factor in determining bond ratings. Bonds can be long-term (maturities exceeding one year) or short-term (maturities of 12 months or less), with notes being a common short-term debt instrument. The type of activity being financed, whether public or private, also influences bond ratings. Bond ratings are determined by privately managed rating agencies based on factors such as default risk and the financial health of the issuing entity. Tax anticipation notes (TANs), revenue anticipation notes (RANs), and bond anticipation notes (BANs) are common short-term debt instruments. Tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs) are often grouped together. Long-term borrowing dominates state and local debt activity, with the long-term share peaking in 2016 at 92.5%. General obligation (GO) bonds pledge the full faith and credit of the issuing government, while revenue bonds do not guarantee repayment. Revenue bonds pledge specific tax revenue or project earnings for repayment, without the government guaranteeing repayment. Credit enhancements like insurance or bank letters of credit can ensure payment in case of revenue shortfall. Revenue bonds have dominated the long-term market, with a share fluctuating between 60% and 72% since 1992. Tax-exempt interest income for state and local governments can also come from installment purchase contracts and finance leases. Governments can use installment purchase contracts and finance leases for tax-exempt payments to vendors, such as for computer or road building equipment. These transactions, known as municipal leasing, involve large monthly payments that cover the vendor's interest expenses. Lease rental revenue bonds are a variation where an authority or nonprofit corporation issues bonds, builds a facility, and leases it to a municipality, with security based on lease payments. The leasing technique involves municipalities issuing bonds for constructing facilities leased to nonprofit organizations, with security based on lease payments. Tax-exempt bond issues can be new or refunding, with new issues financing capital facilities and refundings replacing outstanding bonds with lower interest rates. Refunding bonds are used to replace outstanding bonds with lower interest rates. Proceeds are used to pay off the original bond issue. Advance refunding bonds add to the outstanding stock of bonds without adding to capital. The 2017 tax revision repealed the exclusion of interest income on advance refunding bonds issued after December 31, 2017. The demand for tax-exempt bonds increased in 1993 due to higher individual income tax rates. This led to a rise in refunding bonds with lower interest rates. Refundings decreased in 1999 and 2000 possibly due to higher interest rates and strong economic conditions. However, from 2001 to 2003, refundings increased as the economy slowed and state budgets faced lower tax revenue collections. In 2005, GO bonds and refunding bond volume peaked due to historically low interest rates on tax-exempt debt. The low rate environment since 2011 has also increased the share of refunding issues. Tax-exempt bonds are issued for activities that serve a broadly defined \"public\" purpose to restrict tax preferences. Bonds are considered for a public purpose if less than 10% of the proceeds benefit non-governmental entities. Tax-exempt bonds can be issued for governmental projects or private-activity bonds (PABs) that benefit private individuals or businesses. PABs must meet certain criteria to be eligible for tax-exempt financing. Table 2 shows the dollar value of new PABs issued in 2014 and 2015, while Figure 4 provides historical data on PAB volume. Private-activity bonds have restrictions not applicable to governmental bonds, such as the now-repealed ability for advance refundings and inclusion of interest income in the alternative minimum income tax base. The annual volume cap for bonds issued for various activities is limited to $105 per resident or $311.38 million in 2018, adjusted for inflation since 2004. This cap applies to bonds issued for housing, industrial development, exempt facilities, student loans, and bond-financed takeovers of utilities. Certain private activities like airports, docks, and wharves are exempt from the volume cap if governmentally owned.

Certain private activities like airports, docks, and wharves are exempt from the volume cap if governmentally owned. Congress has expanded the types of private activities eligible for tax-exempt financing and increased capacity for selected activities and issuers since 2001. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 created a new type of tax-exempt private-activity bond for qualified public educational facilities. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 created the New York Liberty Zone after 9/11, with tax benefits for economic revitalization. The \"Liberty Bond\" program allows up to $8 billion in tax-exempt bonds for qualified facilities in the zone. The original deadline for issuing bonds was extended. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the deadline for issuing bonds to January 1, 2014. The American Jobs Creation Act created bonds for green building projects exempt from state volume caps. A new type of tax-exempt bond was created for rail to highway transfer facilities. Congress created a tax-advantaged economic development zone after the Gulf region hurricanes to encourage investment. The Gulf Opportunity Zone (GOZ) was established by Congress to promote investment and rebuilding in the Gulf region after the hurricanes. The GOZA 2005 Act included provisions to increase private-activity bonds and relax eligibility rules for mortgage revenue bonds in the affected areas of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The GOZA 2005 Act added $2,500 per person in the federally declared Katrina disaster areas for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. It defined \"qualified project costs\" eligible for bond financing and allowed for advance refunding of certain tax-exempt bonds. Under GOZA 2005, governmental bonds issued by Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi could be advance refunded an additional time and exempt facility private-activity bonds for airports, docks, and wharves once. In response to the housing crisis of 2008, Congress included provisions in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) to assist the housing sector by providing tax benefits for qualified private activity bonds issued for residential rental projects, mortgage bonds, and veterans' mortgage bonds. Additionally, HERA created $11 billion of volume cap space for qualified mortgage bonds and bonds for residential rental projects. In response to the financial crisis, Congress included bond-related provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) to make bond finance less expensive for designated projects. Provisions included expanding the definition of qualified manufacturing facilities to include intangible property and creating recovery zone facility bonds for investment in economically distressed areas. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included provisions for bond finance to support designated projects. This included recovery zone facility bonds for investment in economically distressed areas and $2 billion for tribal governments to issue tax-exempt bonds for economic development. The act aimed to make bond finance less expensive and expand opportunities for economic development projects. State and local governments can issue tax-exempt bonds at low interest rates and earn arbitrage profits by reinvesting the bond proceeds in higher-yielding taxable debt instruments. Congress limits this arbitrage activity by requiring bond proceeds to be used quickly for capital projects. Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) are an alternative to tax-exempt bonds that offer investors a federal tax credit or the issuer a direct payment proportional to the bond's value in lieu of a federal tax exemption. Bond issues must spend an increasing share of the proceeds within a three-year period to avoid rebating any arbitrage earnings to the Department of the Treasury. Bond issues can be considered taxable arbitrage bonds if the proceeds are invested in higher yielding investments in violation of the tax code. Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) offer investors a federal tax credit or direct payment proportional to the bond's value instead of a federal tax exemption. TCBs are used for various purposes such as public school construction, clean energy projects, and economic development. The 2017 tax revision repealed the authority to issue new TCBs after December 31, 2017, but existing bonds may still receive federal tax benefits. Legislative interest has focused on altering the tax treatment of state and local debt to provide a more economically efficient subsidy with a lower federal revenue cost. Proposals include capping, eliminating, or changing the preference to a direct issuer subsidy for state and local government bonds. The 2017 tax revision initially included provisions to repeal authority to issue Private Activity Bonds (PABs) and eliminate tax-exempt bonds for professional sports stadiums, but these were not included in the final legislation. The Congressional Budget Office proposed eliminating the tax exemption for new bonds. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) proposed eliminating the tax exemption for new qualified private activity bonds, aiming to generate $28 billion in budget savings over the 2017-2026 period. The future changes to the federal tax code will determine modifications to the tax treatment of state and local government debt. Private-activity bond. Zimmerman, Dennis. The Private Use of Tax-Exempt Bonds: Controlling Public Subsidy of Private Activity (Washington: The Urban Institute Press, 1991). Provides institutional background on tax-exempt bonds as an economic policy tool affecting intergovernmental fiscal relations, the federal budget deficit, resource allocation, and tax equity. Discusses tax-exempt bond legislation from 1968 to 1989 and Auction Rate Securities (ARSs) with adjustable interest rates through periodic auctions. Auction Rate Securities (ARSs) use a \"Dutch auction\" where bidders submit bids for purchase at a specific interest rate. The market-clearing rate determines the new ARS rate for all bidders. ARSs often have a call option for the issuer to buy back at face value. They are typically insured to reduce risk and interest rates, requiring bond insurance for marketability. Credit ratings heavily influence ARSs. The issuance of Auction Rate Securities (ARSs) grew significantly from 1988 through 2007, with a peak in 2004 when 438 ARS bonds valued at $42.5 billion were issued. If a failed auction occurs, the issuer must pay a higher reservation interest rate until the next successful auction to avoid paying the reservation rate, which is typically higher than market rates. No ARSs have been issued since 2007, coinciding with the financial crisis."
