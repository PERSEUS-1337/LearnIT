    "content": "Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to include a Federal Renewable Portfolio Standard. Retail electric suppliers must submit renewable energy credits equal to a specified annual percentage from renewable energy resources starting in 2005. Retail electric suppliers must submit renewable energy credits equal to specified annual percentages from renewable energy resources starting in 2005, increasing gradually each year until 2023. Retail electric suppliers can meet requirements by submitting renewable energy credits issued, obtained, or borrowed. Each credit can only count once towards compliance. The Secretary will establish a program to issue, monitor, and track renewable energy credits within a year of enactment. The Secretary will issue renewable energy credits to entities generating electric energy from renewable resources at eligible facilities. Each credit represents one kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. Incremental hydropower credits will be calculated differently. The Secretary will issue two renewable energy credits for each kilowatt-hour of electric energy generated from a renewable energy resource at an eligible facility on Indian land. Credits for incremental hydropower will be based on efficiency improvements or capacity additions, not operational changes. The Secretary will issue two renewable energy credits for each kilowatt-hour of electric energy generated from a renewable energy resource at an eligible facility on Indian land. Biomass cofired with other fuels is eligible for two credits if grown on eligible land. Renewable energy credits are issued based on the proportion of renewable energy resource used when both renewable and nonrenewable resources are utilized. When a generator sells electric energy generated from a renewable energy resource to a retail electric supplier under a contract subject to section 210 of this Act, the supplier is treated as the generator for the duration of the contract. The Secretary may issue credits for existing facility offsets to be applied against a supplier's required annual percentage. Renewable energy credits can be sold or exchanged and unused credits can be carried forward for up to 4 years. Retail electric suppliers can carry forward renewable energy credits for up to 4 years. Before the end of 2005, suppliers can submit a plan to earn enough credits within the next 3 years to meet requirements. Upon approval, these credits can be used to comply with regulations for each year involved. The Secretary offers renewable energy credits for sale at a capped price, adjusted for inflation annually. Non-compliance by retail electric suppliers may result in civil penalties, except for uncontrollable reasons like weather damage or mechanical failure. Retail electric suppliers must submit the required number of renewable energy credits or face a civil penalty. The Secretary can collect information to verify the generation of renewable energy and electricity sales by suppliers. The section discusses the quantity of electricity sales by retail electric suppliers, environmental and state savings clauses, and definitions related to biomass and renewable energy sources. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of fats and oils for renewable energy generation facilities, including eligible facilities for electric energy generation from renewable resources. The curr_chunk defines eligible renewable energy resources for electric energy generation, including solar, wind, ocean, geothermal energy, biomass, landfill gas, generation offset, and incremental hydropower. It also explains terms like generation offset and existing facility offset. The curr_chunk defines \"incremental hydropower\" as additional generation achieved from increased efficiency or capacity additions at a hydroelectric dam after the enactment of this section. It also defines \"Indian land\" as land within Indian reservations, pueblos, or rancherias, or land held by the United States for the benefit of Indian tribes or individuals. The curr_chunk defines \"Indian tribe\" as any organized group eligible for special programs and services from the US due to their status as Indians. It also defines \"renewable energy\" as electric energy generated from renewable resources. The curr_chunk defines \"renewable energy resource\" as solar, wind, ocean, geothermal energy, biomass, landfill gas, generation offset, or incremental hydropower for electricity generation. It also defines \"repowering or cofiring increment\" as additional generation from modifications to expand electricity production from renewable energy resources or cofire biomass. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a \"retail electric supplier\" as a person selling electric energy to consumers, excluding certain entities. It also mentions the term \"retail electric supplier's base amount.\" The curr_chunk defines the \"retail electric supplier's base amount\" as the total electric energy sold to customers, excluding energy from renewable sources, municipal waste, or hydroelectric facilities."
