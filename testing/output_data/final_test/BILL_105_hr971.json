Congress declares the 26,000,000-acre Northern Forest region as an extraordinary resource rich in natural resources and values. This Act aims to support successful businesses, provide stable jobs, preserve wildlife habitat, and protect the biological integrity of the region. The Northern Forest region is declared as a valuable resource by Congress. The Act aims to support local communities, industrial forest land, small woodlots, and conservation land based on recommendations from the Northern Forest Lands Council. The implementation of these recommendations should be led by the Northern Forest States with federal assistance. The Northern Forest States aim to manage their forests, protect traditions, emphasize landowners' rights and responsibilities, and promote cooperative conservation for future generations. Support for sustainable forest management is emphasized in the Northern Forest States to protect traditions, landowners' rights, and promote cooperative conservation for future generations. The Secretary of Agriculture may provide technical assistance for State-based initiatives in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont to define sustainable forest management benchmarks based on principles recommended by the Northern Forest Lands Council, including soil productivity, water quality conservation, forest age balance, and timber flow. The Northern Forest Lands Council recommends sustainable forest management benchmarks including soil productivity, water quality conservation, forest age balance, timber flow, improvement of timber quality, addressing scenic quality, conservation of habitats, protection of natural areas, and continuation of traditional recreation opportunities. The Northern Forest Lands Council recommends sustainable forest management benchmarks, including soil productivity, water quality conservation, forest age balance, timber flow, improvement of timber quality, addressing scenic quality, conservation of habitats, protection of natural areas, and continuation of traditional recreation opportunities. Additionally, there is a section dedicated to the Northern Forest Research Cooperative. The Secretary of Agriculture may collaborate with states, universities, and other parties to conduct research on ecosystem health, forest management, sustainability, technology transfer to the wood products industry, and dissemination of information. The Secretary of Agriculture collaborates with various parties to conduct research on ecosystem health, forest management, sustainability, and technology transfer to the wood products industry. This includes dissemination of information on conservation strategies for areas of ecological significance and recreational opportunities. SEC. 5. INTERSTATE COORDINATION STRATEGY. The Secretary of Agriculture may provide a representative to coordinate Federal and State policy recommendations for the Northern Forest Lands Council at the request of Governors of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. SEC. 6. LAND CONSERVATION. Federal Assistance may be provided by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior for State-managed public land acquisition planning and initiatives in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, or New York. The planning process should establish a goal-oriented land conservation program, including the identification and prioritization of acquiring fee or less-than-fee interests in exceptional lands. The federal assistance can be used for acquiring outstanding recreational opportunities, ecological land, habitats for rare species, scenic areas, and private forest lands in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, or New York. The criteria for land acquisition under this Act include obtaining land from willing sellers with community support, involving local governments and landowners in the planning process, recognizing zoning limitations, using eminent domain with landowner consent, purchasing only necessary rights, and considering potential impacts and benefits. The criteria for land acquisition under this Act include consideration of impacts on local economies, future land management costs, minimizing tax consequences, potential land exchanges, and ensuring proper use of acquired land. Federal funds must be used with the consent of willing sellers. The Act requires that Federal funds can only be used for property acquisition if the owner willingly offers the property for sale. Cooperative land acquisition projects can be funded solely by the Federal Government or jointly with a State government, promoting State land conservation objectives. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for a complementary program. The Secretary of the Interior conducts activities as a complement to State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plans for Northern Forest States. Authorization of appropriations is provided under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. Congress acknowledges that certain Federal tax policies hinder the long-term ownership, management, and conservation of forest land in the Northern Forest region. They urge for additional legislation to address these issues promptly. Additionally, there is a provision for landowner liability exemption. Congress acknowledges that landowners play a crucial role in providing forest-based recreational opportunities in the Northern Forest region. They recommend strengthening relief-from-liability laws to protect landowners allowing public recreational use and updating laws to cover costs of defense and property damage. The proposed measures include providing tax reductions for landowners allowing public recreational use, purchasing land for recreation purposes, creating new government positions for managing public land use, enforcing laws against trespassing and littering, and improving education programs for recreation users. The proposed measures aim to improve recreational use by implementing tax reductions for landowners, purchasing land for recreation, creating new government positions for land management, enforcing laws against trespassing and littering, and enhancing education programs for recreation users. Additionally, efforts will be made to enhance State park and recreation agencies' capacity to measure and address trends in recreational use before they become problematic. SEC. 9. NONGAME CONSERVATION. Congress recognizes the importance of private landowners in managing lands for wildlife habitat and supports creating incentives for exceeding forest management standards. Congress should prioritize legislation for funding nongame fish and wildlife conservation without duplicating existing laws for game fish and wildlife. SEC. 10. WATER QUALITY. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may provide assistance to assess water quality trends in the Northern Forest region upon request from the Governor of Maine, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont. SEC. 11. RURAL COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of Agriculture may provide technical and financial assistance to Maine, New Hampshire, New York, or Vermont for developing capacity in the forest products sector. Funds from the rural community assistance program will support initiatives to strengthen partnerships, develop technical capacity, and enhance extension capacity in utilizing forest products. Develop extension capacity in delivering utilization and marketing information to forest-based businesses. SEC. 12 states that the Act does not grant any new authority to regulate land use. SEC. 13 authorizes appropriations for specific sections of the Act in certain states."
