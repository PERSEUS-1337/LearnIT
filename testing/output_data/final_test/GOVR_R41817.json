    "content": "The United States focuses on preparing partner nations to defend and govern themselves to prevent costly direct military interventions. Building the capacity of partner governments and security forces is crucial in addressing challenges in various locations. The capabilities of allies and partners are seen as equally important as US military actions. Security force assistance (SFA) is defined as activities that support the development of foreign security forces and their institutions, aiming to establish security, governance, and development programs in host nations. It aligns with various interests of Congress, including security assistance, cooperation, and foreign military financing. Security force assistance (SFA) is crucial for engaging underdeveloped nations in preventive measures linked to counterterrorism strategy. It aims to develop military and governance capabilities to prevent the conditions that could lead to terrorism. SFA is central to U.S. strategy for ensuring stability in Afghanistan and Iraq. The ability to provide trainers/advisors to Central Command is key for reconstruction efforts. Security force assistance (SFA) is crucial for engaging underdeveloped nations in preventive measures linked to counterterrorism strategy. Congress may want to consider policies to ensure allies contribute to this requirement and assess the sustainability of capabilities attained through coalition SFA. SFA is linked to security cooperation efforts through various legislative authorities and oversight functions. Congress could consolidate these authorities into pooled funding for a more comprehensive approach. Security force assistance (SFA) supports the development of foreign security forces to meet U.S. national security objectives. It can be part of conventional or irregular warfare operations, stability operations, security cooperation, and security assistance. Through SFA, foreign forces are trained to combat internal and external threats, and serve as coalition partners/peacekeepers. The goal is to develop capable and sustainable security forces. The goal of Security Force Assistance (SFA) is to develop competent and confident foreign security forces that contribute to legitimate governance. SFA involves coordinated efforts across various government agencies and spans different congressional committees. The National Security Council (NSC) plays a role in overseeing SFA implementation. The National Security Council (NSC) provides guidance on Security Force Assistance (SFA), with the Department of State (DOS) leading national policies. USAID offers nonmilitary assistance programs, while the DNI and CIA support SFA activities. This report focuses on the military aspect of training and advising. The Department of Defense is the primary agency for Security Force Assistance (SFA) missions, focusing on training and assisting foreign military forces. While Congress has authorized DOD to train and equip specific countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD generally operates under State Department authority. Combatant commanders carry out SFA operations in their respective theaters, with a focus on both military and nonmilitary aspects of engagement and capacity building. The National Security Strategy guides these efforts. The National Security Strategy guides combatant commanders in developing theater-specific security cooperation plans with critical and key supporting partners to achieve regional or functional objectives. These partners receive U.S. security cooperation resources to complement or supplement capabilities and support broader U.S. government foreign policy goals. Combatant commanders are tasked with establishing achievable military objectives that contribute to longer-term campaign end states in national security objectives. They have flexibility in constructing campaign plans, with varied approaches to intermediate military objectives. The U.S. diplomatic mission in a host nation coordinates Security Force Assistance activities, involving representatives from all U.S. departments and agencies present in the country. The President appoints the chief of the diplomatic mission, usually an ambassador, to oversee all executive branch employees in the host country, excluding those under a U.S. military commander. Close coordination between the chief of mission and military counterparts is crucial for Security Force Assistance (SFA) operations supporting the host nation's defense and development program. Country teams set objectives for enhancing the host nation's security forces, with embassy oversight of military training activities. SFA missions are planned by the Department of State (DOS) and Department of Defense (DOD) to develop specific capabilities. SFA missions are coordinated by DOS and DOD counterparts to align with U.S. diplomatic goals. However, there is a lack of regional coordination within the State Department equivalent to military combatant commanders. Regional bureaus at DOS provide policy guidance to embassies but do not operate major programs. Military services play a role in providing guidance directly to affected countries. The military services provide technical and operational expertise through mobile training teams (MTTs) ranging in size. Responsibility for training foreign forces has historically been with Special Operations Forces (SOF), but now it is a key mission for the military as a whole. The practice of assisting friendly nations' militaries has a long history. The practice of assisting friendly nations' militaries has a long history, dating back to the Lend Lease Program in World War II. Post-war efforts included establishing professional militaries in West Germany, Greece, and Turkey. Support continued with training and advising in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Republican and Democratic administrations have endorsed supporting weak and failed states through military assistance. Efforts shifted towards Vietnam and Latin America in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1950s and 1960s, the special operations community took on the training role for foreign forces shifting towards Vietnam and Latin America. This led to the merging of arms transfers, economic aid, and collective security under a program called \"security assistance.\" The United States then focused on assisting friendly nations like Lebanon and Panama in the 1980s, requiring them to take responsibility for their own defense. In the first Iraq war, U.S. Special Forces trained Saudi military and naval forces, eventually training 30,000 coalition troops in various subjects. In the 1990s, the United States provided SFA assistance to former Warsaw Pact nations and Colombia under \"Plan Colombia\" to stabilize the country. Weak and failing states are seen as a national security threat due to the conditions that allow terrorist organizations to thrive, as seen in the Mindanao region of the southern Philippines. Supporters of Security Force Assistance (SFA) argue that it provides a refuge for operations in areas where the military and government are limited. The application of SFA aims to prevent crises in weak and failing states, which are considered a significant threat to US national security due to their inability to carry out basic functions. Weak and failed states unable to carry out basic functions can pose risks to U.S. strategic interests, including terrorism, international crime, and regional stability. Regions like the Sahel and the Horn of Africa are at risk, with groups like Al Qaeda seeking sanctuary. Post-conflict conditions can also lead to instability and terrorism. Post-conflict conditions in Iraq after Operation Iraqi Freedom led to the dissolution of security forces and a violent insurgency. Weak and failing states pose risks to U.S. strategic interests, including terrorism and regional stability, emphasizing the need for a strong diplomatic and development strategy. Critics argue that the assumption weak and failed states pose a threat to U.S. national security interests is ambiguous and resources are wasted on perceived threats. They emphasize the importance of oversight and use of a failed state's security forces. Building partner capacity in weak or failed states involves training security forces and developing competent governance institutions. The DOD Quadrennial Defense Review of 2006 emphasized the need for a shift towards irregular and asymmetric operations. This transformation requires a focus on reinforcing other necessary government functions beyond just building foreign security forces. The 2006 DOD Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized the shift towards irregular and asymmetric operations, focusing on building partner capabilities to defeat terrorist networks. It highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term, low-visibility presence in various regions and leveraging partner capacity through surrogates to achieve strategic goals. Working indirectly with local partners can help transform the conflict by denying popular support to the enemy and utilizing their local knowledge and legitimacy to effectively combat terrorist networks. The 2006 DOD Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized the importance of building partner capabilities to fight terrorist networks. The lexicon of terms surrounding security force assistance has been confusing and lacks clarity, with terms like \"train advise assist\" (TAA), \"security assistance\" (SA), and \"building partnership capacity\" (BPC) being non-synonymous. The 2006 DOD Quadrennial Defense Review highlighted the need to enhance partner capabilities in combating terrorist networks. However, there has been confusion in defining irregular warfare within DOD policy, with Secretary Gates mentioning a 10% commitment to irregular warfare without specifying resources. The OSD has described irregular warfare as efforts to prevent, deter, disrupt, and defeat non-state actors and state actors posing irregular threats, while also enhancing a local partner's legitimacy and influence. The term has limited congressional discussion to kinetic activities associated with counterinsurgency, but the 2010 QDR emphasized training and assistance to foreign forces without using the term \"irregular warfare.\" The 2010 QDR emphasized the indirect approach by prioritizing \"Build the security capacity of partner states\" for rebalancing U.S. defense forces. Security force assistance (SFA) was identified as the most dynamic security cooperation activity, involving hands-on efforts in host countries to train, equip, advise, and assist their forces in providing security and protecting resources. SFA training activities were directly linked to partner nations' ability to participate in peacekeeping, stability, and counterterrorism operations. The 2010 QDR emphasized the importance of security force assistance (SFA) in improving regional security through coalition stability operations and peacekeeping efforts. Partnering with other U.S. government agencies and allied forces to strengthen security institutions of partner nations is crucial in defeating terrorist groups worldwide. Training and advising Afghan and Iraqi security forces to uphold the rule of law and defend against non-state actors is a key focus, with partnered counterinsurgency operations proving effective in contested environments. The 2010 QDR emphasized the importance of security force assistance in improving regional security through coalition stability operations and peacekeeping efforts. It highlighted the effectiveness of partnering with Afghan and Iraqi units to train and advise forces during combat operations against insurgents. The QDR also called for strengthening general purpose force capabilities for security force assistance, including enhancing language, regional, and cultural abilities, training partner aviation forces, and facilitating rapid transfer of critical materiel. Additionally, it emphasized the integration of coordinated efforts between DOD and DOS to support cross-functional authorities and roles with interagency partners. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized the importance of security force assistance in improving regional security through coalition stability operations and peacekeeping efforts. It called for strengthening general purpose force capabilities for security force assistance and highlighted the need for coordinated efforts between DOD and DOS to support cross-functional authorities and roles with interagency partners. The QDRIP report identified institutional weaknesses in existing security assistance programs and framework, recommending structural and cultural changes in both the executive and legislative branches to protect enduring U.S. interests. The panel recommended establishing pooled funding mechanisms for national security missions benefiting from the Comprehensive Approach, including security capacity building and conflict prevention. The QDRIP endorsed the policy of security force assistance, emphasizing training near-peer nations and allies for coalition capability in SFA engagement. The Department of Defense released Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5000.68, \"Security Force Assistance,\" which established policy and assigned responsibilities for SFA across the Department. This includes efforts at Building Partnership Capacity, low-end institution building in post-conflict/failing states, developing high-end capacity of traditional allies, and viewing rising powers as potential partners for collaboration and challenges. The focus is on a \"build to share\" policy from the outset, requiring export control reform and national disclosure policy reform. The Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 5000.68 established policy and responsibilities for Security Force Assistance (SFA) across the Department. It clarifies the differences between SFA, Security Cooperation (SC), and Security Assistance (SA), emphasizing SFA as a comprehensive approach to building partner state capacity. Unlike SA and SC, SFA enables coordination and integration of all foreign security force developmental activities across agencies and organizations. The DODI 5000.68 establishes policy for Security Force Assistance (SFA) to coordinate foreign security force activities efficiently. SFA contributes to USG security sector reform initiatives and is a subset of overall security cooperation efforts. Security assistance programs fund SFA activities to support a host country's defense against threats like subversion and insurgency. The Obama Administration's 2012 budget request included a segment emphasizing the importance of building partner capacity in foreign countries to enhance security capabilities. This assistance aims to prevent terrorist threats originating from abroad, reducing the need for extensive U.S. involvement in the future. The Obama Administration's strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan focuses on training and equipping local security forces for self-sufficiency. President Obama announced a new strategy in 2009 to transition to full Iraqi responsibility and remove combat forces from Iraq. The Obama Administration's strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan involves training and equipping local security forces for self-sufficiency. In Iraq, the remaining forces will focus on training, advising, and conducting targeted counterterrorism missions. In Afghanistan, the emphasis is on training Afghan forces to eventually take over security responsibilities. This shift in strategy aims to prepare local forces to take the lead in securing their countries and ultimately bring back American troops. The Obama Administration's strategy involves training local security forces in Iraq and Afghanistan for self-sufficiency. Additional troops have increased training capacity, with plans to deploy 4,000 U.S. troops to train Afghan security forces. The goal is to build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 by 2011. The core objective is to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda, with Security Force Assistance (SFA) supporting the transition. The Obama Administration's strategy involves training local security forces in Iraq and Afghanistan for self-sufficiency. SFA supports the transition to Afghan responsibility by focusing on building the capacity within the Afghan forces and government. Lieutenant General William B. Caldwell IV emphasized the importance of resourcing the NATO Training Mission Afghanistan (NTM-A) for the growth of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) to ensure enduring tactical gains on the battlefield. Lt. Gen. Caldwell urged NATO to provide more trainers for the self-sustaining Afghan Security Force. The Armed Services Committees have pushed for continued NATO support, highlighting the need for an \"Afghan surge\" to increase ANSF size and capability. Congress endorsed this, with NATO aiming to grow Afghan security forces from 256,000 to 306,000 by October. The Afghan security forces have more than doubled in size, with a proposal to increase by 35,000 personnel. General James Mattis raised concerns about the sustainability of such a large force, but noted improvements in quality. Critics question the increase in size of the Afghan National Security Forces. According to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), U.S. training efforts in Afghanistan have been criticized for failing to properly structure partnerships with new units, rushing battalion-sized combat elements into service without considering quality or host country perceptions, and facing leadership and retention problems. The analysis emphasizes quality over quantity and highlights the importance of considering Afghan cultural needs. The International Crisis Group highlights the challenges in developing the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), describing it as seeped in Soviet-style structures with weak recruitment and retention policies. The Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) is a key tool approved by Congress for Security Force Assistance (SFA) efforts in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) allows the transfer of DOD funds to CSTC-A for equipment, training, and infrastructure for Afghan security forces. Congress mandates reports on fund transfers. ASFF is crucial for building ANSF capabilities and eventual security transition. General Mattis emphasizes ASFF's role in ANSF's training and security responsibilities. The Afghan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) budget supports the growth, training, and equipping of the ANSF to prevent insurgent safe havens in Afghanistan. Congress allocated significant funds for this purpose, emphasizing the importance of transitioning security responsibilities to the ANSF for stability in Afghanistan and the eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops. President Obama's budget request for FY2012 includes resources to continue training Afghan forces. The FY2012 Administration budget request for the Afghan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) was $12.8 billion to support the training and equipping of Afghan forces. Estimates show that sustaining the Afghan security forces would cost $2-6 billion annually, much less than the $96 billion annually to maintain U.S. troops in Afghanistan. NATO has concerns about Afghanistan's ability to sustain these costs given its GDP and government revenue. The Afghan state may struggle to sustain the cost of maintaining the Afghan National Security Forces until 2040. Analysts suggest long-term military aid to fund half of the Afghan budget, similar to US relationships with other countries. In Iraq, the US shifted focus to training and advising Iraqi Security Forces, counterterrorism operations, and force protection for personnel. Coalition forces are building indigenous capacity, forging local relationships, and preventing Taliban resurgence. The Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF) is crucial for enabling Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) to achieve minimum essential capabilities (MEC) for internal security and defense. Revenue shortfalls from low oil prices have hindered equipping forces in Iraq, leading to budget cuts and challenges in training the ISF. The Ministry of Interior (MoI) has made progress in training capacity but still faces difficulties. The Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defense in Iraq are facing challenges with training capacity, poor facilities, recruiting shortages, and logistical issues. Despite a slight rise in oil prices, Iraq has depleted its fiscal reserves in 2009 and is projected to have financial shortages in the future. The FY2011 budget request for ISFF was $2.0 billion, with $1.5 billion approved by the FY2011 NDAA. Congress required the Iraqi government to pay 20 percent of equipment costs, showing skepticism towards Iraq's security efforts. The Iraqi government pays 20 percent of equipment costs for the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF). The FY2012 budget did not include funding for ISFF, shifting focus to the Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I) to build partner capacity with the ISF. OSC-I will maintain military-to-military relationships to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces. The equipment transfer provisions are set to operate through FY2011, with a focus on International Military Education and Training (IMET) and other security force assistance programs. The Commanders' Emergency Response Program (CERP) provides military assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan for urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction efforts. The Commanders' Emergency Response Program (CERP) was initially funded with seized Iraqi assets and later with U.S. funds. It is authorized annually for missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. In FY2011, $500 million was allocated for CERP, with $100 million for Iraq and $400 million for Afghanistan. The Afghan CERP was reduced but offset by a new $400 million Afghan Infrastructure Fund. The FY2011 NDAA also imposed restrictions on using Afghan CERP funds exceeding $20 million for any project. A 2008 GAO report highlighted challenges in defining project scope, monitoring completion, and ensuring visibility. The FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act included enhanced approval and reporting requirements for the Commanders' Emergency Response Program (CERP). Legislators have criticized the use of CERP for large-scale projects in Afghanistan, which goes against its intended purpose of funding small-scale projects for urgent humanitarian relief. Congress has emphasized the need for Iraq to contribute more to rebuilding costs. CERP is not used for training, equipping, or operating costs of Afghan and Iraqi security forces, but it complements Security Force Assistance (SFA) in bridging civilian and military development efforts. The Global Train and Equip / Section 1206 authorities provide a bridge for military commanders to develop indigenous civilian and military capabilities. Section 1206 of the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act allows the Secretary of Defense to train and equip foreign military and maritime security forces, valued as an important tool by the Department of Defense. This mechanism is endorsed by regional combatant commanders for effective security force assistance within legislative restrictions. The Department of Defense values Section 1206 authority to train and equip military partners for counterterrorism support and stability operations. The 2011 NDAA authorizes $350 million for this purpose, with a provision to increase the ceiling to $100 million for building foreign military capacity in stabilization operations. The Obama Administration's 2012 budget request included continuation of the 1206 authority with $500 million funding for DOD's global military \"train and equip\" assistance programs, including counterterrorism training in various countries and developing Yemen's internal counterterrorism capability. Congress has not yet made Section 1206 permanent authority, raising questions about its placement under the State Department. The 1206 authority, initially under the State Department, is being questioned for potential misuse of security assistance. The Government Accountability Office found that the program aligns with U.S. strategic priorities but faces challenges due to partner nations' limited support and legal restrictions on using FMF. The Government Accountability Office recommended that the Department of Defense estimate sustainment costs and seek funding commitments from partner nations for counterterrorism efforts. The Secretary of Defense emphasized the importance of enabling and empowering partners to defend their own countries. The U.S. military focuses on searching for terrorist cells and building partner countries' capabilities to deter terrorist activities. Counterterrorism efforts include direct actions against terrorist networks and indirect actions to influence global environments. The Department of Defense's emphasis in Security Force Assistance is to give partner countries the ability to prevent terrorist activities. The U.S. Special Operations Command Concept Plan 7500 outlines direct and indirect approaches to combat terrorism. Security Force Assistance (SFA) is a key part of the indirect approach to combat terrorism by training partner nations to combat violent extremist organizations. Some analysts question the link between weak/failed states and terrorism, suggesting that terrorist attacks are carried out by extremists with no geographical affiliation, making safe havens more social than geographical. Safe havens for terrorists are not necessarily geographical but social. European radicals pose the biggest terrorist threat to the homeland and can travel to America more freely than those in weak or failed states. Secretary of Defense Gates and other military leaders are working to build a larger pool of SFA-oriented trainers within the services to combat this threat. The special operations community has historically trained forces for this mission, while the conventional services are still standardizing their approach. The conventional services are standardizing their training methods and supporting organizations. There have been increases in training and organizational commitment, but a significant challenge is providing continuity of effort compared to SOF. Service members may be tasked to deploy as trainers in their area of expertise, attend training before deployment, and then return to their unit. Training skills are not maintained permanently. The responsibility for conducting security force assistance has long resided with the special operations community, specifically the U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF). SOF personnel train extensively for this mission and are the most qualified to do so. Maintaining proficiency in this field would require significant time and resources, which conventional forces may struggle to match. Under DOD, SOCOM is the lead for developing joint doctrine, training, and education for Security Force Assistance (SFA) activities. U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) are uniquely qualified for SFA due to their extensive training, flexibility, and regional expertise. They excel in respecting customs, language proficiency, and integrating with host nations. U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF) excel in Security Force Assistance (SFA) by respecting customs, speaking the language, and participating in host nation's cultural activities. SOF units build long-standing relationships with host nation militaries, providing continuity and collaboration. Admiral Eric Olson emphasized the importance of SFA and the indirect approach in achieving lasting outcomes. SFA includes security cooperation, assistance, and foreign internal defense, making it a key aspect of USSOF indirect action. Admiral Olson highlights the importance of Security Force Assistance (SFA) in enhancing allies' military capabilities through training, advising, and equipping foreign forces. SFA is a key element in USSOF's indirect approach for counterterrorism, focusing on long-term success through trust-building and partnership development. Success is measured by preparing others to face security challenges, not by direct actions taken on their behalf. Admiral Olson emphasizes the challenges faced by SOF in adequately resourcing the Security Force Assistance (SFA) mission. Despite recent growth in personnel and budget, the high demand for SOF skills has strained resources, leading to limitations in mission effectiveness. Deployed SOF are heavily engaged in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, highlighting the need for more resources to meet SFA mission requirements. Admiral Olson highlighted the strain on Special Operations Forces (SOF) due to high demand for their unique skills, with deployments increasing over the last nine years. He mentioned the growth of SOF battalions in various Special Forces Groups and the deployment of additional operational detachments. The demand for SOF forces is expected to outpace supply in the foreseeable future. The demand for Special Operations Forces (SOF) has increased significantly over the years, leading to strain on their capabilities. While SOF are considered the \"gold standard\" for Security Force Assistance (SFA) missions, the growing demand cannot be met solely by SOF. As a result, General Purpose Forces (GPF) are taking on more SFA activities, including basic training and advisory duties in large numbers. This shift is a departure from historical practices where GPF primarily focused on technical training in SFA missions. The demand for Special Operations Forces (SOF) has increased significantly over the years, leading to strain on their capabilities. The SOCOM commander emphasizes the importance of using U.S. SOF primarily to train partner nations' SOF rather than in basic military skills. Special operations should focus more on training foreign special operations forces and less on basic training for new recruits in foreign countries. Despite this, the global demand for special operations is expected to continue rising. The demand for Special Operations Forces (SOF) globally continues to rise. Recent U.S. SOF missions include training counterterrorism forces in Yemen, developing indigenous SOF forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and training forces in Mali against illicit trafficking. The Marine Special Operations Regiment was established in 2006, with Marine Special Operations Battalions as subordinate units. The Marine Special Operations Regiment was established in 2006, with the newly designated 3rd MSOB incorporating structure and personnel from MSOAG's former companies. Marines and sailors of the MSOR train, advise, and assist friendly host nation forces to support internal security and stability, counter subversion, and reduce the risk of violence. The 1st Marine Special Operations Battalion, headquartered at Camp Pendleton, California, consists of four Marine Special Operations Companies (MSOCs). The 2nd and 3rd Marine Special Operations Battalions are based at Camp Lejeune, NC, with each MSOC task-organized with personnel skilled in special equipment support, intelligence, and fire support. The Naval Special Warfare Command primarily focuses on direct action and special reconnaissance missions, but also provides training in maritime special operations to select foreign armed forces through the Naval Special Warfare Center. In 2006, NAVSCIATTS was assigned the mission of conducting Foreign Internal Defense in support of Combatant Commanders. NAVSCIATTS, under Naval Special Warfare Command, conducts Foreign Internal Defense using Mobile Training Teams to prepare partner nation forces for small craft operations in riverine/littoral environments. Located at John C. Stennis Space Center, it has trained over 6,000 students from 55+ nations since 1963. The U.S. Army Special Forces Command conducts foreign internal defense operations to assist developing nations by improving technical skills, human rights understanding, and humanitarian projects. Special Forces Groups are regionally oriented to support combatant commanders and are located at various bases in the U.S., Japan, and Germany. The 7th Special Forces Group will relocate to Eglin Air Force Base in 2011. The Special Forces Group, currently at Fort Bragg, will relocate to Eglin Air Force Base, FL. There are two National Guard Special Forces Groups in Alabama and Utah, with subordinate units in 19 states. Each group has approximately 1,400 soldiers. The 12-man ODA, or \"A\" Team, is the basic operating element of a Special Forces group, consisting mainly of noncommissioned officers with specific functions in operations, intelligence, weapons, engineering, medical duties, and communications. Specialized training for each specialty can take six months or longer and includes small-unit tactics, languages, and survival skills. The ODA may specialize in infiltration skills or specific mission-sets like military freefall, combat diving, mountain warfare, maritime operations, or urban operations. The 6th Special Operations Squadron (6th SOS) within Air Force Special Operations Command is a combat aviation advisory unit that assesses, trains, advises, and assists foreign aviation forces in airpower employment, sustainment, and force integration. Squadron advisors help friendly and allied forces employ and sustain their airpower resources and integrate them into joint and combined operations. Their training and advisory capabilities include airpower applications, tactical employment, and mission planning for fixed and rotary-wing operations such as combat search and rescue, close air support, and airlift/aerial delivery. Assistance in sustainment includes aviation maintenance, supply, munitions, ground safety, life support, personal survival, and air base defense. The 6th Special Operations Squadron (6th SOS) supports combat air operations by providing assistance in sustainment functions, training, and advising foreign aviation forces. The squadron currently has 218 personnel and is projected to double in size. Training for 6th SOS members takes 12-18 months and includes working with host nation aviation forces at various levels. The process of interaction with foreign security forces involves training, advising, and eventually having them operate independently. Special Operations Forces conduct Security Force Assistance through programs like Joint Combined Exchange Training (JCET). Title 10 of the U.S. Code prioritizes training for U.S. forces over foreign forces in SFA. The JCET program focuses on providing tailored combat readiness training to partner nations' forces to support regional stability. Training may include humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations, and civic assistance projects. Congress has scrutinized the program due to instances where trained forces used skills in repressive ways. The JCET program faced criticism for conflicting purposes and lack of oversight. The Leahy Amendment prohibits training with human rights abusers, with federal law now barring assistance to units with human rights violations. The Leahy Amendment prohibits training with human rights abusers, with federal law now barring assistance to units with human rights violations. In an effort to increase congressional oversight, the U.S. Code was amended to add a reporting requirement to Congress regarding training conducted under this section. The report must include details such as countries where training was conducted, type of training, number of armed forces involved, expenses paid, and participation by foreign military forces. The Obama Administration aims to achieve a diplomatic balance in using JCETs for SFA, detailing the number and service affiliation of foreign military personnel involved, host nations' contributions, expenditures, and unique military training benefits for US special operations forces. The Obama Administration is seeking a diplomatic balance in using JCETs for SFA, particularly with Western-leaning Muslim nations like Indonesia to counter terrorism. Indonesia has been targeted by radical groups like Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf, with the Bali attack in 2002 killing 202 people, including American tourists. Engaging with Indonesia is also viewed as a strategy to counter China's influence, although concerns about human rights abuses persist among some Senate members. The \"Leahy Amendment\" prohibits assistance to foreign security force units involved in gross human rights violations. The Leahy Amendment prohibits assistance to foreign security force units involved in gross human rights violations, unless effective measures are taken by the host government to bring those responsible to justice. The law applies to all security assistance programs funded by FOAA funds and includes recurring language in the annual National Defense Appropriations Act. The Army has identified Security Force Assistance (SFA) as one of its primary responsibilities. Casey emphasized the Army's responsibility to assist other nations in building capacity and ensuring domestic order to prevent future conflicts. American Soldiers are currently deployed to Central America and the Balkans for this purpose. The Army has reconfigured itself to conduct Security Force Assistance (SFA) and established an Army Service Component Command for U.S. Africa Command to assist partner nations in Africa. Outgoing Chief of Staff of the Army General George W. Casey previously expressed skepticism about building other armies but acknowledged the role of Army Special Forces in advisory missions. General Martin Dempsey, the presumptive new CSA, anticipates a continued need for SFA-tasked brigades beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army is organized for SFA through the modular design of brigade combat teams. The Army utilizes modular brigades for Security Force Assistance (SFA) missions, leveraging their versatility by tailoring them for specific tasks. Despite some critics questioning the use of brigade combat teams for training and advising roles, lessons from deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq show that BCTs are effective for large-scale SFA to build capacity at individual and unit levels. The Army utilizes modular brigades for Security Force Assistance (SFA) missions, leveraging their versatility by tailoring them for specific tasks. Critics question the use of brigade combat teams for training and advising roles, suggesting dedicated training units instead. Army service component command staffs have expanded to include a section for coordination between various organizations. Training for SFA missions includes regional language expertise and cultural skills, with specialized training provided by organizations like 162 Brigade in Fort Polk, LA. The Army has also established training centers like the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Culture Center at Fort Huachuca, AZ. The Navy emphasizes Security Force Assistance (SFA) to build cooperative relationships and prevent local disruptions. The Cooperative Seapower Strategy advocates proactive engagement to minimize conflict and instability. This approach focuses on smaller nations and emphasizes partnership capacity building. The Navy's Security Force Assistance (SFA) approach involves proactive engagement to enhance maritime assets and relies on the special operations community for training. The Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training (MCAST) Command SFA Detachment plays a key role in establishing relations between military forces, organizations, and civilians to support the Combatant Commander's Theater Security Cooperation Plan (TSCP). The Navy's Security Force Assistance (SFA) involves training foreign audiences in various military operations. Navy general purpose forces (GPF) are allocated to SFA activities through the Global Force Management (GFM) process. The Navy conducts SFA using fleet and regional training, rotational deployments, and fleet and expeditionary operations. Topics covered include small boat operations, maritime combat operations, and more. The Navy's Security Force Assistance (SFA) engagements cover various topics such as small boat operations, maritime combat operations, weapons handling, antiterrorism, force protection, maintenance, construction, and professional development. Key Navy commands involved in SFA activities include Naval Expeditionary Combat Command, Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training Command, and others. The Marines gauge the need for SFA activities based on input from regional combatant commanders like CENTCOM and EUCOM, emphasizing forward presence to engage partner nations and allies. The Marines have created a Security Cooperation Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SC-MAGTF) to better prepare foreign militaries and engage partner nations and allies. This task force is tailored for Security Force Assistance (SFA) operations, allowing the Marines to train foreign militaries, provide humanitarian support, and develop relationships as needed by combatant commanders. The Marines have established a Security Cooperation Marine Air-Ground Task Force (SC-MAGTF) for training foreign militaries and engaging with partner nations. The SC-MAGTF's advisory missions are similar to special operations forces but are limited by current deployment commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The concept has evolved to reflect the characteristics of a special purpose MAGTF, with a focus on Security Force Assistance (SFA) operations. The Marines renamed the \"Security Cooperation MAGTF\" to \"Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force-Security Cooperation (SPMAGTF-(Security Cooperation))\" for engaging in theater security cooperation activities. The Marine Corps Training and Advisory Group (MCTAG) coordinates security force assistance (SFA) and security cooperation (SC) efforts, providing training and advisor support to host nation security forces and assisting in developing partner nation training programs to build partner capacity. The MCTAG was developed to standardize advisor training after the Marine Special Operations Advisor Group moved to the Marine component of Special Operations Command. The U.S Air Force's Air Advisor Academy, established in 2010, trains airmen for missions in partner nation aviation capacity building, similar to the 6th Special Operations Squadron. Training includes language, cultural awareness, and combat survival. The Air Force invests in light mobility and light attack aircraft for training partner nations. A study emphasizes the importance of aviation capacity for security, stability, and economic development. Underdeveloped regions lack transportation infrastructure, making aviation essential for projecting influence and establishing government legitimacy. Partner nations can project government influence through aviation capacity developed via Security Force Assistance (SFA), including skills like medical evacuation and search and rescue. This capacity also aids military forces in navigating around improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and supports economic development and trade. However, developing aviation skills in fragile states with lower education levels can be challenging. The Air Force aims to assist partner nations in developing a cost-effective and interoperable aviation enterprise to enhance security and stability, combat terrorist networks, drug cartels, and criminal organizations, and prevent threats from failing states. The Air Force's SFA strategy involves developing partnerships globally to enhance long-term capabilities through security cooperation. General Schwartz highlighted examples of working with Afghan and Iraqi partners to strengthen their air forces and build partner capacity operations. General Schwartz outlined the priority of partnering with the Joint and Coalition Team to guide the Air Force's direction. The Air Force aims to enhance integration across multiple domains, build partnerships with other air forces, and train partner nations through activities like Air Advisor training and establishing an Air Advisor Academy. Additionally, the Air Force plans to develop and field the Light Attack/Armed aircraft. The Air Force aims to enhance integration across multiple domains, build partnerships with other air forces, and train partner nations through activities like Air Advisor training. Secretary Gates highlighted the need for better coordination and integration of partner capacity and security assistance functions within the Pentagon, particularly within the Air Force. The Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force for International Affairs plays a key role in supporting the Air Force's strategic engagement imperatives through the Global Partnership Strategy. This strategy focuses on establishing and expanding mutually beneficial global partnerships, providing capacity for national security, and training foreign air forces. The Air Force emphasizes success in Security Force Assistance (SFA) through people, not equipment. In 2007, the CSAF directed AETC to provide pre-deployment training for airmen serving as \"air advisors\" in Iraq and Afghanistan. The number of students increased from 136 in the first year to 675 per year in 2010. The air advisor course at Joint Base McGuire/Dix/Lakehurst supports current CENTCOM SFA requirements and provides advisor training for global SFA needs. Training at Joint Base McGuire/Dix/Lakehurst, NJ includes core knowledge, language, region, and culture skills, as well as field craft such as survival and convoy training. The Air Advisor Academy provides training for ACS and aviation experts to assist less-developed nations. Air advisors may receive flight training at one of seven locations. A permanent basing facility for the Academy is yet to be determined. Initial operating capacity is expected in 2011. The Air Force plans to increase the number of students to 1,500-2,000 per year by 2014. They aim to utilize existing organizations, like contingency response groups, for different purposes. These groups, with diverse skill sets, are being aligned regionally to support Security Force Assistance missions. Contingency response forces have been assigned a secondary mission supporting Security Force Assistance (SFA). They are praised for their airfield opening functions, but concerns have been raised about their ability to support traditional missions due to low manning rates. The Air Force is introducing new programs, LiMA and LAAR, to enhance SFA capabilities and engage with a wider range of allies and partners. The LiMA program aims to provide training and advisory support to partner nations for air mobility capabilities. It enables the US to conduct cost-effective airlift operations in austere areas, where the Air Force currently lacks a light airlift capability. LiMA is designed to operate from short or unimproved landing surfaces, enhancing the ability of conventional units to work effectively with a broader range of partners. The LiMA program plans to acquire 15 aircraft starting in FY2011 to train U.S. aviators and support personnel on light attack tactics. The LAAR program plans to acquire 12 aircraft starting in FY2012 for similar purposes. The Administration's FY 2011 budget request included $65.7 million for the LiMA program, with no projected procurement beyond this initial lot. The FY 2012 request included $158.5 million for the LAAR program. The LAAR program has a procurement budget of $158.5 million and a projected requirement of $106.6 million for FY2013. There is debate over whether the aircraft will be used solely for training other nations' aviation capacity or also to support U.S. forces. Proponents argue for close air support capability for ground forces, but the Air Force believes existing aircraft can provide this adequately. Some analysts question the investment in these aircraft for security force assistance or partner capacity building, citing budget constraints. The argument is that resources should be allocated to modernizing existing Air Force aircraft to maintain a technological advantage. The Inter-American Air Forces Academy in Lackland AFB, San Antonio, TX, provides training to partner nations' aerospace forces, graduating around 800 students annually and offering classes in Spanish and English for foreign aviation units. The Defense Language Institute English Language Center (DLI/ELC) offers English-language training to foreign armed forces, providing services under U.S. security assistance programs. DLI trains international students in general- or special-purpose English and also prepares English instructors and school administrators. They offer in-country consultations, develop curriculum for partner nations, and help legitimize fragile states by enabling government services in remote areas. Some countries face challenges in developing aviation capacity due to inadequate infrastructure. Less-developed countries often rely on helicopters like the MI-17 to access rural areas. The US procured MI-17s from Russia to build rotary-wing capabilities in Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, sparking controversy over lack of defined requirements and rising costs. The Secretary of Defense directed an internal study to assess DOD's enduring operational and SFA requirements for non-standard rotary wing platforms. The study concluded that there is a steady demand to support at least 39 countries of strategic importance through 2016, with 80% categorized as urgent. Congress has expressed concerns about supporting the Russian helicopter industry with nearly $1 billion of U.S. taxpayer dollars. The study recommended that DOD provide materiel assistance, individual and unit training on rotary wing platforms (primarily MI-17s) to support partner nations. Concerns were raised about DOD's capacity to meet the demand for training on these platforms. The study identified the need for individual training on rotary wing platforms for air crews, including U.S. and partner nation pilots. DOD took steps such as evaluating U.S.-made platforms as alternatives to the MI-17 for the Afghan Air Force and allocating $45 million for MI-17 training. The study emphasized the importance of building partner nation capabilities and was well received by DOD leadership. The study emphasized the importance of security assistance and cooperation programs governed by U.S. statutes, which are described as disjointed and not finely tuned to address overseas needs or national security interests. DOD has limited ability to sustain long-term efforts in implementing SFA, a dilemma consistently raised by combatant commanders in congressional hearings. In a 2009 memorandum to the National Security Council, DOD highlighted deficiencies in existing authorities for security assistance, including funding shortfalls, stagnant FMF funding, slow budget execution timelines, and lack of multiyear funding for combatant commanders. Secretary Gates noted missed opportunities for the US in conducting missions. The current authorities create missed opportunities for the US to conduct capacity building in at-risk locations, often filled by other nations like China. The Government Accountability Office cited difficulties in Africa Command accessing 15 different funding sources in FY2009, leading to delays in capacity-building missions. The GAO found that U.S. funding sources could not support participants in capacity-building missions in at-risk locations. The lack of continuity in strategic planning across government agencies hampers the execution of programs in countries like Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Critics argue against the military-centric approach of the DOD in implementing foreign relations through Security Force Assistance (SFA), pointing out the disparity in resources between DOD and other agencies. The disparity in resources between DOD and other agencies is highlighted, urging significant investment in the Department of State for foreign assistance. A 2007 report recommended against migrating foreign assistance functions to DOD due to inadequate funding requests. Streamlining security assistance decision-making at the State Department is crucial to address emerging threats and opportunities. Insufficient funding in civilian agency budgets leads to a migration of foreign aid authorities to DOD. Congress and the executive branch should overhaul the Foreign Assistance Act to prevent narrow focus on specific countries or programs. Detailed justifications and strategic rationale for aid priorities are necessary to avoid congressional directives. Congressional leadership should prioritize foreign aid authorization bills every two years and agree on reprogramming levels for embassy decision-making. Congress directed DOD to provide a report on authorities to build the capacity of foreign military forces. A new Global Security Contingency Fund endorsed by both State and Defense departments aims to pool resources for building partner capacity and preparing for emerging threats. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) is an initiative aimed at incentivizing interagency collaboration through a new business model to provide a more agile and cost-effective way to reduce the risk of future conflicts and take advantage of emerging opportunities to help partners secure their territories. The proposal, modeled after a similar effort in the United Kingdom, aims to structure funding mechanisms and approval processes to reflect the importance of security sector activities and offer incentives for collaboration across the national security structure. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) aims to incentivize interagency collaboration for national security budgeting. Admiral Mike Mullen supports pooled funding to enhance operational effectiveness in security sector assistance. The fund aligns with State Department reorganization outlined in the 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), emphasizing interagency coordination and leveraging DOD's resources. The GSCF would be affiliated with the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) emphasizes the Department of Defense's role in building military capacity in foreign nations. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) proposal involves pooled funding from both the State Department and Defense Department, with an initial request for $50 million and the potential to transfer an additional $450 million if needed. Both agencies must approve projects for the fund to move forward. The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) proposal involves pooled funding from both the State Department and Defense Department, with an initial request for $50 million and the potential to transfer an additional $450 million if needed. The GSCF is not meant to replace existing programs like 1206 and 1207, but could potentially expand to include training for the justice sector in regions facing conflict or instability. The proposal for the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) involves pooled funding from the State Department and Defense Department, requiring legislation to establish funding pools in the U.S. Treasury. DOD and State would need authority to provide funding to the pool, drawing from existing accounts or a separate funding requirement. Oversight from multiple committees would be necessary, similar to the 1206 and 1207 programs, providing transparency to Congress. The proposal for the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) aims to increase transparency to Congress. One analysis suggests creating select committees in both the House and Senate to oversee the funds, establishing a new title in the U.S. Code (referred to as \"Title 51\"). Endorsers of the proposal highlight concerns about personnel and resources. The proposal addresses issues such as personnel and resource availability, streamlined authorities, and the shift towards a unified security effort. While the State Department is responsible for engagement strategies, military resources are often used for interactions with allies. Despite fiscal constraints, resources may be jointly utilized by State and USAID, with the GSCF seen as part of a broader security coordination effort. The GCSF is viewed as part of a larger security coordination effort, along with the State Department's reorganization and a consolidated DOD/DOS Overseas Contingency Operations budget. Some argue that pooling resources undermines the authorities of DOD and State, eroding State Department leadership in aligning security assistance with foreign policy priorities. Critics fear the GCSF could give the Secretary of Defense too much power over foreign policy decisions, potentially misaligning the Defense Department's role in policymaking and security assistance's contribution to diplomatic balance. The debate surrounds the amendment of Section 506 of the Foreign Assistance Act to allow the president to redirect resources for security assistance. Opponents argue that funding through defense committees creates a conflict of interest and undermines diplomatic efforts. They suggest focusing on the State Department's Complex Crises Fund instead. This raises questions for Congress regarding security force assistance. The concept of security force assistance raises questions for Congress regarding the sufficiency of organizing, training, and equipping services for conducting SFA. The debate includes considerations on the effectiveness of training indigenous forces in Afghanistan versus eradicating the Taliban. Questions also arise about the adequacy of current legislative authorities for SFA and the need for effective oversight if a Global Security Cooperation Force is endorsed. Additionally, there are concerns about coordinating capacity building between the Department of State and Department of Defense. The Global Combatant Commanders believe that current authorizations for Security Force Assistance (SFA) hinder effective security cooperation efforts. In Africa Command (AFRICOM), SFA is crucial for stability and counter-terrorism strategies. The commander emphasized the need for flexible, multi-year authorities to sustain long-term security cooperation programs in Africa. The Global Combatant Commanders believe that current authorizations for Security Force Assistance (SFA) hinder effective security cooperation efforts, especially in Africa Command (AFRICOM). They emphasize the need for flexible, multi-year authorities to sustain long-term security cooperation programs in Africa, including train and equip programs and capacity-building to counter violent extremism. The European Command (EUCOM) commander also highlights the importance of expanded long-term authorities and funding to enhance training efforts and enable partner contributions in Afghanistan. Operationally, there is a need to continuously find flexible authorities and funding to support sustained security engagement with African partners. The need for flexible authorities and funding to support security cooperation efforts with partner nations, particularly in Afghanistan, has become increasingly important. Current security assistance programs are seen as outdated and in need of evolution to better support strategic efforts in the European theater. The Global Combatant Commanders emphasize the importance of long-term authorities and funding to sustain security cooperation programs, especially in Africa, to counter violent extremism. The security assistance programs are constrained by various issues, including limited resources and unwieldy processes. The Administration's efforts to reform these programs are crucial for maintaining our competitive edge. Congressional 1206 authority is essential for addressing urgent needs in the region, particularly in Central Command. General David Petraeus also highlighted legislative obstacles to effective security force assistance. The security assistance programs face legislative obstacles and constraints, hindering their effectiveness. Reformation is needed to create more responsive mechanisms for developing partner nations' security capacity. Special authorities and multi-year appropriations are necessary to address emerging needs in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency activities. Multi-year programs providing training, equipment, and infrastructure for partner nations' security forces are crucial for success in conflict regions like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Key programs include the Iraq Security Forces Fund and the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff emphasizes the need for reform in security sector assistance programs, citing inflexible authorities, insufficient resources, and cumbersome processes as barriers to addressing current security challenges. Coordination of resources and congressional reform are necessary to enhance global engagement and create more substantial partnerships in national security efforts. The President is required to report on the relationship between Department of Defense authorities for security cooperation programs and State Department assistance authorities for building foreign military capacity by March 1, 2010. This is part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The President must report on the strengths and weaknesses of various laws related to training and equipping foreign military forces, and suggest any changes to improve the United States Government's ability in this area. The President must report on the organizational and procedural changes needed in the Department of Defense and the Department of State to enhance their ability to train and equip foreign military forces for counterterrorist operations and military stability. This includes assessing resources and funding mechanisms required for such programs. The specified congressional committees involved in this oversight are the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations. The State Department and USAID will pursue innovative mechanisms for civil-military collaboration, such as pooled funding, to enhance unified planning and implementation of missions across agencies. The creation of a 3-year joint pilot pooled fund between State, USAID, and Department of Defense is being explored for security and justice sector and stabilization assistance. This mechanism would provide flexibility and resources for coordinated assistance responses across security and justice sectors, overcoming current limitations and resource shortfalls. The joint pilot pooled fund between State, USAID, and Department of Defense aims to integrate military and civilian assets for comprehensive assistance programs, based on agencies' comparative advantages. This approach would address current limitations and resource shortfalls by promoting shared responsibility and collaboration among agencies. The Department of Defense (DOD) has actively worked to build the defense capacity of allied and partner states since the end of World War II. This includes security cooperation activities such as training, exercises, foreign military sales, officer exchange programs, and technical exchanges to assist foreign security forces in building competency and capacity. These efforts support the U.S. objective of securing a peaceful and cooperative international order in today's complex security environment. The Department of Defense emphasizes the importance of enhancing partners' security capacity through security force assistance missions. These missions involve training, equipping, advising, and assisting host countries' forces to improve their ability to provide security and protect their resources. Efforts also focus on building the capabilities of security institutions to sustain improvements in partner security forces. The Department's long-term commitment to fostering human dignity is reflected in human rights vetting and controls in training and assistance programs. The Department of Defense emphasizes enhancing partners' security capacity through security force assistance missions, focusing on training, equipping, advising, and assisting foreign forces. Efforts include promoting healthy civil-military relations, human dignity, rule of law, and professionalization of partner military forces. These activities aim to enable host-country participation in coalition stability and peacekeeping operations, improving regional security. Collaboration with U.S. government agencies and allied forces to strengthen partner nations' security institutions is crucial in defeating terrorist groups worldwide. Terrorist groups exploit ungoverned areas as safe havens for recruitment, indoctrination, and training. U.S. forces collaborate with partner nations to strengthen their security capacity and deny terrorists safe havens. Training and advising local security forces is essential for protecting populations from insurgents and terrorists. The focus is on upholding the rule of law and defending territories against violent non-state actors. Partnered counter insurgency (COIN) with Afghan and Iraqi units, alongside U.S. forces, is an effective way to train and advise forces while combating insurgents. This collaboration allows host-nation units to leverage their knowledge of terrain, language, and culture, while U.S. forces assist in training and advising to uphold the rule of law and defend against violent non-state actors. Key QDR initiatives support security force assistance by strengthening general purpose force capabilities. All four Services provide specialized training for individuals and groups deploying abroad to train partner nations' security forces. The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps will increase personnel in train-the-trainer units for general purpose forces. The Air Force will expand its regionally oriented contingency response groups. These units aim to develop specialized expertise in specific regions. The Air Force is focusing on building defense capacity of allies and partners by fielding light mobility and light attack aircraft in general force units. Security force assistance operations are becoming increasingly important in U.S. strategy, with a growing emphasis on training indigenous security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Department is enhancing general force capabilities for security force assistance, improving language and cultural abilities, strengthening partner aviation forces, and facilitating rapid transfer of critical materiel."
