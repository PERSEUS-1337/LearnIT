    "content": "The United States' crude oil production is increasing due to advanced drilling technologies, with projections indicating a potential output of 9.6 million barrels per day by 2019. Light tight oil (LTO) is the main contributor to this growth. Despite calls to ease export restrictions, the Energy Information Administration forecasts a steady demand for crude oil domestically, with imports projected to range between 6 to 8 million barrels per day through 2040. The Energy Information Administration's high resource case projections suggest lower crude oil import requirements of 2 to 4 million barrels per day from 2020 to 2040. The disconnect between import needs and the desire to export crude oil is influenced by factors such as geographical location of production, type/quality of crude oil, refinery configurations, petroleum products derived, and transportation challenges. U.S. crude oil exports are restricted, but petroleum products like naphtha, gasoline, diesel fuel, and natural gas liquids are not. Petroleum products such as naphtha, gasoline, diesel fuel, and natural gas liquids are not subject to export restrictions, leading to increased production and exports. In August 2014, approximately 4.1 million barrels per day of petroleum products and other liquids were exported from the United States, up from 1.4 million barrels per day in 2007. The debate over crude oil exports involves various positions from members of Congress, including calls to lift export restrictions, maintaining existing restrictions, and proposing bills to eliminate restrictions. The increase in U.S. LTO production and oil supply from Canada has presented challenges in the crude oil export policy debate. The increase in U.S. LTO production and oil supply from Canada has led to challenges in the crude oil export policy debate. Current crude oil export restrictions date back to the 1970s, during an era of U.S. oil price controls that motivated producers to export and sell crude oil at unregulated world prices. This report provides background and context about the crude oil legal and regulatory framework, discusses motivations for exporting U.S. crude oil, and presents analysis of issues for Congress to consider during the debate. In 1973, an oil embargo by OAPEC led to U.S. crude oil export restrictions under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Despite exceptions granted by the President, crude oil exports remained low, with levels reaching 287,000 bbl/d in 1980 and dropping to 9,000 bbl/d in 2002. Since 2002, U.S. crude oil exports have steadily increased, reaching 401,000 bbl/d in July 2014, with the majority sent to Canada. The Bureau of Industry and Security defines \"crude oil\" as a mixture of hydrocarbons in liquid phase in underground reservoirs, excluding certain processed oils. Since 2002, U.S. crude oil exports have been steadily increasing, with a peak of 401,000 bbl/d in July 2014, mainly to Canada. U.S. crude oil production saw a decline from 1970 to 2008, but production of light/sweet crude in tight oil formations started rising rapidly in 2009. The debate over crude oil exports is influenced by the physical and chemical properties of Light Tight Oil (LTO) and its compatibility with U.S. refinery needs. Investments in processing heavy crudes from Canada and Latin America in the Midwest and Gulf Coast were driven by price discounts. The industry is now adjusting to process more light crude due to tight oil production. Transportation bottlenecks are being relieved, but oversupply of light crudes may lead to price discounts. Uncertainty remains on whether the industry will economically adjust to accommodate the expected increase in light crude production. Export of domestically produced crude oil has been restricted since the 1970s by federal laws and regulations. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) and Short Supply Control Regulations by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) prohibit crude oil exports from the US, with exemptions based on national interest and specific criteria. The BIS regulations on Short Supply Controls at 15 C.F.R. \u00a7754.2 provide exemptions to the prohibition on crude oil exports from the US, including licenses for exports to Canada and specific exceptions for certain types of crude oil exports. The BIS regulations provide exemptions for crude oil exports from the US, including exports of heavy California crude oil up to 25,000 barrels per day, exports consistent with international agreements, exports consistent with findings by the President under certain statutes, and exports of foreign origin crude oil not commingled with US origin oil. Applications not falling under these exemptions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis for approval based on national interest and Energy Policy and Conservation Act purposes. Certain specific exports will be authorized through a case-by-case review by BIS regulations. Generally, BIS will only approve temporary exports or transactions that result in the importation of an equal or greater quantity and quality of crude oil, can be terminated if US petroleum supplies are threatened, and demonstrate compelling economic or technological reasons for exporting crude oil. EPCA directs the President to restrict crude oil exports but does not provide the regulatory framework. The Export Administration Act of 1979 gives the President the power to control exports for national security, foreign policy, or short-supply purposes. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) enforces these restrictions and licensing for crude oil exports under its \"short supply control\" regulations, even though the EAA expired in 2001. The Export Administration Act (EAA) expired in 2001, but its authority remains in effect through a presidential declaration of a national emergency and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Executive Order 13222 continued the EAA's execution, and the emergency authority has been extended annually since 2001. Several federal statutes restrict crude oil exports or mandate certain actions. Federal statutes either prohibit or exempt certain crude oil exports under the EPCA. P.L. 104-58 amended the MLA to allow oil exports via pipeline unless the President deems it against national interest. The determination must consider impacts on US petroleum availability, environmental reviews, and potential oil supply shortages or price increases. President Clinton issued a determination in April 1996. President Clinton issued a determination in April 1996 allowing Trans-Alaska Pipeline System oil exports under certain conditions outlined in 15 C.F.R. \u00a7754.2(j). Section 28(u) of the MLA requires all domestically produced crude oil transported through federal lands to adhere to Export Administration Act licensing requirements. The President must make an express finding that such exports will not diminish the total quantity or quality of petroleum available before they can occur. The MLA allows for exports of domestically produced crude oil through federal lands if it is in the national interest and does not diminish petroleum availability in the US. Congress has 60 days to review and can stop further exports with a resolution of disapproval. The restriction on crude oil exports via federal lands is part of BIS regulations. The Export Administration Act imposes limitations and licensing requirements on the export of petroleum produced at naval petroleum reserves and the Outer Continental Shelf. The President must make a finding that exports will not reduce domestic petroleum availability and are in the national interest. These restrictions are incorporated into BIS regulations. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) is subject to export limitations and licensing requirements under the Export Administration Act. Exports must be in the national interest and not increase reliance on imported oil or gas. The President must make an express finding to authorize such exports, and Congress has the power to disapprove further exports if deemed necessary. The OCSLA restriction on exports of petroleum from the OCS is included in BIS regulations. Crude oil exports require a license under the Export Administration Act, administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security. License applications are reviewed by the Office of National Security and Technology Transfer Controls at BIS, and only U.S. exporters or entities can apply. Applications are submitted electronically through SNAP-R, listing exporter, consignee, export volume, and details. Once registered, the applicant must provide details such as exporter, consignee, export volume, product description, end-use, and certification of origin. BIS handles license applications according to Executive Order 12981, contacting the applicant within nine days for additional information. Crude oil licenses are typically processed within 7-10 days, unlike dual-use technology licenses. Licenses are valid for one year and non-transferable, except in cases of company acquisition. Certain crude oil exports may qualify for a license exception. License exceptions can be used for crude oil exports, allowing shipments under specific conditions without the need for a license. Three exceptions include foreign-origin crude stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, samples for testing, and Trans-Alaska pipeline shipments. TAPS exception requires adherence to tanker routing and environmental restrictions, with U.S.-owned and crewed vessels. No re-exports are permitted, prohibiting trans-shipments through Canada. The number of crude oil license applications has been increasing steadily. The number of crude oil license applications has steadily increased over the last few years, with a high approval rate likely due to exporters' knowledge of regulations. Most licenses are for exports to Canada, while exports to other countries involve re-exports of foreign crude. Stakeholders are motivated to lift export restrictions due to increased tight oil production, with some seeking higher prices for oil. Refiners are concerned about potential narrowing of regional crude oil acquisition price discounts if exports are expanded. Price discounts may narrow with expanded exports, affecting refinery margins and potentially leading to refinery closures. Refiners may need to invest in infrastructure to handle increased volumes of LTO. Factors like tight oil production locations, refinery setups, and market prices justify lifting export restrictions, but these factors are dynamic. Refineries and infrastructure can adapt to market conditions, impacting oil values for producers. In 2013, the Energy Information Administration noted that the debate on oil export policy is complex due to the dynamic nature of the industry. Adjustments in production, transportation, and refining segments will impact each other. Various midstream and downstream adjustments can accommodate changing production patterns, making it difficult to assess the potential impacts of policy decisions on any one segment without considering the others. In 2000, 250,000 bbl/d of tight oil was produced in the US. By 2013, production increased to 3.5 million bbl/day. The EIA projects a peak of 4.8 million bbl/day in 2021, mainly from Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, and Bakken formations. EIA projections are subject to change based on current information and policies. The EIA's high resource case projects tight oil peaking at 8.5 million barrels per day in 2035, with uncertainty in production levels. Timing for potential oversupply and price discounts of U.S. LTO is uncertain, depending on factors like production levels, export restrictions, and access to markets. Price discounts may occur as early as 2015/2016 or after 2020. Based on EIA projections, tight oil production is expected to increase rapidly and peak around 2019, with potential for U.S. exports to Canada and access to West Coast markets. The window of opportunity for crude oil exports may be temporary, depending on export volumes and continuous drilling needed to maintain production levels. The high resource case suggests that tight oil production could continue growing until 2035, reflecting potential advancements in industry knowledge and technology. The future of U.S. LTO production could see growth with advancements in technology. The increase in extremely light hydrocarbons like lease condensate is a factor in the crude oil export debate. Actual and projected LTO production levels are impacting refining and infrastructure segments, with adjustments dependent on economic variables and investments. The United States has 115 oil refineries with a total capacity of 17.8 million barrels per day. Refineries in PADD 3, with 43 facilities and a capacity of 9.1 million barrels per day, are facing economic decisions as light tight oil (LTO) production increases in the Gulf Coast area. PADD 3 has the largest refining capacity in the US at 9.1 million barrels per day, with nearly half of the refineries equipped with coking units. Adding a coking unit is costly, around $1 billion+, and is based on the expectation of purchasing discounted heavy crude oils to produce high-value products. Approximately 60% of PADD 3 refiners are considered coking refineries, investing in coking capacity to utilize discounted heavy crudes from Canada and Latin America. Increased production of LTO in PADD 3, primarily from the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin formations, may lead refiners to assess economic parameters for processing additional volumes. Investments can be made to handle more LTO, but factors like price discounts, product values, and economic optimization will determine the absorption of additional volumes. Ultimately, individual refinery decisions will dictate the extent of LTO processing. Investments in refining equipment can help absorb more domestically produced LTO in PADD 3. Light sweet crude imports are decreasing, with some estimates suggesting they may reach zero by the end of 2014. Refiners may then consider reducing medium- and heavy-quality crude imports. Foreign oil suppliers like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have ownership stakes in U.S. refinery assets, which could lead them to continue providing oil to their U.S. refineries at discounts compared to U.S. crudes. This could limit the reduction of crude oil imports, as the ability of refiners to use more Light Tight Oil (LTO) and transportation infrastructure for delivering crude to refineries are key considerations for U.S. oil producers. Delivery infrastructure and transportation costs can impact the value of oil produced in different locations. The evolving crude oil transportation network in the United States is facing challenges due to the concentration of Light Tight Oil (LTO) production in North Dakota and Texas. This has led to constraints in the existing pipeline delivery system, prompting changes such as reversing oil flow direction, developing new pipelines, and increasing rail shipments. The evolving crude oil transportation network in the United States is facing challenges due to the concentration of Light Tight Oil (LTO) production in North Dakota and Texas. Changes such as reversing oil flow direction, developing new pipelines, increasing rail shipments, and waterborne shipments complying with Jones Act requirements are being made. Transportation costs and constraints contribute to different oil values at various delivery points throughout the country. Infrastructure adjustments are occurring, but it is unclear how much LTO volume these adjustments will ultimately accommodate. Some oil producers may argue that allowing crude oil to be exported would serve to equalize prices by alleviating infrastructure-related price discounts in the market. Infrastructure limitations and resulting price discounts will impact oil production volumes and refiner decisions. U.S. oil producers aim to maximize the value of each barrel by considering factors like oversupply, refinery demand, and infrastructure limitations. Allowing crude oil exports could reduce price discounts in some regions, equalizing the value of Light Tight Oil (LTO) with global prices. However, this normalization may negatively impact profitable refiners benefiting from regional price discounts. The Bakken LTO has experienced price discounts compared to the U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark, with discounts as high as $28 per barrel. However, these discounts have since decreased due to changes in the oil transportation network. Eagle Ford LTO in Texas has not seen significant price discounts like the Bakken, likely due to its proximity to refining customers and fewer transportation challenges. Condensate prices are harder to assess, but some refiners do post prices for various crude types, including condensate. Condensate prices can vary, with discounts ranging between $0.75 and $12 per barrel in December 2014. This wide range suggests that specific refiners value condensate differently, impacting certain producers financially. As LTO production increases, transportation bottlenecks and limited refinery demand may lower producer prices, potentially leading to decreased oil production. The relationship between producer prices and refinery acquisition costs is dynamic. The relationship between producer prices and refinery acquisition costs is dynamic, reflecting bottlenecks and limitations in transportation networks and refinery configurations. Estimates for price discounts needed to motivate system modifications and incentivize oil production are uncertain due to the integrated nature of production, transportation, and refining. The debate on U.S. crude oil exports is complex and multidimensional, with various stakeholder views. Congress may consider several issues during future discussions on crude oil exports. The U.S. crude oil export restrictions have been a topic of analytical studies on economic and price impacts. Opening markets to world trade can affect domestic prices, and the U.S. oil market has historically been one-directional in terms of trade. Changes in demand and supply globally influence the price of oil on the world market. The potential effects of allowing the export of U.S. crude oil to the world market include convergence of domestic oil prices with world prices, adjustments in the price of U.S. reference crude grade relative to world grades, and overall adjustments in the world price of oil due to increased U.S. supplies. The potential effects of allowing the export of U.S. crude oil to the world market include convergence of domestic oil prices with world prices. If U.S. exports of LTO settle at about 500,000 barrels per day, this would represent nearly one half of the total output from the Bakken field in 2013, 2.5% of total U.S. consumption, and 0.5% of world demand for oil. Shale based LTO has sold at a discounted price relative to other domestic crude oils of similar quality due to location, lack of infrastructure, and technological characteristics of U.S. refineries. The EIA reported that Bakken crude oil has been discounted by up to $28 per barrel compared to WTI since 2012, due to the added cost of rail shipment which is 3 times more expensive than shipping by pipeline. Allowing the export of LTO could increase demand and raise prices to match world market levels, reducing or eliminating the discount in the U.S. market. Investment in the fields could increase oil production and create jobs. Introduction of LTO exports may impact the price spread between WTI and Brent crudes due to market dynamics. The price spread between WTI and Brent crudes may be influenced by market dynamics, with potential benefits for U.S. oil production and producers. An increase in LTO supply to the world market is not expected to have a significant impact on oil prices due to low demand and supply elasticities. The effects of U.S. exports on price include a potential reduction in OPEC crude oil demand and an increase in global spare oil production capacity. This could lead to a decrease in price volatility in the oil market. The high demand for petroleum products strained supply, leading to low excess capacity. Changes in crude oil prices directly impact consumer costs at the pump. 68% of gasoline costs and 57% of diesel costs are due to the refiner's crude oil cost. Price discounts on Bakken crude mostly benefited Midwest and Rocky Mountain refiners, resulting in lower regional fuel prices compared to the national average. During January 2012 through January 2014, Midwest gasoline prices were lower than the national average for 21 out of 24 months. As local crude oil prices align with global prices, the benefit of lower regional prices for consumers may decrease. A decrease in world oil prices due to U.S. exports could lead to lower petroleum product prices for U.S. consumers if refiners use a mix of domestic and imported crude oils tied to global prices. The impact of a fall in world oil prices may be limited if U.S. crude oil exports are small relative to the global market. The rise in U.S. oil production has led to small oil exports relative to the global market. This increase in production has already impacted international markets and geopolitics. Despite debates over U.S. crude oil exports, the government has not used production as leverage and does not directly control oil companies. The rise in production has reduced the need for imports, contributing to less volatile prices in the world oil market and potentially benefiting national and international energy planners. The rise in U.S. oil production has shifted the country from a major importer to a potential exporter, impacting global energy dynamics. This change has led to increased refined petroleum product exports and altered perceptions of the U.S. as a competitive player in the petroleum sector. Potential changes in import/export policies could further influence geopolitics depending on the volume and timing of exports. In the short to long term, potential changes in U.S. laws and regulations regarding crude oil exports could impact global energy dynamics and geopolitics. The rise in U.S. oil production has reduced reliance on certain OPEC countries, leading to discussions on increasing crude oil exports. The U.S. posture towards sanctions against Iran has also become more stringent due to increased oil production. OPEC countries, including Nigeria, welcome the rise in U.S. oil production. Saudi Arabia supports increased U.S. oil production and exports. Analysts suggest the U.S. may shift focus away from key oil-producing regions due to domestic resources. Saudi Arabia may offer discounts on exports to the U.S. to maintain market share. U.S. petroleum consumption was 19.04 million barrels per day in 2014, with production at 8.68 million barrels per day. The United States produced 8.68 million barrels per day of crude oil and imported 7.34 million barrels per day in 2012. Over two-thirds of imports came from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Venezuela. Canada and Mexico are reliable suppliers, while Saudi Arabia and Venezuela own refining assets in the U.S. Beyond these countries, over 30 others supply crude oil to the U.S. The United States may need to replace crude oil exports in case of emergency conditions. The psychological impact of removing export barriers could signal commitment to the global energy market. While industry analysts do not expect the U.S. to produce more crude oil than it consumes in the long run, any additional production could reduce OPEC's market share. Some countries have shown interest in the U.S. removing export restrictions. U.S. oil production is increasing and projected to continue rising into the next decade. The United States is projected to increase oil production into the next decade, potentially becoming a growing importer again. Despite attempts by a cartel to manipulate prices, the oil market remains competitive. Global energy market dynamics have allowed countries to support each other during emergencies, such as supplying petroleum products after natural disasters or sending resources to Japan post-Fukushima. The United States is now involved in energy agreements through the International Energy Agency to address supply disruptions. It maintains a Strategic Petroleum Reserve and may export crude oil, impacting trade policy. The US is a member of the WTO and has free trade agreements, with restrictions on crude oil exports. The WTO agreements are based on the principles of most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment, which prohibit discrimination among member states' products. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) prohibits quantitative restraints on imports or exports, with some exceptions under Article XX. Exceptions under Article XX of the WTO allow governments to restrict trade for conservation of natural resources or human health, but not to disguise trade restrictions or discriminate between countries. For example, restrictions on crude oil exports may be tied to production limits and subject to the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. This was seen in a successful U.S. challenge to Chinese export restrictions on raw materials. The United States is currently negotiating two free trade agreements. The United States is negotiating two multi-nation free trade agreements: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). Both agreements are relevant to U.S. energy supplies, with TPP including countries like Australia, Japan, and Mexico, and T-TIP involving the European Union. The EU is seeking access to U.S. energy, including crude oil, in the T-TIP negotiations. The EU is seeking access to U.S. energy supplies in the T-TIP negotiations, including a legally binding commitment for free export of crude oil and gas resources. There are concerns about the potential harm to consumers, national security, and the environment from automatic and unrestricted approval of U.S. oil and gas exports to the EU. EU attempts to secure energy guarantees through T-TIP may be driven by tensions with Russia. The T-TIP negotiations may gain urgency due to tensions with Russia, a key oil and gas supplier to Europe. The impact of removing crude oil export restrictions on environmental issues is uncertain. Policy makers are concerned about the effect on domestic oil production, with projections showing a potential increase in light tight oil production. There are debates on whether removing export restrictions would lead to a production ceiling for specific resources and the magnitude of additional domestic production that would result. Estimates suggest a potential excess of 500,000 bbl/d of light sweet crude oil by 2015-2016 if export restrictions are lifted. Increased domestic production could raise environmental concerns such as oil transportation, extraction impacts, and climate change. Existing challenges in transporting oil efficiently and safely may be amplified with a further increase in domestic crude oil production. The increase in domestic oil production has led to challenges in transporting crude efficiently and safely through existing pipelines. To address the uncertainty of pipeline capacity, producers are turning to rail as a quicker alternative. While rail transportation has benefits in moving oil to market hubs, it also raises concerns about safety and environmental impacts. Despite lower spill rates compared to other land transportation modes, safety and environmental issues remain a priority. Crude oil transportation by rail and barge has increased, with concerns about safety and environmental impacts highlighted by major accidents. While spills from tank vessels and barges are lower per ton-mile, they often occur in vulnerable locations. Hydraulic fracturing is commonly used to extract LTO, raising questions about its impact on air and groundwater quality. The debate over groundwater contamination risks from hydraulic fracturing is fueled by a lack of scientific studies. Environmental groups advocate keeping crude oil export restrictions to prevent increased development that could impact the global carbon budget. The debate over crude oil export policy and its impact on the global carbon budget is complex. While some advocate for restrictions to prevent increased development, there is no political agreement on a domestic carbon budget or the validity of the 2\u00b0C temperature target. The degree to which a change in crude oil export policy would affect the carbon budget remains uncertain. Proposals to tax crude oil exports to increase federal revenues may face obstacles due to constitutional restrictions. Calculating potential revenue increases from taxing crude oil producers is complex and relies on various assumptions. As the debate on exporting crude oil continues, new proposals may emerge. Various proposals may emerge in the debate about exporting crude oil, ranging from removing export restrictions entirely to maintaining and possibly expanding them. Two industry groups, CRUDE and PACE, advocate opposing positions on crude oil export policy changes. One policy option Congress may consider is amending EPCA to lift export restrictions, although some Members of Congress have called on the executive branch to act instead. Some Members of Congress have urged the executive branch to ease or remove current export restrictions on crude oil. If restrictions are lifted, U.S. oil producers could access global markets, leading to potential convergence of domestic and international prices. This could boost domestic crude oil production, but may negatively impact U.S. refineries by reducing regional crude oil price discounts. Increased production could also raise environmental concerns. While lifting crude oil export restrictions could lead to lower global and domestic prices, the actual impact is uncertain due to various factors influencing prices. Congress could choose to maintain restrictions to ensure U.S. energy security. The potential outcomes of maintaining oil export restrictions include oversupply of certain types of crude oil in specific locations, possible adjustments by refineries to accommodate changing crude oil qualities, and the economic considerations for refiners in making capital investment decisions based on lower LTO prices. The uncertainty remains regarding the impact of oil prices on LTO production and the ability of oil producers to innovate and improve efficiencies. Maintaining export restrictions may lead to lower prices for some oil producers, potentially resulting in reduced U.S. oil production and economic development. Financial break-even per barrel prices vary based on location and other factors. Break-even per barrel prices for shale oil can range from $50 to $100, depending on factors like well characteristics and company financial structure. Discounted crude oil prices in certain areas can allow refineries to operate profitably. There is potential for oil producers to explore more export opportunities within existing regulations, despite inconsistencies in crude oil definitions. Oil producers are looking to export more material into the global market by determining the minimum processing needed for an exportable product. The path forward involves exploring export options within the current regulatory framework, with uncertainties on how existing laws will be interpreted. Policy options to consider include exempting Light Tight Oil (LTO) from export restrictions, as the increase in LTO production is a driving force behind exports. The President has the power to exempt certain types of crude oil exports if it is in the national interest. In the past, exports of specific types of crude from certain locations have been exempted. Removing \"lease condensate\" from the crude oil definition may help address oversupply and price discount issues in the Gulf of Mexico region. Crafting a definition for lease condensate may present challenges as there is no industry standard. One policy option could be to allow crude oil exports for a limited period, such as five years, after which the situation could be reassessed. Various options for modifying export restrictions could impact the market and stakeholders differently, and Congress may study these considerations. Several bills were proposed in the 113th Congress to eliminate crude oil export restrictions by modifying the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Analytical studies have been published assessing the economic effects of removing these restrictions. Several bills in the 113th Congress proposed removing crude oil export restrictions by modifying the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Analytical studies have been published comparing the effects of lifting these restrictions, noting the challenges in comparing results due to different methodologies and the uncertainty of how OPEC might respond to additional crude oil in the international market. The uncertainty of a change in U.S. crude oil export policy could be influenced by OPEC actions. If export restrictions are lifted, U.S. oil prices may align, leading to lower gasoline prices and increased production and exports. The effects vary among studies, as shown in Table B-1, with various variables and caveats to consider. It is recommended to review the full study reports for a better understanding of the assumptions and limitations. The curr_chunk discusses the economic, price, and budget effects of removing crude oil export restrictions. Crude oil exports are mostly prohibited under current law, leading to price discounts for some oil producers due to increased U.S. production of light crude oil and condensate. Limited domestic marketability of \"lease condensate\" is also highlighted. The limited domestic marketability of \"lease condensate\" is prompting oil producers to explore export markets to enhance the value of this material. In June 2014, BIS permitted two firms to export processed condensate, sparking a debate on whether this signifies a shift in crude oil export policy or an administrative ruling within the existing regulatory framework. The BIS crude oil definition includes \"lease condensate,\" subject to export restrictions. The definition of crude oil for export includes reconstituted crude petroleum, lease condensate, and liquid hydrocarbons from various sources. There is room for interpretation regarding the level of processing required for export eligibility. Lease condensate, often produced with natural gas, adds complexity to the crude oil export debate due to regulatory inconsistencies and limited data. Lease condensate, with physical/chemical characteristics similar to exportable hydrocarbons, is subject to BIS Commodity Classification Restrictions for crude oil exports. Exporters must obtain a license under the Export Administration Regulations, with some exports eligible for a license exception. Exporters can request a commodity classification from BIS for items with uncertain control status. The BIS provides commodity classifications to determine control status of sensitive products, including crude oil. Exporters submit specifications for classification, focusing on product description or process. Two companies applied to BIS for classification of processed condensate. Two companies applied to BIS for classification of processed lease condensate to be exported without a license. Details are confidential, but a presentation in July 2014 revealed arguments for export eligibility based on distinct processing, suitable product uses, and similar characteristics to exported hydrocarbons. The BIS issued a ruling classifying processed condensate as an EAR99 product, no export license required. Industry observers suggest a policy change allowing export of minimally processed crude oil, but the Administration denies any change, stating the rulings are within current regulations. The logic is that since condensate is crude oil, applying the same process to crude oil would result in an exportable product. The rulings only apply to products resulting from stabilizing and distilling condensate. The BIS rulings on processed condensate and crude oil may lead to increased applications for export classifications, as there is ambiguity in the definition of export-eligible products. The rulings do not guarantee mass exports, but they could prompt requests to determine the level of processing needed for export qualification. Applications for processed condensate at BIS were reportedly on hold in July 2014."
