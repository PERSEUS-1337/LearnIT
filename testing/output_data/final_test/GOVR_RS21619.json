    "content": "During the Cold War, the United States maintained nuclear weapons to deter attacks by the Soviet Union. The Bush Administration continues to view nuclear weapons as essential for security, with a more comprehensive role beyond deterrence. The Bush Administration argues that nuclear weapons, along with missile defenses and conventional forces, deter adversaries, assure allies, dissuade potential threats, and defeat enemies. They believe the U.S. may need different nuclear weapons to support these objectives. The Bush Administration is shifting from \"threat-based\" targeting of nuclear weapons towards a broader approach that considers a wide range of capabilities and contingencies. This change aims to tailor U.S. military capabilities to address various potential conflicts and adversaries. The Bush Administration is shifting its nuclear weapons strategy to target a wide range of capabilities and contingencies, including potential conflicts with Russia. The specific targets of this new strategy have not been disclosed. The Bush Administration's nuclear weapons strategy now includes targeting hardened and deeply buried facilities housing nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons as potential threats in conflicts with other nations. These targets were previously part of U.S. war plans against the Soviet Union. The Administration emphasizes the need to plan for known and potential threats, as their locations cannot be certain in future conflicts. The Bush Administration is integrating the nuclear weapons infrastructure into its deterrence strategy to address known, potential, and unexpected threats. This includes the capability to target unidentified nations and quickly respond to emerging threats. The focus is on sustaining forces and adapting to new challenges in a timely manner. The Administration is modernizing the nuclear weapons complex to reduce the U.S. nuclear arsenal while maintaining the ability to respond to emerging threats. Plans include establishing small teams to evaluate evolving military requirements and assess options for new weapons. The Administration is modernizing the nuclear weapons complex by establishing warhead concepts teams to evaluate evolving military requirements and assess options for new or modified warheads. Funding has been requested for studies on converting existing nuclear weapons and exploring new low-yield nuclear weapon designs. Analysts fear this research may lead to the production of new weapons to support an enhanced warfighting role for nuclear weapons. The United States has various types of delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons, including short-range missiles, medium-range land-based and sea-based missiles, aircraft, long-range missiles, submarines, and heavy bombers. In the early 1990s, the US withdrew and eliminated shorter- and medium-range nuclear weapons, focusing on longer-range strategic weapons due to the reduced threat of ground wars in Europe or Asia. The US no longer needed to threaten battlefield targets and is considering deploying new types of nuclear weapons under the Bush Administration. If the United States deploys new types of nuclear weapons considered by the Bush Administration, it could involve battlefield nuclear weapons delivered by long-range missiles or aircraft. These weapons aim to achieve precise objectives on the battlefield, raising concerns about the likelihood of their use in conflict rather than just for deterrence. The debate over new nuclear weapons concepts focuses on credible deterrence vs. likelihood of use. The Bush Administration plans to develop a more focused nuclear war-fighting capability for the United States, including the ability to destroy hardened targets in nations that might threaten the U.S. The Bush Administration plans to develop a more focused nuclear war-fighting capability for the United States to deter threats from other nations. Critics question the credibility of using nuclear weapons as a deterrent, suggesting that conventional forces may be sufficient. Some analysts doubt that nuclear threats against specific facilities in smaller, rogue nations would effectively deter their leaders. Critics fear that developing nuclear weapons for battlefield use may increase the likelihood of the United States using them in a conflict, especially if the adversary cannot retaliate with nuclear weapons. They worry that over time, U.S. officials may see the unilateral use of nuclear weapons as a better option than facing chemical or biological attacks. The Bush Administration plans to maintain nuclear weapons in U.S. security policy, while also aiming to reduce their role as per the 1968 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Critics argue that this dual approach may hinder efforts to discourage nuclear proliferation and make it challenging for the U.S. to urge restraint on nations seeking nuclear weapons. Additionally, the acquisition of nuclear weapons by potential adversaries could pose a threat to U.S. security. The United States faces criticism over its nuclear policy as some argue for reducing the role of nuclear weapons in defense and foreign policy to deter proliferation. The Bush Administration defends the development of advanced nuclear weapons to deter other nations from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The United States is pursuing research and possibly development of new nuclear weapons, sparking debates in Congress over the implications of these programs."
