    "content": "The \"Immigration Protection Act of 2000\" may be cited as the short title for this legislation. Congress finds an epidemic of fraud targeting aliens dealing with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Fraudulent immigration consultants extract large sums of money from aliens by promising help with immigration issues through deceptive means. Phony consultants approach aliens in line at service buildings or advertise in foreign-language newspapers, offering assistance for a fee to obtain residency or green cards using false promises or personal connections. Fraudulent immigration consultants deceive aliens by taking fees and filing meritless asylum petitions, posing as lawyers or notaries to exploit Spanish-speaking immigrants. Victims are often too scared to report the fraud, allowing consultants to operate freely. Federal and State efforts to combat fraudulent immigration consultants have not been successful in stopping the exploitation of aliens. Jurisdictional limitations hinder prosecution of these consultants unless they are involved in submitting false documents to immigration authorities. The problem of aliens being exploited by bogus consultants is estimated to have grown in recent years, with thousands of fraudulent consultants operating nationwide. The Department of Justice planned to create task forces to tackle immigration consultant fraud in cities with large immigrant populations, but only one task force exists in Los Angeles. State enforcement against fraudulent consultants is inconsistent, with many jurisdictions not actively pursuing or prosecuting them, and even when convicted, most cases are treated as misdemeanors. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"attorney\" refers to a person who is a member in good standing of the bar of any State, possession, territory, Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia. An \"accredited representative\" is an organization or individual accredited by the Board of Immigration Appeals. \"Compensation\" is defined as any form of payment or consideration. An \"immigration consultant\" is also mentioned. An immigration consultant is defined as an individual or entity that provides assistance or advice on immigration matters for compensation, excluding attorneys and accredited representatives. Immigration matters refer to any actions affecting immigration or citizenship status under relevant laws or orders. The Naturalization Service is a component of the Department of Justice, State, or Labor. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTS AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES. It is illegal for immigration consultants to make false statements, claim special influence with government agencies, retain payment for services not rendered, withhold client documents, select government forms, or provide information to agencies without authorization. Immigration consultants are prohibited from providing information to government agencies without client consent, engaging in unauthorized practice of law in immigration matters, and falsely representing themselves as attorneys. Violators may face criminal penalties of fines, imprisonment, or both. SEC. 5. ADVERTISEMENT DISCLAIMER, NOTICE AND WRITTEN CONTRACT. It is unlawful for an immigration consultant to advertise without stating they are not an attorney and cannot provide legal advice or select forms for clients. Additionally, they must display a notice in their office stating the same information prominently. It is illegal for an immigration consultant to act in an immigration matter without a written contract with the client, detailing services, fees, and a disclaimer that they are not licensed to practice law. An immigration consultant must have a written contract with the client, including a statement that they are not licensed to practice law, a provision for returning documents to the client, a 72-hour rescission period, and providing a copy of the contract to the client. Any immigration consultant who fails to meet the requirements outlined in this section may face criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment for up to one year, or both. SEC. 6. CIVIL ENFORCEMENT. Any person aggrieved by violations of section 4 or 5 can file a civil action in a US district court for relief. The Attorney General can also initiate civil actions if there is reasonable cause to believe that individuals are being harmed by these violations. State Attorneys General can also bring civil actions on behalf of their states. In civil actions under this section, relief may include injunctive relief, damages, and civil penalties up to $50,000 for first violations. The Attorney General or State Attorney General can seek relief on behalf of aggrieved parties. The Attorney General can seek relief in civil actions, including injunctive relief, damages, and civil penalties up to $50,000 for first violations and $100,000 for subsequent violations. SEC. 7. TASK FORCES. The Attorney General will establish task forces in eight districts with high numbers of aliens violating immigration laws to investigate, prosecute, and bring civil suits. $7,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2003 for the Department of Justice to carry out this section. Amounts appropriated under paragraph (1) are authorized to remain available until expended. SEC. 8. OUTREACH BY IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE. The Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization will establish an outreach program to inform aliens about immigration consultant obligations, law enforcement methods, and a hotline for reporting violations. A toll-free hotline will be set up for reporting violations of immigration laws anonymously. Callers can provide information anonymously and it may be forwarded to law enforcement authorities. $7,000,000 is authorized for the Department of Justice annually from 2001 to 2003 for this purpose. SEC. 9. CONFIDENTIALITY. The Attorney General and Department of Justice officials are restricted from using information provided by individuals, including undocumented aliens, for purposes other than enforcing the law. Exceptions apply if the information was not provided in good faith. The Attorney General and Department of Justice officials are restricted from using information provided by individuals for purposes other than enforcing the law. Whoever knowingly uses information in violation of this section shall be fined not more than $10,000. SEC. 10. NONPREEMPTION OF MORE PROTECTIVE STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. This Act supersedes State and local laws only if they hinder its application. States and municipalities can add additional requirements to those in this Act."
