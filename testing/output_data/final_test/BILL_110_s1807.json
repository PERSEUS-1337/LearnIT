    "content": "The Act titled \"Weather Mitigation Research and Development Policy Authorization Act of 2007\" aims to establish a national weather mitigation policy and research program at the federal and state levels. According to a 2003 report by the National Research Council, there is a need for a coordinated national program of weather modification research supported by states. Less than a handful of weather mitigation research programs are underway worldwide, with the United States spending less than $500,000 per year on related research. The United States faces significant economic losses due to droughts and severe storms, with annual damages reaching billions of dollars. Weather mitigation projects like snowpack, rain enhancement, and hail suppression help reduce these losses. Recent droughts in the Western United States have led to low lake levels and cooperative agreements among states in the Colorado River Basin. Additional research in these areas can enhance existing programs and quantify their impacts. Cooperative agreements for snowfall enhancement programs in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming aim to benefit the Colorado River System. Evaluations show potential for significant water yield through cloud seeding. Research on weather mitigation could provide insights into the impact of pollution on precipitation processes. The recent Weather Damage Modification Program by the Bureau of Reclamation successfully combined resources for cloud-seeding projects in North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California, aiming to enhance rainfall and snowfall while suppressing hail. This research may increase understanding of weather mitigation impacts on precipitation processes in cloud systems. The Weather Mitigation Advisory and Research Board, established under section 5(a), defines key terms such as \"Board\" and \"Executive Director.\" Research and development in this context involve practical applications of scientific or technical theories. The Weather Mitigation Advisory and Research Board is established in the National Science Foundation to coordinate the national research program on weather mitigation. The Board consists of 11 members appointed by the Director of the National Science Foundation, including representatives from states with weather mitigation programs, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and NASA. The Weather Mitigation Advisory and Research Board, established in the National Science Foundation, consists of 11 members appointed by the Director, including representatives from various organizations such as the American Meteorological Society, American Society of Civil Engineers, National Academy of Sciences, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Agriculture, and institutions of higher education or research institutes. The Weather Mitigation Advisory and Research Board, under the National Science Foundation, has 11 members appointed by the Director, including representatives from different organizations. Members serve at the Director's pleasure, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Board selects a Chair and Vice Chair from its members. The Chair can appoint an executive director and necessary personnel, subject to Board confirmation. Advisory committees can be established to advise on various matters. The Weather Mitigation Advisory and Research Board, appointed by the Director, must hold its first meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. The Board will meet as called by the Chair, with a majority forming a quorum. The Board has the power to conduct studies, investigations, and hearings, cooperate with other agencies, and enter into cooperative agreements. The Executive Director, with the approval of the Board, may conduct or contract for research and development activities related to weather mitigation. The Executive Director, with the approval of the Board, may conduct or contract for research and development activities related to weather mitigation under the National Research and Development Program. The Executive Director must develop and submit a plan to Congress within 180 days for the national research and development program on weather mitigation. The plan should establish goals, priorities, and activities for the next 10 years, including funding research grants, scientist training, and international collaboration. It should also integrate relevant federal agency programs. The national research and development program on weather mitigation will involve interdisciplinary research, coordination of activities, recommendations for program coordination with other organizations, and estimating Federal funding for research activities. The national research program on weather mitigation involves coordinating research on cloud physics, dynamics, cloud seeding technologies, severe weather, and potential adverse effects. It also includes collaboration with relevant organizations and developing new technologies through partnerships with federal and state agencies and academic institutions. The Board promotes research and development for weather mitigation by funding studies on improved forecast technologies and evaluating the effectiveness of weather mitigation. Additionally, they administer a grant program for research and development in this field. The Board may establish a grant program for research and development projects related to weather mitigation, modeled after existing programs. Grants awarded will range from $50,000 to $500,000, with a federal share requirement for project funding. The subsection outlines eligibility criteria for entities seeking grants for weather mitigation research and development projects. Eligible entities include State agencies, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit organizations with expertise in weather mitigation. Grants can only be used for projects related to weather mitigation that were already in operation before the grant was awarded. SEC. 7. ANNUAL REPORT ON ACTIVITIES. The Executive Director must submit an annual report to the President and Congress by January 31 each year, detailing Federal weather mitigation research achievements, progress towards plan goals, agency budgets, and any recommendations for additional action. The annual report must include recommendations for additional action or legislation to assist in achieving the purposes of the Act, the relationship between weather mitigation research and research under the Global Change Research Act, potential adverse consequences of weather mitigation efforts, and means of reducing such consequences. The first report is due on January 31 in the second calendar year after the Act's enactment. The Board for weather mitigation research shall receive $10,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2017 for carrying out the Act, and may also accept gifts or donations."
