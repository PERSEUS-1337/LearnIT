    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 5202 of the Water Code is amended to require reporting of groundwater extraction for certain areas not managed by a groundwater sustainability agency. Reporting is due by December 15 each year for extractions made in the previous water year, unless exempt under specific conditions. Reporting of groundwater extraction is required for certain areas not managed by a groundwater sustainability agency. The report must be filed by December 15 each year for extractions made in the previous water year, unless exempt under specific conditions. The report should include details such as the persons extracting water, the general place of use, and the quantity of water extracted from each source. The report must be filed with the board and accompanied by a fee imposed by Section 1529.5. By January 31, 2020, high- or medium-priority basins designated as critical conditions of overdraft must have a groundwater sustainability plan. By January 31, 2022 or 2023, other basins must also have a plan in place. Each report on groundwater extraction must be accompanied by a fee. The Legislature authorizes low- and very low priority basins to be managed under groundwater sustainability plans. Counties without a groundwater sustainability agency will be presumed to be the agency for unmanaged areas. Notification to the department is required unless the county opts out. In 2017 and 2018, areas without a groundwater sustainability agency in counties must be reported to the department. Failure to notify the department by June 30, 2018, may result in the designation of a basin as probationary. This designation can occur if no local agency has elected to develop a groundwater sustainability plan for the basin. After January 31, 2020, if a groundwater sustainability agency or a collection of local agencies has not adopted a groundwater sustainability plan for the entire basin, the board cannot take action until at least 180 days after disapproval by the department. The department may approve an alternative if a groundwater sustainability plan is deemed inadequate or not being implemented effectively. If by January 31, 2022 or 2023, no groundwater sustainability plan has been adopted for the entire basin by a groundwater sustainability agency or a collection of local agencies, the department can approve an alternative. The department can approve an alternative if a groundwater sustainability plan is found inadequate or not effectively implemented. If by January 31, 2022 or 2023, the plan is deemed insufficient or not being implemented to achieve sustainability, or if the basin is in long-term overdraft, an alternative can be approved. The board may rely on periodic assessments prepared by the department to determine significant depletions of interconnected surface waters due to groundwater extractions. The department can conduct additional assessments as requested by the board, with determinations posted for public comment. The determination may exclude certain extractions from reporting requirements if they are managed by a local plan or have minimal impact on basin withdrawals. It may also require reporting of extractions exempted if they have a substantial impact or are necessary for information gathering. If litigation delays the formation of a groundwater sustainability agency or program, the board will not designate a basin as probationary for a period equal to the delay. The determination may set requirements for reporting groundwater extraction, modify reporting dates, and establish guidelines for measuring devices. The board will exclude portions of a basin from probationary status if a groundwater sustainability agency shows compliance with the sustainability goal."
