    "content": "Sequestration is the automatic reduction of federal spending by a uniform percentage, established as a budget enforcement tool by Congress in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. It is triggered when Congress violates specific budget objectives, reducing certain federal spending. This enforcement mechanism is currently used for three budget rules created by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 and the Budget Control Act of 2011 established three budget enforcement rules, including mandatory sequester. Medicare, a federal program for healthcare services, faces spending reductions under these rules. This report explains budget sequestration's impact on Medicare and its different parts. The report explains how budget sequestration impacts Medicare by triggering reductions in budget accounts for various categories of funding. Sequestration cuts are applied evenly across all budget account subcomponents, such as programs, projects, or activities. Budget sequestration impacts Medicare by reducing budget accounts for different categories of funding, including programs, projects, or activities. Sequestration cuts are applied evenly across all budget account subcomponents, with the reduced resources typically being permanently cancelled. This applies to discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending subject to annual appropriations acts and only a portion of mandatory spending provided in appropriations acts. Mandatory spending is usually provided by permanent laws, such as the Social Security Act. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calculates across-the-board percentage reductions for Medicare, nondefense, and defense funding in the event of a sequester. Mandatory Medicare benefit payments receive a specific percentage reduction different from other federal spending types. The methodologies and sequestered amounts are published in a report by OMB, made public once the President issues a sequestration order. Three budget enforcement rules can trigger sequestration, two established by the Budget Control Act (BCA) and one separately. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established three rules that can trigger sequestration. The bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to develop legislation to reduce the deficit, leading to automatic spending reductions, including sequestration of certain mandatory spending from FY2013 to FY2021. Congress extended this reduction through subsequent legislation, such as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 18; P.L. 115-123). The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the reduction of discretionary spending limits through FY2027. Any breach of these limits results in sequestration of funding. The BBA 18 also increased the discretionary spending caps for FY2018 and FY2019 to prevent breaches. The Statutory PAYGO Act established a budget enforcement mechanism to prevent deficit increases over a 5- and/or 10-year period. The Statutory PAYGO sequester has never been triggered as Congress has voted to exclude specific legislation from its effects. An example is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which included measures to reduce spending. The Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018; P.L. 115-123) aimed to reduce deficit impact to zero. Medicare, a federal program for healthcare services, is subject to sequestration with varying impacts across its four parts. Established in 1965, Medicare provides insurance to Americans aged 65 and older. Medicare, established in 1965, provides medical insurance to Americans age 65 and older, as well as certain disabled persons. In 2017, the program covered 58 million individuals. Total Medicare spending is projected to reach $718 billion in FY2018 and $1,390 billion in FY2027, with most of the spending allocated to benefit payments and administration. Medicare consists of four parts, with Part A covering inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home care. Part A of Medicare covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing care, hospice care, and some home health services. Most individuals aged 65 and older are automatically entitled to premium-free Part A if they or their spouse paid Medicare payroll taxes for at least 40 quarters. Part A services are funded by a 2.9% payroll tax on earnings of current workers. Part B covers medical services like physician services, laboratory services, durable medical equipment, and outpatient hospital services. Enrollment in Part B is optional, but most beneficiaries with Part A also enroll in Part B. Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage) is a private plan option covering all Parts A and B services except hospice, funded through the HI and SMI trust funds. Part D is a private plan option for outpatient prescription drug benefits, funded through the Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund. About 76% of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Part D or have coverage through an employer retiree plan subsidized by Medicare. Beneficiaries are responsible for paying Medicare Parts B and D premiums, as well as out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and coinsurance. Most have supplemental insurance to help cover expenses. Medicare Advantage has out-of-pocket spending limits. Medicare pays providers directly under Parts A and B, while private insurers receive monthly payments under Parts C and D. Medicare pays private insurers a monthly capitated amount under Parts C and D to provide coverage to enrollees, adjusted for differences in beneficiary risk factors. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC) fights healthcare fraud and waste, funded by mandatory and discretionary funds, with three programs including Medicaid Oversight and MIP. The Medicare program includes Parts A, B, C, and D, with program integrity efforts expanding into capitated payment systems. The administration of Medicare is funded through discretionary and mandatory resources subject to reductions under sequestration orders. The funding for Medicare includes payments to contractors for processing claims, beneficiary outreach, and IT infrastructure maintenance. Special rules limit the impact of budget sequestration on Medicare benefit payments, with caps of 2% under BCA and 4% under Statutory PAYGO orders. Administrative spending is not subject to these caps. Under the current mandatory sequestration orders, Medicare benefit payments are capped at 2% reduction. If OMB determines larger reductions are needed for other budget categories, Medicare may face a 2% cut while other programs face higher cuts to achieve necessary savings. Under current mandatory sequestration orders, Medicare benefit payments are capped at a 2% reduction. If larger reductions are needed for other budget categories, the determined percentage would be applied to all nonexempt, nondefense, mandatory accounts, including Medicare. If a mandatory sequestration order is triggered by Statutory PAYGO, Medicare benefits reduction would be capped at 4%. Certain Medicare programs and activities are exempted from Statutory PAYGO and BCA sequestration orders. Under mandatory sequestration orders, Medicare benefit payments are subject to a 2% reduction cap. If larger reductions are necessary, the percentage would apply to all nonexempt, nondefense, mandatory accounts. Statutory PAYGO triggers a 4% cap on Medicare benefit reductions. Sequestration orders are issued by OMB for one fiscal year and can be reissued as needed. Medicare benefit payments are sequestered the following month after the order is issued. The BCA mandatory sequester orders are issued by OMB for one fiscal year and can be reissued as needed. The first order takes effect on the first date of the following month and remains in effect for one year. Subsequent orders begin after the completion of the initial order. For example, the FY2013 order was issued on March 1, 2013, and remained in effect until March 31, 2014. The FY2014 order was issued on April 10, 2013, and was in effect from April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015. The OMB issues sequester orders for one fiscal year based on current law. Medicare outlays are estimated and compared to the sequestrable budget authority. If outlays exceed estimates, they are sequestered at the established percentage. No adjustments are made if outlays are less than estimated. Under Medicare Parts A and B, providers are paid by the federal government on a fee-for-service basis. Sequestration reductions apply only to the portion of the payment to providers by Medicare, not to beneficiary cost-sharing amounts or amounts paid by other insurance. Under Medicare Parts A and B, providers are paid by the federal government on a fee-for-service basis. Sequestration reductions apply only to the portion of the payment to providers by Medicare, not to beneficiary cost-sharing amounts or amounts paid by other insurance. For example, if a beneficiary has a 20% co-insurance, they would pay $20, while Medicare's payment would be reduced by 2% under the FY2018 sequestration order, resulting in a total Medicare payment of $78.40. The provider would receive a payment of $98.40, considered payment in full with no expectation for higher copayments from the beneficiary. Medicare non-participating providers may receive lower reimbursement rates and can charge beneficiaries more than the fee schedule amount. In these cases, the 2% reduction in Medicare payments is passed on to the patient, who then pays the provider the reduced amount. Under Medicare, providers may charge beneficiaries more than the fee schedule amount, with the 2% reduction in Medicare payments passed on to the patient. The beneficiary is responsible for paying the provider the listed amount on the check, cost sharing, balance bill charges, and sequestered amounts. Medicare Payment Advisory Commission considers sequestration effects in payment assessments for provider payments. Medicare Advantage plans receive monthly payments per person for providing Medicare-covered benefits, excluding hospice, regardless of the services used by beneficiaries. Payments to Medicare Advantage plans are fixed and determined annually through a bid process approved by CMS. These payments cover medical costs, administrative expenses, plan profits, risk adjustments, and rebates to beneficiaries. Sequestration cuts are applied uniformly to these payments, with MAOs having discretion on how to distribute the cuts across different components while still adhering to guidelines. Some Medicare Advantage plans have tried to pass sequestration cuts onto providers through lower reimbursement rates, but they may be limited in doing so. CMS guidelines state that reductions in payments to contracted providers must be allowed in the contract or renegotiated. In cases of emergency out-of-network care, MAOs are required to reimburse non-contracted providers. MAOs have the discretion to incorporate sequestration cuts into payments to non-contracted providers, who must accept reduced payments as full. Regulations limit MAOs' responses to sequestration in the bid process, ensuring reasonable revenue margins and preventing impacts on beneficiaries' plan benefits or liabilities. This makes it challenging for MAOs to pass sequestration cuts onto beneficiaries through higher premiums or increased non-Medicare profits. The Secretary cannot consider sequestration cuts when adjusting Medicare payment rates for Part C, resulting in larger annual adjustments compared to baselines with sequestration cuts. Medicare Part D plans receive a base monthly payment adjusted for risk sharing mechanisms, but plans receive different adjustments. The Part D program includes risk sharing adjustments in monthly payments, with reductions only applied to direct subsidy amounts due to sequestration. Part D risk sharing adjustments are exempt from sequestration. The Retiree Drug Subsidy Program provides subsidies to qualified employers and union groups for prescription drug insurance. Instead of a capitated monthly payment, sponsors receive a federal subsidy at the end of the year to cover a portion of gross prescription drug costs for each retiree. Sequestration reductions are applied to the annual subsidy amount under this program. The HHS Secretary is prohibited from considering sequestration cuts when computing the Part D annual growth rate. Since FY2013, Medicare benefit payments have been subject to a 2% annual reduction limit under the BCA sequestration order. Nondefense mandatory budget authority reductions also apply to Medicare administrative spending. Medicare administrative spending has been subject to budget authority reductions ranging from 5.1% to 7.3% through FY2018. The sequestration order mandates a 6.6% reduction in Medicare administrative expenses. The total reduction in Medicare administration budget authority is not specified in the OMB sequestration report. Medicare benefit payments make up 89% of sequestrable budget authority, with 70% of sequestered funds coming from Medicare benefit payments. In FY2018, Medicare benefit payments are estimated to account for the largest share of sequestrable budget authority and sequestered funds since the first BCA sequestration order was issued for FY2013. Medicare Part C is sequestered, but OMB sequestration orders do not distinguish between Medicare parts. Medicare Advantage accounted for 32% of all HI Trust Fund benefit payments and 38% of all SMI Trust Fund benefit payments from FY2016-FY2017. CBO estimates a 96% increase in Medicare benefit payment outlays from FY2018 to FY2027. Payment outlays are projected to increase by 96% from FY2018 to FY2027, reaching $1,387 billion in the last year of BCA mandatory sequestration. This rise is mainly due to an aging population and rising healthcare costs per person. The increase in payments would be subject to sequestration, which was prompted by the BCA to achieve savings through mandatory sequestration of funds, reduced discretionary spending limits, and lower expected interest payments on U.S. government debt. Medicare benefit payments, although a significant portion of sequestered funds, contribute a smaller share to overall BCA savings, around 10%, with reduced discretionary spending limits playing a larger role. In FY2018, sequestered Medicare benefit payments will make up about 10% of total BCA savings, with reduced discretionary spending limits accounting for a larger share.

The curr_chunk provides information on various CRS reports related to Medicare Advantage, Budget Control Act, Sequestration, and Budget Terminology Definitions. Budget Terminology Definitions from the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA) include Budget Authority, Budgetary Resources, Discretionary Appropriations, and Mandatory Spending. Budget Authority allows for financial obligations using federal government funds, while Budgetary Resources cover new obligations and their liquidation. Discretionary Appropriations are budgetary resources provided in appropriation Acts, excluding direct-spending programs, and Mandatory Spending includes entitlement authority and programs like Medicare. Sequestration refers to the cancellation of budgetary resources provided by discretionary appropriations or direct spending laws. Medicare Benefit Payments cover all payments for programs under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Revised Nonsecurity Category includes discretionary appropriations other than in budget function 050, while Revised Security Category includes discretionary appropriations in budget function 050.
