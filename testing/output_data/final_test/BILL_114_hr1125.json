    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Start Saving Sooner Act of 2015\". Congress finds that children as young as 3 years old can understand financial concepts and form basic financial habits by age 7. Research shows that children of low-income parents who save money are more likely to move up the economic ladder. Opening tax-advantaged retirement accounts for children aged 0-18 could lead to them having more tax-free assets by retirement age. Federal policy should enable parents, guardians, and families of all income levels to encourage youth saving and investment for retirement at an earlier age. This will benefit children by providing longer exposure to compound interest, leading to higher financial literacy, college graduation rates, and retirement security in adulthood. Additionally, creating retirement savings incentives for low-income Americans can increase personal financial security and reduce reliance on Social Security for retirement income. Incentives and structures are needed to help low-income Americans save more for retirement. A refundable incentive like the Saver's Credit could reach 50 million low-income households, significantly more than a non-refundable credit. SEC. 3. YOUNG SAVERS ACCOUNT. Establishment of a Young Savers Account under Section 408A of the Internal Revenue Code allows individuals under 18 to have a Roth IRA with specific contribution limits. For any taxable year, contributions to young savers accounts increase contribution limits for individuals and the accounts themselves under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. For any taxable year, contributions to young savers accounts increase contribution limits for individuals and the accounts themselves under specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code. Qualified young saver contributions refer to contributions made by an individual to a young savers account maintained on behalf of another individual, with limitations on the aggregate amount that can be contributed for any taxable year. The deductible amount for qualified young saver contributions in a taxable year is limited by the aggregate amount under section 219(b)(5). Contributions to young savers accounts can increase contribution limits for individuals, with restrictions on the total amount that can be contributed annually. The text discusses amendments to the Internal Revenue Code regarding the eligibility for the Savers Credit and the refund payable to young savers accounts. Contributions to young savers accounts can increase contribution limits for individuals. SEC. 6433. YOUNG SAVERS ACCOUNT REFUND PAYMENT. The Secretary will refund overpayments related to the Savers Credit into the young savers account. Regulations will be prescribed for implementation. The Commissioner of Social Security will provide information on young savers accounts with social security card applications. Assets in these accounts will not affect eligibility for federal programs or benefits. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014."
