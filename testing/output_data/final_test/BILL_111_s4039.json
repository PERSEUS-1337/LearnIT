Section 485(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require institutions of higher education to develop and distribute a statement of policy regarding sexual assault and intimate partner violence prevention programs. This includes procedures for handling such offenses once they occur. The amended Section 485(f) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 requires institutions to provide written information to victims of sexual or domestic violence offenses. This includes explaining their right to notify law enforcement authorities and obtain orders of protection if needed. The policy requires institutions to provide information on obtaining orders of protection and contact details for support services for victims of sexual or domestic violence. It also mandates honoring any lawful orders issued by criminal or civil courts. Education programs are required to promote awareness of sex offenses and intimate partner violence, including stalking, dating violence, sexual violence, and domestic violence. This includes primary prevention and awareness programming for new students and employees, covering topics such as consent, reporting offenses, bystander intervention, and risk reduction. Ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns are also mandated for students and faculty. The curr_chunk provides information on possible sanctions and procedures for victims to follow in cases of sex offenses or intimate partner violence on campus. It includes details on who to contact, preserving evidence, and reporting the offense. The curr_chunk outlines procedures for handling sex offenses and intimate partner violence on campus, including the right to request disciplinary proceedings, trained officials, the preponderance of evidence standard, equal opportunities for the accuser and accused, and the presence of advisors during proceedings. The procedures for handling sex offenses and intimate partner violence on campus include informing both the accuser and accused of the final results within one business day. Victims are entitled to options for changing academic, living, transportation, and working situations if requested and reasonably available. The paragraph discusses the definition of \"intimate partner violence\" which includes physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a current or former partner. It also encompasses stalking, dating violence, sexual violence, and domestic violence offenses. The term 'stalking' is defined as willfully and repeatedly engaging in harassing conduct that alarms, torments, or terrorizes an individual. 'Primary prevention' refers to strategies aimed at stopping sexual and intimate partner violence before it occurs by changing social norms. Awareness programming aims to alert students about intimate partner violence, sexual violence, and stalking by discussing prevalence, statistics, and outcomes of disciplinary proceedings at higher education institutions. The curr_chunk discusses risk factors and definitions related to sexual violence prevention, including bystander intervention and risk reduction strategies. The curr_chunk discusses final results in disciplinary matters within institutions, including the disclosure of the accused's name, alleged violation, essential findings, and imposed sanctions. The curr_chunk adds a new requirement for the Secretary to consult the Attorney General on best practices for preventing and responding to sex offenses and intimate partner violence in higher education institutions. The amendments made by this Act will be effective for annual security reports prepared by higher education institutions in calendar year 2012 and beyond."
