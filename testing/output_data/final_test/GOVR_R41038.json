The compilation is based on searches of legal databases and aims to be comprehensive, although some editorial judgment was necessary. The final product may be considered over- or under-inclusive. The report surveys federal statutes mentioning race, gender, or ethnicity in federal program administration. It includes laws related to socially and economically disadvantaged groups, without defining terms or tracking how they are defined. The report surveys federal statutes mentioning race, gender, or ethnicity in federal program administration. It is important to check the statutes authorizing and regulations implementing specific programs, as well as any relevant case law, to determine eligibility. Certain categories of federal law, such as federal regulations and executive orders, are generally not covered. Additionally, federal civil rights statutes like Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act are not included, as they place nondiscrimination requirements without mandating preferences based on race, ethnicity, or gender. Regulations of federal departments or agencies under Title VI are also not included for similar reasons. The study excludes federal antidiscrimination laws like Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act, which do not mandate preferences based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It also does not consider federal programs solely for Native Americans on reservations. The Supreme Court has upheld programs for Native Americans on reservations based on the Government's trust relationship with Tribes and the unique legal status of Indians. These programs are not considered racial discrimination but are designed to further Indian self-government. Some programs are open to Native Americans and Indian tribes, but those exclusively for Native Americans are generally not included. The report focuses on preference programs that directly benefit minorities or women, excluding those that require reporting to Congress. It categorizes programs into government-wide and agency-specific sections, listing programs that provide preferential treatment to minorities or women at the federal level. The report lists federal programs that provide preferential treatment to minorities or women, including Affirmative Action Plans for federal contractors with 50 or more employees.

Agency heads must establish agency-specific goals for contracting and subcontracting with SBDs and WOSBs in consultation with the SBA Administrator. The agency-specific goals should realistically reflect small businesses' potential to perform federal contracts and subcontracts. The Minority Small Business and Capital Development Program (8(a) Program) provides benefits for participating small businesses. The Small Business Innovation Program (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(j); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 637(a)) offers benefits to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

Contractor performance on subcontracting goals is considered in past performance evaluations for future contracts. The Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program authorizes agencies to use evaluation factors focused on subcontracting with SDBs when awarding prime contracts. Factors include identifying subcontracting opportunities, commitment to use SDBs, complexity of work, realism of proposals, past performance in complying with subcontracting goals, and extent of SDB participation. The Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program allows agencies to use evaluation factors for subcontracting with SDBs when awarding prime contracts. Agencies can also incorporate monetary incentives for subcontracting with SDBs into prime contracts, rewarding prime contractors for exceeding their subcontracting targets. Additionally, agencies are encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks to promote opportunities for these businesses. The Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program authorizes agencies to restrict competition for federal contracts to small businesses owned and controlled by women meeting specific criteria.
