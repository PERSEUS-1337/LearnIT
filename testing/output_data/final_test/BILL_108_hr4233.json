    "content": "The Act is titled the \"American Home Fire Safety Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purposes. In 1998, there were 12,800 candle fires causing 170 deaths, 1,200 injuries, and $174.6 million in property damage. Mattress and bedding fires resulted in 410 deaths, 2,260 injuries, and $255.4 million in damage despite industry efforts to reduce flammability. Upholstered furniture fires caused 520 deaths in 1998, with no significant change since 1994. Death rates have decreased in California, which has stricter standards, compared to the national average. Children, the elderly, and lower income families are at higher risk of death and injury from these fires. The increased incidents of fire, particularly from children playing with matches, candles, and lighters, have led to a higher risk of death and injury from upholstered furniture fires. Congress should establish fire safety standards for candles, mattresses, bed clothing, and upholstered furniture, with the Consumer Product Safety Commission enforcing these standards. The Environmental Protection Agency should review materials used to meet these standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission should develop safety standards to reduce flammability in candles, mattresses, bed clothing, and upholstered furniture. Consumer Product Safety Commission to develop fire safety standards for consumer products. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will establish fire safety standards for upholstered furniture and mattresses within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The standards will be based on Technical Bulletin 117 for upholstered furniture and Technical Bulletin 603 for mattresses. The State of California published fire safety standards for bedclothing and candles in February 2003, based on Technical Bulletin 604 and Provisional Standard PS 59-02. The Consumer Product Safety Act exempts the promulgation requirements for fire safety standards for candles based on the Provisional Specification by ASTM International."
