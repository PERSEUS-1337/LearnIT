    "content": "Medicaid case management involves assisting eligible beneficiaries in obtaining necessary medical services. Targeted case management is specific to certain beneficiary groups based on disease, condition, or geographic location. TCM and case management are optional services that states can choose to provide. Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) allow states to cover TCM and case management services through state plan amendments. The Medicaid statute for case management was amended by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, with new rules issued by CMS for claiming reimbursement. Most states cover TCM benefits, leading to a rapid increase in Medicaid expenditures for TCM. Medicaid expenditures for TCM have increased rapidly, with total federal and state TCM expenditures more than doubling between FY1999 and FY2005. The number of beneficiaries receiving TCM also increased significantly during this period. Average TCM expenditures per beneficiary rose by 26.9%. Overall Medicaid expenditures and the number of beneficiaries also increased, with average spending per Medicaid beneficiary increasing by approximately 30.7% from FY1999 to FY2005. In FY2005, total federal and state expenditures for TCM services ranged from $535 million in California to $872,000 in Hawaii. The number of beneficiaries receiving TCM services varied from 820,000 individuals in Illinois to 1,463 in Hawaii. National per beneficiary TCM expenditures were $1,058 in FY2005, with state expenditures ranging from $5,778 in Massachusetts to $116 per beneficiary in Ohio. Most states spent between $500 to $1,500 per beneficiary on TCM in FY2005. Some states did not report TCM expenditures in the Medicaid Statistical Information System. In FY2005, some states did not report TCM expenditures in the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) database. Six states and the District of Columbia reported no TCM expenditures, with Delaware being the only state indicating it does not cover TCM. The CMS Director of Medicaid and State Operations issued a letter addressing TCM claiming for children in foster care, providing guidance for states on claiming TCM expenditures under Medicaid. The letter reiterated statutory language defining TCM broadly and allowing states flexibility in covering and structuring TCM services. In 2001, the SMDL provided examples of appropriate TCM expenditure claiming. States received guidance on TCM claiming from GAO and HHS/OIG reports critical of state practices. Maryland's SPA for foster care TCM was denied in 2004, leading to ambiguity on TCM practices. TCM expenditures increased, raising questions about states delivering services through other programs and classifying them as Medicaid TCM. HHS/OIG audits found state practices inconsistent with policy, leading to claims of abusive practices by Bush administration officials. Congress passed DRA in 2005 to address these issues. In 2005, Congress passed the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) which refined the definition of case management services, specifying activities such as assessment, care plan development, referral, monitoring, and follow-up. The DRA clarified that case management, including Targeted Case Management (TCM), does not include the direct provision of medical, educational, social, or other services. It also stated that federal matching payments cannot assist non-eligible individuals or those ineligible for TCM. Additionally, Medicaid third-party rules apply to case management payments. The DRA clarified that Medicaid third-party rules apply to case management payments, allowing payments for TCM only if no other third parties are available. States should cost-allocate when sharing costs for case management services with other federally funded programs. The DRA instructed the Secretary of HHS to implement interim final regulations for case management changes, with the TCM interim final rule published on December 4, 2007. This rule provides guidance on claiming federal financial participation for TCM expenditures and addresses case management issues previously open to interpretation. CMS stipulated that the case management interim final rule applies to all Medicaid authorities, covering TCM and services delivered through waivers. The regulation is expected to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $1.28 billion between FY2008 and FY2012, with federal foster care expenditures increasing by $369 million. FFP will be paid for case management in community settings or transitioning from institutions, with exceptions for individuals with complex medical needs. The interim final rule allows states to claim FFP to assist individuals transitioning from institutions to community settings, with a focus on TCM services spanning inpatient and community placement. FFP is payable after beneficiaries' community residence begins, and TCM can help coordinate services like housing and transportation for the transition. States must amend their Medicaid state plans to continue covering case management services after March 2009. This includes specifying the target beneficiary group, geographic area served, types of services offered, qualifications of providers, and payment methodology. Separate State Plan Amendments (SPAs) are required for each target group and subgroup. Providers delivering case management services must meet established qualifications. Case managers can provide assessments, care plans, referrals, monitoring, and follow-up activities for beneficiaries. The new regulations require states to assign each Medicaid beneficiary only one case manager to ensure unified planning and reduce fragmentation. Case managers cannot act as gatekeepers or make medical necessity determinations. Beneficiaries must have free choice of qualified case managers, and access to case management cannot be tied to specific providers. States must decide which target group to assign beneficiaries if they fit in multiple groups. Compliance date for transitioning to one case manager may be delayed. Case managers cannot provide direct medical services unless billed separately. Medicaid case management services require treatment plans and detailed records documenting progress, units of service, and coordination with other programs. States must use unit-of-time reimbursement for fee-for-service case management. Managed care contracts cannot claim federal funding for case management of medical services. The interim final rule prohibits states from claiming federal funding for case management of medical services under managed care contracts, except when services extend beyond medical components to include non-medical services. This prohibition extends to other programs such as child welfare, protective services, parole, probation, public guardianship, and special education. The interim final rule prohibits states from claiming federal funding for case management of medical services under managed care contracts, except for non-medical services. This prohibition extends to child welfare, protective services, public guardianship, special education, and therapeutic foster care. The rule allows FFP for referral services, overseeing placements, training of workers, supervision, court attendance, and compensation for foster care patients. Some argue that CMS underestimated the impact of the regulations and is shifting Medicaid costs to states. The interim final rule shifts Medicaid costs to states by reducing federal expenditures, with estimates ranging from $760 million to $3.1 billion over five years. Various perspectives exist on the impact of the rule on TCM policy issues. The interim final rule on TCM policy issues involves three perspectives: advocates for beneficiaries, state governments/Medicaid agencies, and CMS. CMS clarifies regulations to control federal outlays, reduce confusion, and address past abuses in TCM claiming. Advocates and states fear that the new rule on TCM claiming will lead to reduced federal funding, resulting in cuts to TCM services for children and adult beneficiaries. They believe the rule is more restrictive than intended by Congress and will increase state costs while decreasing provider participation and quality of care. Child welfare advocates are concerned that Medicaid reimbursement changes will impact services for mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals. Child welfare advocates argue that Medicaid reimbursement changes will increase costs and decrease provider participation, leading to reduced services for children in foster care and protective services. They believe that states cannot afford to fund enough TCM services, and further restrictions will force cuts in services, causing existing medical conditions to deteriorate. Without TCM, beneficiaries will require more costly health care treatment in the future. The CMS case management rule is criticized for increasing costs due to additional administrative activities, such as reporting requirements and delayed billing. State Medicaid agencies believe these rules will hinder their ability to provide TCM services to beneficiaries. The interim final rule allows states up to two years to comply with the one-provider provision, recognizing the complexity of adapting systems. State Medicaid agencies are concerned about the short timeline to comply with the interim final rule on case management, fearing sudden withdrawal of FFP. Legislation has been introduced to delay changes to Medicaid case management services until April 1, 2009. A bill, H.R. 5613, was introduced to delay Medicaid case management changes until April 1, 2009. The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted to send the bill to the full House, requiring reports on the regulations' purpose, implementation, and legal basis. An independent contractor would also prepare a comprehensive report by March 1, 2009. The Senate introduced a similar bill to H.R. 5613, called the Economic Recovery in Health Care Act of 2008 (S. 2819), which also imposed a moratorium on certain Medicaid regulations until April 1, 2009. The Senate passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2642) on May 22, 2008, which included a moratorium on the implementation of certain Medicaid regulations until April 1, 2009. H.R. 2642, passed by the House and Senate in 2008, included moratoria on six Medicaid regulations, such as case management and TCM, until April 1, 2009. The bill also required the Secretary to submit reports to specific committees and hire an independent contractor to assess the impact of the regulations. The President signed P.L. 110-252 into law on June 30, 2008, after the Senate and House adopted the final version of the budget resolution. The conference agreement included provisions to delay Medicaid administrative regulations, specifically targeting Medicaid case management and TCM. The Bush Administration's FY2009 federal budget proposed legislation to restrict TCM claiming rates. However, no legislation has been offered yet."
