    "content": "Alternative dispute resolution is a method of action. In General, a covered health care malpractice action must be initially resolved under an alternative dispute resolution system certified by the Attorney General or the alternative Federal system before being brought to a State or Federal court. The subject of the action must be initially resolved under an alternative dispute resolution system certified by the Attorney General before being brought to court. This involves reaching a decision on liability and damages within a specified timeframe. In a healthcare malpractice claim, parties must submit sealed statements to a court selected by the arbitrator to indicate if they contest the decision. The sealed statements remain sealed until all parties have submitted them or the submission deadline. A covered healthcare malpractice action cannot be brought to court unless the party files the action there. In a healthcare malpractice claim, parties must submit sealed statements to a court selected by the arbitrator to indicate if they contest the decision. The action must be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of the decision, and a notice of intent must be filed by any party. The term \"court of competent jurisdiction\" refers to the appropriate State trial court for actions filed in a State court and the appropriate United States district court for actions filed in a Federal court. (d) Uncontested ADR decisions have the same status as a verdict in a malpractice action. Judicial review standard is de novo. Costs and attorneys' fees awarded post-ADR if final judgment is not more favorable to contesting party. If the final judgment or order in a case is not more favorable to the party contesting the ADR decision than the ADR decision itself, the opposing party can petition the court for payment of costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred after the ADR decision. The court may then order the contesting party to pay these costs and expenses if the final judgment is not more favorable to them than the ADR decision. Attorneys' fees awarded after an ADR decision must be reasonable and based on the attorney's hourly rate, considering qualifications, experience, and case complexity. The fees should not exceed the actual costs incurred for legal services related to the claim. The requirements of this section apply to covered health care malpractice claims arising 270 days after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR STATE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION SYSTEMS. The State's alternative dispute resolution system must apply to all health care malpractice claims, issue a written opinion within 180 days, and include findings of fact and cost details. The State's alternative dispute resolution system for health care malpractice claims must meet qualifications set by the State, be approved by the State or local governments, allow parties to select a resolution procedure, and transmit information to the State agency. The alternative dispute resolution system for health care malpractice claims must transmit findings to the State agency responsible for monitoring professionals, and provide information on resolved disputes to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality while maintaining parties' anonymity. SEC. 6. CERTIFICATION OF STATE SYSTEMS; APPLICABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE FEDERAL SYSTEM. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, will certify whether each State's alternative dispute resolution systems meet the requirements of the Act. If the system meets the requirements of section 5, it will be certified for a calendar year. Additionally, within 270 days of the Act's enactment, the Attorney General will establish the applicability of the alternative federal system. The General, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish an alternative Federal ADR system for resolving covered health care malpractice claims in States without a certified ADR system. The system will apply certain requirements, appoint medical and legal experts as arbitrators, and operate in conjunction with the state's existing system. The Attorney General may modify the alternative Federal ADR system in a State to consider existing dispute resolution procedures. States using the system must reimburse the United States for costs incurred during the year. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on private litigation insurance markets in the UK and Germany to assess their effectiveness in providing affordable access to courts and reimbursing prevailing parties in \"loser pays\" systems. A report on the study's results must be submitted to Congress within 270 days of the Act's enactment."
