    "content": "Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 is amended to include a new part called \"GO GIRL\" aimed at preparing girls for the 21st century. Congress finds that women have historically been underrepresented in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology occupations. Female students take fewer high-level math and science courses, fewer advanced computer classes, and earn fewer degrees in these fields compared to male students. Early career exploration is crucial, and teachers' attitudes and classroom atmosphere impact female students' interest in nontraditional fields. Stereotypes about appropriate careers for females also play a role. Stereotypes, lack of role models, and limited access deter girls from STEM careers. Females rate themselves lower in computer ability. 65% of the economy will be IT-based. Recruitment practices often overlook females. \"Program authority under SEC. 3602.\" The Secretary can provide grants to local educational agencies to support girls in STEM fields and prepare them for careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. To be eligible, agencies must submit an application with required information. The program description for grants supporting girls in STEM fields must include program content, collaboration between schools, participant recruitment, instructional activities, and an evaluation plan. \"Elementary school program under SEC. 3603.\" A local educational agency receiving a grant must select elementary schools to provide services that encourage girls in grades 4 through 8 to pursue studies in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, introduce them to related careers, and educate parents about the challenges girls face in these subjects. Services may include tutoring in reading, science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. The grant provides various services to encourage girls in grades 4 and higher to pursue studies in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology. This includes tutoring, mentoring, covering costs for events, after-school activities, summer programs, software purchases, and field trips. The grant offers field trips to educate and inspire girls in science, math, engineering, and technology, acquainting them with related careers. Additionally, it provides information to parents to support their daughters' interest in these fields. SEC. 3604. SECONDARY SCHOOL PROGRAM. A local educational agency receiving a grant must select secondary schools to provide services that encourage girls in grades 9 and higher to pursue STEM majors, offer academic advice, promote STEM careers, and educate parents about challenges girls face in STEM. Services may include academic assistance and career planning. The grant provides support for tutoring, mentoring, event attendance, internships, after-school activities, and summer programs to encourage girls in grades 9 and higher to pursue STEM fields. Encouraging girls in grades 9 and higher to pursue STEM fields through various activities such as purchasing software, offering field trips, visiting higher education institutions, and meeting with educators and college students. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2002 and the following 4 years is set at $50,000,000 to support STEM initiatives."
