    "content": "The \"Improved Budget Presentation Act\" establishes a commission to provide more effective presentation of US Government expenses. The Congress acknowledges the lack of comprehensive evaluation of capital investment programs, leading to a fragmented approach in setting priorities and planning for public facilities, which hinders the efficiency and stability of the capital investment program. A separate capital budget would establish a useful planning process focusing on long-term projects, costs, and benefits for an efficient capital investment program. The establishment of a Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States is outlined in Section 4. The Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States is established with 9 members, including the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget as Chairman, the Comptroller General, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, and members appointed by the House and Senate leaders. The Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States consists of 9 members, including the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget as Chairman, the Comptroller General, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, and two executive branch officials appointed by the President. These officials must hold positions at or above level III of the Executive Schedule and have substantial responsibilities for formulating, presenting, and implementing executive budgets. Appointments to the Commission must be completed within 30 days after the effective date of this Act, and vacancies will not affect its powers and will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members of the Commission will not receive compensation for their service. Members of the Commission on the Presentation of the Budget of the United States will not receive compensation for their service, but will be reimbursed by their Federal organization for travel and other necessary expenses.
