    "content": "The Act titled \"Good Samaritan Search and Recovery Act\" provides expedited access to certain federal land. The \"Good Samaritan Search and Recovery Act\" defines terms like \"eligible\" for not-for-profit organizations, \"good Samaritan search-and-recovery mission\" for finding missing individuals believed to be deceased, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture. Each Secretary is required to develop and implement processes. Each Secretary must establish a process to expedite access to Federal land for eligible organizations and individuals conducting good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions. Access granted is for private purposes and does not classify the individual as a Federal volunteer. Eligible organizations and individuals conducting good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions are exempt from certain federal laws, including the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Federal Employees Compensation Act. Eligible organizations and individuals conducting good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions are exempt from liability insurance requirements on Federal land if they acknowledge and consent to specified provisions and sign a waiver releasing the Federal Government from liability. The Secretary will notify them of approval or denial of requests. The Secretary will notify eligible organizations or individuals of approval or denial of requests for good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions within 48 hours. Denials will include reasons and actions to meet requirements. Each Secretary will develop partnerships with search-and-recovery organizations. The Secretaries will coordinate good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions on Federal land and expedite efforts for missing individuals. A joint report to Congress will detail partnership plans and mission acceleration efforts within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
