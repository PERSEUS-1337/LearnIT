FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact in 1620, America's Founding Fathers declared independence in 1776, and Thomas Jefferson authored the Declaration of Independence in 1781.\" Thomas Jefferson, in his work \"Notes on the State of Virginia,\" emphasized the importance of God-given liberties for a nation's security. George Washington, as President of the Constitutional Convention, urged delegates to uphold their convictions and not compromise for public approval. The events of May 14, 1787, and July 21, 1789, underscored the Founding Fathers' reliance on divine guidance in shaping the nation's future. On July 21, 1789, the First Congress of the United States passed the Northwest Ordinance, emphasizing the importance of religion, morality, and knowledge for good government. On September 25, 1789, they also approved a resolution for a National Day of Thanksgiving, acknowledging the blessings of Almighty God in establishing the government. On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address, emphasizing the dedication to the cause for which soldiers gave their lives. On April 28, 1952, the Supreme Court ruled in Zorach v. Clauson, allowing school children to be excused from public activities. In Zorach v. Clauson, Justice William O. Douglas emphasized that the First Amendment does not mandate a complete separation of Church and State, but rather specifies how they should not be entwined. This ensures that the State and religion are not alienated from each other, allowing for cooperation without violating the Constitution. The First Amendment does not prohibit references to the Almighty in legislative halls, messages from the Chief Executive, or courtroom oaths. In 1954, Congress amended the Pledge of Allegiance to include \"under God.\" The national motto of the United States is \"In God We Trust\", inscribed in various prominent locations. In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled compulsory school prayer unconstitutional, emphasizing the importance of neutrality in religious matters. The Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of neutrality in religious matters, as shown in the decision of Lynch v. Donelly in 1984, where a city's display of a nativity scene was upheld. The Constitution prohibits a hostile attitude towards religion and recognizes the historical influence of religious teachings on legal, political, and personal values. Chief Justice Burger, in a case where a city's nativity scene display was deemed constitutional, highlighted the historical acknowledgment of religion in American life by all branches of government since 1789. Examples include references to religion in the national motto \"In God We Trust\" and the phrase \"One Nation under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance. Public art galleries also exhibit religious paintings predominantly inspired by one faith. The National Gallery in Washington exhibits religious masterpieces with Christian themes. The Supreme Court ruled a mandatory moment of silence for prayer unconstitutional in Wallace v. Jaffree. Justice O'Connor concurred that the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance serve as an acknowledgment of religion with legitimate secular purposes. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a school district's policy for voluntary recitation of the Pledge including the words \"under God\" as constitutional. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance's use of \"under God\" is unconstitutional in teacher-led recitations. This decision was criticized for potentially making the Constitution itself unconstitutional due to its reference to \"Year of our Lord\" in Article VII. SEC. 2. ONE NATION UNDER GOD. Amends Section 4 of title 4, United States Code to reaffirm the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag. SEC. 4 reaffirms the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, specifying the manner of delivery. It states that the pledge should be recited while standing at attention facing the flag, with the right hand over the heart. Men not in uniform should remove any non-religious headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute. The Office of the Law Revision Counsel is tasked with codifying this subsection and noting that the 107th Congress reaffirmed the pledge's language. Additionally, SEC. 3 reaffirms the presence of God in the national motto. SEC. 3 reaffirms the national motto \"In God we trust\" without any changes, stating that the 107th Congress reaffirmed the exact language that has been in place for decades."
