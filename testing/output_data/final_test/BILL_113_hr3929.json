The Pullman Historical District, designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1970, holds significance in American labor history, social history, and urban planning. Built by George M. Pullman between 1880 and 1884, it aimed to provide workers with suitable living conditions. The town was recognized as \"The World's Most Perfect Town\" in 1896. The Pullman factory site symbolizes the historic American struggle for fair labor practices. In 1894, factory workers initiated a strike over unsafe conditions and pay cuts, leading to a nationwide industry strike supported by the American Railway Union. Despite facing a Federal injunction and violent clashes with Federal troops, the strike demonstrated the power of working Americans to advocate for just practices. The Pullman community was the site of the famous 1894 Pullman labor strike, leading to the creation of Labor Day. The Pullman Car Company also played a role in African-American history through the Pullman Porters, ex-slaves employed in a discriminatory environment post-Civil War. The Pullman Porters, who served diligently between the 1870s and 1960s, played a significant role in the development of the Black middle class by carrying information, ideas, and commerce across the country on trains. They were commended for their attention to detail and contributions to education and wealth in Black communities. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, founded by A. Philip Randolph in 1925, was the first African-American labor union with a collective bargaining agreement, fighting against discrimination and advocating for just labor practices. The Pullman community, designed by architect Solon Spencer Beman, is a well-preserved example of 19th-century planning and architecture. It includes historic structures like the Administration Building and row houses for Pullman workers. Threatened by demolition in 1960 and a fire in 1998, restoration efforts have preserved the community. The preservation and restoration of the Pullman community, designated as a National Historic Landmark District, Illinois State Landmark, and City of Chicago Landmark District, require cooperation among various entities for the management of its historical and architectural resources. Over 100 civic organizations and sectors support the creation of Pullman National Historical Park. Establishment of Pullman National Historical Park. Pullman National Historical Park in Illinois is established to preserve and interpret labor, civil rights, and architectural history, as well as the role of Pullman in creating the first Labor Day holiday. Coordination of preservation efforts by various entities is also a key purpose. The boundaries of Pullman National Historical Park in Chicago should align with the Pullman Historic District, covering about 300 acres. The National Park Service would initially own the Pullman Factory Complex and surrounding land, with future acquisitions through donation, transfer, or exchange only. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary of the Interior administers Pullman National Historical Park in accordance with applicable laws, including the National Park Service Organic Act and the Act of August 21, 1935. The Secretary may also enter into cooperative agreements for the preservation of non-Federal properties within the Park. The Federal Government may acquire land within and near the Park through donation, transfer, exchange, or purchase. A management plan must be completed within 3 fiscal years, in consultation with the State, in accordance with relevant laws."
