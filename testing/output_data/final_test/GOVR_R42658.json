    "content": "The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA; P.L. 105-220) is the primary federal program supporting workforce development. It includes four main titles: Title I provides job training and services, Title II offers adult education and literacy programs, and Title III amends the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933. Title III of the Workforce Investment Act integrates the U.S. Employment Service into the One-Stop system established by WIA. The authorizations for appropriations for WIA programs expired in FY 2003, and since then, funding has been through the annual appropriations process. Reauthorization bills were passed in the 108th and 109th Congresses, but no further action was taken. In the 112th Congress, discussion drafts were released to amend and reauthorize WIA. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has ordered reported H.R. 4297 \u2014the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was considered and amended before being reported by the committee. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has ordered reported H.R. 4297 \u2014the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012, introduced by Representative Virginia Foxx. The bill was considered and amended before being reported by the committee. The major features of H.R. 4297 pertain to workforce investment systems, adult education, literacy activities, and changes to the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933. The bill compares proposed provisions to current law in tables outlining Title I, Title II, and Title III. The Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, amended in Title III of WIA, authorizes the Employment Service. Title IV of WIA and Title V of H.R. 4297 amend the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, focusing on Vocational Rehabilitation and employment services for individuals with disabilities. Title I of WIA establishes a One-Stop delivery system for state and local training and employment activities, coordinates partner programs, and funds state grant programs for Adult, Youth, and Dislocated Workers, among other national programs. H.R. 4297 consolidates multiple workforce development programs into a single block grant allocated to states. It maintains the One-Stop delivery system for employment and training services. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act funds basic education programs for individuals beyond school age without a high school diploma. H.R. 4297 reauthorizes Title II programs through 2018, limiting annual appropriations to FY2012 levels. It aligns AEFLA with new WIA performance indicators and emphasizes the link between adult education and employment. Title III of the Workforce Investment Act amends the Wagner-Peyser Act, authorizing the Employment Service as a central component of One-Stop delivery systems. The One-Stop delivery system plays a crucial role in matching individuals seeking work with employers under WIA. H.R. 4297 repeals sections authorizing the Employment Service and consolidates funding into the Workforce Investment Fund. The Rehabilitation Act supports programs for employment and independent living for individuals with disabilities, mainly administered by the Rehabilitation Services Administration. Rehabilitation Act's VR grants to states program, a key funding source, is reauthorized through FY2018 in H.R. 4297. It emphasizes serving transitioning students and sets aside 10% of federal allotments for them. The bill also eliminates smaller programs under the Rehabilitation Act."
