    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on employee health insurance expenses. The new section on employee health insurance expenses provides a credit for small employers based on the amount paid for qualified employee health insurance expenses. The credit is 60% for self-only coverage and 70% for family coverage, with dollar limitations of $600 and $1,200 respectively per employee. The term 'small employer' is defined as an employer with an average of 9 or fewer employees in the preceding calendar years. If the employer was not in existence in the 1st preceding year, the determination is based on the 2nd preceding year. The term 'qualified employee health insurance expenses' refers to amounts paid by an employer for health insurance coverage for qualified employees, excluding amounts paid under salary reduction arrangements. The term 'qualified employee' refers to an employee whose annual wages from the employer range from $5,000 to $16,000. The term 'wages' includes net earnings from self-employment for certain employees and is subject to inflation adjustments after 1999. The amount is determined by multiplying a dollar amount by the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100. Rules similar to section 52 apply for this purpose. The rules of section 52 apply to determine the amount for the employee health insurance expenses credit. No double benefit is allowed for these expenses under any other provision of the tax code. The credit is part of the general business credit under section 38(b) and cannot be carried back before it is effective. No portion of the unused business credit attributable to the employee health insurance expenses credit under section 45D can be carried back to a taxable year before the enactment of section 45D. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments under section 45D for employee health insurance expenses apply to taxable years after the enactment of this Act."
