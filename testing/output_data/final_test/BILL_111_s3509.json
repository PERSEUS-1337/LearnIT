    "content": "The Act titled \"Safer Oil and Gas Production Research and Development Act of 2010\" authorizes a program for research and development in the oil and gas production industry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to focus on deepwater well control, accident prevention, and technology research for drilling activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to emphasize deepwater well control, accident prevention, and technology research for drilling activities by the Department. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to focus on safe oil and gas production accident prevention research and development program. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to prioritize safe oil and gas production and accident prevention, including selecting projects on a competitive, peer-reviewed basis. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to prioritize safe oil and gas production through competitive, peer-reviewed selection of projects focusing on deepwater exploration and production technologies for operational safety and environmental impact reduction. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 prioritizes safe oil and gas production through competitive selection of projects focusing on deepwater exploration and production technologies, including well control, blowout prevention, nontoxic materials, and an integrated systems approach. Awards for unconventional resources research will focus on areas such as advanced coalbed methane, deep drilling, natural gas production from tight sands and gas shales, stranded gas, innovative exploration techniques, and enhanced recovery techniques. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 emphasizes safe oil and gas production by awarding projects that focus on deepwater exploration technologies, nontoxic materials, safety, accident prevention, and environmental mitigation for unconventional natural gas and petroleum resources. Awards for small producers will prioritize safety, accident prevention, and environmental mitigation. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 prioritizes safety, accident prevention, and environmental mitigation in oil and gas production. Research and development funding is allocated for technologies addressing safety in deepwater exploration, unconventional natural gas reservoirs, and unconventional oil reservoirs like tar sands and oil shales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allocates funding for research and development in areas such as improved cementing and casing technologies, well control best practices, integrity guidelines for well-plugging and abandonment, wellbore sealant technologies, and blowout prevention devices. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 funds research in various areas, including cementing technologies, well control practices, and blowout prevention devices. A study will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of awards given in 2011 and identify new research areas to achieve program objectives. The Secretary must submit a report to relevant committees by January 1, 2012. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress containing the results of a study conducted on program effectiveness. Optional updates may be made every 5 years. In subsection (e), there are amendments regarding submissions to the Secretary for review. In subsection (i), amendments are made regarding the publication of an annual report on research findings and recommendations for implementation of the program. Amendments are made in subsection (i) to change the subsection heading and remove references to the United States Geological Survey. Additionally, in subsection (j), references to the National Energy Technology Laboratory are struck from the first sentence. SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AWARDS. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to change references from \"ultra-deepwater technology or an ultra-deepwater architecture\" to \"deepwater technology\". \n\nSEC. 5. PROGRAM ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to establish a Program Advisory Committee. The Secretary shall establish an Advisory Committee known as the Program Advisory Committee within 270 days of the Safer Oil and Gas Production Research and Development Act of 2010. The Committee will consist of members appointed by the Secretary with research or operational knowledge of hydrocarbon production, representatives of affected interests, and Federal agencies. The Program Advisory Committee, established within 270 days of the Safer Oil and Gas Production Research and Development Act of 2010, will include members with knowledge of hydrocarbon production, representatives from Federal agencies, State regulatory agencies, and other individuals as determined by the Secretary. The Advisory Committee will not include individuals who are board members, officers, or employees of the program consortium, and the Secretary will ensure a balanced representation of different groups within the Committee. The Advisory Committee established under the Safer Oil and Gas Production Research and Development Act of 2010 may create subcommittees for separate research programs. Its duties include advising the Secretary on program development, implementing programs, and carrying out specific tasks. Committee members serve without compensation but can receive travel expenses. The Committee is prohibited from making funding recommendations for specific projects or entities. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. Section 999G of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to redefine terms related to deepwater architecture and technology for exploration and production of natural gas or petroleum resources at deepwater depths. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to redefine terms related to deepwater architecture and technology for exploration and production of natural gas or petroleum resources at deepwater depths, including removing references to economically inaccessible geological formations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to redefine terms related to deepwater architecture and technology for exploration and production of natural gas or petroleum resources at deepwater depths, including removing references to economically inaccessible geological formations. Funding is addressed in Section 7. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to rename a research fund and adjust funding percentages for safety technology research and development in the oil and gas industry. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to rename a research fund to the \"Safe and Responsible Energy Production Research Fund\" and adjust funding percentages for safety technology research and development in the oil and gas industry. SEC. 8. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. Subtitle J of title IX of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to rename it as the \"Safe Oil and Gas Production and Accident Prevention Program\"."
