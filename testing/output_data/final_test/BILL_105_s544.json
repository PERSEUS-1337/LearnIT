    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Volunteer Protection Act of 1997\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 acknowledges that the fear of liability lawsuits deters volunteers from offering their services, leading to a decrease in volunteers for nonprofit organizations and government entities. This results in diminished community contributions and higher program costs. Federal funds support cost-effective social service programs that are impacted by the lack of volunteers. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 aims to protect volunteers from personal liability risks, especially in national social service programs that heavily rely on volunteer participation. This legislation recognizes that volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher costs due to liability concerns and unwarranted litigation, impacting their ability to provide services that would otherwise be offered by private entities. Efforts to reform should consider the role of states in this matter. The purpose of the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 is to promote the interests of social service program beneficiaries and sustain programs and organizations relying on volunteer contributions by providing liability protections for volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. Reform efforts should respect the role of states in civil justice rules while recognizing the national government's role. SEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY. This Act preempts state laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or governmental entities. States can choose not to apply this Act to civil actions involving parties from the same state by enacting a specific statute. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS. Liability Protection for Volunteers: Volunteers of nonprofit organizations or governmental entities are not liable for harm caused by their actions if they were acting within their responsibilities, properly licensed, and the harm was not willful or criminal. Liability Protection for Volunteers: Volunteers are not liable for harm caused if acting within responsibilities, properly licensed, and harm not due to misconduct. No effect on organization/entity liability. Exceptions apply based on state laws. State limit volunteer liability subject to conditions such as adherence to risk management procedures, liability for volunteer acts like employer-employee relationship, exclusion if operating certain vehicles, and other state-specific laws. State laws may limit volunteer liability based on various conditions, including adherence to risk management procedures and liability for volunteer actions similar to an employer-employee relationship. Additionally, state laws may exclude liability if certain conditions are not met, such as operating specific vehicles. Furthermore, state laws may require nonprofit organizations or governmental entities to provide a financially secure source of recovery for individuals harmed by volunteer actions, which can include insurance policies, risk pooling mechanisms, equivalent assets, or alternative arrangements approved by the state. Different standards may apply for various types of liability exposure. Separate standards for different types of liability exposure may be specified, including limitations on punitive damages for volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities. Punitive damages may not be awarded unless clear and convincing evidence shows willful or criminal misconduct by the volunteer. Exceptions to Limitations on Liability: The limitations on liability for volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or governmental entities do not apply to misconduct involving violence, terrorism, hate crimes, or sexual offenses. The defendant's misconduct may involve a sexual offense, violation of civil rights laws, or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident. Liability for noneconomic loss is addressed in Section 5. Liability for noneconomic loss in civil actions involving volunteers, nonprofit organizations, or governmental entities is determined based on the percentage of responsibility of each defendant. Each defendant is liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to them in proportion to their responsibility for the harm to the claimant. Separate judgments are rendered against each defendant accordingly. In civil actions, liability for noneconomic loss is determined by the percentage of responsibility of each defendant. The trier of fact assigns the amount of noneconomic loss to each defendant based on their responsibility for the harm to the claimant. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"economic loss\" as pecuniary loss resulting from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, and loss of business opportunities. \"Harm\" includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. \"Noneconomic losses\" refer to losses such as pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. The term \"nonprofit organization\" refers to organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or those operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes in various States and territories. A volunteer is an individual who performs services for a nonprofit organization or governmental entity without receiving compensation exceeding $500 per year. This includes volunteers serving in various roles such as director, officer, trustee, or direct service volunteer. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by volunteers filed after the effective date, regardless of when the harm occurred."
