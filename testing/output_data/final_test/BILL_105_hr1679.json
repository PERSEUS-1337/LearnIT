    "content": "The \"Cardiac Arrest Survival Act\" is the short title of this legislation. The findings section follows. The Congress finds that over 350,000 adults suffer cardiac arrest annually, with a high mortality rate due to delayed or lack of defibrillator use. Cardiac arrest deaths result from various causes like heart disease, drownings, allergic reactions, or electrical shocks. Successful survival depends on early implementation of a chain of events known as the chain of survival, starting from the moment of arrest until the patient reaches the hospital. The first responder must take quick and simple actions to care for the patient and ensure prompt medical attention. A coordinated Federal response is necessary to ensure timely lifesaving interventions for nontraumatic cardiac arrest victims. First responders are typically lay persons or professionals from various fields who are present at the scene of the arrest. The text chunk discusses the need for expanded research on immediate out-of-hospital lifesaving interventions for nontraumatic cardiac arrest patients, the development of nationally uniform educational content on these interventions, and the identification of barriers to implementing them. The curr_chunk discusses the development of model State legislation to reduce barriers and enhance each State's response to the problem of nontraumatic cardiac arrest. The National Institutes of Health Model Program focuses on the first links in the chain of survival for nontraumatic cardiac arrest. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include programs for developing and disseminating a core content for a model State training program on cardiac arrest in emergency medical services educational curricula. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include programs for developing a core content for a model State training program on cardiac arrest care providers to provide lifesaving interventions, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with age-specific criteria and reevaluation of interventions. The curr_chunk discusses the operation of a demonstration project to provide training in core content for cardiac arrest care providers, defining and identifying these providers, establishing criteria for completion of core content, and identifying necessary equipment and supplies for lifesaving interventions. The curr_chunk discusses the development of model State legislation in cooperation with the Attorney General to ensure access to emergency medical services and provide good samaritan immunity for cardiac arrest care providers and those involved in training programs. The curr_chunk discusses the development of a national database for reporting and collecting information on cardiac arrest incidents, survival rates, and the effectiveness of interventions. The curr_chunk highlights the importance of improving the chain of survival for cardiac arrest patients through the publication of a biennial public report summarizing progress in care. The curr_chunk establishes a Commission on Cardiac Arrest Survival. The Commission on Cardiac Arrest Survival is established as an independent agency within the executive branch with 15 members appointed by the President and other officials. The Commission on Cardiac Arrest Survival is established with 15 members appointed by the President and other officials, including expertise in emergency medical care, pediatric emergency medicine, cardiology, public safety, trauma, and more. The Commission on Cardiac Arrest Survival is established with 15 members appointed by the President and other officials, including expertise in emergency medical care, pediatric emergency medicine, cardiology, public safety, trauma, legislation, human factors engineering, professional and public education. The Commission includes ex officio members from various agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, General Services Administration, Department of Defense, and Department of Justice. The Commission evaluates the risks and benefits of resuscitative modalities and fulfills various functions related to cardiac arrest survival. The Commission on Cardiac Arrest Survival, in consultation with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, evaluates methods to increase survival from cardiac arrest and may recommend further studies or legislation. Within 18 months of enactment, the Commission must submit a final report to the President and Congress. The Commission has administrative powers to hold hearings and gather evidence as needed. The Commission on Cardiac Arrest Survival has the authority to hold hearings, gather evidence, and receive necessary information from federal departments. Appropriations are authorized as needed for the provisions of this section."
