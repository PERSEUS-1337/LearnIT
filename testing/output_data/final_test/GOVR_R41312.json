The agreement would replace the existing one from 1979 and has an initial term of 30 years. It meets all requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and will enter into effect after a consultation and review period unless Congress acts. The U.S.-Australian civilian nuclear cooperation agreement was submitted for approval by President Obama, with a consultation and review period of 60 days. Congress had the option to approve or disapprove the agreement through a joint resolution. The agreement was governed by Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act and allowed for significant nuclear cooperation between the two countries. The State Department, with advice from the Department of Energy, negotiates a nuclear cooperation agreement with Australia under Section 123 of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act. The agreement allows for the export of nuclear information, material, equipment, and components for research and power production, with restrictions on sensitive technology and uranium enrichment levels. Approval from the United States is required for any enrichment of nuclear material exported to Australia. The 2010 agreement between the United States and Australia expands cooperation on nuclear forensics and allows transfer of nuclear material for radioisotope production. It updates physical security requirements and is crucial for continued uranium supply from Australia to the U.S. The agreement also facilitates Australia's export of uranium to countries using U.S. reactor technology. Congress may consider Australia's role in developing multilateral nuclear fuel cycle services. Australia's strong bilateral relationship with the U.S. and stable political environment could benefit the development of multilateral nuclear fuel facilities. The development of multilateral nuclear fuel facilities is being considered, with Australia potentially building a uranium enrichment plant. However, there are obstacles to overcome, including policy reconciliation with the United States. Enrichment technology transfer is restricted until criteria are established by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Australia may qualify for transfer under these criteria, but concerns such as cost and finding a host government remain. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is relevant to these discussions. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 allows for congressional review of civilian nuclear cooperation agreements. The agreement with Australia met the requirements and entered into force in 2010 without further action after the review period. Members of Congress expressed approval for the agreement, with a resolution introduced for its approval. The renewal agreement with Australia faced potential delays in congressional review in fall 2010. Senator Richard Lugar introduced a bill for approval of the agreement, outlining possible scenarios for approval or disapproval by Congress. The bill, S. 3844, and its companion bill, H.R. 6411, aimed to approve the Agreement Between the US and Australia on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, bypassing congressional review requirements. The House passed H.R. 6411 on November 30, 2010, with the agreement set to come into force on or after October 8, 2010. The Agreement Between the US and Australia on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, signed on May 4, 2010, may become effective on or after October 8, 2010, subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and other US laws. This agreement is part of the strong alliance relationship between the two nations based on shared values, ties, and strategic interests. The relationship between the United States and Australia is based on shared democratic values, cultural ties, and strategic outlook. The ANZUS treaty was signed in 1951, solidifying their alliance. The annual AUSMIN meetings have been held since 1985, strengthening their partnership in defense and security. The United States and Australia have a strong alliance based on shared values and strategic cooperation. They conduct joint military exercises, exchange officers, and have a close intelligence relationship. Australia has supported the US in various conflicts and played a key role in promoting regional stability. They also have a Free Trade Agreement in place. The United States and Australia share a special relationship with a high degree of trust. Australia is a strong partner in nonproliferation policy, supporting the Non-Proliferation Treaty and promoting IAEA safeguards. Australia is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Australia has developed strict standards for nuclear trade, requiring an Additional Protocol and bilateral safeguards agreements for uranium exports. The international community is discussing ways to promote nuclear energy growth while minimizing proliferation risks. Australia supports multilateral fuel assurance mechanisms and believes a well-functioning market is key for supply assurance. Australia's stance on nuclear proliferation and fuel cycle technologies aligns with current U.S. policy. The Nuclear Suppliers Group is discussing criteria for future transfers of enrichment or reprocessing technologies. Past political divisions on nuclear power and sensitive fuel cycle technologies in Australia included a plan by former Prime Minister John Gorton to develop a uranium enrichment facility and a nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay. Australia's nuclear policy evolved over time, influenced by political changes and international events. The Labor Party's election of Gough Whitlam in 1972 reversed plans for a nuclear reactor at Jervis Bay, leading to Australia ratifying the NPT in 1973. Support for nuclear disarmament was furthered by endorsing the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty in 1985. Anti-nuclear sentiment was also shaped by events in New Zealand and French nuclear testing in the 1990s. Today, Australia advocates for nuclear disarmament on the global stage. Australia's nuclear policy evolved over time, influenced by political changes and international events. During the post-World War II period through the 1950s, Australia shifted from being a \"possible nuclear proliferator\" to a supporter of extended nuclear deterrence under the ANZUS alliance. Australia worked closely with the United Kingdom, allowing nuclear tests and cooperating in atomic bomb research. Former Prime Minister Menzies saw this cooperation as an opportunity to gain knowledge of nuclear weapons development. Australia worked closely with the United Kingdom in the post-World War II period, allowing nuclear tests and cooperating in atomic bomb research. This collaboration was seen as an opportunity for Australia to gain knowledge of nuclear weapons development. Australia's security environment became more precarious in the 1960s due to events such as China's first nuclear test in 1964 and the British announcement of its strategic departure from East of Suez in 1967. Australia's involvement in joint intelligence, communications, and early warning facilities with the United States also made it a potential nuclear player. The Defense Support Program (DSP) facility at Nurrungar, South Australia, was part of a constellation of geosynchronous satellites and ground tracking stations designed to detect ballistic missile launches, strengthening America's nuclear deterrence. DSP also detected Iraqi Scud missile launches during Operation Desert Storm. Australia's Very Low Frequency (VLF) station at Northwest Cape and signals intelligence facility at Pine Gap played key roles in maintaining the bi-polar strategic balance of the cold war. Australia, a major uranium exporter, lacks uranium enrichment plants and nuclear power plants. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) operates a research reactor at Lucas Heights for medical isotope production. ANSTO, established in 1987, cannot conduct research on nuclear weapons. The Lucas Heights Research Establishment, opened in 1958, was the site of Australia's first nuclear reactor. Research on uranium enrichment technology was also conducted at Lucas Heights. The nuclear fuel cycle starts with mining uranium ore and upgrading it to yellowcake. Australia exports yellowcake for uranium enrichment to make fuel for reactors. Commercial enrichment and fuel fabrication services are available globally. Australia requires safeguards agreements for peaceful use. The country operates the OPAL research reactor fueled by low-enriched uranium. The curr_chunk discusses the commissioning of a low-enriched uranium research reactor in 2007, which produces radioisotopes for medical purposes. The AAEC conducted research on enrichment technologies in the 1960s, including centrifuge and laser isotope separation enrichment. Plans for building an enrichment plant in Australia for exporting enriched uranium hexafluoride were controversial and never completed. The Hawke government terminated uranium enrichment R&D by the AAEC in 1986. Australia terminated uranium enrichment R&D by the AAEC in 1986 and dismantled the laboratory-scale centrifuge enrichment plant. Silex Systems began R&D on laser enrichment technology in 1990, with the technology proven on a laboratory scale in 1994 (SILEX). In 1996, USEC signed an agreement for the development and licensing of SILEX technology for uranium enrichment, leading to a transfer agreement between the United States and Australia in 1999. The U.S.-Australian agreement allows for the transfer of SILEX technology to the United States but limits cooperation in Australia to research and development. Silex Systems stopped lab work on uranium enrichment in Australia but continues to support technology development in the United States. GE/Hitachi Nuclear Energy signed an agreement to license and commercialize laser separation technology for LEU production in the United States. Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) subsidiary received a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2008 to build a test facility called the \"Test Loop\" at GE's fuel fabrication facility in Wilmington, NC. GLE has applied for a commercial license from the NRC. Debate over Australia having its own commercial uranium enrichment facility was sparked by Prime Minister Howard's support in 2006, citing economic benefits due to Australia's large uranium reserves. John Carlson of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office highlighted uncertainties such as lack of established enrichment technology and high license costs for imported technology. The Australian government, under the Labor Party, opposes building a uranium enrichment facility in Australia despite having the world's largest reserves of uranium. The mining sector is crucial to Australia's economy, accounting for 7% of GDP and 43% of exports. There is debate over whether investors would be willing to invest in the substantial capital costs involved in building an enrichment facility, and whether a State government would host it. Australia provides 13% of U.S. uranium imports and exploring opportunities to expand mining exports, including exporting uranium to India, may be favorable to the electorate. Australia exports uranium to various countries, including the United States, the European Union, Japan, China, and potentially Russia. The Labor government, led by Kevin Rudd, initially opposed exporting uranium to India due to its non-signatory status to the NPT. However, the John Howard government supported such exports. The Nuclear Suppliers Group allowed civilian nuclear exports to India in 2008 under certain conditions. The current Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, has not clarified her stance on this issue yet. The Rudd government announced in September 2008 that Australia would not export uranium to India despite the NSG rule change. Australian Liberal Party opposition leader Tony Abbott plans to reverse this policy and start uranium exports to India to strengthen ties with the region. Opinion polls in May 2010 showed Rudd and Abbott neck and neck for the upcoming federal election. A Joint Feasibility Study recommended a free trade agreement with India in May 2010, as India is Australia's fastest-growing export market. Strengthening trade with India could help Australia diversify its export markets away from heavy reliance on China. In the lead-up to the 2007 parliamentary elections in Australia, differences between the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Coalition on nuclear energy policy were highlighted. Former Prime Minister John Howard expressed openness to nuclear power, while Labor Party members, including Peter Garrett and Bob Brown, were against it. The future of nuclear power in Australia remains uncertain. The former Howard government in Australia considered nuclear power as a practical option for electricity production due to projected increased demand. However, support for nuclear energy within the Liberal-National Coalition waned after Howard's defeat in 2007. The unpopularity of Howard's stance on nuclear power before the elections led to a modification of his position. Australia has considered nuclear power due to concerns about carbon emissions. The low cost of coal compared to nuclear energy has hindered its pursuit. Dr. Switkowski believes a carbon cost of $15 to $40 per ton would make nuclear power viable. The country has shelved plans for a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but continues efforts to reduce carbon emissions."
