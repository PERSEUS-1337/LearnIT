    "content": "On March 17, 2011, Congress passed P.L. 112-6 to fund the federal government through April 8, cutting $6 billion in discretionary funding. This included $50 million from DOT and $18 million from HUD. The Senate rejected H.R. 1 on March 9, along with a substitute amendment that would have provided $51 billion more in total federal discretionary funding. Congress also passed P.L. 112-4 on March 2, cutting $4 billion in discretionary funding, with $1.2 billion coming from THUD. On February 19, 2011, the House passed H.R. 1, a continuing resolution to fund the federal government for the remainder of FY2011, providing less funding than requested by the President. The bill included cuts for THUD programs compared to FY2010 levels. Additionally, on December 21, 2010, P.L. 111-322 was passed to fund the government through March 4, 2011, maintaining funding at FY2010 levels. The House passed the FY2011 Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, providing $126.4 billion in funding, $4.3 billion more than FY2010. The Senate's version provided $122.8 billion, $675 million more than FY2010. The Senate's FY2011 Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provided $122.8 billion, $675 million more than FY2010, rejecting a proposed $4 billion infrastructure fund to stay below the total amount requested. The President's FY2011 request for these programs was $123.7 billion, $1.5 billion more than FY2010, with a net total budgetary resources request for DOT of $78.4 billion, $2.0 billion more than FY2010. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $76.5 billion for the FY2011 Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, rejecting the new infrastructure fund proposal. The HUD funding request was $45.6 billion, with the largest new item being $350 million for a \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative. In the 111th Congress, the House-passed bill would have provided $46.5 billion, while the Senate Committee recommended $46.6 billion, both rejecting the \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" request. The President requested $386 million for other related agencies in the THUD bill, with the bulk of funding for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation ($250 million) and the National Transportation Safety Board ($100 million). In the 111th Congress, the House-passed bill would provide $447 million, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $459 million. The President also requested termination of three programs totaling $345 million and reductions totaling $947 million in four programs. In the FY2011 budget, there were reductions and savings totaling over $23 billion from outdated, ineffective, or duplicative programs. The President requested termination of five programs under THUD in the FY2010 budget, with Congress not funding two of them. The remaining three programs received increased funding of $346 million. The status of the FY2011 THUD appropriations bill and funding for each title in the bill for FY2010 and FY2011 is detailed in tables. The numbers cited in discussions of the THUD appropriations act can be confusing due to discrepancies in reported totals. The Senate Committee on Appropriations' draft bill reports total resources of $122.5 billion, while the House bill contains $126.4 billion. The difference lies in the inclusion of contract authority in the Senate's total resources figure. Contract authority is based on federal trust fund resources, unlike regular budget authority. The FY2011 Budget request for THUD sought $68.7 billion from the General Fund of the Treasury. The FY2011 Budget request for THUD included $68.7 billion from the General Fund of the Treasury and $54.5 billion from trust funds. The House THUD Subcommittee's FY2011 302(b) allocation was $67.4 billion, which also includes contract authority funds. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have reorganized their subcommittee structure three times between 2003 and 2008. In 2005, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures, reducing the House Committee's subcommittees from 13 to 10. This included combining the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee with the District of Columbia subcommittee, forming the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, District of. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reorganized its subcommittees, reducing them to 12 and adding jurisdiction over appropriations for Housing and Urban Development and the Judiciary to the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies subcommittee. The House and Senate subcommittees had almost identical coverage of appropriations, with the main difference being that the Senate handles appropriations for the District of Columbia separately. In 2007, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures again, dividing the responsibilities of the TTHUD subcommittees between two subcommittees. The reorganization of the Senate Committee on Appropriations led to the splitting of responsibilities between two subcommittees, with the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies subcommittees (THUD) now handling DOT and HUD appropriations. This change complicates year-to-year comparisons of funding due to appropriations appearing in different bills with various agencies. Other factors like supplemental funding for disaster response and changes in the Department of Transportation further complicate funding comparisons. Funding trends for DOT and HUD from FY2005-FY2010 are shown in Table 4, excluding emergency and supplemental funding, along with the requested amounts for FY2011. The FY2011 fiscal year began without a THUD appropriations act in place. Congress passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through December at FY2010 levels. The midterm elections resulted in new House leadership for the 112th Congress. Two short-term continuing resolutions were passed, but a long-term agreement was not reached. In the 112th Congress, the House passed a full-year continuing appropriations bill, H.R. 1, cutting the FY2011 federal discretionary budget by $61 billion. The Senate considered H.R. 1 and an amendment, S.Amdt. 149, which would have cut the total FY2011 discretionary budget by $43 billion. In the 112th Congress, the House passed H.R. 1, cutting the FY2011 federal discretionary budget by $61 billion. The Senate did not pass the bill, which would have reduced funding for THUD agencies by $2.2 billion below the FY2010 level. Two short-term continuing resolutions in March also decreased funding for THUD agencies. The debate focused on discretionary funding, representing only half of THUD's total annual appropriation. H.R. 1 proposed cutting DOT funding by $8.5 billion below the FY2010 level. The House passed H.R. 1 in the 112th Congress, cutting the FY2011 federal discretionary budget by $61 billion. The bill proposed reducing DOT funding by $8.5 billion below the FY2010 level, with significant cuts to programs like HSIPR and TIGER II. The Senate alternative, S.Amdt. 149, would cut DOT funding by $3.1 billion below the FY2010 enacted level. The House passed H.R. 1 in the 112th Congress, cutting the FY2011 federal discretionary budget by $61 billion. The bill proposed reducing DOT funding by $8.5 billion below the FY2010 level, with significant cuts to programs like HSIPR and TIGER II. The Senate alternative, S.Amdt. 149, would cut DOT funding by $3.1 billion below the FY2010 enacted level. The HSIPR program at $1.0 billion, the level requested in the FY2011 budget request, rather than the $2.5 billion it received in FY2010. Almost $1 billion would come from not funding the two FHWA earmarked programs for which no FY2011 funding was requested, and another $700 million would come from rescissions of prior year funding. Continuing resolutions passed during March 2011 included reductions in some DOT programs. Table 7 presents funding provided for DOT in the FY2010 THUD appropriations act, and the amounts requested for FY2011 by the Administration, provided by the House, and recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. The President's FY2011 budget requested a total of $77.7 billion in funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT), $2.0 billion above the $75.7 billion provided for FY2010. The House passed H.R. 1 in the 112th Congress, cutting the FY2011 federal discretionary budget by $61 billion. The bill proposed reducing DOT funding by $8.5 billion below the FY2010 level, with significant cuts to programs like HSIPR and TIGER II. The Senate alternative, S.Amdt. 149, would cut DOT funding by $3.1 billion below the FY2010 enacted level. The President's FY2011 budget requested a total of $77.7 billion in funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT), $2.0 billion above the $75.7 billion provided for FY2010. The House-passed bill would provide $79.4 billion; the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $75.8 billion. Neither bill included the requested $4 billion for an infrastructure fund, freeing up $4 billion to be applied to existing programs within the overall requested level. DOT funding is provided in two forms: discretionary funding drawn from the general fund of the Treasury (i.e., general funds), and contract authority. Contract authority is a type of budget authority\u2014in the case of DOT, derived from the existence of the Aviation and Highway Trust Funds\u2014that is available for \"obligation\" (which makes the federal government obligated to pay the money to the recipient) as a result of provisions in authorizing legislation, without requiring further legislative action (i.e., without any appropriation by Congress). The ObLim, set in authorizing legislation, limits government spending. It indicates contract authority available for use. DOT funding priorities include safety, future investment, and livable communities. Key safety initiatives proposed are preventing distracted driving. The Administration requested $50 million for a new Distracted Driving Prevention grant program to address the growing concern of distracted driving, which was a factor in 16% of traffic fatalities in 2008. At least 28 states have passed legislation limiting cell phone use by drivers, and the proposed program would provide grants to states to support efforts in preventing distracted driving. Funding for this program would come from the seat belt incentive grant program. The Administration proposed giving the Department of Transportation (DOT) a greater role in oversight of transit rail safety due to recent incidents raising concerns about state oversight efforts, particularly in the case of the Washington, DC, Metro system. The incentive grant program for transit rail safety has been in existence since FY1999, and it is unlikely that any new states would qualify for funding under that program in FY2011. The House-passed bill and the Senate Committee on Appropriations both supported this request. The Administration requested $30 million for transit rail safety legislation, with the House bill providing $24 million and the Senate Committee recommending $5 million, contingent on legislation passage. A major initiative was a $4 billion request for a National Infrastructure Innovation and Finance Fund, aiming for a total of $25 billion for the program to support transportation projects. The Administration requested funding for transportation projects through grants and loans, but Congress did not support the request for a national infrastructure bank. Instead, Congress created a separate grant program for infrastructure projects of regional and national significance, providing $1.5 billion in the economic stimulus act of 2009 and an additional $600 million in the FY2010 THUD appropriations act. Despite the Administration's FY2011 request being turned down, both the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations provided additional funding for the program. The House provided $400 million, while the Senate committee recommended $800 million. The House provided $400 million, the Senate committee recommended $800 million for the program. The Administration proposed directing $527 million towards encouraging communities to include housing and land use considerations in transportation planning. This effort aims to promote \"livable communities\" with transportation choices, affordable connections, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and economic opportunities. Coordination with HUD is also part of the initiative. The Administration requested funding in FY2010 and FY2011 for transportation programs, including a new competitive grant program to integrate transportation, land use, and natural resource conservation planning. They also proposed creating an Office of Livable Communities with $20 million in new funding for grants and technical assistance to study the impact of transportation investments on livability. Both the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations generally supported this initiative. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations generally supported the Administration's initiative for transportation programs, including a new competitive grant program and the creation of an Office of Livable Communities. The House passed bill supported the livability initiative funding request but did not restructure the FTA grant programs. The Senate Committee recommended funding for FHWA grants and allocated $3 million to the existing Office of Transportation Policy for developing performance measures. They also requested a list of federal laws and regulations that hinder livability initiatives. The federal government should focus on addressing existing barriers to support livability. Congress faced issues with funding DOT for FY2011, including the solvency of the highway trust fund and pending expiration of authorizations for federal aviation, highway, and transit programs. The highway trust fund, funded by federal excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuel, has not been increased since 1993. The federal highway trust fund, funded by federal excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuel, has not been increased since 1993. Congress authorized highway and transit funding to be drawn from the Fund through FY2009, with funding levels lower than initially sought. Inflation has reduced the value of the tax, impacting construction costs. The highway trust fund has faced financial challenges due to higher outlays and lower revenue, leading to Congress transferring billions in general revenues to maintain solvency. Funding for aviation programs expired in FY2007, with Congress extending authorization multiple times. Further action is needed to address the imbalance between the fund's revenues and expenditures. The SAFETEA highway and transit program authorizations were set to expire in September 2009. Congress has repeatedly extended the authorization, with the current expiration date set for December 2010. Congressional reaction to extending the authorization has been mixed. The last reauthorization of highway and transit programs was extended multiple times, causing delays in passing new legislation due to disagreements over funding. State departments of transportation face challenges in planning transportation projects without certainty in funding. The President's budget requested $132 million for the EAS program, a decrease from the $150 million provided in FY2010. Congress proposed $196 million for FY2011, including $146 million recommended by the House and Senate Appropriations Committee, in addition to the $50 million reserved annually for the program. The EAS program funding proposed by Congress for FY2011 is $196 million, compared to $200 million in FY2010. The Administration suggested limiting future funding to communities that received subsidies in FY2010. The program aims to preserve air service to small communities by subsidizing costs. Critics mention the high subsidy cost per passenger and the limited service at many airports in the program. The EAS program aims to preserve air service to small communities by subsidizing costs. Critics highlight the high subsidy cost per passenger, limited service at many airports, and proximity of some airports to major ones. In FY2010, public attention was drawn to allegations of unintended acceleration in certain Toyota vehicles, leading to congressional hearings and examination of NHTSA's response. Witnesses testified about complaints across car makes, possible causes in some Toyota models, and complexities in software and electronic systems in vehicles. In FY2010, Congress questioned NHTSA's expertise in investigating defects in complex vehicle systems. $15 million was allocated for investigations of unintended acceleration, with additional funding recommended for further research in FY2011. The President requested $1 billion for FRA's HSIPR program, with the House-passed bill proposing $1.4 billion. The HSIPR program, created in the 2009 economic stimulus legislation, has received varying levels of funding over the years. The program provides grants for capital projects to improve intercity passenger rail service, including high-speed rail. The President has requested additional funding for the program, with Congress allocating $2.5 billion in FY2010. The program has awarded grants in two rounds, with a focus on developing high-speed rail service. The FTA's Bus and Bus Facilities Program, which funds bus-related capital projects, announced a new round of grants in October 2010. The program typically designates funds for specific projects, with only 20% earmarked in FY2010 due to limited designations in authorizing legislation. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $984 million for the bus program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $984 million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) programs, which focus on providing safe, affordable housing for low-income households, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. HUD's main funding sources are discretionary appropriations from Congress, with rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance receiving the majority of the funding. HUD's main funding sources are discretionary appropriations from Congress, with rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance receiving the majority of the funding. Two flexible block grant programs\u2014HOME and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG)\u2014help communities finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. Other grant programs assist homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. FHA insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings, using fees from insured borrowers to sustain the insurance fund and offset administrative costs. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset HUD budget costs. In FY2011, HUD's budget would decrease by about 16% under H.R. 1 compared to FY2010. This reduction includes rescinding funding from FY2010 for various accounts and programs, such as HOPE VI, Energy Innovation Fund, Brownfields Redevelopment, and Sustainable Communities Initiative. The decrease in net budget authority is also due to an increase in offsetting receipts from the FHA. In FY2011, HUD's budget would decrease by about 16% under H.R. 1 compared to FY2010, with reductions in various accounts and programs. The largest reduction would be to the Community Development Fund, including cuts to the Community Development Block Grant program. Additionally, no new funding would be provided for certain programs like Housing Counseling Assistance and the Native Hawaiian Block Grant program. Funding for various HUD programs would be significantly reduced under H.R. 1 in FY2011. The Community Development Block Grant program would see a 63% cut, while housing programs for the elderly and disabled would face reductions of about 70%. Public Housing funding would also be slashed, with cuts to capital repairs, modernization, and maintenance. Additionally, competitive grants for public housing revitalization would be eliminated. Funding for public housing, including Section 8 rental assistance, would be reduced under H.R. 1 in FY2011. While Section 8 vouchers for low-income families may be adequately funded, concerns have been raised about funding for rental vouchers for low-income persons with disabilities. The transfer of renewal costs from the Section 811 program to the Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance account is unclear. The Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities account may not transfer funds to the Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance account under H.R. 1. Funding increases are proposed for the Section 8 project-based rental assistance account and HUD's initiative to address mortgage fraud in FY2011. The President's budget requested about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD under H.R. 1 for FY2011, with a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The increase in appropriations would be offset by higher offsetting collections and receipts from proposed changes to FHA mortgage insurance programs. Section 8 rental assistance programs would see the largest increases, while funding for programs for the elderly, disabled, and public housing repairs would decrease. The brownfields redevelopment program would no longer be funded in FY2011. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House and Senate would provide about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. It includes a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The bills reject proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly, disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. They also reject funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, like the House bill, provides a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejects proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. Unlike the House bill, it funds the President's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. In response to concerns over the financial stability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, FHA has proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs. The Administration estimates that the MMI Fund will generate about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2011, while the Congressional Budget Office projects a smaller subsidy of around $1.9 billion. In FY2011, FHA is proposing changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs to address concerns over the financial stability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program is estimated to require a $250 million appropriation, with proposed changes expected to generate additional revenue. HUD plans to increase HECM borrowers' annual insurance premiums and decrease the initial funds available from the loans. Overall, FHA is projected to have excess receipts in FY2011 to offset HUD expenses. In FY2011, FHA is proposing changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs to address concerns over the financial stability of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund. The program is expected to generate excess receipts to offset HUD expenses, but the amount available may differ between HUD's and CBO's estimates. The President's proposal for FY2011 includes reduced funding for Section 202 and Section 811 housing programs, with Section 202 and related programs funded at $274 million and Section 811 program funded at $90 million. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 reject the proposed reductions and would fund the programs at higher levels. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 reject the President's proposed reductions and would fund the Section 202 program at the same level as in FY2010 ($825 million). The House bill would fund the Section 811 program at the FY2010 level ($300 million), while the Senate Appropriations Committee bill would fund the program at $100 million less than the FY2010 level ($200 million). The Senate Appropriations Committee report indicates that the committee believes less funding is needed for the account because the committee provided funding to meet the renewal needs of existing Section 811 vouchers through another account. The Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new proposal in the FY2010 budget, aims to revitalize distressed neighborhoods by offering competitive grants to various entities. In FY2010, $200 million was allocated to the HOPE VI program, with $65 million set aside for the Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. In FY2011, H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while the Senate had a different stance on funding for both programs. President Obama's FY2011 budget requests $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. The initiative aims to transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance, expected to be more expensive. The President's budget requests $350 million for a new project-based rental assistance initiative with tenant mobility options. Draft legislation titled the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act has been circulated, but formal legislation has not been introduced yet. Funding for the President's Transformation Initiative was not included in H.R. 5850 or S. 3644. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative called Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs) to support economic development projects in distressed areas. The funds would be awarded competitively to various entities, unlike CDBG funds allocated by formula. Additionally, $148.5 million was requested for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI), but neither H.R. 5850 nor S. 3644 included funding for these programs. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) requested $148.5 million for its multipronged program, which includes Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, Housing-Transportation Integration Research, and Capacity Building Program. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 would fund this program at the President's requested level."
