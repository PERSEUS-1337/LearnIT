Congress finds that the main teacher quality problem in 1998 was the lack of subject matter knowledge, and states should have flexibility to create alternative teacher certification programs to recruit well-educated individuals into classrooms. The purpose of this Act is to improve the supply of well-qualified teachers by encouraging states to develop alternative routes to teacher certification requirements. SEC. 3. ALLOTMENTS. From the amount appropriated for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State the lesser of the amount applied for or a proportion based on the total population of children ages 5 through 17. Excess funds from States not utilizing their allotment may be reallocated to other States. The Secretary may allocate funds to States with a current need, and funds awarded must be used within 2 years. SEC. 4. STATE APPLICATIONS. State applications for receiving an allotment under this Act must be submitted through the State educational agency, containing program descriptions and assurances to supplement, not supplant, funds for teacher certification programs.
