    "content": "On November 3, 2004, President Fox congratulated President Bush on his re-election and emphasized major bilateral issues. Cabinet-level Binational Commission meetings were held in Mexico City on November 9, 2004, where Secretary of State Powell highlighted cooperation on counter-narcotics, border security, and immigration. During the APEC meeting in Santiago, Chile on November 17, 2004, President Bush and President Fox discussed collaboration on immigration and border security. On December 6, 2004, the body of Enrique Salinas, brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was found murdered, with a letter expressing concerns about his safety and financial situation. Mexico nominated Foreign Minister Ernesto Derbez as a candidate for Secretary General. Mexico nominated Foreign Minister Ernesto Derbez as a candidate for Secretary General of the Organization of American States. President Fox proposed human rights reforms in response to a U.N. analysis. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case of a Mexican inmate on Texas' death row. President Bush signed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Mexico became the United States' second most important trading partner after Canada. Mexico is the United States' second most important trading partner in Latin America, with significant investment and cooperation on issues like illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The US is Mexico's top customer, receiving 87% of its exports and providing 77% of its imports. The two countries have a history of economic integration and tourism ties, with the US being a major source of foreign investment in Mexico. Mexico underwent significant economic, political, and foreign policy reforms under Presidents Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Ernesto Zedillo. These reforms included opening up the economy to trade and investment, implementing electoral reforms, and increasing cooperation with the United States on various issues. Vicente Fox, who was inaugurated as President in 2000, promised to promote free market policies, strengthen democracy, fight corruption and crime, and resolve conflicts in Chiapas. Fox's presidency marked the end of 71 years of presidential control by the dominant party. Vicente Fox was elected President in 2000, ending 71 years of presidential control by the dominant party. He won with 42.52% of the vote, forming an alliance with the conservative National Action Party and the Green Ecological Party. The legislative elections resulted in a pluralistic legislature with no party having a majority in either chamber. Following the July 2003 Chamber of Deputies elections, the PAN dropped to 153 deputies, weakening its support for Fox's program. The PRI's delegation increased to 224 deputies, while the PRD's delegation increased to 95. Mexico's economy faced challenges due to the slowdown in the United States and a decline in tourism post-September 2001 attacks. President Fox operated under austere budgets from 2001 to 2004, with meager growth results compared to previous years. President Fox has faced challenges operating under austere budgets from 2001 to 2004, leading to reduced funding for health and education programs. Despite lacking majority support in Congress, he has been unable to pass major legislation such as tax and energy reforms. President Fox has focused on ending corruption, promoting transparency, and strengthening human rights commitments, including professionalizing the police force to address security concerns. President Fox proposed judicial and human rights reforms in response to public concerns with security and police corruption. He also took steps to address the situation in Chiapas, including introducing indigenous rights legislation. However, the Zapatistas denounced the legislation as inadequate and withdrew from dialogue with the government. President Fox aims for a more active foreign policy, focusing on U.N. involvement, stronger ties with Latin America and Europe, and promoting cooperative development efforts in Central America. He is reviving the G-3 group and seeking better ties with Mercosur countries. Mexico is expanding trade with the EU and Japan through free trade agreements. Mexico also held a temporary seat on the U.N. Security Council and supports diplomatic efforts under the United Nations. President Fox supports diplomatic efforts under the United Nations for Iraq's disarmament, disappointing the Bush Administration. He advocates for warm relations with the U.S., NAFTA cooperation, and a migration agreement for undocumented Mexicans. Meetings with President Bush in various countries occurred in 2001 and 2002, showing solidarity after the 9/11 attacks. In 2001 and 2002, Presidents Fox and Bush met in various countries to discuss warm relations, NAFTA cooperation, and a migration agreement. In subsequent years, they continued to meet at summits to discuss bilateral immigration issues and trade growth between Mexico and the United States. Bush's new immigration proposal aims to address the growing trade relationship between Mexico and the United States, which has seen significant growth since the implementation of NAFTA. Despite a trade deficit with Mexico, the country has become one of the fastest-growing export markets for the U.S. and is now the second most important trading partner after Canada. The NAFTA agreement was negotiated in 1991 and 1992, with trade and investment restrictions being eliminated over a 15-year period. The agreements went into force on January 1, 1994, leading to increased U.S. exports to Mexico and job creation in both countries. NAFTA institutions have been functioning since 1994, including the Commission on Environmental Cooperation. The NAFTA institutions, including the Commission on Environmental Cooperation, have been operating since 1994. Various commissions and banks were established to promote and finance border environment projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress agreed in 2004 to allow the NADBank to provide grants and loans for environmental infrastructure along the border. The NAFTA institutions aim to encourage cooperation on trade, environmental, and labor issues. Cooperation on trade, environmental, and labor issues is promoted through NAFTA institutions. 28 petitions have been submitted under the labor side agreement, with 15 against Mexico. Some cases involve working conditions and compensation for migrant workers. Seven submissions against Mexico advanced to ministerial consultations, while others were dropped or withdrawn for various reasons. One submission is pending. In a case involving the dismissal of workers for union activities at a SONY plant in Mexico, labor ministers agreed on a plan of action. Ministerial consultations also addressed discrimination against pregnant workers in border assembly plants and union association issues in other maquiladora plants. Additionally, consultations were held on occupational safety and health issues at various plants in Mexico. Ministerial consultations in Tamaulipas, Mexico led to the establishment of a bilateral working group on workers' rights violations in garment factories in Puebla. The trilateral CLC focuses on occupational safety, rights of working women and children, and environmental compliance. Mexico has faced allegations of non-compliance with environmental legislation, with a major case involving the construction of a cruise boat port in Cozumel. The Council requested a response from the Mexican government regarding the impact of a cruise boat port construction in Cozumel, Mexico. They are also reviewing responses from Mexico on pollution cases involving the Magdalena River and Lake Chapala. The CEC is involved in various environmental projects, including bird conservation initiatives and the management of chemicals to reduce their use. The CEC is involved in environmental projects such as bird conservation and reducing the use of pollutants. Major trade disputes between countries include access of Mexican trucks to the US, Mexican telecommunications sector competition, and access of sugar, tuna, and beef products. President Bush supported Mexican truck access, but additional safety provisions were required by the US Congress. The U.S. Congress required safety provisions for Mexican truck access to U.S. highways. Environmental and labor groups initially blocked the action, but the Supreme Court later ruled in favor of the Bush Administration. The House approved an amendment to prohibit Mexican and Canadian truck operators from bringing their trucks into compliance with U.S. safety provisions. The U.S. filed a complaint with the WTO over Mexico's telecommunications industry dominance. The U.S. filed a complaint with the WTO over Mexico's telecommunications industry dominance, citing Mexico's failure to open its long-distance market to competition. The WTO dispute panel upheld U.S. claims regarding Telmex's interconnection fees, leading to a settlement between Mexico and the United States. Mexico also disputes sugar trade issues under NAFTA. Mexico's sugar trade issues under NAFTA include complaints about high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) imports from the United States. The Mexican Congress imposed a 20% tax on soft drinks made with corn syrup sweeteners to support the domestic cane sugar industry, despite objections from the U.S. President Fox initially suspended the duties, but they were reinstated in late 2002. Efforts to find a compromise continued in 2003. In 2003, efforts to reach a compromise on Mexican sugar trade issues with the U.S. regarding HFCS failed. Corn Products International filed a $325 million claim under NAFTA against Mexico for losses due to the tax on HFCS drinks. Senate Finance Committee Chairman introduced a bill imposing retaliatory tariffs on Mexican products unless the tax was rescinded. In January 2004, USTR urged WTO dispute settlement against Mexico's HFCS tax. In March 2004, USTR initiated proceedings, and in June 2004, the US requested a dispute settlement panel. In September 2004, panelists were selected, with hopes for a negotiated settlement. The Clinton Administration lifted the embargo on Mexican tuna in April 2000, but a federal judge ruled against the dolphin-safe label standards in July. In December 2003, Mexico banned US beef imports due to mad cow disease. In March 2004, Mexico resumed beef trade with the US with restrictions after new US procedures were announced. Mexico resumed beef trade with the United States in early April 2004, with some restrictions. Both countries have had disputes over alleged dumping of various products, sanitary standards, and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Mexico has also objected to U.S. sanctions against third countries with investments in Cuba under the Helms-Burton legislation. In early October 2002, the U.S.-Mexico working group on agriculture addressed major agricultural issues, including Mexico's anti-dumping decisions on apples, rice, swine, and beef, and safeguard actions on potatoes. In January 2003, both countries agreed to Mexican safeguard measures against U.S. imports of chicken legs and thighs, which were extended until 2008 with declining tariffs each year. Mexico demanded consultations on a U.S. request for a WTO dispute panel regarding anti-dumping duties on U.S. beef and rice imports. Agricultural agreements were announced at the Binational Commission meetings in November 2004 to advance cooperation on rural development programs. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated in early 2003 that there were 4.8 million undocumented Mexican migrants residing in the United States in January 2000, accounting for 68.7% of the total estimated illegal alien population of 7.0 million. Mexico views the migrants as \"undocumented workers\" and expresses concern about abuses suffered by them in the U.S. Mexico benefits from illegal migration as a \"safety valve\" for political discontent and economic reasons. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 in the United States includes penalties for employers hiring undocumented workers, increased border control, and provisions for legalization of certain illegal aliens. Recent administrations have sought to control illegal immigration due to concerns about job competition and strain on resources. The recent administrations in the United States have aimed to control illegal immigration to preserve legal immigration programs. States like California, Florida, Texas, and Arizona have taken legal action against the federal government, with California passing Proposition 187 in 1994 to restrict benefits for illegal aliens. The Clinton Administration implemented strategies like \"prevention through deterrence\" to improve border control, while Mexico and the United States engaged in formal consultations. In 1996, the United States passed two major immigration reform measures to control illegal immigration and limit federal program eligibility for aliens. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act added Border Patrol agents, while the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act focused on welfare reform. The United States passed immigration reform measures in 1996 to control illegal immigration by adding Border Patrol agents and restricting federal program eligibility for aliens. Congress also increased funding for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, tripling its budget from $1.5 billion in FY1993 to $6.2 billion in FY2002. Various groups called for amnesty for illegal immigrants, prompting Congress to consider measures to increase the number of H-2A agricultural workers. In response to calls for amnesty for illegal immigrants, Congress considered increasing H-2A agricultural workers and legalizing undocumented aliens' status through registry and amnesty. President Bush discussed migration issues with President Fox, with a focus on legalizing Mexican workers in the US. In a Joint Communique, Presidents Bush and Fox agreed to address migration and labor issues through cabinet-level negotiations. President Bush expressed condolences for Mexican migrants' deaths and reaffirmed border safety commitment. Proposals to regularize Mexican workers' status were considered, but blanket amnesty was ruled out. President Fox called for migration agreement by year-end during his visit to Washington, D.C. During the Bush-Fox meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, on March 22, 2002, the Presidents noted progress in enhancing migrant safety and agreed to continue talks for safe, legal migration flows. President Bush called for legislation to extend legal status adjustment for undocumented persons. They also announced a U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Action Plan for border cooperation and technological enhancements. During the cabinet-level Binational Commission meetings in Mexico City in November 2002, Secretary of State Powell and Foreign Secretary Castaneda reaffirmed talks towards a migration agreement. Congressional action in 2001 and 2002 focused on strengthening border security through various acts, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 incorporated INS/Border Patrol and Customs into the Department of Homeland Security. In March 2003, the Department of Homeland Security began operations. In May 2003, 19 migrants died near Victoria, Texas, prompting President Fox to appeal for U.S. action on immigration. In June 2003, U.S. and Mexican officials announced a joint effort to save migrants' lives. In October 2003, President Bush and Fox met in Thailand to discuss bilateral immigration issues. In early 2004, President Bush proposed an immigration overhaul. In early 2004, President Bush proposed an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system to match foreign workers with U.S. employers. The proposal included temporary legal status for new foreign workers and undocumented workers already in the U.S. for three years, with incentives for workers to return to their home countries. President Fox welcomed the proposal as a significant step forward during a meeting with President Bush in Monterrey, Mexico. President Bush proposed immigration reform in 2004, including temporary legal status for foreign workers. Congressional initiatives like S. 1387 and S. 1645/H.R. 3142 aimed to establish new worker programs and streamline the H-2A program. More comprehensive proposals like S. 1461/H.R. 2899, S. 2010, and S. 2381/H.R. 4262 sought to grant legal status to foreign and undocumented workers. President Fox visited President Bush in Texas in March 2004. President Fox visited President Bush in Texas, where it was announced that Mexicans with border crossing cards would be exempted from US-VISIT program requirements. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge met with Mexican Government Secretary Santiago Creel in Mexico City to sign the U.S.-Mexico Action Plan for Cooperation and Border Safety for 2004. They also committed to developing new SENTRI lanes for pre-screened individuals and new FAST lanes for pre-cleared cargo. The 9/11 Commission issued its final report in July 2004, recommending increased collaboration with other governments in counter-terrorism efforts and raising border security standards. The House and Senate passed separate versions of S. 2845 in October 2004 to implement these recommendations, with differing measures on immigration law enforcement and border control. After negotiations, a final report and bill were agreed upon in December 2004, approved by the House and Senate. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) was signed into law on December 17, 2004, after being approved by the House and Senate. The legislation includes provisions for increased law enforcement personnel for immigration enforcement, closer monitoring of alien entry and exit, and standards for identification documents and driver's licenses. Certain provisions from the House bill were dropped in the final report but will be addressed in the 109th Congress. Following the 2004 Binational Commission meetings, Secretary of State Powell highlighted growing cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico on counter-narcotics and border security, including a new Working Group on Cyber-Security. Mexico is a major supplier of drugs to the U.S., but relations have improved in recent years. Congress strengthened Border Patrol and international interdiction efforts along the Southwest Border in the late 1990s. President Bush certified Mexico as a fully cooperative country in controlling drug trafficking in March 2001, citing arrests of key traffickers and increased cooperation with the United States under the new Fox Administration. Bills were introduced but not enacted to exempt Mexico from drug certification requirements following Vicente Fox's election as President in July 2000. The new Fox Administration in Mexico sought to enhance cooperation with the United States in law enforcement and counter-narcotics efforts. In 2001, President Fox called for reform of the U.S. drug certification process, leading to temporary modifications in late 2001 through the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2002. The Bush Administration's drug control policy in February 2002 aimed to designate only countries that had demonstrably failed to meet international counter-narcotics obligations. The Bush Administration's drug control policy aims to prevent drug use through education and community action, provide treatment resources for drug users, and disrupt the drug marketplace. Mexico's efforts against major drug cartels have been successful, with arrests and increased drug seizures. The Bush Administration's drug control policy focuses on prevention, treatment, and disrupting the drug marketplace. Mexico has seen success in combating major drug cartels through arrests and increased drug seizures. Key events include the arrest of Jesus Albino Quintero Meraz and six associates in the Juarez drug cartel in Veracruz, as well as the passage of the Foreign Relations Authorization for FY2003, which includes International Drug Control Certification Procedures. The new certification procedures require the President to report annually on major drug transit or producing countries, withholding U.S. assistance from countries failing to adhere to counter-narcotics agreements unless vital to national interest or substantial efforts are made. The President may also choose to apply previous drug certification and sanctions procedures at his discretion. In November 2002, President Fox presented a more comprehensive National Drug Control Plan for Mexico, acknowledging the country's drug problem and the need for increased cooperation among agencies. US officials praised Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts under President Bush's new certification procedures in early 2003. In mid-March 2003, Mexican authorities captured alleged drug kingpin Osiel Cardenas-Guillen. On June 20, 2003, 31 soldiers deserted the army to work for the Gulf Cartel. Manuel Ruelas Martinez, a key money-laundering figure for the Arellano Felix cartel, was arrested on July 19, 2003. The Zambada Garcia drug cartel was dismantled on July 31, 2003, leading to the arrest of 240 individuals and seizure of illicit drugs. Mexican troops killed three suspected drug smugglers in Nuevo Laredo on August 1, 2003. President Bush did not mention Mexico in the worst offending countries in counter-narcotics efforts in September 2003. In late January 2004, Mexican state police officers were held in Chihuahua on suspicion of involvement with drug traffickers. Mexico is a major transit point for cocaine entering the US and a leading source of marijuana and heroin. Despite this, the Fox Administration made efforts to combat drug trafficking and cooperated with the US. In April 2004, marijuana and opium poppy cultivation in Mexico increased significantly. Several drug traffickers were arrested in Mexico in 2004, including Otto Herrera-Garcia, Jaime Ross-Castillo, Efrain Perez, Jorge Arellano Felix, Ramiro Hern\u00e1ndez, and Gilberto Higuera Guerrero. In August 2004, drug cartel leader Jorge Arellano Felix was arrested. In October 2004, a major Mexican money-laundering and drug trafficking organization was dismantled through Operation Money Clip. In November 2004, six leaders of the Arellano Felix Organization were added to the list of persons subject to economic sanctions. Concerns over elections in Mexico have been raised due to the Institutional Revolutionary Party's long-standing control until 2000. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mexico underwent electoral reforms following the controversial 1988 presidential election. President Salinas proposed and Congress approved three electoral reforms. Subsequent elections were considered generally fair, with opposition governors and legislators being elected. In 1994, Ernesto Zedillo of the PRI won the presidency, and in the following years, the opposition PAN won governorships in many states. Major electoral reforms were agreed upon in 1996 for the 1997 elections, including direct election of the mayor of Mexico City and controls on campaign spending. In the 1997 midterm legislative elections in Mexico, the PRI lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, Senate, governorships, and the race for Mayor of Mexico City. This signaled a shift towards a more pluralistic system, requiring negotiation among parties. In the lead-up to the 2000 elections, Francisco Labastida was chosen as the PRI candidate, while the opposition parties failed to agree on a common candidate. In the 2000 Mexican elections, Vicente Fox of the PAN was elected President, marking the first time an opposition party candidate won in 71 years. Additionally, opposition parties won governorships in Chiapas, while the PRI won in Veracruz and Tabasco (later annulled). In November 2000, the PAN won a governorship in Jalisco. The PAN-PRD coalition candidate won the governorship of Yucatan in June 2001. The PRI won the governorship in Tabasco in August 2001. In other elections, the PRI won control of the state legislature and most municipalities in Chihuahua in July 2001. The PAN demonstrated dominance in Baja California in July 2001, winning the governorship and other races. Lazaro Cardenas of the PRD won the gubernatorial election in November 2001. In Michoacan, Lazaro Cardenas of the PRD won the gubernatorial election. The election in Ciudad Juarez was annulled due to illegal campaign ads by the PAN in El Paso, Texas. The PAN won the re-run election, while the PRI recaptured posts in Nayarit and retained pluralities in Coahuila, Guerrero, and Hidalgo in subsequent local elections. In September, October, and November 2002, local elections took place in Mexico. In March 2003, the PRI and PVEM alliance extended its legislative plurality in the state of Mexico. In July 2003, nationwide elections were held, with the PRI securing a dominant position in the Chamber of Deputies and winning four of the six gubernatorial races. The PAN fared poorly, winning only 31% of the seats in the Chamber. In 2003, the IFE fined political parties for campaign finance irregularities, including the PRI for illegal funds from Pemex and the PAN/PVEM for foreign contributions. In 2004, all parties were fined for violations during the Chamber of Deputies election. In 2004, state and municipal elections in various states saw the PAN, PRI, and PRD winning different municipalities and state assembly seats. The PRI retained governorships in Chihuahua and Durango, while the PRD retained control in Zacatecas. The PRI also won the mayoral race in Tijuana and the gubernatorial race in Oaxaca, contested results. The PAN won the gubernatorial election in Aguascalientes. The PRI won the governorship in Veracruz in disputed elections, and generally won in municipal elections in Oaxaca and Chiapas, gaining control of major cities previously held by the PAN. Allegations of human rights abuses in Mexico include torture, harassment, extra-judicial killings, threats against journalists, prison deficiencies, discrimination against women and indigenous peoples, and child labor in the informal sector. President Zedillo took steps to address these issues, including support for the National Human Rights Commission. Antonio Lozano of the opposition PAN was named Attorney General in 1994. President Zedillo appointed Antonio Lozano as Attorney General in 1994 to reform the judicial system and combat corruption and human rights abuses. Judicial reform was approved in December 1994, increasing the independence of the Supreme Court and Attorney General's Office. Zedillo focused on the 1997 Acteal massacre in Chiapas, leading to the conviction of 77 individuals. President Fox appointed human rights activist Mariclaire Acosta as a Special Ambassador for Human Rights, signaling Mexico's commitment to human rights. President Fox signed an agreement with the United Nations for technical assistance on human rights. The killing of human rights lawyer Digna Ochoa raised concerns about the government's policies, prompting calls for action from domestic and foreign organizations. President Fox freed environmentalists Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera, represented by Ochoa. The National Commission on Human Rights documented abuses in the 1970s and early 1980s, leading to criticism of the government. President Fox appointed Ignacio Carrillo as Special Prosecutor to investigate abuses in the 1970s and early 1980s. General Jose Francisco Gallardo was released from prison but not pardoned, facing allegations of a fabricated conviction. In May 2002, 26 indigenous peasants were killed in Oaxaca, leading to arrests in June. President Fox enacted a new Freedom of Information Act and released secret government archives. Army officers General Mario Arturo Acosta and Francisco Quiros were implicated in late September 2002. In 2002, Mexican army officers General Mario Arturo Acosta and Francisco Quiros, along with retired Major Francisco Javier Barquin, were charged with homicide for the killings of 143 anti-government activists in the 1970s. Luis de la Barreda Moreno, former head of the disbanded secret police, was charged with torture and murder of a guerrilla leader. Despite efforts to improve human rights, critics argue that the special prosecutor has not produced significant results and lacks government support. The government has received inadequate support, with critics pointing to the elimination of the Special Ambassador for Human Rights as evidence. President Fox appointed a special prosecutor to address the issue of over 300 women slain in Ciudad Juarez. The State Department's report on human rights in Mexico noted stalled efforts to improve the situation. On July 24, 2004, a Mexican judge refused an arrest warrant against former President Luis Echeverria for a 1971 massacre due to statute of limitations. President Fox proposed human rights reforms in response to a UN analysis. The House passed H.R. 1950 with provisions on Mexico, including a possible migration accord, pollution control, and extradition policy. The Senate considered bill S. 925 in July 2003, which did not include provisions on Mexico's consular identification cards. An amendment for $100 million to support rural development in Mexico was approved but the bill was not completed. A new bill, S. 2144, was reported out by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March 2004 without provisions related to Mexico. The idea of a migration accord between President Fox and President Bush has been discussed since 2001. Representative Menendez offered an amendment on migration matters in H.R. 1950, which passed the House with provisions on Mexico, including a possible migration accord. The House passed an amendment on migration matters in H.R. 1950, calling for a migration accord between the U.S. and Mexico to ensure safe and orderly migration. Representative Ballenger proposed a substitute amendment emphasizing the need for reform and private investment in Mexico's state-run petroleum monopoly (PEMEX) to curb illegal migration. Representative Gallegly proposed an amendment to address extradition and law enforcement cooperation in a migration agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. The amendment was approved by unanimous consent. Mexican officials criticized provisions related to PEMEX and extradition as an intrusion in their domestic affairs. The Office of the Mexican Presidency prioritized negotiating a migration agreement but rejected tying it to opening PEMEX to foreign investment. Changes were made at PEMEX to modernize infrastructure and ensure Mexican ownership of oil. The House approved an amendment removing references to PEMEX, emphasizing the need for U.S.-Mexico cooperation. The House approved an amendment expressing the need for U.S.-Mexico cooperation on a migration accord and pollution control, prioritizing treaty negotiations for a wastewater treatment facility in Mexico. The House approved amendments related to extradition issues and consular ID cards, emphasizing the need for cooperation between the U.S. and Mexican governments. The House approved an amendment by Representative John Hostettler to restrict the issuance of consular identification cards by foreign missions, particularly focusing on Mexican consulates issuing matr\u00edcula consular cards. Critics argue that these cards are primarily used by illegal aliens for benefits not obtained through regular immigration procedures and may facilitate money-laundering and terrorist activity. The amendment would require foreign missions to issue consular identification cards only to verified citizens with proper documentation and notify the mission of any address changes. The amendment by Representative John Hostettler aims to restrict the issuance of consular identification cards by foreign missions, particularly focusing on Mexican consulates issuing matr\u00edcula consular cards. It includes requirements such as notifying the mission of address changes, keeping automated records to prevent fraud, and subjecting records to audit by the United States. Noncompliance could lead to suspension of visa issuance. Supporters argue for control over card issuance, while opponents see it as an attack on Mexican identity cards and Hispanic heritage. The Senate considered providing $100 million in assistance to Mexico for rural development crisis in 2003, but did not complete action on the bill. H.R. 254 was introduced to authorize amendments for the Border Environment Cooperation Commission and the North American Development Bank, allowing grants and loans in the U.S.-Mexico border region. The North American Development Bank (NADBank) expanded its loan portfolio to support water conservation projects in the U.S.-Mexico border region. The bill H.R. 254 was approved by the House and Senate, with funding limitations for projects. Additionally, the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations for FY2005 (H.R. 5025) was approved with amendments, including the Oxley-Frank amendment restoring funding. The Oxley-Frank amendment restored funding for Treasury Department regulations allowing Mexican consular identification cards to be accepted by financial institutions. Representative Culberson's amendment aimed to prohibit the use of funds for implementing these regulations. The Culberson amendment aimed to end the use of unreliable consular cards for identification, opposed by those who believed the cards were safe. The full Appropriations Committee approved the measure after defeating an amendment to strike the Culberson language, citing concerns about terrorist misuse of the cards. Representative Pastor and others argued for the reliability of identity cards for financial transactions, opposing the Culberson amendment. Representatives Oxley and Frank later offered an amendment to restore funding for Treasury Department regulations on identity cards, citing their effectiveness and Administration support. Opponents argued that the regulations were too lenient. The House passed the Transportation-Treasury Appropriations Act for FY2005, restoring previous authorities regarding consular ID cards. The Act was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 and signed into law on December 8, 2004. An amendment was approved to prohibit the implementation of a rule allowing Mexican and Canadian truck owners and operators certain privileges. The Administration rule allowing Mexican and Canadian truck owners extra time to comply with U.S. safety standards was contested. The Transportation-Treasury Appropriations Act for FY2005, which included provisions on immigration and border security, was approved by Congress and the President in late 2004. The House and Senate versions of S. 2845, aimed at intelligence reform and 9/11 Commission recommendations, had conflicting provisions on immigration and border issues. After extended negotiations, an agreed conference report and bill were filed on December 7, 2004, with provisions for more law enforcement personnel for immigration laws, monitoring of aliens' entry and exit, and standards for identification documents and drivers' licenses. The enacted legislation was signed into law on December 17, 2004, with agreements to address dropped provisions in the House bill early in the 109th Congress. Provisions in the early 109th Congress included banning Mexican consular ID cards, prohibiting driver's licenses for undocumented aliens, and requiring a section of the border wall in California. In 2001-2002, various CRS reports were published on topics such as drug control, immigration legislation, NAFTA trade effects, Mexican drug certification issues, Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts under Fox, and Mexico's Congress and elections. In 2001-2002, CRS reports were published on topics including drug control, immigration legislation, NAFTA trade effects, Mexican drug certification issues, Mexico's counter-narcotics efforts under Fox, and Mexico's Congress and elections. The reports covered Mexico's Presidential, Legislative, and Local Elections of July 2, 2000, NAFTA Labor Side Agreement, and NAFTA-related environmental issues and initiatives."
