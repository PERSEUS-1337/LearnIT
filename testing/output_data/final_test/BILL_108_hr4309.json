The Clean Air Act is amended to allow the Administrator to redesignate areas as transitional if they meet specific criteria for the 8-hour ozone standard. The Clean Air Act allows the Administrator to redesignate areas as transitional for the 8-hour ozone standard based on specific criteria, including consultation with the State air pollution control agency and a demonstration of ozone control measures to attain the standard. The Governor of the State in which the county is located must make a binding commitment to the Administrator regarding the lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) for major stationary sources in the nonattainment area. The air pollution control agency must obtain emission offsets for ozone and ozone precursors from new or modified stationary sources in the county if it fails to meet the 8-hour ozone standard by a certain date. The Administrator must redesignate the area within 30 days after receiving notice from the Governor, on or before the deadline for State implementation plan submission. SEC. 2. STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLANS FOR TRANSITIONAL AREAS. Section 110 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include a new subsection regarding Transitional Areas. Counties redesignated as transitional will be treated as attainment or unclassifiable areas for the prevention of significant deterioration provisions. The Administrator will determine if a county has attained the 8-hour national standards for ozone within 3 years of redesignation. If not attained, the county will be redesignated. The county will be redesignated as nonattainment within 1 year if it fails to meet ozone standards. The State must submit a plan within 2 years to address air pollution control and provide offsets for emissions from new sources. Offsets for major stationary sources in the county must be equivalent to the difference between current emissions and maximum emissions allowed under the Clean Air Act if the county had not been redesignated. The offsets can be obtained from nearby sources following EPA guidance. Offsets for major stationary sources in the county must be equivalent to the difference between current emissions and maximum emissions allowed under the Clean Air Act if the county had not been redesignated as a transitional area for ozone standards."
