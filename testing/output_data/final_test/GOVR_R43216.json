    "content": "The security clearance process determines an individual's trustworthiness for access to classified national security information. It has evolved since the 1950s and involves a background investigation by a federal agency to assess character and eligibility for access. A security clearance alone does not grant access to specific classified materials; it signifies eligibility. Access to classified information requires a demonstrated \"need to know\" and signing a nondisclosure agreement. Suitability checks determine suitability for federal positions, unlike security clearances which focus on eligibility for access to classified information. Levels of security clearances correspond to the sensitivity of information accessed: Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Top Secret includes Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAPs). Access to highly sensitive policies, projects, and programs like SCI and SAPs require higher eligibility standards and investigative requirements. Security clearances are necessary for individuals working with classified materials, with only U.S. citizens generally eligible. Order 12968 outlines eligibility criteria for access to classified information, emphasizing the importance of loyalty, trustworthiness, and adherence to regulations. Individuals cannot obtain a security clearance on their own and must undergo a thorough investigation. Security clearances are initiated by sponsoring agencies and are based on investigations requested by Federal agencies for specific positions. They are not required for certain high-ranking government officials as specified in the U.S. Constitution. United States officials holding positions prescribed by the Constitution are considered trustworthy for access to classified information. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, sets the standards for access through executive orders like Executive Order 13467, which determines suitability checks and security clearances for federal employees, applicants, and contractors. 'Covered individuals' are those working for or seeking to work for the executive branch, excluding the President and certain employees. Congressional and judicial staff must hold security clearances to access classified information, as mandated by public laws, congressional rules, and judicial procedures. For example, the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court requires staff to have security clearances commensurate with their responsibilities. Congressional staff must obtain appropriate clearances and sign nondisclosure agreements through the Office of House Security and the Office of Senate Security. Staff must obtain security clearances and sign nondisclosure agreements to access classified national security information. As of October 1, 2015, approximately 4.3 million individuals held security clearances, with 2,885,570 at the Confidential or Secret level and 1,363,483 at the Top Secret level. In FY2015, 638,679 security clearances were approved, including 408,262 at the Confidential or Secret level and 230,417 at the Top Secret level. This includes initial clearances and renewals, not just new clearances issued. The security clearance process involves key steps such as pre-investigation, investigation, adjudication, and reinvestigation. During pre-investigation, the agency determines the need for access to classified information. The investigation phase includes a background check based on the applicant's submitted materials. The background investigation varies in content, cost, and duration depending on the clearance level sought. The National Background Investigations Bureau oversees personnel background investigations for security clearances. Adjudication phase determines clearance grant based on investigation findings. Reinvestigations are periodic based on clearance level. The National Background Investigations Bureau oversees background investigations for security clearances, with reinvestigations required periodically based on clearance level. OPM and ODNI reduced the reinvestigation timeline to five years for all clearance holders. Private contractors follow the same clearance procedures as government employees, with the process initiated by a sponsoring federal agency. The contractor must inform the sponsoring agency that the employee needs access to classified materials. The sponsoring agency decides whether to start the security clearance process. President Obama transferred background investigation responsibilities from OPM-FIS to NBIB in 2016. NBIB conducts some investigations and contracts out the rest. At least 21 federal agencies can conduct their own investigations. The FBI, USMS, ATF, and CIA have authority to conduct security clearance background investigations for certain positions. OPM handles the majority of federal background investigations, charging other agencies for its services. The cost varies based on clearance level and investigation scope. The requesting agency is responsible for costs associated with security clearance adjudication and reinvestigations. The ODNI's 2015 Report on Security Clearance Determinations shows processing times impacted by external events like resource demand and system delays. In FY2015, there were more pending security clearance cases than in FY2014, with longest processing times ranging from 134 to 395 days for Top Secret cases and 153 to 197 days for Secret or Confidential Clearances. Adjudicative decisions are made by federal employees using 13 guidelines. The 13 adjudicative guidelines used for security clearance determinations cover various aspects such as allegiance, foreign influence, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. Adverse information does not automatically result in denial, as adjudicators consider the recentness and patterns of behavior. Mitigating factors are also taken into account. An individual can appeal a denied or revoked security clearance determination, following agency-specific policies and procedures outlined in Executive Order 12968. Some agencies allow applicants to challenge unfavorable polygraph results. Appeals are typically handled internally by the agency's security appeals board or an administrative judge, with limited exceptions for judicial review. Security clearances are generally not subject to judicial review and must be accepted by other agencies, with exceptions for Top Secret, SCI, and SAPs. Agencies can conduct additional investigations and add requirements like polygraph exams. Reports by the GAO and ODNI suggest agencies may be hesitant to accept background investigations or security clearance determinations from other agencies."
