    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"America's Youth Commission Act of 2001\". Congress acknowledges that American youth, up to 18 years of age, are the freest, most educated, and most affluent generation in the nation's history. Despite favorable conditions, destructive behaviors among some youth are harming the nation and hindering their full potential to contribute to freedom's cause. Some American youth are engaging in destructive behaviors such as youth violence, school pranks, alcohol and drug use, and gun violence, hindering their potential to contribute to society. American youth in the United States are exposed to high levels of violence and degrading material in the media, leading to concerns about the erosion of human dignity. This \"culture of death\" is seen as influencing the behavior and consciousness of American youth. The community in the United States has undergone significant changes in the past 30 years due to economic growth and mobility, affecting families' aspirations and livelihoods. Factors such as static purchasing power, mergers, production dislocation, higher family mobility, suburbanization, and rising levels of foster children have contributed to a more fluid social structure. This has led to less continuity for youth in nurturing relationships with family and community, with developmental attachments by adults towards youth becoming more fragile in today's society. The \"National Commission on the Impact of United States Culture on America's Youth\" is established by this Act. The Commission's duty is outlined in Section 4. The Commission will investigate and make recommendations on the condition of contemporary youth in America compared to prior generations, focusing on family, schools, work, and community involvement. It will also analyze the origins and trends of antisocial and violent behavior among American youth, including the influence of organizations and cultural elements. Additionally, the Commission will identify successful initiatives that promote positive development and curb antisocial behavior among youth. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations for averting and reducing violence among American youth, as well as suggestions for building positive developmental experiences for youth by parents, families, and various organizations.
