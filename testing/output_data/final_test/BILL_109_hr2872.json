    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Louis Braille Bicentennial--Braille Literacy Commemorative Coin Act\". Louis Braille, inventor of the Braille method for the blind, was born in Coupvray, France in 1809. He lost his sight at age three but with support from his parents, a priest, and a teacher, he attended school with sighted children. At age 10, he continued his education with their help. At age 10, Louis Braille received a scholarship to attend the Royal Institute for Blind Children in Paris. There, he discovered books for the blind with large embossed letters. Wanting more, he learned about \"night writing\" from a captain in Napoleon's army, which later inspired him to create the Braille method. At age 15, Louis Braille developed modern Braille, using 6 dots in a cell to represent each letter. Braille books can contain up to 1000 characters on a page, making them more compact than embossed letter books. Louis Braille, a talented organist, developed the Braille representation of music and published the first-ever Braille book in 1829. He later published a book on a system of representing mathematics in 1837. Recognized for his talents, he became the first blind apprentice teacher at the school at the age of 17, teaching various subjects. Louis Braille's system of reading and writing for the blind faced skepticism initially but started to spread widely in 1868. It became the official method for blind United States citizens in the 20th Century. Helen Keller praised Braille as a precious aid in her life. Braille has been a valuable aid for Helen Keller, enabling her to go to college, take notes, and write speeches. Despite technological advances benefiting the blind, the teaching of Braille has declined, with only 10 percent of blind students learning it. The National Federation of the Blind emphasizes the importance of Braille literacy for the blind. The National Federation of the Blind promotes Braille literacy and the memory of Louis Braille. Braille literacy is crucial for the employment and independence of the blind, with 85% of employed blind individuals being Braille-literate. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to mint and issue $1 coins with specific designs, weighing 26.73 grams, with a diameter of 1.500 inches, and containing 90% silver and 10% copper. These coins are legal tender and considered numismatic items. The design of coins minted under this Act honoring Louis Braille must reflect his life and legacy, with the obverse featuring his image and the reverse emphasizing Braille literacy. The reverse design must include the word \"Braille\" in Braille code, meeting specific tactile specifications. Each coin must also display its value. The Act requires coins to have a designated value, the year 2009, and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design is chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Federation of the Blind, and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS.\n\nCoins minted under this Act shall be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities. Only 1 facility of the United States Mint may be used to strike any particular quality of the coins minted under this Act. The Secretary may issue coins minted under this Act only during the 1-year period beginning on January 1, 2009. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price including the face value, surcharge, and cost of designing and issuing. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. The sales of coins under this Act require a $10 surcharge per coin, with the surcharges going to the National Federation of the Blind for Braille literacy programs. The Federation is subject to audit requirements for the funds received. No surcharge can be included for a coin issuance if it would exceed the limit for commemorative coins in a calendar year. The issuance of the coin may exceed the annual limit for commemorative coin programs under section 5112(m)(1) of title 31, United States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury can provide guidance for this.
