    "content": "Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization is addressed in Section 1. Taiwan sought to participate in the World Health Organization as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with support from the United States and other Member States, Taiwan was invited to attend the World Health Assembly. Statehood is not a requirement for attendance at the WHA, allowing non-members and non-governmental organizations to participate. Taiwan, known as \"Chinese Taipei,\" attended the World Health Assembly as an observer until 2016. After President Tsai-Ing Wen's election, China's resistance increased, leading to Taiwan not receiving an invitation in 2017. Despite this, Taiwan has been a significant contributor to global health, providing over $6 billion in aid. Taiwan has provided $6 billion in international medical and humanitarian aid since 1996, responding to crises like Ebola by donating $1 million. Despite its contributions, Taiwan faces resistance from the PRC in international engagements, such as not being invited to the 2016 ICAO Assembly. In 2013, Taiwan's request to participate in the 2016 General Assembly of INTERPOL was rejected. PRC delegates disrupted a meeting in Australia in May 2017 until Taiwan delegates were asked to leave. In June 2017, Panama granted diplomatic recognition to the PRC, ending its relationship with Taiwan. Congress has supported Taiwan's participation in international bodies like the WHO. In 2016, Taiwan did not receive invitations to attend events as an observer at the WHA, ICAO Assembly, or INTERPOL Assembly despite efforts by Congress. Congress has supported Taiwan's participation in international bodies like the WHO. The Secretary of State has made changes to the US plan to endorse Taiwan for observer status at the World Health Assembly following annual meetings where Taiwan was not successful. The amendment will take effect with the first report required under subsection. The House of Representatives passed a bill on January 9, 2018, related to Public Law 108-235. Karen L. Haas, the Clerk, attested to the bill."
