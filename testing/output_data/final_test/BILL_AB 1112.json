    "title": "AB 1112",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 41976 of the Education Code is amended to allow school districts and county superintendents to offer adult education programs in parenting, family literacy education, and support for children with limited English proficiency. Adult education programs cater to a diverse range of individuals, including those with limited English proficiency, immigrants, adults with disabilities, and those seeking workforce preparation. These programs offer courses in basic skills, English as a second language, citizenship, and job-specific technical training. Adult education programs for adults with disabilities, short-term career technical education programs with high employment potential, programs for older adults, apprentices, home economics, and health and safety education are eligible for funding. No state apportionment for courses not listed. The curr_chunk discusses various classes and courses offered in adult education programs, including child growth and development, parent-child relationships, family literacy education, elementary and secondary basic skills, English as a second language, courses for immigrants, education programs for persons with disabilities, and short-term vocational programs with high employment potential. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of two-year planning and implementation grants to regional consortia of community college districts and school districts for the purpose of developing regional plans to better serve the educational needs of adults. The eligibility for consortia receiving grants includes at least one community college district and one school district within its boundaries. Consortia can also include other entities providing adult education courses. Grant funds are to be used to create and implement a plan to better serve adults in the region. The adult education programs funded by grants include basic skills classes for high school diploma or equivalency, citizenship and English as a second language courses for immigrants, workforce preparation, programs for adults with disabilities, career technical education with high job potential, apprenticeship programs, and parenting education. The classes and courses in adult education programs funded by grants include instruction on American government and civics, covering topics such as federal, state, and local government, the three branches of government, civic engagement, and registering to vote. It is required that students receive this instruction, and each regional consortium's plan must include these components. Each regional consortium's plan must evaluate current adult education programs, assess needs, integrate existing programs for seamless transitions, and address identified gaps. The regional consortium's plan must address identified gaps, employ proven approaches to accelerate student progress, collaborate for professional development, and leverage existing regional structures. Additional elements may be identified by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the State Department of Education. The Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the State Department of Education must submit a joint report to the Legislature and the Governor by March 1, 2014, detailing the development of regional consortia and grant awards. Another report is due by March 1, 2015, outlining the plans developed by regional consortia. The Legislature intends to develop common policies for adult education, including funding increases for regional consortia in the 2015-16 fiscal year. If costs are mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided. The Legislature aims to ensure that funding for adult education consortia continues to support minors in high school credit recovery and limits the use of funds for pupils in grades 9 to 12 to no more than 10 percent."
