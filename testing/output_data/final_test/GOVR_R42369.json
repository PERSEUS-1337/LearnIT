    "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental disabilities that affect social skills, communication, and behavior. It includes conditions like autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified. The cause of ASD is unknown, but it has been linked to abnormal brain biology and chemistry. The CDC reports that 1 in 110 eight-year-olds have ASD. According to the CDC, 1 in 110 eight-year-olds have autism spectrum disorder, with boys affected more than girls. The increased prevalence has raised questions about the causes of autism and the need for effective treatment. Symptoms typically appear before age three and include difficulty talking, repeated behaviors, and sensitivity to loud noises, impacting communication and social integration. There are no medical treatments for autism itself, but medications and behavioral therapy can help with symptoms. Research is ongoing to determine causes, risk factors, screening methods, and effective therapies. The federal government plays a role in financing and delivering treatment for ASD. Congress is interested in the number of cases, diagnosis, and treatment affecting expenditures. Congress has shown interest in financing research on ASD prevalence, causes, and optimal treatment. This interest is demonstrated through legislation such as the Children's Health Act (CHA) in 2000, the Combating Autism Act in 2006 (CAA), and the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act (CARA). The report provides an overview of these acts, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding and activities, federal activities related to autism, and selected issues for Congress. Title I of the CHA authorized the Secretary of HHS to conduct activities related to autism and developmental disabilities, including funding for autism surveillance at CDC and establishing the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. The NIH was authorized to expand autism research efforts and establish Centers of Excellence for autism research. The CHA also created an Autism Coordinating Committee to coordinate research within NIH and funded an information and education campaign. The CAA, enacted in 2006 and reauthorized in 2011, aims to address concerns about the increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorders and stimulate research into causes and treatments. The CAA, enacted in 2006 and reauthorized in 2011, aims to address concerns about the increasing prevalence of autism spectrum disorders. It authorizes funding for autism research, screening, early intervention, and education, as well as expanding research activities at NIH and creating the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) to coordinate federal autism research efforts. It also authorizes surveillance and awareness programs at CDC and expands federal efforts in autism education, early detection, and intervention at HRSA. The CAA authorizes expanded federal efforts in autism education, early detection, and intervention, including funding for research and surveillance programs at CDC. CDC is also required to coordinate the federal response to potential clusters of ASD or developmental disabilities. The CAA authorizes the establishment of regional centers of excellence in the epidemiology of ASD and other developmental disabilities to collect and analyze data according to CDC guidelines. These centers are required to develop special research expertise and identify cases and controls for research into potential causes or risk factors for ASD. Grants are provided for projects to increase awareness, reduce barriers to screening and diagnosis, promote evidence-based interventions, train healthcare professionals, and provide early intervention. The Secretary must train healthcare professionals to use valid screening tools and provide early intervention for children with ASD. Activities are carried out through HRSA to increase public awareness, promote research, and collaborate with federal programs for low-income individuals. The CAA authorizes federal programs for low-income individuals to provide culturally competent information on ASD and developmental disabilities. Programs include Head Start, Early Start, Medicaid, CHIP, and more. States must designate a lead agency to disseminate this information through various means. The CAA authorizes federal programs to provide information on ASD through various means determined by each state. The Secretary must promote the development and use of screening tools, collect educational materials, fund grants for training programs, and promote best practices in autism screening and diagnosis. Additionally, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to expand ASD research activities at NIH. The CAA authorizes the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) at NIH to coordinate ASD research, screening, intervention, and education efforts within HHS. IACC members include representatives from various federal agencies and non-federal public members, including individuals with autism and parents. The committee must meet at least twice a year in public session and is responsible for formulating and updating ASD-related policies annually. The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) at NIH meets at least twice a year in public session to formulate and update ASD-related policies. Funding for CAA programs was authorized through FY2011, with the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act (CARA) extending funding through FY2014. CARA does not include funding for an expansion of research and services as requested by some autism advocates. Table 1 shows authorizations of appropriations for CAA and CARA provisions from FY2007. The table provides funding details for CAA activities from FY2007 through FY2014. FY2013 funding is estimated at $238 million, a $1 million increase from FY2012. Funding for autism-related activities is not limited to the authorizations shown in the table and may vary each year. Autism-related activities may also receive funding from CDC and NIH. The Moyer Report compiles agency spending information on autism-related activities funded through general authorizations at CDC and NIH. Federally funded autism research not authorized under the CAA is discussed in the section \"Other Federal Activities Related to Autism Research.\" CDC focuses on surveillance and epidemiological research, NIH on basic science and research coordination, and HRSA on autism education, detection, and early intervention. Under the Combating Autism Act, CDC is responsible for ASD surveillance and research, forming the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM), and the Centers for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology (CADDRE). CDC collaborates with HRSA and other agencies on epidemiologic ASD research. The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities established the ADDM network for collecting state-level epidemiological data on ASD. ADDM monitors ASD prevalence among eight-year-olds at selected sites using uniform surveillance methods. Pilot sites were funded by the Children's Health Act, and the program expanded under the CAA. ADDM has published reports on ASD prevalence in 2007 and 2009. CDC established a grant program for ASD surveillance under the CAA. The CDC collaborates with various entities to establish regional centers of excellence in ASD, known as CADDRE, which are part of a multi-site study on risk factors for ASD. The CDC also partners with Autism Speaks for global autism prevalence statistics through the IAEN. Additionally, the CDC runs a health communication campaign called \"Learn the Signs. Act Early\" to promote early detection of ASD. The \"Learn the Signs. Act Early\" health communication campaign aims to improve early identification of children with ASD by educating parents, healthcare professionals, and early educators on developmental milestones. HRSA, under the CAA, is tasked with ensuring children with ASD are screened, diagnosed, and receive appropriate treatment, as well as addressing the shortage of trained professionals in autism treatment. HRSA received funding to increase awareness of ASD, reduce barriers to screening and diagnosis, promote evidence-based interventions, train healthcare professionals in screening tools, and provide early intervention. HRSA established or increased support for four programs: Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities (LEND), Developmental Behavioral Pediatric training programs, state implementation programs, and research programs. These programs focus on screening tools, diagnostic tools, and continuing education for healthcare providers serving women, children, and families to address the shortage of qualified professionals for autistic individuals. State-level grantees implement state autism plans, promote awareness, and develop service models for children. The HRSA has established Autism Intervention Research programs to improve the health and well-being of children with ASD and other developmental disabilities. These programs focus on evidence-based research and the development of best practices in physical and behavioral health. CAA funding at NIH supports research at multiple institutes and centers. NIH's CAA funding supports research on autism risk factors, causes, and treatments through the Autism Centers of Excellence Program. Studies focus on biomarkers, genetic susceptibility, pharmacotherapy, language development, early intervention, and risk factors. The Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation examines environmental and genetic factors in ASD. NIH also sponsors scientific workshops and supports ASD research infrastructure, including biobanking. The Children's Health Act and the CAA support ASD research infrastructure, including biobanking and a common database for data collected in NIH-funded studies. The Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) coordinates autism activities among member agencies and presents a strategic plan for ASD research annually. The 2011 IACC Strategic Plan focuses on interventions for non-verbal individuals with ASD, health promotion, and safety. Federal funding for autism research is supported by various government agencies, not just the Combating Autism Act. HHS agencies have the authority to allocate funds for public health concerns, including autism programs. The HHS agencies, including ACF and CMS, conduct activities related to autism research and funding. ACF funds programs for families and children with ASD under different authorities. CMS administers Medicare. The CMS administers Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance Program, supporting autism education and intervention services. The HHS Office on Disability coordinates resources for individuals with disabilities, including autism. SAMHSA provides mental health and substance abuse programs for children with ASD through the Child Mental Health Initiative. The Department of Defense and Department of Education are involved in addressing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through research programs and data collection. The DOD has a research program for ASD funded since FY2007, receiving $41 million in total funding from FY2007 to FY2012. The Department of Education funds research programs and collects data on individuals served by special education programs. In 2010, the IACC analyzed autism research funding sources, with private entities funding 24% and the federal government funding 76% in 2009. The report also assessed the relevance of funded projects to key topic areas identified in the IACC strategic plan for 2009. Research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) primarily focuses on causes, prevention, and access to services. Concerns during CAA enactment include data sharing, surveillance coordination, and funding allocation for disease-specific legislation. These issues are relevant not only to autism research policy but also to other diseases. The coordination of research and data sharing is crucial for disease-specific legislation like autism. Accurate case estimates are needed for studying common characteristics and risk factors. Enumerating autism cases at different levels of government remains a challenge. Members of Congress have raised concerns about prioritizing disease-specific legislation. The concern over prioritizing disease-specific legislation like autism, with advocates arguing for the continuation of programs under the CAA to prevent interruptions in progress. Autism services research impacts healthcare cost and coverage decisions, including provisions in the ACA affecting individuals with autism. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes provisions that impact coverage for individuals with autism, such as prohibiting coverage cancellation due to preexisting conditions, removing lifetime caps on benefits, and providing tax subsidies for low- and middle-income individuals. Medicaid eligibility will also be expanded to include single adults. The long-term effects of health reform on individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remain uncertain."
