    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 480 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires a change in ownership statement to be filed when there is a change in ownership of real property, manufactured home, or floating home subject to local property taxation. The statement must be filed with the county assessor in the county where the property is located. Additionally, the personal representative must file a change in ownership statement with the county recorder or assessor for any real property owned by the decedent at the time of death that is subject to probate proceedings. The change in ownership statement must be filed within specific timeframes: at the time of filing the inventory and appraisal with the court clerk, within four months of issuing letters testamentary or letters of administration, or within 150 days of the decedent's death for real property transfers. The change in ownership statement required by law must be declared as true under penalty of perjury and include specific information about the property transaction. It should not contain irrelevant questions and must inform the new owner about property tax relief options. The change in ownership statement must be printed with the title in at least 12-point boldface type and the body in at least 8-point boldface type. \"Important Notice\" The law requires any transferee acquiring an interest in real property to file a change in ownership statement with the county recorder or assessor within a specified timeframe. This statement must be filed at the time of recording or within 90 days of the change in ownership, with exceptions for transfers due to death. Failure to file a change in ownership statement within 90 days results in a penalty of $100 or 10% of taxes, whichever is greater, not to exceed $5,000 or $20,000. Penalty will be added to the assessment roll and collected like delinquent property taxes. The change in ownership statement can be attached to the deed for recording, allowing omission of certain information required by law. When a change in ownership is recorded, the statement must be filed with the county recorder or assessor within a specified timeframe, even if not filed concurrently with the document. If the change is due to death, the statement must be filed within 150 days or at the time of estate probate. The change in ownership statement must be filed within four months of receiving letters testamentary or letters of administration. The statement can be filed with the assessor by mail, and the date of filing is determined by the postmark or courier certification. In the case of a corporation, the change in ownership statement must be signed by an officer or designated employee. For partnerships, LLCs, or other entities, the statement must be signed by an officer, partner, manager, or designated employee. No liability is incurred for assisting the transferee with the statement preparation. Section 480 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require the transferee to file a signed change in ownership statement when there is a change in ownership of real property or a manufactured home subject to local property taxation. If the transferee is not locally assessed, no statement is needed. The personal representative or trustee must file a change in ownership statement with the county recorder or assessor for any real property owned by the decedent at the time of death within 150 days. This also applies to transfers through a trust. The change in ownership statement required by law must be declared as true under penalty of perjury and include specific information about the property transaction. It should not contain irrelevant questions and must inform the new owner about property tax relief options. The notice must be printed with the title in 12-point boldface type and the body in 8-point boldface type. \"Important Notice\" \"The law mandates filing a change in ownership statement for real property or manufactured homes subject to local property taxation assessed by the county assessor. Failure to file within 90 days incurs a penalty of $100 or 10% of applicable taxes, not exceeding $5,000.\" The penalty for failure to file a change in ownership statement is $5,000 if eligible for homeowners' exemption or $20,000 if not, added to property taxes and collected like any other delinquent taxes. The change in ownership statement can be attached to the deed for recording, allowing omission of certain information required by law. When a change in ownership is recorded, the statement must be filed with the county recorder. If not recorded, the statement must be filed with the assessor within 90 days, or 150 days in case of death. Whenever a change in ownership statement is filed with the county recorder\u2019s office, the recorder shall transmit the original statement or a true copy to the assessor along with required recorded documents. The statement may also be filed with the assessor through the United States mail, with the postmark date or certified date by a courier service considered as the filing date. When a change in ownership statement is filed for real property, it must be signed by an authorized individual from the corporation, partnership, or legal entity involved. No liability is incurred for assisting the transferee with preparing the statement. The section does not create a duty for anyone to assist in real property transfers on behalf of the parties involved."
