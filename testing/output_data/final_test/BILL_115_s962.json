The Secretary will distribute funds for landscape-scale restoration projects through a competitive process to address national priorities identified in State-wide assessments and forest resource strategies. Multiyear projects may also receive funding under this section. To be eligible for funding, a State Forester or approved entity must submit landscape-scale restoration proposals to the Secretary. These proposals should include priorities from State-wide assessments and forest resource strategies, measurable results, and activities on all necessary land. The Secretary prioritizes projects that are developed collaboratively with other organizations and communities, with at least 50% of funding coming from non-Federal sources, unless justified otherwise. The Secretary gives priority to projects that align with State-wide assessments and long-term forest strategies, emphasizing public-private partnerships and cross-boundary activities on Federal, State, and private forest lands. The Natural Resources Conservation Service or relevant Federal agency prioritizes projects that focus on water quality, wildfire risk reduction, wildlife habitat protection, forest health improvement, and wood product market enhancement to strengthen local economies.

Projects may give priority to landscape-scale areas for ecological restoration treatments and insect and disease treatment. The curr_chunk focuses on various authorized restoration services, including insect and disease treatment, watershed restoration, stewardship end result contracting projects, and protection services under different Acts. The Secretary will establish a proposal review process ranking each based on achieving requirements and priorities. Regional review may be conducted, and a report is due within 3 years of enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 3 years detailing the progress, expenditures, and accomplishments of landscape-scale projects under the program. $30,000,000 is authorized for the restoration program annually.

PROMOTING CROSS-BOUNDARY WILDFIRE MITIGATION. Section 103 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended to encourage the use of excess funds for hazardous fuels reduction projects with cross-boundary considerations. Grants may be provided to State Foresters for projects on non-Federal land, with a minimum allocation of 20 percent or $20,000,000 for such projects. The Secretary is directed to use funds for hazardous fuel reduction projects that span across different types of land ownership, including Federal, State, county, tribal, and private land. These projects should focus on priority areas identified in State-wide forest assessments and require mutual agreement between the State Forester and Regional Forester. The Secretary is authorized to conduct and fund treatments for projects involving both Federal and non-Federal land. The Secretary can use their authorities for cooperation and assistance, including the good neighbor authority, and allocate wildfire mitigation funds for cross-boundary projects. State Forester, in consultation with the Secretary, will carry out this subsection. State Forester, in consultation with the Secretary, must consult owners of non-Federal land for hazardous fuels reduction projects and obtain consent before implementing any project on non-Federal land. Only laws and regulations applicable to non-Federal land will apply to projects under this subsection."
