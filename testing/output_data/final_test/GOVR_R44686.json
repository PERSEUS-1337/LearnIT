    "content": "The ATF is the primary federal agency for enforcing laws on firearms, explosives, arson, and alcohol/tobacco diversion. It is funded through the DOJ and works with the FBI's NICS for background checks on firearm purchases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects data on firearms-related deaths and injuries, but CDC grants for gun violence research have been controversial. This report covers congressional action on President Obama's FY2017 budget request for gun safety. It includes analysis of ATF's budget for FY2017, focusing on trends like the number of licensed gun dealers and growth in firearms in civilian stock. The report discusses trends in firearms-related violent crime and annual appropriations limitations on CDC for gun control. Congress appropriated $1.24 billion for ATF in FY2016 and the Obama Administration requested $1.306 billion for FY2017. The Senate and House Committees on Appropriations reported bills providing ATF with $1.259 billion and $1.258 billion for FY2017, respectively. Both bills included increases for FBI to address firearms-related background checks and information sharing on prohibited persons. Obama Administration requested $50 million for these purposes. President Obama signed into law two appropriations acts in 2016 and 2017, funding the federal government at nearly the same levels as previous years with slight across-the-board decreases. The bills did not provide the requested $10 million for gun violence research. President Trump signed a continuing appropriations act extending the previous resolution until Congress passed full-year appropriations. Congress allocated $1.259 billion for ATF in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, $47 million less than the Obama Administration's request. Obama's budget proposal for ATF was $1.306 billion, $66.1 million higher than the allocated amount. President Obama's budget proposal for ATF included $11.8 million for technical and base adjustments, $54.3 million for budget enhancements, and $35.6 million to hire additional special agents and industry operations investigators. Additionally, $4.0 million was allocated to upgrade the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) and ballistic imaging hardware and software, $5.7 million to process federal firearms and explosives licenses, and $9.0 million for other initiatives. The FY2017 budget request included funding for ATF to integrate case management systems and repeal appropriations limitations. President Obama's gun safety initiative allocated funds for FBI background checks, criminal history improvement programs, and gun violence research. NICS was established in 1998 for firearms background checks. The DOJ Office of Justice Programs provides grants to improve NICS accessibility for firearms background checks. ATF allocated $1.033 billion for law enforcement operations in FY2016. ATF allocated $1.240 billion for its \"law enforcement operations\" budget decision unit in FY2017, with 83.7% allocated for this unit and 16.7% for \"investigative support services.\" The agency requested an increase of 188 FTEs for FY2017, with 115 FTE associated with additional permanent positions. The ATF requested $54.3 million for FY2017, including 73 FTE and $11.8 million for \"technical and base adjustments\" without adding permanent positions. Special Agents accounted for nearly half of the permanent positions under the FY2017 request. The ATF requested $54.3 million for FY2017, including 73 FTE and $11.8 million for \"technical and base adjustments\" without adding permanent positions. Special Agents and Industry Operations Investigators (IOIs) accounted for a significant portion of the permanent positions. The level of funded positions for these job series has remained stable, with a reduction in FY2013 due to sequestration and a DOJ hiring freeze. Additional positions requested for FY2017 included Special Agents, Intelligence Analysts, and Attorneys. The Obama Administration requested the elimination of two long-standing provisos in FY2017 related to ATF appropriations. Congress included provisions in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 to make these changes permanent. There are various gun control-related spending limitations imposed on ATF by Congress. The ATF salaries and expenses appropriations language has undergone changes in recent years, with some provisos being removed due to concerns raised by gun control advocacy groups. Congress did not alter these provisions in the FY2017 CJS Appropriation bills, despite the Obama Administration's request. Data trends such as the number of federal firearms licensees, civilian gun stock growth, and firearms-related violent crime rates continue to impact ATF workloads. Under the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the National Firearms Act of 1934, persons engaged in the business of manufacturing, importing, or selling firearms must be licensed by ATF as Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs). The criteria for being considered engaged in the business of dealing in firearms include devoting time, attention, and labor to the trade with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through repetitive purchase and resale of firearms. The intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms must predominantly be for obtaining livelihood and pecuniary gain. Federal law exempts persons who make occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for personal collection enhancement or hobby. FFLs can facilitate interstate firearms transfers for unlicensed individuals. ATF struggles to inspect every FFL for compliance due to limitations in appropriations legislation, an increase in FFLs, and a rise in firearms-related commerce. In FY2014 and FY2015, ATF conducted fewer FFL compliance inspections due to limited resources. As of January 11, 2016, there were 138,370 FFLs, with Type 3 FFLs making up 43.0% and Types 1 and 2 FFLs comprising 40.4%. Dealers and Pawnbrokers are the largest percentage, facilitating transfers to unlicensed individuals. The number of Type 1 and 2 FFLs, Dealers, and Pawnbrokers decreased significantly from about 258,607 in 1992 to 73,044 in 2001, a 72% decrease. This reduction was partly due to limited resources for ATF compliance inspections. The number of Type 1 and 2 FFLs, Dealers, and Pawnbrokers decreased significantly from about 258,607 in 1992 to 73,044 in 2001, a 72% decrease. This reduction was partly due to higher licensing fees and ATF changes in regulations. The number of Type 1 and 2 FFLs continued to decrease until 2009, but since then, there has been an increase. Additionally, the number of Type 3 FFLs, Collectors of Curios and Relics, has increased significantly from 1997 to 2015. Over a 35-year period, from 1980 to 2014, over 250 million firearms were introduced into the U.S. civilian gun stock. Since 1980, over 250 million firearms were added to the U.S. civilian gun stock. Spikes in firearm introductions occurred during debates and passage of gun control laws. Increases in firearm acquisitions were seen in 2006, possibly due to fears of stricter regulations. The year following the Newtown, CT mass shooting in 2012 saw the highest annual increase of 16 million firearms in the U.S. civilian gun stock. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the U.S. civilian gun stock, with estimates ranging from 290 to 320 million firearms held by civilians. This rise in firearms could be linked to debates and passage of gun control laws, as well as fears of stricter regulations. The Government Accountability Office estimated that there were around 350 million firearms in the U.S. as of 2013. As of 2014, there were approximately 1 million firearms in police possession and 4 million in military possession. Polls show that 35% of households and 25% of adults (60 million) own a gun, with 37% of men and 12% of women being gun owners. ATF reported incidents of criminal homicide, robbery, and aggravated assault with firearms in 2014. FBI data indicates that two-thirds of homicide victims were killed with firearms, and half with handguns. Homicide rates were lower in 2014 compared to 1968, with peaks in 1974 and 1980. In 2014, firearms-related homicides decreased by over half from 1993 to 2014, with a rate of 3.0 victims per 100,000 population. The estimated firearms murder rate per 100,000 population in 2014 was lower than in 1968. About 40% of robberies and 22% of aggravated assaults are committed with firearms. Firearms-related robberies and aggravated assaults have also decreased since 1993. In 1993, there were about 112 firearms-related aggravated assaults per 100,000 population, compared to 52 in 2014. The number of federally licensed dealers and pawnbrokers decreased significantly from 1992 to 2009, but increased by 18.3% to 64,087 in 2015. The number of firearms introduced into civilian gun stock grew to 8 million or more per year since 2009, suggesting some dealers were transferring more firearms to unlicensed individuals. ATF focused more on enforcement than regulation, which may have impacted the transfer of firearms. The ATF's regulatory mission, particularly monitoring FFLs and explosives licensees, may need more resources. The ATF regulates nonmilitary commerce in various firearms under the NFA. Since 2011, 17 states legalized suppressors for hunting, bringing the total to 39 states allowing it. The ATF's workload has increased due to changes in state laws regarding suppressors, with the number of registered suppressors rising significantly. The Senate-reported FY2017 CJS appropriations bill would have provided ATF with additional funding, but fell short of the Obama Administration's request. The Senate report expressed support for ATF's efforts to address gun violence and enforce existing gun laws, including funding for NIBIN and bomb disposal training. However, it did not mention increased staffing for firearms compliance inspections or funding for a new investigative case management system. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.258 billion for ATF in FY2017. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.258 billion for ATF in FY2017, which was slightly higher than the previous year's appropriation but below the Obama Administration's request. The House report expressed concerns about the lack of consistent entry of ballistic evidence into NIBIN and directed ATF to upgrade the system. Additionally, the report urged continued support for efforts to counter improvised explosive devices and noted concerns about longer processing times for ATF's NFA workload. The committee recommended $6.0 million to address longer processing times at ATF. The House bill included provisions on gun-related issues such as \"gun walking\" across the U.S.-Mexico border and restrictions on firearms parts exports. Additionally, there was a provision to prohibit ATF from collecting multiple long gun sales reports in southern border states. Following the Orlando mass shooting in June 2016, Senator Christopher Murphy and other Democrats pushed for gun control legislation. In the Senate markup, an amendment to deny firearms transfer to \"dangerous terrorists\" was defeated. Senator Murphy also proposed an amendment to expand federal background check requirements for intrastate firearms transfers. The Senate rejected the Murphy amendment for universal background checks on intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons. Senator Grassley's amendment, which aimed to improve background checks, was also rejected. Other amendments were considered to authorize the denial of firearms and explosives transfers to individuals deemed unfit by the Attorney General. The Senate considered amendments to authorize the denial of firearms and explosives transfers to individuals deemed dangerous terrorists by the Attorney General. One amendment, known as the \"Collins compromise,\" was rejected in a procedural vote. The Senate rejected the \"Collins compromise\" amendment in a procedural vote, with 52 votes against. The motion was seen as a test vote to amend the bill successfully. The FBI activated the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in November 1998, which conducts background checks for unlicensed individuals seeking firearms from FFLs or state authorities. Intrastate transfers between unlicensed persons are not covered by federal background check requirements. FBI-administered background checks through NICS have increased significantly in recent years. The Obama Administration requested a $35 million increase for the NICS program, which falls under the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services decision unit. This would bring the FY2017 NICS program budget to $121.1 million. The FBI reported that the NICS program budget for FY2016 was anticipated to be $94.1 million. The House Committee on Appropriations Chair, Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, submitted a report indicating that P.L. 115-31 included $511.3 million for CJIS, supporting CJIS programs including NICS. Funding was allocated to improve criminal history recordkeeping under the National Criminal History Improvement Program, authorized under the Brady Act and strengthened by the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. This act prioritizes making records on persons prohibited from possessing firearms available electronically to the FBI for firearms-related background checks through NICS. The NICS Amendments Improvement Act prioritizes federal-state record sharing on mentally incompetent individuals and domestic violence convictions. Funding for this program was allocated $73 million in FY2016 and requested $48 million in FY2017. The Senate bill proposed $75 million, while the House bill proposed $73 million for these purposes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated $73 million for grants, including $25 million for programs established by P.L. 110-180. The Obama Administration requested $10 million for CDC research on firearm injury prevention, focusing on gaps in knowledge identified after the Newtown, CT mass shooting in 2012. The Obama Administration requested funding for research on youth access to firearms, risk factors for firearm violence, and risks and benefits of firearms ownership. Congress did not appropriate funding for these purposes in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. Since FY1997, Congress has prohibited the use of funds for gun control advocacy in Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations. Representative Jay Dickey proposed redirecting funding from a CDC program for gun research in FY1997, but the amendment was not approved. The Dickey amendment was not approved, and an alternative amendment by Representative Robert Livingston was passed, prohibiting the CDC from advocating or promoting gun control. The House FY1997 report language stated that the CDC should not engage in activities promoting gun control initiatives. The CDC is restricted from advocating for gun control initiatives and must conduct research objectively through an impartial peer review process. In 1996, controversy arose over CDC-sponsored research by Dr. Arthur L. Kellermann, leading to limitations on CDC appropriations from FY1997 to FY2011 and expanded to all of HHS in FY2012. The appropriations limitations from FY1997-2011 prohibited certain agencies from conducting publicity or propaganda supporting or defeating legislation, including research initiatives on alcohol availability and gun violence, alcohol use and firearms carrying among adolescents, and parental gun ownership as a hazard to children. These limitations were possibly a response to research perceived as advocating for gun control. Some Members of Congress objected to taxpayer-funded research advocating gun control, citing limitations on NIH and other HHS agencies. The Dickey amendment expanded to restrict unbiased scientific research on gun violence causes and prevention. President Obama's plan to reduce gun violence, Now Is The Time, was released after the Newtown, CT, mass shooting in December 2012. President Barack Obama's plan, Now Is The Time, aimed to reduce gun violence by directing CDC and other HHS agencies to conduct research on the causes and prevention of gun violence. However, the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations did not provide the requested $10 million for this research in FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 did not provide funding for gun violence prevention research. Congress has placed provisos on ATF appropriations for salaries and expenses related to domestic gun control. One proviso, the \"Tiahrt amendment,\" has included words of futurity since FY2005. The Tiahrt amendment restricts ATF from using appropriations for releasing unfiltered firearms trace data and supporting civil lawsuits. Gun control advocates argue that these limitations hinder ATF's law enforcement efforts, while gun rights supporters believe they prevent ATF from exceeding its authority. Congress included provisions in FY2012 that may make these limitations permanent law. The FY2013 appropriations included provisions related to NICS Fee Prohibition, Next-Day Destruction of Records, Curios or Relics Definition, Dealer Inventory, Dealer License Denials, and Trace Data Caveats. The Obama Administration requested the repeal of Curios or Relics Definition and Dealer Inventory provisions for FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. Additionally, provisions on Firearms Parts Exports to Canada and Curios and Relics Imports were included in appropriations bills for FY2013, FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Congress included provisions related to firearms disabilities, ATF reorganization, anti-gun walking, and shotgun imports. Legislation has been introduced to repeal some of these provisions in the 114th Congress. The ATF S&E appropriations language included a proviso for firearms acquisition/disposition data collection from FY1979 to FY2012. The ATF S&E appropriations language included a proviso prohibiting ATF from creating a registry of firearms or firearms owners. This provision was added in response to a proposal during the Carter Administration. The language also included a word of futurity in FY2012 to make the proviso permanent law. The ATF S&E appropriations language includes a proviso prohibiting the use of funds for changing the definition of \"curios or relics\" from FY1996 through FY2013. This was in response to concerns about surplus military firearms being imported into the US. The ATF appropriations language prohibits the use of funds for certain amendments or changes to regulations regarding \"Curios or relics.\" Congress made this limitation permanent in FY2013, despite requests for repeal in subsequent fiscal years. The ATF S&E appropriations language includes a proviso preventing the agency from using funds to consider applications for relief from firearms disabilities for ineligible individuals. This restriction aims to allocate resources towards fighting violent crime instead. The ATF appropriations language prohibits the agency from using funds to process applications for relief from firearms disabilities under 18 U.S.C. 925(c). This provision was included in the FY2015 and FY2016 appropriations acts, with a Senate bill maintaining the restriction while a House amendment sought to require ATF to process such applications. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act ultimately retained the appropriations limitation. Both the Senate and House FY2017 CJS Appropriations bills also included similar language. The FY2017 CJS Appropriations bills and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 included provisions for relief from firearms disabilities for corporations. This provision allows funds to be used to process disability relief applications for corporations under section 925(c) of title 18, United States Code. Similar provisions were included in previous appropriations acts for FY2015 and FY2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 and 2017 included provisions preventing the dismantlement of the ATF agency in response to a recommendation to transfer its law enforcement functions to the FBI. The ATF S&E appropriations language includes a proviso preventing the transfer of functions to other agencies. This provision has been included in various appropriations acts from FY2015 to FY2017. The ATF S&E appropriations language includes a proviso introduced by Representative Todd Tiahrt in FY2012, restricting ATF from sharing unfiltered trace data with parties other than law enforcement and national security agencies. This provision exempts trace reports used for statistical analysis and firearms trafficking trends. The amendment has been revised multiple times, with the last substantive change made in FY2010. The ATF appropriations language, introduced by Representative Todd Tiahrt in FY2012, restricts the disclosure of Firearms Trace System database contents. This provision has been revised multiple times, with the last substantive change in FY2010, and includes exceptions for law enforcement agencies and statistical analysis. The ATF appropriations language restricts the disclosure of Firearms Trace System database contents to specific entities for criminal investigations, national security, or intelligence purposes. Disclosure is prohibited if it compromises undercover officers or informants, and the data is immune from legal processes and inadmissible in court. The ATF appropriations language restricts disclosure of Firearms Trace System database contents to specific entities for criminal investigations, national security, or intelligence purposes, with exceptions for statistical information sharing among law enforcement agencies and publication of annual reports on regulated products. The ATF appropriations language restricts disclosure of Firearms Trace System database contents to specific entities for criminal investigations, national security, or intelligence purposes, with exceptions for statistical information sharing among law enforcement agencies and publication of annual reports on regulated products. This provision has not appeared in subsequent ATF appropriations, indicating a potential permanent law. Congress included a related provision in the FY2003 Treasury-Postal appropriations act, possibly prohibiting ATF from using funding for processing FOIA requests for trace data. The ATF restricts disclosure of firearms trace data for criminal investigations and national security purposes to prevent jeopardizing investigations and officer safety. This provision aims to protect the privacy of innocent citizens and prevent the dissemination of sensitive information through the Internet. The ATF restricts disclosure of firearms trace data for criminal investigations and national security purposes to protect investigations and officer safety. Legislation prohibits the agency from requiring federal firearms licensees to conduct inventories before an inspection. The FY2004 Tiahrt amendment prohibits funds from being used to implement a rule requiring a physical inventory of licensed businesses under section 923 of title 18, US Code. The Obama Administration requested the repeal of this provision in FY2014, FY2015, and FY2016. However, no changes were made in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The FY2017 CJS Appropriations bills also did not include any provisions to repeal this limitation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) includes provisions related to ATF S&E appropriations, specifically prohibiting the use of funds to search computerized records of out-of-business FFLs. This restriction, with a word of futurity added in FY2012, appears to be intended as permanent law. Additionally, funds are prohibited from electronically retrieving information gathered under 18 U.S.C. 923(g)(4) by name or personal identification code. The ATF S&E appropriations language includes a provision prohibiting the denial or renewal of a dealer license for lack of business activity from FY2004 to FY2013. This provision was a response to ATF efforts to reduce individuals holding federal firearms licenses for convenience rather than livelihood. The language of the provision states that funds cannot be used to deny a license due to lack of business activity. The provision prohibiting the denial or renewal of a dealer license for lack of business activity was in place from FY2004 to FY2013. This provision aimed to prevent individuals from holding federal firearms licenses for convenience rather than livelihood. However, after 2013, this provision was not included in subsequent appropriations, possibly due to language indicating it was intended to be permanent law. Additionally, there was a provision in annual appropriations acts from FY2012 to FY2015 that prohibited the investigative tactic of \"gun walking\" as part of Operation Fast and Furious. Senator John Cornyn sponsored an amendment to the FY2012 CJS appropriations act to prevent \"gun walking\" and the trafficking of firearms to Mexican drug trafficking organizations. The related FY2012 provision prohibits Federal law enforcement officers from facilitating the transfer of operable firearms to individuals, except for the national instant criminal background check system. The FY2012 provision sponsored by Senator John Cornyn prohibits Federal law enforcement officers from facilitating the transfer of firearms to individuals, except for the national instant criminal background check system. In subsequent years, similar provisions were included in appropriations acts to prevent the transfer of firearms to drug cartels. The annual CJS appropriations acts from FY1999 to FY2012 included provisions prohibiting the Department of Justice from charging fees for firearms-related background checks and requiring the FBI to destroy background check records within 24 hours for eligible individuals. These provisions were responses to past proposals and practices, with the FY2012 provision mentioning futurity language. The FY2012 provision in the CJS appropriations act prohibits the use of funds for implementing certain tax or fee systems related to firearm background checks. It also mandates the destruction of identifying information for eligible individuals within 24 hours. The FY2012 provision in the CJS appropriations act prohibits funds for certain firearm background check systems and mandates the destruction of identifying information for eligible individuals within 24 hours. The provision regarding trace data limitations and disclaimers was included in the FY2004 CJS appropriations bill but was not included in subsequent appropriations. Firearm traces assist law enforcement in investigations by tracking specific firearms. Traced firearms are not a random sample and do not represent all firearms used in crime. Traced firearms are usually linked to the first retail seller, and the sources reported may not reflect how criminals acquire firearms for illicit purposes. Congress included provisions in FY2013 to make certain firearms parts exempt from export licensing requirements, allowing Canadian residents to acquire them from U.S. gun dealers. This was in response to regulations that made it costly for Canadians to obtain these parts. The provision exempts certain firearms parts from export licensing requirements for exports to Canada, with a total value not exceeding $500 wholesale in any transaction. This was in response to regulations that made it costly for Canadians to obtain these parts. The exemption from export licensing requirements for certain firearms parts to Canada does not apply to fully automatic firearms, components, or parts for such firearms, barrels, cylinders, receivers, breech mechanisms for Category I firearms, or articles for export to other foreign destinations. In accordance with this section, the District Directors of Customs and postmasters shall permit the export of unclassified articles to Canada without a license for end use in Canada or return to the United States. The President may require export licenses temporarily if inadequate import controls in Canada lead to diversion of articles for terrorism or conflict escalation. The President can terminate license requirements when the reasons for temporary requirements have ended. This provision was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2015. For FY2017, both the Senate and House CJS Appropriations bills included this provision with words of futurity. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 also includes this provision with words of futurity. The provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) includes language indicating permanency for prohibiting the denial of certain import applications using appropriated funds. This provision was initially included in the FY2006 Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) includes a provision prohibiting the denial of import applications for \"curios or relics\" firearms, parts, or ammunition using appropriated funds. This provision has been included in various appropriations acts since FY2006. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) includes a provision regarding shotgun imports, prohibiting the denial of import applications for certain shotguns with \"non-sporting\" features using appropriated funds. This provision has been in place since FY2012 in response to an ATF study. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) prohibits the denial of import applications for certain shotguns with \"non-sporting\" features using appropriated funds. This provision has been in place since FY2012 in response to an ATF study. The provision allows importation if all legal requirements are met and no previous denial for the same shotgun model occurred before January 1, 2011. The FY2017 CJS Appropriations bills included provisions regarding the suitability of shotguns for sporting purposes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 prohibits the denial of import applications for certain shotguns with \"non-sporting\" features. Congress has also included a provision to prohibit funding for implementing the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 includes a provision prohibiting the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty until Senate ratification. The treaty aims to reduce illicit small arms trafficking and establish international standards for arms transfers to prevent certain entities from acquiring advanced conventional weapons. The Arms Trade Treaty defines \"advanced conventional weapons\" and requires countries to adopt comparable arms export control laws to address illicit arms trafficking. Some Members of Congress oppose the treaty due to concerns about Second Amendment rights, but the State Department asserts that it protects U.S. sovereignty and interests. The Arms Trade Treaty protects U.S. sovereignty and interests, including rights under the U.S. Constitution. Opponents argue it does not adequately address individual firearm use and constitutional rights. Senator James Inhofe proposed an amendment before the treaty was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. In March 2013, Senator Inhofe offered an amendment to the Budget Resolution that opposed the Arms Trade Treaty. The amendment passed with bipartisan support, raising concerns about the treaty's impact on lawful firearm ownership and the U.S. firearms industry."
