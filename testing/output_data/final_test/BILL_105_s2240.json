In 1946, Secretary of the Interior established Adams Mansion National Historic Site in Quincy, Massachusetts. In 1952, the site was enlarged and renamed Adams National Historic Site. Congress authorized additions to the site in 1972 and 1978, including the birthplaces of John Adams and John Quincy Adams in Quincy. In 1980, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to manage the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Massachusetts, the burial place of John Adams, Abigail Adams, and John Quincy Adams and his wife, as part of the Adams National Historic Site. Past actions have preserved the birthplaces and burial site of the Adams family, resulting in a multi-site unit of the National Park System. The purpose of this Act is to establish the Adams National Historical Park in Quincy, Massachusetts, to preserve the home, property, birthplaces, and burial site of John Adams, Abigail Adams, John Quincy Adams, and subsequent generations of the Adams family for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.
