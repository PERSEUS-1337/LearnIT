    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2006\" and includes findings. Congress finds that President George H.W. Bush recognized the need for periodic referendums on Puerto Rico's political status, and President Clinton established a task force to identify options for the territory's future status. President George W. Bush amended Executive Order No. 13183 to require periodic reports on Puerto Rico's status determination progress. A report recommended a federally sanctioned plebiscite for Puerto Ricans to vote on remaining a US territory. Puerto Rico can either remain a United States territory or pursue a path towards a permanent nonterritorial status with the United States. The Act defines key terms such as Commission, Commonwealth, and Task Force. It establishes a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination. During the 110th Congress, the Commission will conduct a plebiscite in Puerto Rico by December 31, 2007, allowing voters to choose between continuing as a territory or pursuing a path towards permanent non-territory status. The Commission will issue rules and regulations for the plebiscite and certify the results. The plebiscite results will be reported to the President and Congress. Federal courts in the US will have exclusive jurisdiction over legal claims related to the Act's implementation. SEC. 5. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE SELF-DETERMINATION PROCESS. During the self-determination process, the Secretary of the Treasury will allocate up to $5,000,000 to the Commission for conducting the plebiscite. The Task Force will determine the amount needed for the plebiscite costs. The funds can also be used for educational and other materials. The Commission can use funds allocated by the Secretary of the Treasury for voter education materials certified by the Task Force as compliant with laws and policies."
