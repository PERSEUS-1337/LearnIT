    "content": "Casework in a congressional office involves providing assistance to constituents who request help with federal administrative agencies. Members of Congress and their staff act as facilitators, ombudsmen, and advocates for individual constituents. This can also include liaising between the federal government and local governments or businesses affected by federal legislation. Common casework requests include tracking misdirected benefits payments and assisting with government forms. Casework requests in a congressional office involve assisting constituents with various federal benefits applications, government forms, and immigration processes. Members of Congress are limited in their ability to intervene, but providing casework assistance is commonly expected by constituents. Casework is an essential part of a Member of Congress's representational duties, serving as a point of contact for constituents seeking assistance with federal government issues. It can also be seen as a way to evaluate the effectiveness of programs and policies, and may influence legislative considerations. Members and their staff commonly engage in casework to build political support and address constituent inquiries. Members of Congress and their staff are prohibited from representing anyone before the federal government, except in official duties. They can request information, arrange interviews, express judgments, and provide other services for eligible individuals. Ex parte communications with agency employees involved in case adjudication are also prohibited. Additionally, executive branch agencies cannot share records containing an individual's personally identifiable information under the Privacy Act of 1974. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, executive branch agencies are restricted from sharing personally identifiable information without authorization. Requests for information may require waivers, especially for medical data under HIPAA rules. House Ethics Manual guidelines prohibit improper conduct when contacting agencies on behalf of constituents for casework assistance. The House Ethics Manual and Senate Rule XLIII provide guidelines for casework services, with restrictions on assistance based on personal interests. Casework services are primarily for individual constituents, but other entities may also seek help from a Member's office. Foreign-born individuals seeking to immigrate to the United States may contact a Member of Congress for assistance, regardless of strict eligibility criteria. Senate Rule XLIII uses the term \"petitioner\" for casework requesters, while the House Ethics Manual refers to them as \"constituents.\" The House Committee on Ethics advises caution when providing assistance. The Committee on Ethics advises caution when providing assistance to individuals outside a Member's congressional district. Members should not use official resources for non-constituent casework and may refer them to their own House Member or Senators. Casework management is at the discretion of individual congressional offices, based on chamber rules, laws, and office priorities. Factors like constituent requests, casework definition, Member priorities, and staff responsibilities can influence casework policies. Most congressional offices have established casework policies and procedures for handling constituent requests. Staff in state or district offices are typically responsible for casework, with some offices creating specific procedures, forms, and expectations for handling cases. Privacy Act waivers and careful handling of personal information are common practices. Casework records are considered the personal property of the Member. Casework in congressional offices involves staff members acting as liaisons between constituents and federal agencies. Each office determines the decision to hire caseworkers, their qualifications, and job responsibilities. Caseworkers may specialize in certain agencies or types of cases, while others handle all types of cases. They gather information about constituents' situations to provide assistance. Caseworkers in congressional offices act as liaisons between constituents and federal agencies. They gather information about the constituent's situation, determine eligibility for services, request necessary documentation, and communicate with federal agencies on behalf of the constituent. Privacy Act waivers are required for agencies to share personal information with the congressional office. Caseworkers manage constituent expectations and may contact a federal agency's congressional liaison for assistance. Caseworkers in congressional offices liaise between constituents and federal agencies, handling issues that may require contacting state or local governments, nonprofits, or community organizations for assistance. They may also seek support from Members of Congress or other officials when needed. Federal agencies have designated staff for congressional caseworkers, listed in CRS Report 98-446. Congressional liaisons serve as resources, not decision-makers. Additional information for caseworkers is available on the CRS casework resources website or by contacting CRS. Congressional liaisons are resources for Members and congressional staff on legislative and constituent service matters, located in agency offices. They can refer caseworkers to local or regional staff for assistance and may suggest other sources of help, such as local leaders or community organizations. Caseworkers can also learn from contacts in other congressional offices. Caseworkers develop expertise through interactions with agencies and contacts in other congressional offices. They can provide constituents with information not found in formal agency responses. Agencies are responsive to congressional concerns due to Congress's oversight role in creating, funding, and overseeing federal agencies and programs. Federal agencies may view congressional casework inquiries as oversight exercises and response times can vary. Response practices may result in slower responses than expected, with limits on expediting requests. Congressional liaisons can share protocols for emergency situations. Limits exist on expediting requests for agency responses. Caseworkers may provide updates to constituents on the status of their case. Federal agencies must adhere to statutes and regulations, which may sometimes result in unsatisfactory responses. Members of Congress can request further information if they believe agency decisions were not in line with requirements. CRS provides casework resources for congressional offices, including videos and reports on casework practices, service academy nominations, and resources for addressing constituent concerns. Nonfederal entities may offer services to constituents while they await agency decisions. CRS provides casework resources for congressional offices, including reports on service academy nominations and liaison contacts. Congressional offices can also seek additional support from local officials, professional associations, or community groups for constituent issues. Caseworkers in district offices can benefit from contacting staff in the Member's Washington, DC, office for information on policies or programs. Connecting with fellow caseworkers in similar states or districts can also provide valuable contacts, resources, and advice."
