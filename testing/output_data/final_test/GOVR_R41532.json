    "content": "The American Community Survey (ACS) was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau in the mid-1990s as a continuous measurement survey. It collects data from about 295,000 housing units monthly, totaling 3.54 million annually. The data are aggregated over time to produce reliable estimates, with different time frames for reporting based on population size. The American Community Survey (ACS) is a continuous measurement survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, collecting data from about 295,000 housing units monthly. It replaced the census long form and is used to distribute over $450 billion a year in funding for various purposes. The American Community Survey (ACS) is crucial for distributing over $450 billion annually. The ACS evolved from a continuous measurement survey proposed in the early 1990s, eventually becoming the ACS after testing in 36 counties. The ACS methodology was implemented in 36 counties during 1999-2001 to compare results with the 2000 census long form data. A large-scale test called the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey was conducted in 2000 to collect long-form data separately using the ACS questionnaire. The plan is to use 5-year ACS cumulations to replace the census long form for detailed descriptive statistics. The Census Bureau replaced the long form with the ACS to improve public response to the decennial enumeration. The ACS provides 1-year averages for areas over 65,000 population, 3-year averages for areas over 20,000, and 5-year averages for all areas. This change was made to ensure a complete count for apportioning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and for other national, state, and local purposes. The ACS was adopted to increase the initial mail return rate of the census and provide more timely information for distributing federal funds. It replaced the long form, which collected data only once a decade and was up to three years old. The ACS development began in the mid-1990s and fully implemented in 2005 and 2006. The ACS designers decided to have features similar to the decennial census, such as mailing questionnaires to housing units, mandatory responses, and follow-ups with non-respondents. The ACS would collect data continuously from monthly samples, initially considering 500,000 housing units per month but settling on 250,000 for cost-effectiveness. The ACS began limited testing in 1995 in various counties, expanding to areas with diverse characteristics in 1996. This led to research on small-area estimation, nonresponse follow-up, and data quality. Operational testing expanded in 1998 to include additional counties for comparison with 1998 dress results. In 1999, testing was extended to 36 counties in 26 states to compare ACS test data with the 1998 dress rehearsal for the 2000 census. These counties were selected based on various factors such as population size, difficulty of enumeration, racial diversity, and economic conditions. The 36 counties also served as test sites for enumerating residents of group quarters, focusing on methodology for visiting group quarters and conducting interviews. The methodology for visiting group quarters and selecting samples of residents was modified, along with revisions to data collection methods. The testing phase aimed to determine the viability of the methodologies used and generated usable data on demographic, social, economic, and housing topics. A larger-scale test, called the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey, was conducted in 1,239 counties to demonstrate the feasibility of nationwide implementation of the ACS and the quality of the rolling sample survey. The number of housing units sampled annually increased from 165,000 in 1999 to 866,000 in 2000. The Bureau issued 11 reports analyzing various aspects of the demonstration phase of the ACS. The analysis showed the ACS to be successful and recommended further research on discrepancies in estimates of disability and ancestry. The ACS was well-managed, achieved desired response rates, and had quality control procedures in place. The analysis also found that the ACS and census 2000 long-form estimates of economic and social characteristics were comparable. The ACS methodology was found to be sound but in need of ongoing improvement. A test comparing voluntary and mandatory compliance with the ACS had implications for response rates, survey costs, and data reliability. Full implementation of the housing unit component of the ACS occurred in January 2005, covering approximately 250,000 housing units per month. The Bureau fully implemented the ACS group quarters component in January 2006, with an annual sample of around 20,000 group quarters. Annual ACS population and housing unit profiles were released on the American FactFinder website starting in mid-2006. The annual ACS population and housing unit profiles for geographic areas, including congressional districts with 65,000 or more people, are released as period estimates. The latest one-year estimates for 2013 were posted on September 18, 2014, while the latest three-year estimates for 2011 through 2013 were released on October 23, 2014. Generating accurate estimates for areas with fewer than 20,000 people requires a large enough ACS sample. The American Community Survey (ACS) provides accurate long-term estimates based on data collected over a five-year period. The estimates are accompanied by margins of sampling error, indicating the confidence level of the data. The margins of error are based on a 90% confidence level, ensuring that the true value of an estimate lies within its upper and lower bounds. The true value of an ACS estimate lies between its upper and lower confidence bounds, illustrated using a one-year estimate from 2007 for children under 18 below the poverty level in Mississippi. The margin of error is +/- 1.2%, making the data user 90% certain that the true value is between 28.1% and 30.5%. ACS data tables cover various topics, summarized in the report's Appendix, with brief explanations adapted from the ACS questionnaire. The Bureau's questionnaire underwent a precise selection process in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The Act requires OMB approval before collecting information from the public, ensuring that data requested are mandatory, required by law, or necessary for operational needs. The policy statement outlines the OMB's responsibility for approving ACS content, considering factors like data collection frequency and respondent burden. The Census Bureau periodically reassesses questions to ensure survey relevance and practical utility of data. The Census Bureau refers agency requests for new content to the OMB to minimize respondent burden. Data from the ACS questionnaire is used in program formulas distributing over $450 billion annually in federal funds to states and localities. Examples include using disability status information for grants and funds for mass transit systems, and income data for federal program allocations. The data from the ACS questionnaire is used to allocate funds for various programs, including home energy aid, housing assistance, economic recovery grants, job-training programs, food and health care for low-income elderly, meal planning classes for low-income women with children, and education improvement for children from low-income households. Veteran status data is used for veterans' employment and job training programs, language data for grants benefiting children with limited English proficiency, and plumbing facilities data for assessing housing quality and allocating federal housing subsidies. The American Community Survey (ACS) provides detailed, relatively current information on various aspects such as housing quality and geographic coverage. The tension lies in balancing the amount, quality, timeliness, and cost of gathering data. Larger samples yield better data but are more expensive and involve more respondents. The Bureau announced plans to release 2005-2009 ACS data products to achieve the goal of providing small area data similar to Census 2000. The ACS 5-year sample size is smaller than Census 2000, affecting detailed data for small geographic areas. The Bureau lacks the budget for a larger sample, leading to limitations in providing detailed census tract and block group data. The issue of sample size impacting small-area data is not new. The issue of sample size impacting small-area data is not new, as discussed in previous publications. The fixed sample size of the ACS could lead to a decrease in surveyed units as the population grows, affecting data quality for various purposes, including the distribution of federal funds. In 2010, 3 million units represented about 2.3% of the total housing units. In FY2011, the Obama Administration requested $44 million to increase the ACS sample size to 3.54 million housing units, improving data reliability. This funding also supported field data collection enhancements and a nonresponse follow-up operation in specific areas. Director Groves confirmed the sample size increase in 2012, despite some public resistance to the ACS questionnaire. The response rates to mailed questionnaires from the Bureau have been decreasing over time, with a significant drop in ACS mail response rates from 2000 to 2008. The long-form mail return rates also showed a decrease from 1980 to 2000. The response rates to mailed questionnaires from the Bureau have been decreasing over time, with a significant drop in ACS mail response rates from 2000 to 2008. The decrease over eight years was less when all questionnaires were included, with rates dropping from 59.7% in 2000 to 56.6% in 2008. There was dissatisfaction with the 2000 census long form due to perceived intrusiveness and invasion of privacy, despite only one new question being added from 1990. During the 1998 dress rehearsals, the long form response rate was lower than the short form. The long form of the ACS had a lower response rate compared to the short form, leading to controversy and privacy concerns. Media outlets, including major newspapers and TV shows like 60 Minutes, highlighted the issue. Many Americans were uncomfortable answering the long form questions, with commentator Andy Rooney publicly refusing to fill it out. The ACS monthly survey can attract negative attention more frequently due to detailed questions about income, disability, and home plumbing facilities. Respondents may feel their privacy is invaded and question the necessity of answering these mandatory questions. The decennial census is authorized by Title 13, United States Code, Sections 141 and 193 for House apportionment and redistricting purposes. The Census Bureau conducts the American Community Survey (ACS) as mandatory, with fines up to $5,000 for refusal to answer questions. Employees must maintain confidentiality of census data, with penalties for wrongful disclosure. The American Community Survey (ACS) is mandatory, with fines up to $5,000 or five years' imprisonment. In late 2002, concerns led Congress to consider making ACS responses voluntary, prompting a $1 million test in 2003 to compare voluntary and mandatory response rates. Test results were reported to the Commerce Secretary and are available on the Bureau's website. The 2003 report on the American Community Survey (ACS) compared voluntary and mandatory response rates. It highlighted two main treatments: the \"2002 Current Mandatory approach\" and the \"Standard Voluntary\" approach. The Bureau's sample design for the ACS test in 2003 divided housing units into high-response areas (HRAs) and low-response areas (LRAs) based on Census 2000 data. LRAs had younger, Hispanic, non-white, less educated, and more renter populations. The test compared results from the Standard Voluntary treatment. The 2003 voluntary survey had lower mail cooperation rates compared to the 2002 mandatory ACS, leading to more nonresponse follow-up by telephone. Cooperation with telephone interviewers was also lower in the 2003 survey. In 2003, telephone cooperation rates decreased compared to 2002, with a larger decline in HRAs than in LRAs. Personal visits for nonresponse follow-up helped close the gap in cooperation rates between 2002 and 2003, but the voluntary approach had a greater negative effect on compliance in cooperative areas. Overall response to personal visits in 2003 was 89%, down from 95.6% in the previous year. In 2003, response rates to personal visits decreased compared to the previous year. The response rate was 89%, down from 95.6% in 2002. The shift from mail to personal visits or telephone follow-up led to increased survey costs. The Bureau's selection of a subsample of nonrespondents for personal visits raised concerns about data reliability. The Bureau found that switching to voluntary responses for the American Community Survey would require increasing the sample size and cost significantly. Bills introduced in Congress to make ACS responses optional did not progress beyond committee referrals. The American Community Survey Voluntary was introduced in 2009 to make responses optional, except for basic questions. Bills like H.R. 5046 aimed to clarify that only providing the number of residents was required, with penalties only for not answering this question. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to make almost all American Community Survey (ACS) responses optional, with one bill aiming to defund the survey. H.R. 931, introduced in 2011, sought to make participation in the ACS voluntary, except for certain basic questions. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to make ACS responses optional. H.R. 931 aimed to make ACS participation voluntary, with companion legislation S. 3079 introduced by Senator Rand Paul. Amendments to H.R. 5326 would have affected the ACS, including prohibiting enforcement of penalties for not answering ACS questions. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to make ACS responses optional, with amendments proposed to prohibit funding for the ACS survey. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, funded CJS entities for the remainder of FY2013 without mentioning the ACS, but directed the Census Bureau to provide a report to the Committees on Appropriations. The Department of Commerce was directed to provide a report on the efficiency of the ACS within 120 days. An independent analysis on the costs and benefits of voluntary ACS compliance was also mandated within 180 days. Several bills in previous Congresses aimed to make ACS responses optional, but did not progress beyond committee referrals. A bill was introduced to make participation in the American Community Survey voluntary, with responses only required for basic questions. The legislation aimed to prohibit the Commerce Secretary and Census Bureau from conducting surveys, including the ACS, and almost all censuses. The bill introduced aims to make participation in the American Community Survey voluntary, with responses only required for basic questions like name, contact information, and number of people at the same address. It was introduced by Senator Paul and referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, while a similar bill, H.R. 1638, was introduced by Representative Jeff Duncan and referred to various House committees. H.R. 1638 aimed to repeal the authority for the American Community Survey and other surveys, limiting the census to collecting only necessary population data by States. H.R. 4660, an appropriations act, included an amendment to prohibit enforcement of penalties for non-response to surveys like the ACS. The Poe amendment, now Section 545, addresses penalties for false answers on surveys like the ACS. Congress did not pass H.R. 4660 or S. 2437 for FY2015 CJS appropriations. CJS entities are funded through P.L. 113-235 until September 30, 2015. Congress has options for the ACS, including maintaining oversight and funding, addressing methodology, sample size, and data reliability. The ACS sample size and funding levels are key issues for ensuring data reliability, especially for small areas. Several bills in Congress aimed to make completing the ACS questionnaire optional, but a voluntary survey could lower response rates and raise costs. Congress is exploring ways to address public dissatisfaction with the ACS and improve nonresponse follow-up. The ACS data collection process and public engagement in nonresponse follow-up are being discussed by Congress. Suggestions include an advertising campaign to raise awareness of the survey's value, enhancing the appeal of the ACS by linking it to federal funding programs, and implementing an Internet response option for the 2020 census and ACS. The Bureau now notifies households selected for the ACS to complete the survey online. Congress could review the impact on response rates, costs, and public perception. Alternatives to the ACS could be explored, such as using administrative records. The ACS is an efficient means of gathering data for various purposes. Congress could expedite research into replacing certain surveys with the ACS to identify savings and disadvantages. The topics covered by the ACS include demographic characteristics like age, sex, and Hispanic origin. The curr_chunk discusses demographic characteristics such as ethnicity, race, ancestry, citizenship status, disability status, and educational attainment. The curr_chunk provides information on various demographic characteristics such as educational attainment, fertility, field of degree, grandparents as caregivers, language spoken at home, marital status, and place of birth. The curr_chunk provides details on marital status, place of birth, relationship to the person filling out the form, school enrollment, residence one year ago, veterans status, year of entry into the U.S., and economic characteristics like class of worker. Labor force status includes whether a person worked for pay in the past week, actively looked for work in the past four weeks, and their last work date. Health insurance coverage indicates if a person is currently covered by any health insurance plan. Income details sources such as wages, interest, and public assistance. Industry and occupation describe the type of activity and work a person did in the past 12 months. In the past 12 months, data includes information on work status, poverty levels, housing characteristics, and owner statistics such as mortgage payments and utility costs. In the past 12 months, data includes information on payments for housing expenses, ownership of computers and internet access, renter statistics, rooms and bedrooms in housing units, sales of agricultural products, SNAP benefits received, telephone service availability, tenure status, and type of housing structure. The curr_chunk provides information on the value of a home, the number of vehicles available, the year the householder moved in, and the year the structure was built."
