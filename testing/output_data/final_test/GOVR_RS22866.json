    "content": "The House and Senate implemented earmark disclosure rules to increase transparency in congressionally directed spending. House Rule XXI, clause 9, outlines the administrative responsibilities for Members and committees in disclosing earmarks, tax benefits, and tariff benefits in measures. The rules require a list of earmarks or a statement of no earmarks to be included in the measure's report or the Congressional Record. Congressional earmark is defined as a provision included at the request of a Member, providing specific spending authority to an entity or targeted area. Limited tax benefit refers to provisions benefiting 10 or fewer beneficiaries with non-uniform eligibility criteria under the Internal Revenue Code. The curr_chunk discusses limited tariff benefits and the conditions under which a point of order may be raised against a measure's floor consideration if the list of earmarks is missing. The curr_chunk explains that House earmark disclosure rules apply to congressional earmarks in various legislative documents, including bills, committee reports, and conference reports. These rules do not apply in certain situations, such as when a measure is considered under the \"suspension of the rules\" procedure. House earmark disclosure rules do not apply to floor amendments, amendments between houses, or amendments considered as adopted under a self-executing special rule. Members requesting a congressional earmark must provide a written statement with specific details to the committee of jurisdiction. When submitting earmark requests, committees may have additional administrative requirements beyond House rules, such as prioritizing requests or submitting forms online. The House Appropriations Committee requires Members to post information about their earmark requests on their personal websites, including the purpose and why it is a valuable use of taxpayer funds. Earmarks directed to for-profit entities will no longer be approved. Committees may also establish policy requirements like matching funds for earmark requests. Committees and subcommittees have specific policy requirements and restrictions for earmark requests, including deadlines for appropriations legislation. The committee of jurisdiction is responsible for identifying earmarks in legislative text and reports, providing guidance on unclear requests. Members should check with committees for supplemental requirements. Members must also specify if they want the earmark in the bill text or accompanying committee report. Committees have specific policy requirements and restrictions for earmark requests, including deadlines for appropriations legislation. The committee of jurisdiction is responsible for identifying earmarks in legislative text and reports, providing guidance on unclear requests. Members must specify if they want the earmark in the bill text or accompanying committee report, with potential policy implications. House committees have discretion in determining earmarks, using House rules and past designations for guidance. Earmarks must be listed in committee reports or joint statements for reported bills, with disclosure tables made publicly available by the House Appropriations Committee. The committee will disclose earmarks the same day a subcommittee reports its bill. A conference report for an appropriations bill must identify earmarks not in the original legislation. Committees must maintain all earmark requests, even if not included in the final bill, and those included must be open for public inspection. Maintenance and public inspection methods are not specified in Rule XXIII."
