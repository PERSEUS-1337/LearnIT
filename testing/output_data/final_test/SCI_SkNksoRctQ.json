    "content": "The notion of stationary equilibrium ensemble is crucial in statistical mechanics and machine learning. Training in machine learning acts as equilibration, driving model parameters towards stationarity. Stationary fluctuation-dissipation relations derived here link measurable quantities and hyperparameters in stochastic gradient descent. These relations can adaptively set training schedules and extract information about loss-function landscapes. Empirical verification supports these claims. Equilibration governs the long-term behavior of macroscopic systems, leading to a state of tranquility. The Brownian motion exemplifies the balance between microscopic fluctuations and macroscopic motion, leading to the development of fluctuation-dissipation relations in statistical mechanics. Machine learning also undergoes equilibration as models learn patterns in data, improving performance before reaching a plateau. The text discusses the equilibration process in machine learning models as they learn patterns in data, improving performance before reaching a plateau. Fluctuation-dissipation relations are derived for stochastic gradient descent algorithms, linking noise in mini-batched data to model performance evolution. The text discusses the distribution governing model parameters over time, applicable to cases with non-Gaussian noises and nonconvex landscapes. It introduces two relations (FDR1 and FDR2) for assessing equilibration, setting learning rates adaptively, and determining loss function landscape properties. This contrasts with previous work assuming Gaussian noises and harmonic approximations. The paper introduces a framework for treating the stochastic gradient descent algorithm within the Kramers-Moyal expansion. It discusses fluctuation-dissipation relations for checking stationarity and delineating the shape of the loss-function landscape. An adaptive scheduling method is proposed and tested, with future outlooks presented in the conclusion. The model is parametrized by a weight coordinate \u03b8 = {\u03b8 i } i=1,...,P and trained on a set of N s examples to learn patterns in the data. The model's performance is evaluated using a full-batch loss function, f (\u03b8), with the goal of minimizing the loss function through optimization schemes like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. The update equation involves a learning rate \u03b7 and mini-batch loss f DISPLAYFORM1. The text discusses the definition of a noise matrix and higher-point noise tensors in the context of training a model using stochastic gradient descent. It also mentions the observation of model performance plateauing during training and hypothesizes the existence of a stationary-state distribution that influences the sampling process. The text discusses the evolution of probability distribution of model parameters during training, leading to the master equation. It applies this formula to derive stationary fluctuation-dissipation relations for simple observables. The Fokker-Planck equation can be obtained through the Kramers-Moyal expansion, considering the nonstationary version of the equation. The master equation is applied to linear observable, resulting in a gradient of zero due to stochastic model parameter behavior. The gradient of the model parameter stochastically moves around the local minimum according to the stationary distribution. Fluctuation-dissipation relations can be evaluated during training and used effectively. The gradient of the model parameter stochastically moves around the local minimum according to the stationary distribution. Fluctuation-dissipation relations can be used as a metric to check if learning has plateaued and to schedule changes in hyperparameters. The master equation (FDT) can be applied to the full-batch loss function to obtain a closed-form expression involving the Hessian matrix. The left-hand side is replaced by (1 \u2212 \u03bd) (\u2207f ) 2 \u2212 \u00b5 v \u00b7 \u2207f and C i1,i2,...,i k by more complex expressions. Evaluating G(\u03b7) \u2261 (\u2207f ) 2 shows information on the loss-function landscape, with nonlinearity at higher \u03b7 indicating effects of anharmonicity and breakdown of the harmonic approximation. In the context of loss-function landscape analysis, the fluctuation-dissipation relations are explored using the harmonic approximation. The learning rate \u03b7, multiplied by Tr C, is likened to temperature in the analogy between SGD and simulated annealing. Higher-order relations can be derived by extending the calculations, but the investigation of these is left for future work. SGD does not asymptotically reduce to a stochastic differential equation in a continuous time limit. In the context of loss-function landscape analysis, the recent work explores the scaling of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates towards a stochastic differential equation (SDE) limit. The approach involves adapting the view that SGD equals SDE, but faces challenges with noise scaling and covariance in the continuous-time limit. The recent work criticizes the use of continuous-time Fokker-Planck equation with incorrect diffusive term calculation. It suggests employing the discrete-time version of the Fokker-Planck equation instead. In machine learning, a stationary state depends on hyperparameters and learning history, different from statistical mechanics. The stationarity assumption in the equation (6) is weaker than typical assumptions in statistical mechanics. In the full-batch limit, stationary distributions can exist around local minima, forming disconnected ponds that merge or fragment based on learning rates. The conditions for the existence of stationary distributions are not fully formulated in the current paper, leaving room for potential counterexamples. An example is given of a model with unregularized cross entropy loss leading to parameters cascading towards infinity. Further exploration is needed to uncover additional nontrivial caveats. In this section, empirical evidence is provided for the theoretical claims made earlier. Two models of supervised learning are utilized: a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The models use different training data and optimization techniques to prevent overfitting. The text discusses the scaling of noise covariant matrix in relation to SGD and SDE convergence, defining half-running average of observables, and assessing proximity to stationarity in supervised learning models like MLP and CNN. The text discusses the convergence of observables in supervised learning models like MLP and CNN, with a focus on measuring running averages of mini-batch loss and observables O L and O R. Training the model with a learning rate of 0.1 for 100 epochs shows convergence towards stationarity. The text discusses the convergence of observables O L and O R in supervised learning models, showing that they converge to each other after training for 100 epochs. Further training at different learning rates also leads to convergence, with longer equilibration times for smaller learning rates. The text also mentions adjusting model parameters for numerical accuracy and how the relaxation time to reach a stationary regime increases as the learning rate decreases. The text discusses the convergence of observables O L and O R in supervised learning models, showing that they converge to each other after training for 100 epochs. The relaxation time to reach a stationary regime increases as the learning rate decreases. The observable O FB approaches zero at small learning rates, measuring the magnitude of the Hessian matrix. The text discusses the anharmonic effects experienced at higher learning rates, especially in CNN models on CIFAR-10 data. It suggests decreasing the learning rate when the relation FDR1 saturates to achieve learning stationarity. A procedure is proposed to algorithmize the process by evaluating half-running averages and adjusting the learning rate based on hyperparameters X and Y. The text introduces scheduling hyperparameters X and Y to control the saturation threshold of the relation (FDR1) and the decrease in learning rate. Results for SGD without momentum and Xavier initialization BID8 are shown, along with different training schedules. The adaptive scheduler with X = 0.01 is compared to other methods, showing theoretical grounding and practical advantages. The adaptive scheduling method proposed has a theoretical grounding and less dimensionality for tuning scheduling hyperparameters compared to presetting methods, improving optimization. Fluctuation-dissipation relations were derived without assumptions, even for nonGaussian noise and nonconvex loss functions. Empirical verification led to an algorithm that adaptively sets learning-rate schedules on the fly. Future avenues include comparing this method with others for state-of-the-art architectures and the AMSGrad algorithm for NLP tasks. The author proposes an adaptive scheduling algorithm for learning-rate schedules, aiming to investigate non-Gaussianity and nonconvexity in more detail. They also aim to extend the formalism to incorporate nonstationary dynamics and properly treat overfitting cascading dynamics and time-dependent sample distributions. Special thanks are given to individuals for discussions and practical applications of fluctuation-dissipation relations. Daniel Adam Roberts proposed the adaptive method for SGD with momentum and dampening, defining the update equation and stationary-state average of observables. The master equation for SGD with momentum and dampening is derived for linear and quadratic observables. Trivial satisfaction of certain relations is noted if observables are evaluated one step ahead. The MNIST training data consists of 60000 black-white images of hand-written digits with 28-by-28 pixels. The data is preprocessed through an affine transformation to have zero mean and variance. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) model used has an input layer of 784 dimensions, followed by two hidden layers of 200 neurons each with ReLU activations, and a 10-dimensional output layer. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) model used in the study consists of an input layer of 784 dimensions, two hidden layers of 200 neurons each with ReLU activations, and a 10-dimensional output layer with softmax activation. The model is trained on MNIST data using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) without momentum, with a mini-batch size of 100. The MLP is initialized using the Xavier method and trained for a total of 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.1, followed by sequential training with varying learning rates and epochs. The training protocol is carried out with 4 distinct seeds for random-number generation. The CIFAR-10 training data consists of 50000 color images divided into ten categories with 32x32 pixels in 3 color channels. The data is preprocessed to have pixel values ranging from -1 to 1. The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture includes multiple layers with specific filter widths, channels, strides, and padding, followed by ReLU activations and max-pooling layers. The CNN model for CIFAR-10 data includes convolutional layers, a fully-connected output layer with softmax activation, and is trained using SGD with momentum. The model is initialized using the Xavier method and trained for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.1. The proposed adaptive method outperforms AMSGrad in terms of accuracy for the MNIST classification task. The proposed adaptive method with X = 0.01 and Y = 0.1 outperforms AMSGrad in accuracy over time and shows quick initial convergence. However, for CIFAR-10 classification with CNN, a different hyperparameter combination like X = 0.1 and Y = 0.3 can improve initial accuracy at the cost of generalization accuracy compared to the original choice. The learning rate, training loss, and prediction accuracies are plotted in FIG2."
