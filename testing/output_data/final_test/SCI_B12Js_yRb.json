    "content": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have struggled with counting objects in natural images due to soft attention. A proposed neural network component allows robust counting from object proposals, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the number category of the VQA v2 dataset. Experiments show a 6.6% improvement in counting over a strong baseline, outperforming ensemble models with a single model. This component addresses the common task in VQA of answering questions about images. The task of counting in Visual Question Answering (VQA) is challenging due to issues with soft attention mechanisms and lack of ground truth labeling for objects. To improve counting accuracy, object proposals can be used as input instead of learning from scratch. Our main contribution is a differentiable neural network component that addresses the issue of double-counting overlapping object proposals in object detection networks. This component, used alongside an attention mechanism, improves counting accuracy and outperforms previous models on the VQA v2 Open-Ended dataset. The differentiable neural network component improves counting accuracy in object detection networks and outperforms previous models on the VQA v2 Open-Ended dataset. The component can be easily integrated into standard VQA models without the need for other network architecture changes. Our approach improves counting accuracy in object detection networks by creating counting features using information from the attention map over object proposals, allowing for counting of any discriminated objects. This method differs from previous approaches that rely on counting features present in the input. The approach improves counting accuracy in object detection networks by creating counting features using information from the attention map over object proposals. Trott et al. (2018) train a sequential counting mechanism with a reinforcement learning loss on counting question subsets of VQA v2 and Visual Genome, achieving a small increase in accuracy. However, it is unclear if their method can be integrated into traditional VQA models. Santoro et al. (2017) and Perez et al. (2017) successfully count on the synthetic CLEVR VQA dataset BID0 without bounding boxes and supervision, using more training data and simpler objects. In the context of object detection networks, various approaches have been explored to improve counting accuracy. These include methods such as creating counting features using information from attention maps, training sequential counting mechanisms with reinforcement learning, and counting on synthetic datasets without bounding boxes. Different techniques like integrating convolutional receptive fields, dividing images into smaller chunks, and using fixed bounding box structures have been utilized to enhance counting performance. Using feature vectors after attention mechanism is insufficient for counting; attention maps themselves should be utilized. Soft attention in VQA models benefits from shallow convolutional networks, outputting weights for feature vectors at spatial positions for a weighted sum. However, soft spatial attention limits counting ability, as seen in scenarios with multiple instances of the same object. The attention mechanism assigns the same weight to all instances of the same object, leading to duplicate proposals. The goal is to have one proposal per true object, with relevant and irrelevant proposals distinguished by their weights. The attention mechanism assigns weights to object instances, causing duplicate proposals. The issue arises when normalizing the weights to sum to 1, resulting in the loss of information about object count. The attention mechanism assigns weights to object instances, causing duplicate proposals. Normalizing the weights to sum to 1 results in the loss of information about object count. Multiple glimpses or steps of attention do not solve this issue. Hard attention and structured attention have been proposed as solutions, but no significant improvement in counting ability has been found. Ren & Zemel (2017) limit attention to one bounding box at a time, similar to using object proposal features. Without normalization, the scale of output features depends on the attention map. Without normalization of weights to sum to one, the scale of output features depends on the number of objects detected. Deep neural networks are sensitive to scale, making it unreasonable for counting objects. Sigmoid normalization does not help with counting and degrades accuracy on non-number questions. A differentiable mechanism for counting from attention weights is described, addressing the issue of overlapping object proposals to reduce double-counting. This method aims to produce accurate counts. The main idea is to convert overlapping object proposals into a graph and use a specific method to estimate the number of objects. The component is designed to handle extreme cases and interpolate for more realistic scenarios using parameters and differentiable operations. The component is designed to handle extreme cases by using piecewise linear functions as activation functions to approximate arbitrary functions. These functions are learned to deal with overlapping proposals and ensure that extreme cases are left unchanged. Monotonicity is enforced to guarantee proper handling of interactions necessary for overlapping proposals. The counting component enforces monotonicity to ensure that attention map values do not contradict count predictions. It uses an attention mechanism to assign weights to object proposals based on questions. The weights are assumed to be between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a relevant object. Overlapping proposals are handled by piecewise linear functions. The text discusses the handling of exact duplicate proposals of objects in a differentiable manner by converting attention weights into a graph representation using an outer product to create an attention matrix. This matrix can be seen as an adjacency matrix for a weighted directed graph. The adjacency matrix for a weighted directed graph represents object proposals. The goal is to eliminate edges to focus on true objects as vertices. The number of edges in a complete digraph with self-loops is related to the number of vertices. The count is computed by summing the entries in the adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix represents object proposals, with the count computed by summing the entries. Duplicate edges are eliminated by scaling factors for each vertex, removing intra-object and inter-object edges. This process helps focus on true objects as vertices. To compare bounding boxes, an adjacency matrix is used, representing a graph with edges except where boxes overlap. Intra-object edges are removed by multiplying the distance matrix with the attention matrix. Activation functions handle intermediate values, regulating attention weights. Inter-object edges between duplicate proposals are eliminated. The method eliminates inter-object edges between duplicate proposals by scaling down edge weights based on the number of proposals associated with each object. This reduces multiple proposals of an object to one by averaging over similar proposals. The estimation is based on the similarity of proposals belonging to the same object. The method reduces duplicate proposals by scaling down edge weights based on the number of proposals associated with each object. A differentiable similarity function is defined to compare rows of proposals, ensuring accuracy even with inaccurate bounding boxes. The method reduces duplicate proposals by scaling down edge weights based on the number of proposals associated with each object. A differentiable similarity function is defined to compare rows of proposals, ensuring accuracy even with inaccurate bounding boxes. The time complexity of computing scaling factors for each vertex is \u0398(n^3), with the need to expand the scaling factors into a matrix using the outer product to scale both incoming and outgoing edges of each vertex. Additionally, self-loops need to be scaled by the scaling factors as well. The scaling of self-loops involves a non-obvious detail. The diagonal removed when going from A to C contains entries f 1 (a a), scaled by s instead of s s due to the quadratic scaling of inter-object edges. Turning C into a count c involves setting |E| = i,j C ij, ensuring c is an integer under certain assumptions. To handle large numbers of objects, a single feature is split into classes for each possible number. The single feature is split into classes for each possible number, with the predicted count being at most n. The output vector is defined to be 1 at the count index and 0 elsewhere for integer counts, with linear interpolation for non-integer counts. Confidence values are used to scale the output based on the average distances to 0.5. The output of the component with confidence scaling is obtained using differentiable operations to deduplicate object proposals and generate a feature vector for counting from an attention map. A simple toy task is designed to evaluate counting ability, where a classification task predicts an integer count of true objects from bounding boxes and attention weights. Samples from this dataset are provided in Appendix D. The curr_chunk discusses the placement of bounding boxes in a square image with unit side length, controlling overlaps with a parameter l. The score of a bounding box is determined by its IoU overlap with true bounding boxes, and the attention weight is a linear interpolation between the score and a noise value controlled by parameter q. The counting component is compared against a baseline that sums attention weights for a simple feature. The counting component outperforms a simple baseline in most cases, showing increased robustness to overlapping proposals. It performs well with high values for parameter l and handles moderate noise levels decently as long as overlaps are limited. Performance is closely matched with the baseline when both l and q are high. When both l and q are high, the performance is closely matched with the baseline due to the high difficulty of those parametrizations. The activation functions' shapes show how behavior changes with varying dataset parameters, with f1 for attention weights and f2 for bounding box distances. Increasing the side length decreases the \"step\" height in f1 to account for greater overlapping bounding boxes, while f2 varies in requiring high pairwise distances when l is low and small distances when l is high. At the highest l values, there is little signal left in the overlaps. When varying noise levels, f1 resembles a step function starting near x = 1. Increasing noise causes the step to move away from 1, capturing uncertainty in bounding box assignments. Lower q values make f2 consider proposals distinct at lower distances, while higher q values follow a more sigmoidal shape to account for increased uncertainty in bounding box placements. The VQA v2 dataset reduces biases through balanced pairs of images for each question, with an accuracy metric that considers disagreements in human answers. An improved version of the strong VQA baseline model is used without tuning to maximize performance difference. The counting component is added to the baseline VQA model, improving accuracy on number questions without compromising other categories. Results on the VQA v2 leaderboard show significant enhancement with this addition, outperforming even an 8-model ensemble. By adding the counting component, the VQA model outperforms an 8-model ensemble in the number category. Further improvements in number accuracy are expected by enhancing attention weights. The counting module shows higher benefits on counting questions compared to general number questions. The counting module in VQA does not improve when replaced with NMS, indicating the importance of the counting module for learning. Evaluating accuracy over balanced pairs is challenging as it requires the model to find subtle details between images. The counting module in VQA shows significant accuracy improvement over balanced pairs, indicating its ability to properly count rather than fitting to dataset biases. The activation functions of the trained model suggest inaccuracies in attention mechanisms and object proposal network, explaining the modest increase in counting performance. This highlights the importance of balanced pair accuracy as a reflective measure of VQA model performance. The counting component in VQA models improves accuracy by addressing counting challenges through differentiable bounding box deduplication. It can be used with current top VQA models using soft attention and has applications beyond VQA for object-proposal-based tasks. The component's interpretable design showcases how inductive biases can enhance deep learning models for complex problems. By incorporating inductive biases into deep learning models, challenging tasks like counting arbitrary objects can be tackled with limited supervision. Future research should focus on addressing current model shortcomings in VQA v2 by understanding and mitigating them. The activation function is formed by splitting the interval [0, 1] into d equal size intervals, each containing line segments connected to neighboring segments. Each function f_k is associated with d weights w_k1, ..., w_kd, representing the gradient for the interval. Fixing d to 16 in this study showed no significant difference compared to 8 or 32. The paper discusses the activation function formed by splitting the interval [0, 1] into d equal size intervals with associated weights. The weights are enforced to be non-negative and normalized, resulting in a linear interpolation between boundary values. The approach is similar to the subgradient approach for differentiable sampling. The weights are initialized to 1, making the functions linear on initialization. Extensions through Deep Lattice Networks are possible to preserve monotonicity. Deep Lattice Networks preserve monotonicity and allow for more sophisticated combinations of A and D beyond elementwise product. Adapted from Kazemi & Elqursh (2017), the model improves validation accuracy by using object proposal features. The baseline model optimized validation accuracy but neglected performance impact on the counting component. Fusion of vision and question features was modified to include a term measuring their difference. The LSTM for question encoding was replaced with a GRU with dynamic unrolling. Batch normalization was applied before the last linear projection in the classifier. Learning rate was increased and batch size doubled for training over 100 epochs. The model is trained for 100 epochs, with a single-model baseline regularized with dropout. Ensembling is not used in top models to reduce overfitting. Ensembling of the regularized baseline provides a smaller benefit compared to unregularized networks. Example toy dataset data for varying bounding box side lengths and noise is shown. The data column visualizes samples used as input, with weights representing overlap of bounding boxes. Red boxes overlapping with blue boxes turn blue in the data column. The count c is the square root of the sum over elements of C, showing overlapping bounding boxes. The counting module successfully removes overlapping bounding boxes to arrive at the correct prediction, which is not necessarily the rounded value of c."
