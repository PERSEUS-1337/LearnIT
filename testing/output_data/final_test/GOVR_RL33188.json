    "content": "New Orleans is highly vulnerable to flooding due to its location on the Gulf Coast with water on three sides and below-sea-level terrain. The city faces threats from hurricane storm surges, the Mississippi River, and stormwater. Levees and floodwalls provide protection from riverine and coastal flooding, while pumps and drainage canals manage stormwater. The Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans is responsible for stormwater management. The Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans is responsible for stormwater management infrastructure. Levee breaches during Hurricane Katrina caused significant flooding downtown. Investigations are ongoing to determine if the breaches were due to design limitations or faulty construction. Evidence is being collected to understand why New Orleans' hurricane protection system failed, which will shape future design and rebuilding plans. This understanding may also impact flood protection in other U.S. cities. The failure of New Orleans' floodwalls is crucial for assessing vulnerability to storm surge flooding and determining effective flood risk management strategies during rebuilding efforts. Immediate repairs are necessary for the 2006 hurricane season, with discussions on inadequate design for protecting the city from a Category 3 hurricane. The original project design aimed to control storm surge with inlet barriers and canal floodgates. The project's construction began in 1965 with authorization and continued during Hurricane Katrina. Factors like environmental concerns, cost estimates, flood protection preferences, and litigation influenced the design changes to focus on higher levees and floodwalls instead of inlet barriers and floodgates. The Corps' decision in the mid-1980s favored floodgates over floodwalls along certain canals. The decision to build floodwalls instead of floodgates along the London Avenue canals was made by local project sponsors to provide protection from a Category 3 storm surge. The report discusses the evolution in the project's design, focusing on two major developments: shifting from barriers at inlets to higher levees along Lake Pontchartrain, and from floodgates to higher floodwalls along the stormwater outfall canals. The appendix includes a summary of federal funding history for the project. The analysis focuses on the breaches of the Lake Pontchartrain project, including the 17th Street Canal, London Avenue Canal, and Inner Harbor Navigation Canal floodwalls. Predictions of flooding from storm surges stronger than a Category 3 hurricane are discussed. Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage in New Orleans due to levee breaches and overtopping. Preliminary analysis by expert teams identified failures in the hurricane protection system, particularly at the 17th Street and London Avenue canals. The breaches at the 17th Street and London Avenue canals occurred before floodwalls were overtopped, leading to conjecture about the causes such as design issues, construction faults, and maintenance issues. A forensic investigation by the Corps is ongoing, with preliminary analysis pointing to storm surges from multiple directions overtopping the canals. Congress authorized protection from a Category 3 storm for New Orleans. The Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project was authorized by Congress in October 1965 to protect New Orleans from a Category 3 storm. The project, costing $738 million with federal responsibility at $528 million, consists of levees and floodwalls. The Orleans Parish segments were 90% complete by May 2005, with $70 million needed to complete federal funding. The original design was sent to Congress in July 1965 to protect the city from a standard hurricane, equivalent to a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. The Lake Pontchartrain project was authorized in 1965 to protect New Orleans from a Category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Betsy struck Louisiana's coast in September 1965, leading to the project's construction. Modifications have been made to the project since its original design. The Lake Pontchartrain project design originally included inlet barriers and levees for surge protection. Changes were made after Hurricane Betsy in 1965, leading to the shift to higher levees and floodwalls along the lake and canals. The Lake Pontchartrain project design initially included inlet barriers and lower levees, but was later changed to higher levees and floodwalls due to technical issues, environmental concerns, legal challenges, and local opposition. The High-Level Plan was approved by the Corps' Chief of Engineers in February 1985 to protect from a fast-moving Category 3 hurricane. The re-evaluation study recommended changing the construction plan for inlet barriers in response to a 1977 court injunction. The city pumps stormwater into three outfall canals that flow into Lake Pontchartrain, with levees built along the canals to protect from rising water during hurricanes. The Corps integrated hurricane storm protection for the outfall canals into the Lake Pontchartrain project due to inadequate levee height and stability. Two canal protection options evaluated were \"butterfly\" floodgates and higher levees/floodwalls. The Corps recommended butterfly floodgates for the Orleans and London Avenue canals, while parallel protection was favored for the 17th Street Canal. The butterfly floodgate plan for the London Avenue canal was deemed the least costly and fully responsive option for hurricane protection. The Corps recommended butterfly floodgates for the Orleans and London Avenue canals, while parallel protection was favored for the 17th Street Canal. The conclusion for the Orleans Avenue canal was that butterfly gates fully satisfied the project purpose of hurricane storm surge protection and were one-fifth the cost of parallel protection. The Orleans Levee District decided to construct most elements of the parallel protection on its own, incorporating it into the larger Lake Pontchartrain project. The federal cost-share contribution for the parallel protection of the two canals was recommended to be capped at 70%. The federal cost-share contribution for parallel protection of the two canals is capped at 70% of the less-costly butterfly floodgates design. Congress directed the Corps to consider parallel protection for the canals, with the federal government bearing part of the costs. The original project design aimed to control storm surge in New Orleans using inlet barriers and canal floodgates, but the constructed project focused on higher levees and floodwalls to reduce flooding. The Corps' decision was influenced by factors like environmental litigation, project economics, and local preferences. The decision to build floodwalls instead of floodgates along the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue canals was made by local project sponsors. The failure of the floodwalls during Hurricane Katrina decreased confidence in the city's hurricane protection system. This impacts investment decisions and the level of protection provided by the infrastructure. Hurricane protection influences investment decisions for rebuilding after disasters. Concerns about levee and floodwall reliability for the 2006 hurricane season remain due to ongoing repairs and investigations by the Corps. In 2006, concerns about the reliability of levees and floodwalls in New Orleans are compounded by the city's increasing vulnerability to hurricane storm surge. Factors such as land subsidence, disappearing barrier islands and wetlands, and rising sea levels have raised doubts about the ability of the city's infrastructure to provide Category 3 protection. The project was initially designed in the 1960s, with a reanalysis in the mid-1980s, but ongoing coastal land loss and settlement may have impacted its ability to withstand the design storm. Scientists warn that higher sea surface temperatures could lead to increased hurricane intensity, posing a greater challenge for protecting New Orleans. Higher sea surface temperatures may lead to increased hurricane intensity, prompting questions about the need to re-evaluate estimates of hurricane likelihood and past infrastructure decisions. Hurricane Katrina raised concerns about the lack of a Category 4 or 5 protection system for New Orleans, with discussions on the role of coastal wetlands restoration in reducing vulnerability. Congressional authorization would be required to build a more protective system beyond the current Category 3 level. The discussions surrounding regional navigation improvements and storm surge vulnerability raise policy issues on investment levels for protection against low probability-high consequences events. The Corps' cost estimates for levee and floodwall restoration in coastal Louisiana and increased protection for New Orleans range from $1.6 billion to $3.5 billion. State officials estimate Category 5 protection and wetlands restoration costs for all of coastal Louisiana as high as $32 billion. Local stakeholders advocate for including coastal wetlands restoration in hurricane protection plans. Discussions continue on improving hurricane protection for New Orleans and coastal Louisiana post-Hurricane Katrina. Various options are being considered, including infrastructure improvements, wetlands restoration, buyouts of flood-prone structures, flood-proofing, and enhancements to the flood insurance program. Understanding the failures of the hurricane protection system is crucial for addressing vulnerabilities, coastal wetlands loss, and city rebuilding efforts. The Corps is working on moving beyond mere repairs to reduce vulnerabilities in the system. The Corps is proceeding with repairs to failed floodwalls and breaches in New Orleans to meet the June 2006 deadline for hurricane season. Congressional oversight on hurricane protection for New Orleans and coastal areas will likely continue as decisions are made on the level of protection and cost responsibilities. Federal funding history for the Lake Pontchartrain project is detailed in Table A-1, excluding non-federal sponsors responsible for construction expenses and maintenance costs. The Corps has authority to reprogram funds across construction projects during the fiscal year, with the Year End Work Allowance representing the final enacted amount. The Orleans Avenue and London Avenue components of the Lake Pontchartrain project were no longer included in annual budget requests starting in Fiscal Year 1994. Congress provided more funding than requested for the project. When Hurricane Katrina hit, floodwalls along the canals were complete, but work remained on floodproofing bridges and extending floodwalls across pumping stations. Funding for Orleans Avenue and London Avenue parallel protection was not determined by CRS due to lack of information."
