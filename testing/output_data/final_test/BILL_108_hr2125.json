    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Rite of Passage Community Service Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The teenage years are crucial for shaping future outcomes. How young people spend their time during this period can lead to either active citizenship or risky behavior. Research shows that helping others can empower youth to improve their own lives. With proper training and supervision, teenagers can make a significant impact in their communities through volunteer service, potentially becoming a rite of passage for future generations. The National Academy of Sciences Report on Youth Development emphasizes the importance of raising skilled, competent, and responsible adults for the future well-being of the country. The purpose of the Act is to create a national network of service programs for middle school students to serve in their communities, participate in leadership development workshops, and reinforce their connection to the community. The Act aims to create a national network of service programs for middle school students to serve in their communities, participate in leadership development workshops, and instill an ethic of service in young people for a lifetime. The Act introduces a Rite of Passage Community Service Program for middle school students to engage in community service and leadership development. A community-based Rite of Passage after school and summer service corps program is established under the National and Community Service Act of 1990. It offers young people the opportunity to perform service in their communities, participate in leadership development activities, receive training in critical skills, and engage in service-learning linked to academic goals. The Rite of Passage program under the National and Community Service Act of 1990 allows individuals aged 12 to 16 to participate in community-based service projects and receive mentorship from older AmeriCorps members. An individual participating in a Rite of Passage community-based after school or summer service corps program must commit to at least 150 hours over 2 months to 1 year. Individuals participating in a Rite of Passage community-based after school or summer service corps program must complete 150 hours of service to receive a $500 education award. Amendments allow eligibility for programs described in section 122(a)(15) and 12572(a). The Corporation for National and Community Service must provide a report and evaluation of the program authorized by this Act to Congress by March 1 of the first 3 years after the enactment of the Act."
