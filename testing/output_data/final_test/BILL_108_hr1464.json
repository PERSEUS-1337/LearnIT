    "content": "The \"Immigration Security and Efficiency Enhancement Act of 2003\" aims to improve security and efficiency in immigration services through electronic application processes. The Secretary of Homeland Security must submit a plan to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment for implementing security and efficiency enhancements in immigration services. This includes establishing a central computer database, identifying forms for electronic submission, and conducting a pilot project for electronic submission of designated applications. The Act mandates the gradual transition to electronic submission of designated immigration applications and forms, starting at 25% within 4-5 years, increasing to 50% within 6 years, and reaching 75% within 8 years of enactment. The Secretary of Homeland Security will implement electronic submission for designated immigration applications and forms, with limitations on applications by felons or illegal residents. An annual report on the progress of the plan will be submitted to Congress. The annual report will detail the progress and any changes in the plan's projections. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish an electronic file management system for immigration, refugee, asylum, and naturalization functions. This system will efficiently process electronically submitted files, detect errors, and securely share information within the network. Additionally, a filing system will be established through certified service providers. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a system for electronic filing of applications from certified organizations and entities for immigration and naturalization services. Criteria and procedures will be developed for certifying service providers, with a focus on promoting competition and preventing monopolies. Regulations will be promulgated for the certification process. The Department of Homeland Security will establish regulations for certifying service providers, including criteria such as submission security, quality control, user identification verification, and logistical capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security can provide grants to nonprofit service providers for obtaining electronic technologies compatible with immigration functions. The National Records Center will maintain an electronic database of closed files related to immigration to expedite record requests. Appropriations are authorized for implementing this Act."
