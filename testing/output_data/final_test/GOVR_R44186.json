    "content": "This report discusses appropriations for the components of the Department of Homeland Security included in the homeland security appropriations bill for FY2016. It covers the Office of the Secretary, Executive Management, Under Secretary for Management, DHS headquarters consolidation project, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, Analysis and Operations, and Inspector General. Congress has labeled these components as \"Departmental Management and Operations.\" The report compares the Administration's FY2016 request with the appropriations proposed by Congress and enacted so far. The report on homeland security appropriations for FY2016 includes information on provisions throughout the proposed bills that directly affect DHS functions. It tracks legislative action and congressional issues related to discretionary funding amounts, but does not analyze mandatory funding or other legislation related to DHS programs. The discussion involves specialized budgetary concepts explained in the appendix of CRS Report R44053. The curr_chunk discusses terms related to appropriations process, budget authority, and calculations for homeland security appropriations. It references CRS Report R42388 and the Government Accountability Office's glossary for further information. Amounts in CRS reports are rounded to the nearest million, but unrounded data is used for precision in percentages and totals. Data for FY2015 amounts are derived from the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 114-4). The curr_chunk provides information on the sources of data used for analyzing DHS appropriations, including the FY2016 budget request, recommended funding levels from Senate and House reports, and enacted appropriations. It references various legislative documents such as P.L. 114-113 and S.Rept. 114-68. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) allocates annual funding for DHS operations, with discretionary appropriations making up the majority of the budget. The bill is organized into five thematic titles covering different departmental components. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 allocates annual funding for DHS operations through five thematic titles. Title I provides funding for department management activities, Analysis and Operations account, and the Office of the Inspector General. Departmental Management and Operations components make up about 3% of the discretionary appropriations requested for DHS for FY2016. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $1,546 million for Title I components in FY2016, an increase of $405 million (35.5%) from FY2015 and $150 million (10.7%) more than the requested amount. The enacted funding levels for Departmental Management and Operations components for FY2015 and FY2016 are compared, including amounts requested by the Administration, recommended by Senate and House appropriations committees, and provided by the enacted annual appropriation for FY2016.

The House and Senate Appropriations Committees discussed issues related to departmental management and administration in the FY2016 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill. These issues included acquisition matters and the implementation of a common appropriations structure, which were related to the department's Unity of Effort initiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed DHS to provide a briefing on procurement process metrics within 120 days, while the House Appropriations Committee noted the USM's role as the Department's Chief. The House Appropriations Committee report directed the USM to develop written guidance by April 1, 2016, to clarify roles and responsibilities for overseeing program management of major IT acquisition programs, provide cost estimates for operations and maintenance, track adherence to cost estimates, and enter data into the next generation Period Reporting System on a quarterly basis. The House Appropriations Committee directed the Executive Director of PARM to provide quarterly briefings on major acquisition programs by component starting April 15, 2016. Both Senate and House Appropriations Committees discussed potential reform of the DHS budget structure. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted the need to strengthen DHS budget processes to address significant disparities and inconsistencies in appropriations accounts. The lack of transparency and uniformity in budgeting makes it difficult to compare costs and track fund utilization. The DHS presented a common appropriations structure with four standard types of appropriations and specific periods of availability. The Senate Appropriations Committee emphasized the importance of transparency in tracking funds from planning to execution for departmental oversight and resource allocation. The House Appropriations Committee supports the common appropriations structure proposed by DHS, stating it enables cost comparisons and simplifies the transition to modernized systems. They mandated the implementation of this structure in the fiscal year 2017 budget request and directed DHS to develop a standard template for budget justifications based on this structure for the FY2018 budget request. The House Appropriations Committee mandated the implementation of a common appropriations structure proposed by DHS in the FY2017 budget request. They directed DHS to develop a standard template for budget justifications based on this structure for the FY2018 budget request, starting from a zero base and including comparison tables for appropriations and obligations. The new general provision authorized the Secretary to include an account structure in the budget justification. The general provision establishes a timeline, procedures, and requirements for the Secretary to transfer and reprogram funds into the new structure, including materials to be submitted by the CFO by April 1, 2016. This includes technical assistance on new legislative language, tables comparing funding across fiscal years, comparisons across components, a revised financial management policy manual, proposed changes to requirements for transfers and reprogramming, and CFO certification. The Department of Homeland Security is working to consolidate its headquarters, currently spread across 50 locations in the Washington, DC area. This fragmentation leads to inefficiencies and increased costs. Efforts are being made to unify headquarters functions and reduce these issues. The Department of Homeland Security and General Services Administration approved a $3.4 billion plan to create a new DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeths in Anacostia, the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters, has been completed. Funding requests have been made for consolidation of other offices to save on lease costs. DHS and GSA requested $204 million and $380 million for the FY2016 funding of a revised plan for DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths. The new plan reduces cost and size, providing 3.6 billion square feet of office space at $3.7 billion. It will house 3,000 additional personnel, totaling 17,000. The requested funding for DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths would support perimeter security, road access improvements, building rehabilitation, and construction to accommodate 40% more personnel. The total request for headquarters consolidation is almost $216 million, with $212 million allocated in Senate-reported S. 1619. The Senate committee report includes funding for DHS headquarters consolidation at St. Elizabeths, with a requirement for an expenditure plan and quarterly briefings. The project aims to consolidate 32,000 employees from 50 locations into a more affordable enhanced plan. The Department now has a more affordable enhanced plan for the St. Elizabeths project, with cost savings and avoidance. The House-reported H.R. 3128 includes funding for DHS headquarters consolidation, with significant savings over 30 years compared to relying on multiple rented facilities. The recommendation provides funding for the DHS headquarters consolidation at the consolidated headquarters location, with almost $216 million allocated for the project, including over $3 million for security services. The department must submit an expenditure plan within 90 days of the act's enactment. The total funding provided in FY2016 for this project is $557 million, representing the largest tranche of funding for DHS headquarters consolidation. The project receives the largest funding for DHS headquarters consolidation since 2009, including resources for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Office of Operations Coordination. I&A manages the DHS intelligence enterprise and shares intelligence information with various partners. The Office of Operations Coordination develops and coordinates departmental and interagency operations plans, including managing the National Operations Center. The National Operations Center is the main hub for domestic incident management and operations coordination, combining law enforcement, intelligence, emergency response, and private sector information. The Administration requested $269 million for the Analysis and Operations account, with the Senate recommending $263 million. The committee required a briefing on the expenditure plan within 60 days of enactment. DHS was also directed to continue briefings on state and local fusion centers, with a focus on establishing a state-level \"center of excellence\" for threats assessment. The feasibility of establishing a state-level \"center of excellence\" focusing on cybersecurity and critical infrastructure threats in the United States is being considered. The center aims to enhance partnerships for threat information sharing among federal, state, and private sector entities. House-reported H.R. 3128 recommended $265 million for Analysis and Operations, slightly below the Administration's request. Additionally, $300,000 was allocated for enhancing the Criminal Intelligence Enterprise to identify and prioritize threat groups. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that audits and investigates department activities to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. It is required to report to Congress and the Secretary of DHS. The Administration requested $142 million for the OIG, $24 million more than the previous appropriation. The DHS OIG received a $142 million appropriation, with an additional $24 million requested for oversight of disaster relief activities. The OIG's initial budget request was larger than what was ultimately approved, with reductions made during the budget formulation process. The DHS OIG requested additional funding for high-risk areas in DHS, citing historical underfunding. The Senate-reported bill allocated $134 million, slightly below the request, while the House-reported bill allocated $141 million, slightly below the request. Both bills included a transfer from the DRF for disaster relief oversight activities. The omnibus bill included a $137 million appropriation for the DHS OIG, slightly below the requested amount but higher than the previous year. Issues surrounding the DHS OIG impact the broader oversight community and are discussed in detail in CRS reports."
