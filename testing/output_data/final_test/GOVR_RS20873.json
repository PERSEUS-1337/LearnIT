    "content": "Teen pregnancy, abortion, and birth rates in the U.S. have decreased since 1991. However, there was a slight increase in the teen birth rate from 2005 to 2007, but it dropped in 2008. The teen pregnancy rate also increased in 2006 but is still lower than in 1991. Despite the decline, the U.S. still has higher teen pregnancy rates compared to other industrialized nations. In 2009, a significant percentage of 9th graders reported having sexual intercourse. In 2009, a significant percentage of 9th graders reported having sexual intercourse. The corresponding statistics for older teens were 41% for 10th graders, 53% for 11th graders, and 62% for 12th graders. About 20% of female teens who have had sexual intercourse become pregnant each year. Views on sex and young people vary, with some advocating for abstinence and others focusing on the negative consequences of sexual activity like unintended pregnancy and STDs. The Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program supports both prevention and support services for pregnant or parenting teens, while the Abstinence Education program promotes abstinence-only messages. The AFL program, enacted in 1981, focuses on adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting. It promotes family involvement, abstinence, adoption, parenting education, and comprehensive health services. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, it was the only federal program addressing these issues until 1996. The AFL program focuses on adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting by providing grants for projects that offer care and prevention services. It aims to help pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, and their families improve their life prospects. Currently, the program supports 52 demonstration projects nationwide. The AFL program supports 52 demonstration projects nationwide, providing comprehensive health, education, and social services through partnerships with community agencies. Projects are based in various settings and focus on care and prevention services for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents. The AFL program funds 21 abstinence-only projects aimed at adolescents to promote sexual abstinence until marriage. Projects target students aged 9 to 14 in schools, community settings, and households, with parental involvement to reinforce the message. Each project includes internal evaluations and research grants on adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting. The AFL program funds research projects on adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting, including factors influencing teenage behaviors. The 1996 welfare reform law allocated $250 million for abstinence education, requiring states to match federal funds. The Title V abstinence-only education block grant receives annual funding of at least $87.5 million. The latest extension in P.L. 110-275 continued funding through June 30, 2009. P.L. 105-33 included funding for a scientific evaluation of abstinence education programs. The law stipulated that abstinence education programs must exclusively teach the benefits of abstaining from sexual activity. The Title V abstinence-only education block grant receives annual funding of at least $87.5 million. In FY2008, only 28 states and 2 territories sponsored an abstinence education program, emphasizing the benefits of abstaining from sexual activity outside of marriage to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancy, STDs, and associated health problems. In FY2008, $28 million of the possible $50 million in Title V Abstinence Education block grant funds was expended. Abstinence education programs focus on influencing attitudes and behavior through media campaigns, curricula development, and other activities. State funding is based on the proportion of low-income children in the state compared to the national total. Federal mandatory abstinence education funding in FY2008 ranged from $88,991 in North Dakota to $4,777,916 in Texas. In FY2009, $23 million of $37.5 million was spent on the Title V Abstinence Education block grant program. P.L. 111-148 restored funding to the previous annual level of $50 million. The Title V Abstinence Education block grant was funded at $50 million annually for FY2010-FY2014. Previous legislation provided varying amounts of funding for abstinence education programs, increasing from $20 million in FY2001 to $100 million in later years. The Community-Based Abstinence Education (CBAE) program received varying funding amounts from $100 million in FY2005 to $95 million in FY2009. President Bush supported abstinence-only education, emphasizing the importance of abstinence for a healthier future. During his presidential campaign, funding for abstinence education was proposed to match the amount allocated for teen contraception services, totaling around $135 million annually. In FY2009, abstinence education received $149.8 million in funding from various programs, including $37.5 million for state block grants, $13.1 million for AFL projects, $94.7 million for the CBAE program, and $4.5 million for program evaluation. Abstinence-only funding for FY2010 was set at $50 million under P.L. 111-148. In FY2010, abstinence-only education projects did not receive funding under the AFL prevention program. A 1997 survey showed that 51% of public school districts taught abstinence as the preferred option for teenagers but also allowed discussion about contraception, while 35% taught abstinence as the only option outside of marriage with limited or no discussion of contraception. Advocates of abstinence education argue for a clear message that sex outside of marriage is harmful to physical and emotional health. They believe in empowering youth to say no to sex and view supporting both abstinence and birth control as hypocritical. Research shows that teens who pledge abstinence delay sex longer than those who do not make such a commitment. A study on abstinence-only intervention for African-American students in grades 6 and 7 found that 34% of participants engaged in sexual intercourse, compared to 49% in the control group. Advocates argue for abstinence as the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy and STDs, while others advocate for comprehensive sex education to equip youth with information and decision-making skills. Supporters of abstinence-only education argue that it allows young people to make informed decisions about relationships, resist peer pressure, and learn about contraception and STD prevention. They claim that abstinence-only messages do not protect against pregnancy and disease for sexually active individuals. Studies have shown that teens who break their virginity pledges are less likely to use contraception. The effectiveness of abstinence-only programs has been questioned, with evaluations showing no significant differences in sexual behavior between participants and nonparticipants. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget did not provide funding for abstinence education programs, including the Title V Abstinence Education Block Grant and Community-Based Abstinence Education program. Some comprehensive sexual education programs have been successful in delaying sexual activity and preventing teen pregnancy. The Consolidated Appropriations for FY2010 includes a new $110 million discretionary teenage pregnancy prevention program, with an additional $4.5 million for evaluations. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget proposed $200 million for teen pregnancy prevention initiatives. Teen pregnancy prevention initiatives for FY2011 include $129 million for the new TPP program, $50 million in mandatory funds for a formula grant program, $17 million for AFL \"care\" demonstration grants and research programs, and $4 million for evaluations. Additionally, the health care reform law established a new state formula grant program with $75 million annually for each of FY2010-FY2014 for the Personal Responsibility Education program, totaling $375 million over five years. This program educates adolescents on abstinence and contraception to prevent pregnancy. The P.L. 111-148 educates adolescents on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation subjects. It restored funding to the Title V Abstinence Education formula block grant at $50 million annually for FY2010-FY2014."
