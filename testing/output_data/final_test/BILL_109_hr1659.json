    "content": "The Navajo Nation Higher Education Act of 2004 may be cited as the ``Navajo Nation Higher Education Act of 2004''. Congressional findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the Treaty of 1868 between the United States and the Navajo Tribe provides for education, leading to the creation of Navajo Community College in 1968. Congress enacted the Navajo Community College Act in 1971, and in 1997, the college was renamed Dine College to provide educational opportunities for the Navajo people and promote economic and social development. Dine College's mission is to advance student learning through Dine Philosophy principles, including thinking, planning, living, and assurance. It focuses on studying the Dine language, history, philosophy, and culture, preparing students for further studies and employment in a multicultural world, and promoting social responsibility and community service for the well-being of the Navajo Nation. The United States has a trust and treaty responsibility to provide educational opportunities for the Navajo Nation, as significant portions of Dine College's infrastructure are dilapidated and pose health and safety risks. This Act aligns with Executive Orders on tribal colleges and universities and fulfills the government's duty to serve the educational needs of the Navajo people. SEC. 3.
