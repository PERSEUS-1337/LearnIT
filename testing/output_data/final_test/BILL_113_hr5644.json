    "content": "The \"Medicare CGM Access Act of 2014\" allows for Medicare coverage of continuous glucose monitoring devices for qualified individuals. The term 'continuous glucose monitoring device' refers to a class III medical device approved by the FDA that continuously monitors glucose levels. It can be a stand-alone product, integrated with an insulin pump, or part of another FDA-approved medical device like artificial pancreas systems. The Secretary treats an insulin pump or other device with a continuous glucose monitoring device as a single medical device. The term 'CGM qualified individual' refers to someone with Type I diabetes following an intensive insulin regimen, certified by their physician as unable to manage their condition effectively with self-monitoring of blood glucose. This includes necessary components like sensors, transmitters, receivers, and software for class III medical devices. Individuals who are unable to achieve optimal glycemic control or have experienced hypoglycemia unawareness may qualify for a continuous glucose monitoring device. Other medical criteria specified by the Secretary may also qualify individuals for this device. Additionally, individuals with diabetes who have been regularly using a continuous glucose monitoring device before enrolling in Medicare may also be eligible. The text chunk discusses the frequency of certification by an attending physician for continuous glucose monitoring devices under Medicare. It also mentions amendments to payment regulations for these devices, including the amount paid being 80 percent of the fee schedule. The new subsection establishes a fee schedule for continuous glucose monitoring devices under Medicare, including devices with CGM as an integral component. The new subsection establishes an initial payment rate for continuous glucose monitoring devices under Medicare, based on market rates and recent price data. The Secretary will establish new HCPCS codes for different types of class III medical devices, including continuous glucose monitoring devices, based on FDA classifications. The Secretary will establish new HCPCS codes for class III medical devices, including continuous glucose monitoring devices, and provide annual payment rate updates based on the consumer price index. Geographic price variations will also be considered in payment rate adjustments. The Secretary will establish new HCPCS codes for class III medical devices, including continuous glucose monitoring devices, and provide annual payment rate updates based on the consumer price index.
