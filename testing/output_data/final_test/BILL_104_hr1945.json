The property must be open to the public for a substantial portion of the year, with specific visitation requirements. The tax treatment of qualified historic property held by a corporation is outlined, with stock in the corporation considered qualified historic property if all stock was held by the decedent or their family. Additional estate tax may be imposed if there is a disposition of the property within a 20-year period.

However, no tax is imposed if the new owner agrees to be bound by the agreement and liable for any tax. The amount of additional tax is determined based on the property in question. An additional estate tax is imposed on the disposition or violation of qualified historic property.

Any person, except the executor, signing the agreement is personally liable for the tax. Rules similar to sections 2013(f) and 2032A(f) apply. Section 2055(f) does not apply to property with a deduction under subsection (a). Technical amendments are made.
