    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Quiet Communities Act of 1999\". Congress finds that approximately 28 million Americans suffer from hearing loss, with 10 million cases attributed to noise exposure. Chronic noise exposure can lead to sleep loss, psychological and physiological damage, cardiovascular disorders, learning deficits in children, stress, and diminished quality of life. Excessive noise also impacts worker productivity. The Environmental Protection Agency established an Office of Noise Abatement and Control to regulate noise emissions and promote noise education. However, funding for the office was terminated in 1982, leaving the agency responsible for enforcing noise regulations without adequate resources. The Noise Control Act of 1972 prohibited State and local governments from regulating noise sources, leading to dormant noise abatement programs across the country. With population growth and increased air and vehicular traffic, noise pollution is expected to worsen in the future. The Environmental Protection Agency should take a leading role in combating noise pollution for the health and welfare of citizens. The Noise Control Act of 1972 led to dormant noise abatement programs. The Environmental Protection Agency should reestablish the Office of Noise Abatement and Control to combat future noise pollution. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will reestablish an Office of Noise Abatement and Control with duties including promoting state and local noise control programs, conducting national noise research, and assessing noise environmental impacts. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control will develop and disseminate information on noise effects and control methods, provide educational materials and training programs for state and local noise control efforts, and establish regional technical assistance centers. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control will focus on assisting State and local noise control programs, assessing the effectiveness of the Noise Control Act of 1972, and conducting a study on airport noise through contracts with independent scientists. The emphasis will be on noise abatement approaches involving local and State activities, market incentives, and coordination with other agencies. The Federal Aviation Administration will conduct a study on noise measurement methodologies, health impacts, and effectiveness of noise abatement programs at airports. A report with recommendations on mitigating aircraft noise's impact on communities will be submitted to Congress within 24 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. GRANTS UNDER QUIET COMMUNITIES PROGRAM.\n\nAmends the Noise Control Act of 1972 to include establishing training programs on noise abatement equipment and implementing noise abatement plans.\n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAuthorizes $21,000,000 for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control for fiscal years 2000 through 2004."
