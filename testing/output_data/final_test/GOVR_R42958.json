    "content": "The unauthorized alien population, estimated at over 11 million, is a public policy challenge that may gain urgency in 2013 with potential immigration reform. Despite concerns, little discussion has focused on the diverse circumstances of this population, including those with U.S. citizen or LPR sponsors seeking legal status. This variety in status-related circumstances among unauthorized aliens highlights the need for attention in immigration reform policy. The discussion on targeted immigration relief for unauthorized aliens focuses on limiting eligibility for legal status. This relief can include temporary or permanent immigration status without granting LPR status. The report analyzes components of the unauthorized population and discusses policy options for providing relief to selected subgroups of interest. Estimates by the Department of Homeland Security and the Pew Hispanic Center put the unauthorized resident alien population at around 11 million in 2011, including individuals with temporary authorization but no legal status. The unauthorized alien population in the United States includes asylum applicants and individuals with Temporary Protected Status. DHS estimated that 85% of unauthorized immigrants entered before 2005, with Pew reporting 8.0 million unauthorized aliens in the labor force in 2010. Pew also found that about half of unauthorized adults were in families with minor children in 2010. In 2010, about 5 million individuals were in families with minor children, including 1 million unauthorized alien children and 4.5 million U.S.-born children with at least one unauthorized parent. At least 9 million adults and children were in mixed-status families. Unauthorized aliens face challenges in obtaining legal status and employment under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Nonimmigrants are the main category of legal temporary admissions. Nonimmigrants, such as tourists, foreign students, and temporary workers, are the main category of legal temporary admissions. Immigrants, or legal permanent residents, consist of family-based and employment-based admissions, as well as humanitarian cases. Some foreign nationals in the U.S. may lack the necessary family or employment relationships to obtain permanent resident status. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) outlines grounds of inadmissibility for foreign nationals seeking visas and admission to the United States. These grounds include health, security, terrorism, illegal entry, public charge, and other issues. Some grounds may be waived as specified in the INA. Key provisions in current immigration systems address admissibility criteria. The Immigration and Nationality Act outlines grounds of inadmissibility for foreign nationals seeking admission to the United States. Current law provides pathways for some unauthorized residents to obtain legal status, but not all. Nonimmigrants are admitted for a temporary period and specific purpose, typically from abroad. The INA allows lawfully admitted nonimmigrants to change classifications within the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows lawfully admitted nonimmigrants in the United States to change classifications, with exceptions and conditions. Unauthorized aliens can sometimes obtain legal nonimmigrant status through waivers for certain categories like victims of trafficking or abuse. Additionally, eligible T and U nonimmigrants can obtain LPR status under special provisions. The V category allows certain LPR spouses and children with pending immigrant visa petitions or applications to adjust status in the United States without having to go abroad. V nonimmigrants need to adjust status under existing law, unlike T and U nonimmigrants. The INA provides for family-based immigration and specified workers to be admitted as LPRs. Family-based and employment-based immigration to the United States for permanent residence as LPRs involves a complex process with preference categories and numerical limits. Sponsors must file an immigrant visa petition with USCIS, and visa availability can be delayed due to numerical limits and allocation among preference categories and countries of origin. When a visa number becomes immediately available, aliens can apply for assignment of a visa number. Visa applicants abroad undergo admissibility checks. Those issued visas become LPRs upon entry to the US. Aliens eligible for adjustment of status in the US do not need to go through the visa application process but are subject to admissibility checks. Unauthorized aliens in the US have limited opportunities to adjust to LPR status. Applying for a visa abroad may have risks. Family-based immigrants are defined in the INA by category, with top priority given to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, including children, spouses, and parents if the citizen is at least age 21. Immediate relatives are admitted outside the preference system and do not have to wait for a visa number. Other family-based immigrants are categorized by preference, such as unmarried adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, spouses and children of LPRs, married adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, and brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens. Employment-based immigration follows a ranked system similar to family-based immigration, with five preference categories: priority workers, professionals with advanced degrees, skilled workers, special immigrants, and employment creation investors. The process for employment-based immigrants is similar to family-based immigrants but may require an additional step. An employer must first apply for labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor before filing an immigrant petition for an alien. Labor certification confirms the need for alien workers and ensures they will not negatively impact U.S. workers. Aliens in the U.S. when a visa number is available may adjust to LPR status without leaving the country, following eligibility requirements outlined in Section 245 of the INA. An immigrant visa holder who is admissible to the United States and has an immigrant visa number immediately available may be eligible to adjust status under INA \u00a7245(a). However, certain aliens, including those in unlawful immigration status, are generally ineligible. INA \u00a7245(i) provides limited exceptions for unauthorized aliens to adjust status if they meet certain criteria. To be eligible for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7245(i), an alien must have a family-based petition or labor certification filed by April 30, 2001. Having a pending adjustment application allows for an authorized period of stay, eligibility for employment authorization, and no accrual of unlawful presence. However, it does not provide protection from removal. In considering relief options for aliens, the judge may assess admissibility based on INA grounds of inadmissibility. Some grounds relate to entry without proper documentation, including lack of DOL labor certification for certain employment-based immigrants. Inadmissibility grounds also address illegal presence, such as INA \u00a7212(a)(6)(A) for aliens present in the US without proper documentation. The INA includes provisions for inadmissibility based on illegal presence in the US, such as the 3- and 10-year bars for aliens who were unlawfully present. These bars apply to all aliens except LPRs, and determine admissibility based on the length of unlawful presence and time of seeking admission. The INA includes provisions for inadmissibility based on illegal presence in the US, such as the 3- and 10-year bars for aliens who were unlawfully present. These bars apply to all aliens except LPRs and determine admissibility based on the length of unlawful presence and time of seeking admission. Some grounds of inadmissibility have exceptions and may be waived, as specified in the INA, including exceptions for certain battered aliens and minors under 18. An alien found inadmissible under \u00a7212(a)(9)(B) may be eligible for a discretionary waiver if they can prove extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent. The immigration system offers various pathways to legal status for unauthorized aliens, including nonimmigrant admissions and family or employment-based admissions. Special rules regarding INA grounds of inadmissibility apply to these provisions. The INA provisions of registry, asylum, and cancellation of removal offer pathways to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status for long-resident unauthorized aliens. The registry provision allows aliens who have continuously resided in the US since before January 1, 1972, to acquire LPR status. Asylum is available to any alien in the US, regardless of status, as a form of humanitarian relief. To apply for asylum in the United States, aliens must show persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on specific criteria. Asylum allows aliens to live and work legally in the US and potentially adjust to LPR status after one year. Cancellation of removal is a discretionary relief option that can lead to LPR status for certain nonpermanent residents. Cancellation of removal is a form of relief for nonpermanent residents in the United States who are inadmissible or deportable. To qualify, the alien must have been continuously present in the US for 10 years and show that their removal would cause exceptional hardship to their family. There is a cap of 4,000 grants per fiscal year. This relief can lead to legal permanent or nonimmigrant status for eligible unauthorized aliens. Blanket relief, also known as \"quasi-legal\" status, is provided for humanitarian purposes to certain designated classes or on a case-by-case basis. This relief is granted administratively by the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security and allows individuals to apply for employment authorization. Common forms of blanket relief include extended voluntary departure (EVD) and deferred departure or deferred enforced departure (DED), which have been given to deportable aliens of various nationalities. Currently, certain Liberians in the United States have Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), which, along with Extended Voluntary Departure (EVD), does not grant legal status. Legislation in the past has granted Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status to certain groups with EVD. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) can also be authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security for designated foreign states in specific situations. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) can be granted to individuals from designated foreign states in cases of armed conflict or environmental disaster for 6 to 18 months, with possible extensions. Eligible aliens must report to USCIS, pay a fee, and receive registration documents and work authorization. Countries currently designated for TPS include El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Syria. Congressional restrictions limit legal immigration status for TPS holders. Relief from removal can be granted on a case-by-case basis through deferred action. Deferred action is a discretionary procedure that provides relief to individuals on a case-by-case basis for a specific period of time. Those granted deferred action may apply for employment authorization. The accrual of unlawful presence stops when deferred action is granted and resumes when it is terminated. DHS and INS have used deferred action to provide relief to specific groups, such as battered aliens. The INS issued a guidance memorandum on deferred action for battered aliens self-petitioning for immigrant status under the VAWA. DHS established DACA for unauthorized aliens who arrived as children. Parole-in-place, a form of case-by-case relief, allows unauthorized aliens to temporarily enter the US for humanitarian reasons or public benefit. It has been used to help military service members' spouses and children adjust status in recent years. Unauthorized aliens can adjust status in the United States under INA \u00a7245(a) if paroled into the country. The unauthorized alien population is diverse, entering in various ways with different connections to the US. Factors affecting their treatment and status prospects include how they entered the country. Unauthorized aliens enter the United States in three main ways: visa overstays, fraudulent documents, and illegal entry. It is unknown what percentages of the current unauthorized resident population entered the United States in these different ways. Researchers have tried to determine this in the past. Approximately 40% to 50% of unauthorized aliens in the US entered with inspection, while the rest entered without inspection. Visa overstays and illegal entrants are both unauthorized aliens but treated differently under immigration law. Illegal entrants face inadmissibility under INA \u00a7212(a)(6), while both face 3- and 10-year bars under INA \u00a7212(a)(9). Adjustment of status provisions differ for illegal entrants and visa overstays, impacting future status prospects. To obtain LPR status under INA \u00a7245(a), an alien must have been inspected or paroled into the United States. Visa overstays can adjust status, while illegal entrants cannot. Exceptions exist for visa overstays marrying a U.S. citizen. Illegal entrants must leave the U.S. and apply for a visa. Unlawful presence can lead to inadmissibility under the 3- or 10-year bars. The length of an alien's unlawful presence in the United States may affect their ability to obtain immigration benefits and relief. Unlawfully present aliens for more than 180 days but less than one year face inadmissibility if they seek admission within three years of departure. Those unlawfully present for one year or more face a 10-year inadmissibility period. Unauthorized aliens with 180 days or less of unlawful presence are not subject to these bars. Some immigration relief options require a multi-year presence, such as cancellation of removal/adjustment of status for certain nonpermanent residents. The pathway for unauthorized aliens in the United States to become LPRs involves continuous physical presence for 10 years. Family-based immigration is a common route, requiring a close relationship with a U.S. citizen or LPR. Special provisions and exceptions in immigration law can benefit close relatives of U.S. citizens and LPRs. Exceptions to adjustment of status requirements in immigration law benefit unauthorized aliens in the United States with close relationships to U.S. citizens or LPRs. For example, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are exempt from certain provisions that restrict adjustment of status for those who engage in unauthorized employment. Additionally, unauthorized aliens may be eligible for relief such as cancellation of removal if they can prove exceptional hardship to their citizen or LPR family members. Unauthorized aliens in the United States can apply for discretionary waivers to overcome inadmissibility bars, such as the 3- and 10-year bars due to unlawful presence. They can also seek legal permanent residency through employment-based immigration, particularly the third preference category for skilled workers, professionals, and unskilled workers, which requires an employer sponsor and labor certification. The third preference category for skilled workers, professionals, and unskilled workers in employment-based immigration has special provisions for adjustment of status for aliens who entered the U.S. legally and violated their admission terms. This provision allows certain prospective employment-based immigrants to adjust status in the United States under specific conditions. The United States has provisions for aliens who fail to maintain lawful immigration status or engage in unauthorized employment within 180 days of legal admission. INA grounds of inadmissibility and deportability, including criminal offenses and security concerns, impact eligibility for immigration relief. Some relief options have specific requirements related to these grounds, such as cancellation of removal/adjustment of status for nonpermanent residents. The INA provisions on granting asylum explicitly exclude aliens based on criminal- or security-related concerns, including terrorist activity and serious crimes. Individuals in the unauthorized alien population can be grouped into various status-related categories based on factors discussed earlier. These subgroups reflect aliens' current status and available avenues for immigration relief. The unauthorized alien population can be grouped into subgroups based on their current status and available avenues for immigration relief. This includes individuals with approved or pending family-based or employment-based immigrant petitions who may be able to adjust status in the United States or apply for a visa in their home country, potentially facing a 3- or 10-year bar on admission. Other potential beneficiaries are unauthorized parents of individuals with existing family relationships. Unauthorized parents of U.S. citizen children may be able to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status in the United States if they entered legally. However, if they entered without inspection, they would need to return to their home countries to apply for a visa. Battered spouses, children, and parents of U.S. citizens or LPRs have special provisions under the INA to self-petition for immigrant status and adjust their status. Aliens can self-petition for immigrant status and adjust status under the main INA provision, regardless of legal entry. Those self-petitioning for LPR status are eligible for employment authorization. Battered spouses and children have a special cancellation of removal rule to obtain LPR status. Asylum seekers in the US can apply for asylum and may remain during the process. Successful asylum applicants can adjust to LPR status after one year. Aliens with TPS or temporary relief may also have options for adjustment. Aliens with TPS or other temporary relief from removal have protection from removal and can receive employment authorization, but are not granted legal immigration status. Some groups, like those with EVD and DED, have been able to adjust to LPR status under legislative enactments. However, TPS recipients face statutory restrictions on obtaining legal immigration status, requiring a three-fifths vote of all Senators. This subgroup includes unauthorized aliens eligible for special provisions in the INA for a pathway to legal status. The INA provides pathways to legal status for certain unauthorized aliens in the United States, including those eligible for T or U nonimmigrant visas, special immigrant juveniles (SIJ) program, and other subgroups without an affirmative pathway to legal immigration status. Unauthorized aliens in the United States may apply for cancellation of removal if they have a family connection, such as a citizen or LPR spouse, parent, or child. This process requires 10 years of continuous physical presence in the US and proof of exceptional hardship to their family member. If approved, their status is adjusted to that of an LPR. Unauthorized alien students brought to the US as children have been a focus of DREAM Act legislation for several Congresses. In 2012, DHS established DACA to provide temporary relief to certain unauthorized alien residents. There is ongoing discussion about developing policies to provide targeted relief to unauthorized aliens through legislative or administrative means. Policy discussions have focused on providing relief to different subgroups of the unauthorized population, including those with approved immigrant visa petitions and students brought to the US as children. Unauthorized aliens with approved family-based or employment-based immigrant visa petitions may face challenges in obtaining LPR status due to current laws. Those who are ineligible to adjust status and return to their home country for a visa may face inadmissibility to the US for 3 or 10 years based on prior unlawful presence. Unlawful presence of one year triggers a 10-year inadmissibility bar for immigrant visas. A waiver may be available for those found ineligible based on prior unlawful presence, especially for spouses or children of US citizens or LPRs facing extreme hardship. USCIS issued a rule in 2013 to streamline the immigration process for certain prospective immigrants with approved visa petitions. The rule aims to reduce separation time for U.S. citizens and their immediate relatives during consular processing. It allows beneficiaries of approved petitions to apply for a provisional waiver of unlawful presence while in the U.S. by demonstrating extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen spouse or parent. The final rule allows beneficiaries of approved petitions to apply for a provisional waiver of unlawful presence while in the U.S. The waiver grants indefinite relief for the period of unlawful presence once it takes full effect, facilitating the acquisition of LPR status for illegal entrants with approved family-based or employment-based immigrant petitions. Parole-in-place can be granted for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, allowing aliens to adjust status in the United States without traveling to their home countries. Legislation could provide relief to unauthorized aliens eligible for family-based or employment-based immigration. Modifying existing statutory barriers, such as the unlawful presence ground of inadmissibility, could be an option. Legislation could be enacted to enable illegal entrants with approved immigrant visa petitions to adjust status in the United States by updating INA \u00a7245(i) provisions. Legislation has been proposed to allow illegal entrants with approved immigrant visa petitions to adjust status in the United States by updating the April 30, 2001, cutoff date or making INA \u00a7245(i) permanent. This could include subsets of illegal entrants meeting different criteria, such as immediate family members of U.S. citizen or LPR military personnel or unauthorized aliens who came to the U.S. as children, addressed by the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act legislation aims to provide relief to unauthorized aliens by allowing them to adjust to LPR status in the United States through cancellation of removal. Successful applicants would first receive conditional LPR status and could become full-fledged LPRs after meeting additional requirements. Alternative versions of the DREAM Act have been introduced in Congress since 2011, with some proposals granting beneficiaries conditional nonimmigrant status. The DREAM Act legislation proposed granting beneficiaries conditional nonimmigrant status instead of conditional LPR status, with separate pathways to LPR status through military or higher education, each with specific eligibility requirements. For the higher education pathway, aliens would need to graduate from a four-year institution in the US to be eligible for LPR status. While legal immigration status for unauthorized aliens would require the DREAM Act or similar legislation, limited relief from removal could be provided. In June 2012, DHS established the DACA program for certain individuals brought to the US as children. Eligibility criteria include entering before age 16, continuous residency for at least five years, and meeting education or military requirements. Deferred action recipients can apply for relief from removal. The DACA program allows certain individuals brought to the US as children to apply for employment authorization, but it does not offer a pathway to legal immigration status. Legislation like the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act (AgJOBS) has been proposed in Congress to establish a legalization program for agricultural workers, allowing them to obtain legal permanent resident (LPR) status through a two-stage process with work requirements. Eligibility for temporary legal status in the first stage is based on demonstrating a certain amount of agricultural work. The proposal suggests a two-stage process for agricultural workers to obtain legal permanent resident status through work requirements. It also discusses the possibility of targeting unauthorized workers in other low-skilled industries and the need for foreign workers with graduate-level training in certain fields, particularly in STEM. The debate on creating STEM visas for foreign nationals with STEM degrees to adjust to LPR status is ongoing. STEM students initially enter the US on nonimmigrant visas, and discussions focus on facilitating their transition to LPR status. Unauthorized aliens among STEM graduates could be addressed in broader STEM legislation. Additionally, long-term holders of temporary protected status are also targeted for immigration relief. Aliens with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) can legally stay in the US and work, but these designations do not lead to legal immigration status or a pathway to permanent residency. Legislation has been proposed to help TPS and DED holders adjust to Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) status, with some DREAM Act bills extending coverage to TPS holders. DREAM Act bills aim to extend coverage to those with TPS, allowing them to apply for LPR status if they meet eligibility requirements. Legislation targeting Liberian nationals would also provide a pathway to LPR status for those meeting specific criteria. Developing similar laws for other long-term beneficiaries of temporary relief could offer new solutions for unauthorized immigration. Policymakers would need to make distinctions among unauthorized immigrants to determine appropriate relief options. Questions may arise regarding limiting legal status to those who qualify under current law, providing pathways to permanent and temporary legal status, and imposing numerical limits on new relief forms. Additionally, considerations include which subgroups of unauthorized aliens would not be covered by targeted relief options and the policies towards them."
