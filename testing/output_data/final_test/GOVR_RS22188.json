    "content": "The U.S. Constitution outlines the process for a bill to become law, requiring approval from both houses of Congress and the President's signature. The President has the power to veto a bill, sending it back to Congress with objections. Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds majority vote. During a 10-day period after a bill is presented to the President, he may refuse to sign it, resulting in a \"pocket\" veto. If Congress is out of session, they must reintroduce the bill as new legislation to circumvent the pocket veto. Congress can override a regular veto through a process outlined in the U.S. Constitution. After a bill is vetoed by the President, Congress can reconsider it by passing it with a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override the veto. There is no obligation for Congress to schedule an override vote, and a veto threat can influence Congress to modify legislation before presenting it to the President. The President can issue Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) to express views on a bill, coordinating with the Office of Management and Budget. SAPs indicate Administration support or opposition, with veto threats being the first formal indicator of intent to veto a bill. These statements are transmitted to Congress by the White House. Since 1789, 37 out of 44 Presidents have used their veto authority a total of 2,572 times. This includes 1,506 regular vetoes where legislation was returned to Congress with an explanation, and 1,066 pocket vetoes when Congress was adjourned. Congress has overridden 110 regular vetoes, with a higher override rate of 15.4% since 1961. George W. Bush was the first President since John Quincy Adams to serve a full term without using his veto. President John Quincy Adams served a full four-year term without using his veto, a feat not achieved since Thomas Jefferson. President George W. Bush used his veto in July 2006, while President Barack Obama vetoed 10 bills during his time in office. The most recent vetoes were of bills related to healthcare, environmental protection, and labor regulations. Since 1789, Presidents have vetoed 83 appropriations bills, with more than half occurring since 1968. Presidents Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama have vetoed a total of 31 appropriations bills. Congressional overrides of these vetoes are not uncommon, with 12 out of the 83 vetoes being overridden."
