    "content": "The 116th Congress faces trade policy issues related to NAFTA renegotiations and the proposed USMCA. Talks began in 2017, and the USMCA was signed in 2018 by the leaders of the US, Canada, and Mexico. President Trump had campaigned on withdrawing from or renegotiating NAFTA. President Trump campaigned on withdrawing from or renegotiating NAFTA and has hinted at the possibility of NAFTA withdrawal since taking office. Key issues for Congress regarding the proposed USMCA include its constitutional authority over international trade, U.S. negotiating objectives, and the agreement's impact on U.S. industries and trade relations with Canada and Mexico. The USMCA would revise auto rules of origin and establish new provisions in digital trade and intellectual property rights. The USMCA trade deal, which would replace NAFTA, includes updated provisions in digital trade and intellectual property rights. After negotiations, the U.S., Mexico, and Canada reached an agreement on the USMCA on September 30, 2018. Canada aimed to make NAFTA more progressive by strengthening labor and environmental provisions, adding a chapter on indigenous rights, reforming the investor-state dispute settlement process, and protecting its supply-management system for dairy and poultry. Mexico prioritized free trade of goods and services in the USMCA negotiations, aiming for inclusive and responsible trade by incorporating cooperation mechanisms in labor standards, anticorruption, and the environment. The USTR sought to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with NAFTA countries and \"rebalance the benefits\" of the agreement, echoing President Trump's criticism of NAFTA as a \"disaster.\" The U.S. negotiating positions in the USMCA aimed to promote economic sovereignty and roll back liberalization commitments. Trump Administration officials proposed reviewing the agreement every five years, questioning dispute settlement, and increasing U.S. content in auto rules. Mexican and Canadian negotiators opposed these ideas, preferring to modernize NAFTA with provisions from the TPP. The differences in views on modernizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and U.S. proposals caused tensions in negotiations. The proposed USMCA offers a chance to incorporate elements from recent FTAs like the U.S.-Korea FTA (KORUS) and TPP. Changes in the U.S. and global economies, driven by technology advances like the commercial internet, have impacted consumer habits and e-commerce. Negotiators also aimed to update provisions in areas such as intellectual property rights, labor, and the environment, while addressing the role of state-led firms in trade competition. The debate over NAFTA and the proposed USMCA focuses on trade and investment relationships with Canada and Mexico. Labor groups and consumer-advocacy groups argue that NAFTA led to outsourcing and lower wages in the U.S. Some agree that NAFTA should be modernized, but have differing views on how to do so. The report provides an overview of NAFTA, the role of Congress in renegotiation, key provisions in the USMCA, and policy implications for Congress. It does not delve deeply into existing NAFTA provisions and economic relations. NAFTA negotiations began under President George H. W. Bush and were signed into law by President William J. Clinton in 1993. NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, was the first free trade agreement between two wealthy countries and a lower-income country. It set new rules for future trade agreements, including provisions on intellectual property rights, services trade, agriculture, dispute settlement, investment, labor, and the environment. NAFTA, signed into law in 1993, was the first free trade agreement between two wealthy countries and a lower-income country. It eliminated tariff and nontariff barriers on goods and services within North America, leading to a significant increase in trade among the three countries. Trade experts credit NAFTA for expanding economic linkages and production chains in the region. NAFTA expanded trade and economic linkages, improved production processes, increased consumer goods availability, and enhanced living standards. However, it also faced criticism for disappointing employment trends and declining wages in the US. The agreement helped strengthen US relations with Mexico and Canada, accelerating trade and investment trends. Mexico had high trade barriers and a protectionist trade policy until the 1980s. Despite failed protectionist policies, income levels and economic growth did not increase. NAFTA led to Mexico's unilateral trade liberalization efforts, giving the US and Canada greater access to the Mexican market. NAFTA facilitated greater access to the Mexican market for the US and Canada, creating one of the largest free trade areas in the world. The agreement included provisions on tariff and nontariff trade liberalization, rules of origin, services trade, foreign investment, IPR protection, government procurement, and dispute resolution. Labor and environmental provisions were addressed in separate side agreements. NAFTA provisions were groundbreaking, influencing subsequent trade agreements. Market-opening measures gradually eliminated tariffs and nontariff barriers over 10 years. Most tariffs and quotas applied by Mexico on imports from the US were removed. In 1993, Mexico had low tariffs on imports from the US and Canada, with over 50% of US imports entering duty-free. In contrast, the US faced higher tariffs and nontariff barriers exporting to Mexico. NAFTA's market opening significantly impacted Mexico's economy, with exports and imports in 1994 equaling 14% and 18% respectively. NAFTA significantly impacted Mexico's economy, with exports and imports increasing to 37% and 39% of GDP in 2017. For the US, trade is less significant, with imports and exports equaling 15% and 12% of GDP in 2017. NAFTA rules eliminated tariffs on most agricultural products but maintained high over-quota tariffs for certain US exports to Canada. Agricultural exporters face challenges with sanitary and phytosanitary measures, leading to increased costs and disruptions in supply chains. NAFTA also removed investment barriers in Mexico. NAFTA removed investment barriers in Mexico, ensured protections for investors, and provided dispute settlement mechanisms. It allowed for national and nondiscriminatory treatment for foreign investment in certain sectors. The agreement also established rules and obligations for services trade among partner countries, granting providers rights for nondiscriminatory treatment, cross-border sales, investment, and access to information. Under NAFTA, certain exclusions and reservations were made by each country, including maritime shipping (United States), film and publishing (Canada), and oil and gas drilling (Mexico). The agreement liberalized service sectors in Mexico, particularly financial services, opening its banking sector significantly. Canada extended an exemption to Mexico for investment restrictions on Mexican banks, while Mexico allowed financial firms from other NAFTA countries to establish institutions with market-share limits until 2000. In telecommunications, basic services were excluded but not their use. NAFTA also granted a \"bill of rights\" for services. NAFTA granted a \"bill of rights\" for providers and users of telecommunications services, including access to public services, connection to private lines at economic costs, and the right to choose terminal equipment. It did not require authorization for foreign providers or bar monopolies like Telmex in Mexico. NAFTA also included provisions for Intellectual Property Rights protection. The NAFTA agreement included enforceable commitments on intellectual property rights, dispute resolution through arbitration, and opened up government procurement on a nondiscriminatory basis. NAFTA included provisions for government procurement on a nondiscriminatory basis, with limitations for state-owned enterprises. It also introduced labor and environmental provisions in separate side agreements, promoting cooperation and addressing enforcement failures. U.S. trade with NAFTA partners increased significantly after the agreement took effect. U.S. trade with NAFTA partners increased rapidly after the agreement took effect, with total merchandise imports and exports rising significantly. The United States had a trade deficit with Canada and Mexico in 2017, compared to a surplus in 1993. Services trade also saw an increase, with a surplus of $31.4 billion in 2016. Trade in oil and gas was a significant component, accounting for 7.2% of total U.S. merchandise trade with Canada and Mexico in 2017. The U.S. trade deficit with NAFTA partners increased from $0.9 billion in 1997 to $13.4 billion in 2017, with imports rising from $22.3 billion to $69.0 billion. Excluding oil and gas products, the deficit was $88.6 billion in 2017, but only $33.0 billion without these products. Traditional trade statistics may not accurately reflect the complex flows of goods within global production chains, such as auto parts crossing borders multiple times before final assembly. The OECD and WTO developed the TiVA database to show value added content in exports. U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico is complex, with the TiVA method showing a deficit of $79.8 billion compared to $135 billion conventionally. NAFTA impacted Mexico's auto sector. NAFTA significantly impacted Mexico's auto sector, leading to the integration of the motor vehicle industry in all three countries. Motor vehicles and parts became top exports and imports among NAFTA countries. Agriculture trade also expanded, but to a lesser extent. Despite adjustment costs, NAFTA brought trade and economic benefits, although isolating its effects from other factors like economic growth is challenging. Foreign direct investment has also been influenced by NAFTA. Foreign direct investment (FDI) between the United States and NAFTA partners has increased significantly since NAFTA. The United States is the largest investor in Canada, with a stock of FDI reaching $391.2 billion in 2017. Canadian FDI in the United States also saw a substantial increase, reaching $453.1 billion in 2017. These trends reflect a shift in Canadian attitudes towards FDI, from being fearful or hostile to more welcoming. In Mexico, the United States is the largest source of FDI, with the stock of U.S. FDI increasing from $15.2 billion in 1993 to $109.7 billion in 2017. Total FDI in Mexico dropped 19% in 2015, mainly due to declines in the services sector and automotive industry. Mexican FDI in the United States also increased rapidly, from $1.2 billion in 1993 to $18.0 billion in 2017. Some economists believe that Mexico's recent economic reforms have added resilience to the economy, leading to greater growth and investment over time. The President has the authority to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. Congress has the authority to regulate foreign commerce. The President may seek expedited treatment of implementing legislation for a renegotiated NAFTA under the Bipartisan Comprehensive Trade Promotion and Accountability Act of 2015. NAFTA allows for modifications with approval from each party. The President must consult with Congress before starting negotiations under TPA. The Trump Administration consulted with members of the House Ways and Means Committee. The U.S. Trade Representative and congressional committees have been involved in NAFTA renegotiation, with over 12,000 public comments received. The President must notify and consult with Congress before and during negotiations, following specific reporting requirements. Negotiations must align with Congress's 2015 TPA negotiating objectives. The Trump Administration aims to improve the U.S. trade balance and reduce the trade deficit in FTA negotiations. The Trump Administration aims to improve the U.S. trade balance and reduce the trade deficit with NAFTA countries in the renegotiation of NAFTA. The trade balance with NAFTA partners has fluctuated since the agreement entered into force, increasing from $9.1 billion in 1993 to $89.6 billion in 2017. President Trump and some officials believe that trade deficits are detrimental to the U.S. economy. USTR Robert Lighthizer stated that he wanted to negotiate an agreement approved by Congress while also bringing down the trade deficit to help American workers and farmers. Critics argue that U.S. FTAs have contributed to rising trade deficits with some trade partners, but economists generally believe that using trade agreement provisions to decrease the deficit is not feasible. Some economists suggest strengthening Mexico's economy and boosting imports from the United States as an alternative to using trade agreement provisions to reduce the deficit. They argue that trade imbalances are determined by macroeconomic fundamentals, not trade policy. Trade deficits are seen as incomplete measures of economic relations between the U.S. and its trading partners. The proposed USMCA, with 34 chapters and 12 side letters, aims to address market access provisions for autos and agriculture products, rules on investment, government procurement, and IPR. New issues like digital trade, state-owned enterprises, anticorruption, and currency misalignment are also covered. It presents an opportunity to include obligations not in NAFTA, such as digital trade and enforceable labor and environmental provisions. Rules of origin in NAFTA and other FTAs ensure benefits are for goods produced locally. Rules of origin in NAFTA and other FTAs ensure that benefits are granted only to goods produced by the signatory parties. In 2017, 53% of U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico entered duty-free under NAFTA. Goods with materials from non-NAFTA countries can be considered North American if sufficiently transformed in the region. Minimum North American content and a tariff shift are often required. The rules of origin in NAFTA and other FTAs ensure benefits are only given to goods produced by signatory parties. Regional value content can be calculated using the transaction-value or net-cost method. Producers can choose the method, except for the motor vehicle industry which must use the net-cost method. The U.S. proposal to tighten rules of origin in the motor vehicle industry was a contentious issue in negotiations. NAFTA requires at least 60% North American content for goods to receive benefits. The proposed USMCA maintains the requirement of at least 50% North American content for goods to receive NAFTA benefits. Specific rules of origin apply to industries like the motor vehicle industry, which must meet requirements of 62.5% North American content for autos, light trucks, engines, and transmissions, and 60% for automotive parts. NAFTA phased out tariffs on motor vehicle imports from Mexico and opened the Mexican motor vehicle sector to trade and investment from the United States. The NAFTA agreement eliminated Mexican trade barriers, allowing for trade and investment from the United States in the motor vehicle sector. This led to the integration of the North American motor vehicle industry, with major automakers establishing supply chains in the region. Mexico now contributes about 20% of total continental vehicle production, with recent investments focusing on new assembly plants. The proposed USMCA aims to tighten auto rules of origin by requiring 75% North American content. The USMCA includes new rules such as 75% North American content requirement, wage requirements for auto workers, origin requirements for steel and aluminum, and provisions for enforcing manufacturers' rules. Side letters exempt certain vehicles and auto parts from potential tariffs. Vehicle and parts manufacturers generally supported retaining the current rules. Some stakeholders support current NAFTA rules of origin, while others push for higher regional content requirements in the proposed USMCA. Concerns arise regarding compliance with World Trade Organization's Article XXIV. Experts warn of unintended consequences from increased North American content requirements in the USMCA. Experts warn that the new rules-of-origin requirements in the USMCA could have unintended consequences for North American auto production. They argue that it may be more cost-efficient for motor vehicle manufacturers to pay the MFN tariff rather than meet the cumbersome rules. This poses a significant risk as manufacturers may not have the supply to comply with the new rules, potentially leading to a loss of market share to Asian manufacturers. Some automakers express concerns about new rules of origin in the USMCA, but generally support the agreement. Auto industry representatives welcome modernizing changes in the agreement, such as trade facilitation measures and IPR protection. The United Auto Workers union calls for stronger labor and environmental provisions in NAFTA renegotiation. The UAW supports strengthening labor and environmental provisions in NAFTA and evaluating the USMCA agreement for job protection. NAFTA's agriculture provisions include tariff elimination, SPS measures, rules of origin, and grade standards. CUSFTA provisions apply to trade with Canada, with exclusions for dairy, poultry, and eggs. NAFTA resulted in tariff elimination for most agricultural products and redefined import quotas as tariff-rate quotas. However, some products, such as U.S. dairy and poultry exports to Canada, still face high above-quota tariffs due to Canada's supply-management system. SPS measures and nontariff barriers continue to challenge agricultural trade, but NAFTA eliminated most nontariff barriers in agricultural trade with Mexico. NAFTA eliminated most nontariff barriers in agricultural trade with Mexico, including import licensing requirements, by converting them to TRQs or ordinary tariffs. Tariffs phased out over 15 years, with sensitive products like sugar and corn receiving longer phase-out periods. About half of U.S.-Mexico agricultural trade became duty-free. USMCA negotiations focused on gaining additional market access to Canada's supply-management-restricted dairy, poultry, and egg markets. Canada maintains a tariff-rate quota system for dairy, poultry, and egg imports, with out-of-quota tariffs reaching 313.5% for dairy products. Canada agreed to expand the TRQ for dairy products and duty-free quota for poultry, while the US will provide more access for Canadian dairy, sugar, peanuts, and cotton. Changes include phasing out US tariffs on peanuts and cotton over five years and increasing TRQs for dairy and sugar products. Additionally, the US negotiated changes to Canadian wheat grading and national treatment for beer, wine, and spirits labeling and sales. The USMCA partners agreed on non-market access provisions in agriculture, including regulatory alignment, protection for proprietary formulas, SPS rules based on scientific principles, and greater transparency. Biotechnology provisions involve transparent approval processes and a working group on agricultural biotechnology. Customs and trade facilitation aim to ensure the efficient flow of legally traded goods in and out of the United States. Trade facilitation involves the efficient flow of legally traded goods in and out of the United States, including enforcement of trade laws and import security. NAFTA and other agreements have provisions on customs procedures, with recent agreements modernizing these provisions. The WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement aims to simplify customs procedures to reduce trade costs. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) aims to reduce trade barriers by improving administrative procedures at the border and behind-the-border measures. The proposed USMCA includes commitments to facilitate trade through customs procedures and create a Trade Facilitation Committee for cooperation. Other provisions involve online publication of trade-related information and communication mechanisms. The USMCA includes provisions for trade facilitation such as establishing enquiry points, advance customs rulings, efficient release of goods, expedited customs procedures, automated risk analysis, single-access window system, and transparency procedures. It sets de minimis customs thresholds for duty-free treatment at US$800 for the United States, C$150 for Canada, and US$117 for Mexico, with a tax-free threshold at C$40. The USMCA sets de minimis customs thresholds for duty-free treatment at US$800 for the United States, C$150 for Canada, and US$117 for Mexico, with a tax-free threshold at C$40. Proponents argue that these changes will facilitate North American trade by allowing low-value parcels to be shipped across borders tax and tariff-free. Concerns have been raised about a footnote that could allow the US to decrease its threshold to a reciprocal amount, potentially impacting consumers and express carriers. NAFTA includes country-specific exceptions and reservations, such as in the energy sector in Mexico. The USMCA does not have an energy chapter and moves some of NAFTA's energy provisions to other parts of the agreement. It recognizes Mexico's constitutional prohibitions on foreign investment in its energy sector. Energy remains a central component of U.S.-Mexico trade. The USMCA, including ISDS provisions for Mexico's energy sector, protects U.S. energy projects in Mexico. Mexico reformed its energy sector in 2013, allowing private and foreign investors in production-sharing contracts while keeping hydrocarbon ownership state-controlled. Mexico also implemented new procurement rules for efficiency. Industry groups urged the U.S. to use NAFTA's ratchet mechanism in renegotiations. U.S. industry groups want NAFTA's ratchet mechanism to protect Mexico's energy reforms and U.S. investors. Negotiators are addressing the \"proportionality\" provision in energy chapters, which would be removed in the proposed USMCA. This provision restricts Canadian energy exports to the U.S. and pricing discrimination. Canadians may seek changes as it limits Canada's energy policy decisions. The NAFTA government procurement chapter sets standards for government purchases. Government procurement chapters in FTAs promote transparency and nondiscriminatory treatment among parties, allowing firms to bid on contracts for specified government agencies. The United States and Canada offer procurement opportunities through the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Supporters argue that these provisions give U.S. firms access to overseas markets and promote open government procurement domestically. Mexico is not currently a member of the GPA. The Buy American Act of 1933 limits foreign companies bidding on government procurements. Trump Administration prioritizes Buy American policies in government procurement. USMCA government procurement supports Buy American and Hire American policies. The proposed USMCA government procurement chapter applies only to Mexico and the United States, excluding other parties. It maintains coverage similar to NAFTA, promoting transparency in the tendering process and excluding certain sectors like financial services and textiles. The proposed USMCA government procurement chapter applies to Mexico and the United States, excluding other parties. It allows Mexico to set aside annual procurement contracts for Mexican suppliers and covers build-operate-transfer contracts. The exclusion of Canada is a departure from previous government procurement chapters in U.S. FTAs. The national treatment and transparency provisions are common to both the GPA and the proposed USMCA. The GPA and NAFTA have differences in schedules and thresholds for online tendering. The GPA covers more U.S. government entities than NAFTA, with higher thresholds for goods and services but lower for construction procurement. The USMCA uses a negative list approach for services, while Canada maintains a positive list. Government procurement between Canada and Mexico is covered by the CPTPP. Some industry groups criticize the exclusion of Canada and financial services from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP or TPP-11). Concerns raised about potential repercussions for future FTAs and access to Canadian procurement market. NAFTA provided significant coverage for U.S. insurance providers in Mexico, but USMCA's exclusion of financial services raises doubts about continued access. Insurance providers cover two-thirds of Mexican government employees, and NAFTA and U.S. FTAs provide core investor protections reflecting U.S. law. The proposed USMCA largely tracks NAFTA provisions, with some exceptions in investor-state dispute settlement provisions. During the negotiations of the proposed USMCA, the U.S. business community strongly opposed reported U.S. proposals to scale back or eliminate NAFTA ISDS provisions, citing concerns about energy security and investment protections. On the other hand, U.S. labor and civil society groups welcomed the Administration's more skeptical approach to ISDS. The proposed USMCA clarifies language related to national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment. The proposed USMCA clarifies language related to national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment in the context of expropriation. It requires parties to provide MST to investments in accordance with applicable customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The applicable standard of treatment for a covered investment is defined as the customary international law MST of aliens, with \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" not creating additional substantive rights. The proposed USMCA clarifies that actions inconsistent with investor expectations are not automatically a breach of MST. It prohibits specific \"performance requirements\" for investments, including export levels, domestic content, technology transfer, and certain royalties. The denial of benefits article allows parties to deny investment chapter benefits. The proposed USMCA includes a denial of benefits article that allows a party to deny investment chapter benefits to an investor if their enterprise is owned by a non-party, lacks substantial business activities in any party's territory, or is controlled by a person from a non-party. This provision aims to prevent shell companies from accessing protections. Additionally, the USMCA states that nondiscriminatory regulatory actions for public welfare objectives do not constitute indirect expropriation, with debate surrounding what qualifies as \"rare circumstances.\" The proposed USMCA includes a statement affirming a government's right to regulate for \"health, environmental, and other regulatory objectives\" while remaining consistent with the Investment Chapter. ISDS, a controversial aspect of NAFTA, allows private investors to pursue claims against sovereign nations for alleged violations of investment provisions. ISDS tribunals consist of three lawyer-arbitrators chosen by the claimant investor, respondent country, and mutually agreed upon. ISDS tribunals consist of three lawyer-arbitrators chosen by the claimant investor, respondent country, and mutually agreed upon. Cases follow rules from the World Bank's Centre for Settlement for Investor Dispute or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. ISDS is seen as important for protecting investors from discriminatory treatment, with limited remedies being monetary penalties. Critics argue that ISDS restricts governments' ability to regulate in the public interest. The proposed USMCA would substantially revise ISDS provisions in NAFTA and other agreements, ending ISDS between Canada and the United States. Under USMCA, ISDS is limited to government contracts in specific sectors. Under the proposed USMCA, ISDS is continued for legacy claims from existing investments for three years after NAFTA termination, direct expropriation claims for US and Mexican investors, and government contracts in specific sectors. Indirect expropriation is no longer covered. Canada and Mexico maintain ISDS through CPTPP. Under the proposed USMCA, certain sectors like oil and gas, power generation, telecommunications, transportation, and infrastructure are eligible for arbitration under ISDS to protect investors in heavily regulated industries. The US prioritizes services trade liberalization in FTAs, including NAFTA and USMCA, with a focus on core obligations in services trade and chapters covering financial services and telecommunications. NAFTA introduced the first \"negative list\" services chapter in a US trade agreement, which is maintained in USMCA. The services chapter in NAFTA and the proposed USMCA follows a negative list approach, covering all services unless specifically excluded. Key provisions include nondiscriminatory treatment of services, no limitations on service suppliers, and coverage of new types of services developed after the agreement. The proposed USMCA includes provisions on employment, prohibition of locality requirements, mutual recognition of professional qualifications, transparency in government regulations, and capital flow transfers related to services. It also addresses express delivery services, with a focus on cases involving government-owned postal services. The proposed USMCA includes provisions on express delivery services, ensuring that government-owned postal systems do not use their monopoly power to compete with private providers. It also mandates independence between regulators and providers, prohibits fees for funding other providers, and sets a threshold for customs de minimis for expedited customs treatment. The proposed USMCA includes commitments on temporary entry for service professionals, such as accountants, architects, legal, and medical providers, to facilitate cross-border trade in services. It does not place new restrictions on the number of entrants or expand the list of eligible professionals. Financial services are addressed in a separate chapter as in previous U.S. FTAs. The proposed USMCA includes commitments on temporary entry for service professionals to facilitate cross-border trade in services. The financial services chapter adapts provisions from the foreign investment and cross-border trade in services chapters, distinguishing between services traded across borders and those sold by a provider with a commercial presence in the buyer's home country. The prudential exception ensures the integrity and stability of the financial system. The USMCA applies a negative list approach for providers with a foreign commercial presence and limits coverage to a positive list of specific banking and insurance services for cross-border trade. The proposed USMCA includes commitments on temporary entry for service professionals to facilitate cross-border trade in specific banking and insurance services. One key provision is the prohibition on data localization requirements, which can create additional costs and act as a barrier to trade. Supporters argue that localization requirements increase local control and data security. NAFTA allowed data transfer in the ordinary course of business, while TPP was the first proposed U.S. FTA to prohibit data localization. The proposed USMCA strengthens language to protect the free flow of data, removes carve-outs for financial services, and includes commitments on electronic payment card services. Canada has a one-year transition period to implement the data localization prohibition. The USMCA includes provisions on card services, access preconditions, ISDS modification, access to payment systems, and protection of source code in digital trade. The telecommunication chapter in NAFTA requires regulatory transparency, interconnection among providers, and access to network infrastructure. The proposed USMCA telecommunications chapter covers mobile service providers, promoting cooperation on international roaming charges and regulation for mobile roaming service rates. It ensures suppliers can resell and unbundle services, provide value-added services, and promotes regulator independence. Mexico is bound to its 2013 Constitutional reforms in telecommunications. The proposed USMCA chapter aims to ensure the independence of the regulatory commission, nondiscriminatory repurchase rates, and interconnection obligations in Mexico's telecommunications sector. It also addresses digital trade objectives set by Congress, including equal treatment of electronically delivered goods and services, protection of cross-border data flows, and prevention of data localization regulations. The proposed USMCA digital trade chapter aims to promote digital trade, ensure the free flow of information, and maintain an open Internet. It covers all industries but excludes government procurement, data held or processed by governments, and financial services. Key provisions include nondiscriminatory treatment of digital products, prohibition of cross-border data flow restrictions, and restrictions on source code or algorithm disclosure. The USMCA digital trade chapter aims to promote digital trade, ensure the free flow of information, and maintain an open Internet. It includes provisions such as prohibiting customs duties for electronically transmitted products, requiring online consumer protection laws, promoting cybersecurity cooperation, and prohibiting liability for harms related to information stored or transmitted. NAFTA was the first FTA to include an IPR chapter, which served as a model for the WTO TRIPs Agreement. The USMCA digital trade chapter promotes digital trade, ensures free information flow, and maintains an open Internet. It includes provisions like prohibiting customs duties for electronically transmitted products, requiring online consumer protection laws, promoting cybersecurity cooperation, and prohibiting liability for information-related harms. IPR chapters in trade agreements cover patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, geographical indications, and enforcement. US FTAs have obligations more extensive than TRIPS and NAFTA, reflecting a standard of protection similar to US law. The US achieved most of its goals in the proposed USMCA, with results surpassing the TPP in some areas. Patents protect innovations like pharmaceutical products and chemical processes. TPP: Patents protect new innovations like pharmaceutical products, chemical processes, business technologies, and computer software. Copyrights provide creators with exclusive rights to their works. Debate exists over balancing copyright protections and the free flow of information, with digital trade raising new issues like copyright term extension, technological protection measures, and limitations and exceptions. The proposed USMCA does not contain additional language from the TPP to achieve an appropriate balance between users and rights holders in copyright systems. Rights-holder groups have criticized fair use provisions, while open Internet groups have sought to include them in the USMCA. Safe harbor protects ISPs against liability for digital copyright. The proposed USMCA includes provisions on trademark protection and enforcement, extending protection to sounds and requiring efforts to register scents. Certification marks like Underwriters' Laboratory are also protected. The proposed USMCA extends trademark protection to well-known marks for dissimilar goods and services, requires management of country-code top level domains, and mandates public access to a database of domain-name registrants. The proposed USMCA requires parties to provide remedies for \"cybersquatting\" and criminal penalties for trade secret theft, including protection for geographical names. The proposed USMCA aims to protect geographical indications (GIs) for food products, following similar agreements with the European Union. It includes transparency requirements for new GIs and guidelines to determine common language terms. The agreement also commits parties to enforce intellectual property rights (IPR) violations. The USMCA includes provisions for enforcing intellectual property rights, such as copyright enforcement and penalties for trade secret theft. Canada has excluded cultural industries from national treatment to protect its unique culture from being dominated by American influences. This exclusion leads to Canadian content requirements on various media platforms. The USMCA includes provisions on intellectual property rights enforcement and penalties for trade secret theft. Canada has excluded cultural industries from national treatment to preserve its unique culture. NAFTA and USMCA have provisions on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to ensure they act in accordance with commercial considerations and accord nondiscriminatory treatment in the sale of goods or services. The USMCA includes a new chapter on State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to ensure they compete on a commercial basis and do not disadvantage U.S. workers and businesses. The renegotiations addressed concerns over competition with state-supported firms, introducing specific disciplines to address such competition. Some legal analysts argue that the USMCA limits expropriation protection to \"direct\" expropriation only. The USMCA includes provisions to address competition with state-supported firms and limits expropriation protection to \"direct\" expropriation only. NAFTA introduced labor provisions in a side agreement, the NAALC, to enforce labor laws and encourage cooperation. Subsequent FTAs included similar labor provisions in the main text of the agreement. The USMCA includes labor provisions to ensure countries uphold labor laws and prevent unfair competition. Recent FTAs require parties to adopt and enforce core labor principles of the ILO, with violations subject to dispute settlement procedures. The USMCA revises NAFTA provisions on worker rights, requiring parties to enforce laws related to the ILO Declaration. It mandates adoption and maintenance of worker rights in statutes and regulations, including minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety. The USMCA requires parties to enforce labor laws effectively to promote compliance and investigate violations. It allows for enforcement discretion but prohibits activities in another party's territory. Mexico must enact legislation for collective bargaining rights. Legislative action is needed to establish effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, maintain independent bodies for union activities, and create Labor Courts for labor dispute resolution. Mexico's labor reform is a priority for President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, while the US signed separate labor consistency plans with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Brunei in the proposed TPP. Stakeholders suggest a similar plan for Mexico in a revised NAFTA. In the USMCA, Mexico agreed to strengthen labor laws and implement reforms to protect collective bargaining. Labor reform measures are being introduced in the Mexican Senate, with legislation expected to be passed by April 2019. NAFTA included a side agreement on environmental cooperation, requiring parties to enforce their own environmental laws. The USMCA includes obligations for parties to enforce environmental laws and adhere to multilateral agreements. Previous FTAs also included similar environmental chapters with dispute settlement mechanisms. The USMCA includes obligations for parties to enforce environmental laws, adhere to multilateral agreements, and strive for high levels of environmental protection. It also requires parties to adopt and maintain statutes and regulations consistent with multilateral environmental agreements, recognize sovereign rights, and provide mechanisms for dispute resolution and implementation. The proposed USMCA addresses obligations under major Multilateral Environmental Agreements, including protecting the ozone layer, marine environment, biodiversity, and fisheries management. Dispute settlement provisions aim to resolve disputes cooperatively through consultation between parties. Dispute resolution under NAFTA involves initial consultations, mediation, and establishment of a panel. Panels consist of five members, with each side appointing two and a chair appointed by mutual consent. The unsuccessful party must remedy the issue or face compensation, benefit suspension, or fines. Disputes common to WTO and FTA rules can be brought to one forum. Three state-to-state dispute resolution panels were completed between 1994 and 2001 under NAFTA. The USMCA dispute settlement process faced challenges in 1994 and 2001 when a panel was blocked from forming due to issues in the panel selection process. The USMCA allows parties to select and maintain a roster of panelists for a three-year term, but if the roster is not constituted or maintained, a party can challenge proposed panelists. The USMCA contains provisions not found in WTO agreements, making it a potential venue for dispute resolution. The USMCA dispute settlement system could be the only arbiter for disputes not resolved in the agreement. Unlike other U.S. FTAs, NAFTA and USMCA have a binational dispute settlement mechanism. Certain chapters or sections are not subject to dispute settlement, including The Good Regulatory Practices chapter and The Competition Policy chapter. The NAFTA Chapter 19 dispute settlement system allows for review of AD/CVD final determinations between NAFTA parties, originating from CUSFTA negotiations in 1988. It provides a mechanism for resolving disputes related to unfair trade practices and inconsistencies with WTO agreements. The USMCA retained the NAFTA Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism, which allows for review of unfair trade practices. Additionally, the USMCA includes provisions to guard against currency manipulation, a first in a U.S. trade agreement. The USMCA includes provisions to guard against currency manipulation, with a principal trade negotiating objective addressing the issue for the first time. Concerns have been raised about foreign countries undervaluing their currencies to gain an unfair trade advantage against the United States. This could set a precedent for including currency manipulation provisions in future FTAs. Some economists are skeptical about currency manipulation and its impact on the U.S. economy. Nontariff barriers, such as regulatory processes, can hinder market access for U.S. exports. NAFTA has provisions on regulatory practices but lacks a specific chapter on the issue. The proposed USMCA includes a new chapter on regulatory practices, aiming to promote regulatory quality and facilitate international trade and economic growth by enhancing transparency, accountability, and predictability. This chapter emphasizes the importance of good regulatory practices in reducing burdensome and divergent regulatory requirements among the parties. The implementation of NAFTA trucking provisions was a major trade issue between the United States and Mexico for many years. NAFTA provided Mexican commercial trucks full access to the U.S. by 2000 after delays from the U.S. The issue was resolved through cooperation and talks on safety and operational issues, leading to a resolution by 2015. Mexican commercial trucks have authority under NAFTA for cross-border operations. The proposed USMCA would cap the number of Mexican carriers allowed U.S. operating authority and maintain the ban on Mexican carriers hauling freight between two points within the U.S. Mexican carriers with existing NAFTA authority can still operate in the U.S. The U.S. has included anti-corruption commitments in its FTAs through transparency and anticorruption chapters. The evolution of anticorruption provisions in U.S. FTAs has seen progress over the years. While NAFTA did not have a separate chapter on transparency or anticorruption, it did include groundbreaking provisions on foreign investment. Subsequent agreements like the U.S.-Chile FTA and CAFTA-DR included anticorruption provisions in transparency chapters. The proposed TPP was the first to specifically include anticorruption provisions as a U.S. FTA chapter. In NAFTA renegotiations, both the United States and Mexico included anticorruption commitments. The proposed USMCA includes a new chapter on anti-corruption similar to the TPP, affirming resolve to prevent and combat bribery in international trade. Parties commit to a review after six years, with the option to extend the agreement for another 16 years. If not extended, parties will conduct annual reviews. The proposed USMCA includes a new chapter on anti-corruption similar to the TPP. Parties commit to a joint review of the agreement every year, with the option to extend it for another 16 years. The agreement does not specify whether the President or Congress will conduct the review. Some industry observers are concerned about the sunset provision affecting investor confidence. Key issues for Congress include modernized provisions, the role of Congress and the President in the approval process, and the economic impact, especially in the auto industry. The USMCA agreement includes provisions on anti-corruption and annual joint reviews. Concerns exist about the sunset provision impacting investor confidence. Lawmakers are focused on the economic impact, particularly in the auto industry, and the potential effects on U.S. relations with Canada and Mexico. Congressional interest lies in the roles of Congress and the President in modernizing or withdrawing from the agreement, with a possible consideration of implementing legislation under Trade Promotion Authority. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) provides expedited procedures for introducing implementing bills for trade agreements, ensuring timely congressional consideration. TPA requires the President to fulfill consultation, notification, and reporting obligations to preserve Congress's role in influencing trade agreements before finalization. Congress has the opportunity to influence trade agreements before finalization under TPA. If the President fails to meet requirements, Congress can block expedited procedures and deny implementing legislation. The Speaker can strip expedited treatment from the legislation in the House. The Rules Committee may remove expedited treatment from implementing legislation, requiring unanimous consent or a supermajority in the Senate. President Trump could threaten NAFTA withdrawal to pressure Congress, but the legality is uncertain. Congress may challenge any withdrawal attempt, as the authority to terminate NAFTA is debated. Economic and strategic implications of USMCA implementation or NAFTA withdrawal may be examined by Congress. President Trump has hinted at withdrawal from NAFTA. President Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA, which could have significant economic consequences for the U.S. due to strong ties with Mexico and Canada. Retaliatory tariffs and potential new FTAs could result if the U.S. withdraws. The proposed USMCA is not expected to have a major impact on North American trade relations as most trade with Canada and Mexico is already duty-free under NAFTA. The proposed USMCA would maintain NAFTA's tariff and non-tariff barrier eliminations. Economists believe it will not have a significant impact on U.S. trade, investment, jobs, wages, or economic growth. The U.S. International Trade Commission is investigating the economic impacts of USMCA, with a report expected by April 20. The US International Trade Commission is investigating the economic impacts of the proposed USMCA, with a report expected by April 20, 2019. The motor vehicle industry may be particularly affected due to changes in rules of origin and high percentage of duty-free goods under NAFTA. Leading US merchandise imports from NAFTA partners in 2017 were motor vehicles, oil and gas, and motor vehicle parts. The USMCA could impact the auto industry by raising compliance and production costs, potentially leading to higher prices and affecting U.S. vehicle sales. Manufacturers with a strong presence in Mexico, like General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, may be more affected. Observers are analyzing the provisions in the agreement. Some analysts see improvements in provisions of the new agreement, such as customs regulation, digital trade, and labor enforcement. Concerns exist over heightened IPR protections and limited ISDS provisions in the USMCA. Investors may only file ISDS claims for specific breaches under the agreement. President L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico, who won the 2018 elections by a wide margin, supports improving NAFTA rather than terminating it. His chief NAFTA negotiator, Jes\u00fas Seade, finds the proposed USMCA satisfactory for Mexico, expecting increased investment and economic ties. Mexico and Canada are part of the CPTPP, which provides them with preferential market access to lucrative Asian markets. The agreement came into effect on December 30, 2018, and may impact trade and investment trends with the United States. According to a June 2017 study, Canada and Mexico stand to benefit from the CPTPP by gaining increased access to markets, particularly Japan, without competing with U.S. exports. The study projects a 4.7% increase in Canada's exports and a 3.1% increase in Mexico's exports to CPTPP countries by 2035. Canada's agricultural exports, especially beef, would benefit from access to the Japanese market. Additionally, Canada has other FTAs in place, such as the CETA with the EU, which provides preferential market access for goods and services, including agriculture. Canada recognizes Geographical Indications (GIs) to protect the quality of certain products, including cheeses. It has FTAs with South Korea, Central and South American countries, and is an observer to the Pacific Alliance. Mexico has a very open trade policy with 11 FTAs involving 46 countries, including the CPTPP. Mexico has multiple FTAs with countries in the Western Hemisphere, Israel, Japan, and the EU. A new FTA with the EU is expected to open up the Mexican market. Mexico is also part of the Pacific Alliance, aiming for stronger economic ties with the Asia-Pacific region. In 2018, the Pacific Alliance admitted Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada as associate members. President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from NAFTA, with concerns raised by private sector groups about the negative consequences. Congress may assess the impact on the U.S. economy and foreign relations with Mexico. The Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) analysis predicts that a NAFTA withdrawal would cost the US 187,000 jobs reliant on exports to Mexico and Canada over 1-3 years. ImpactEcon estimates further economic consequences if NAFTA were to terminate. ImpactEcon estimates that terminating NAFTA would lead to declines in real GDP, trade, investment, and employment in all three countries. Job losses in the US could range from 256,000 to 1.2 million, with some workers needing to relocate. Canadian and Mexican low-skilled employment would also decrease. The US GDP could decline by 0.64%, risking $88 billion in annual services exports and 587,000 high-paying jobs. The Coalition of Services Industries highlights NAFTA's success for US service providers. Some experts argue that NAFTA has cost the US nearly 700,000 jobs. Renegotiating NAFTA could update labor standards and protect US workers. The Economic Policy Institute recommends stronger labor standards in the USMCA renegotiations, including ILO conventions on labor rights. Canada and Mexico may maintain NAFTA if the US withdraws, with US-Canada trade possibly governed by CUSFTA. If CUSFTA remains in effect, the United States and Canada would continue to exchange goods duty free and adhere to many provisions of the agreement common to both CUSFTA and NAFTA. Some commitments not included in CUSFTA, such as intellectual property rights, would continue as baseline obligations in the WTO. It is uncertain if CUSFTA would remain in effect, as its continuance would require the assent of both parties. In the unlikely event of a U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, the United States would return to WTO most-favored-nation tariffs. The United States and Canada maintain relatively low simple average MFN rates, at 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively. Without NAFTA, there is a risk that tariffs on U.S. exports to Mexico could reach up to 36.2%. U.S. farmers would face double-digit applied and trade-weighted rates in both Mexico and Canada. Mexico and Canada likely would maintain duty-free treatment between themselves through maintenance. If the United States withdrew from NAFTA, certain commitments such as Services Access and Government Procurement would be affected. Mexico and Canada would likely maintain duty-free treatment between themselves through a bilateral NAFTA or commitments made in conjunction with the CPTPP. The NAFTA schedule operated under a negative list basis, making it more extensive than the commitments made for the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services. The NAFTA government procurement chapter establishes standards for government purchases of goods and services. The WTO Government Procurement Agreement imposes obligations on government procurement, with Canada and the United States having reciprocal obligations. U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA could impact U.S. firms competing for Mexican contracts. If the United States were to withdraw from NAFTA, U.S. investors would lose protections in Canada and Mexico, with countries having more leeway to block investments. U.S. investors would not have access to the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism and would need to address claims of expropriation through domestic courts or government-to-government consultation. Canada and Mexico are likely to maintain investor protection through the CPTPP or by keeping NAFTA provisions. The timeline for congressional consideration of the proposed USMCA is uncertain. The timeline for congressional consideration of the proposed USMCA is uncertain due to issues voiced by Congress related to various provisions of the agreement and ongoing trade issues with Canada and Mexico. The agreement would need approval from Congress and ratification from Mexico and Canada before taking effect. President Trump notified Congress of his intent to sign an FTA with Canada and Mexico, and changes to existing U.S. laws required for compliance with the USMCA were submitted to Congress. A report on the economic impact of TPA is expected to be completed by April 20, 2019. The USMCA agreement faces uncertainty in Congress due to unresolved disputes over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. The tariff issues must be resolved before the agreement can enter into force, according to the U.S. business community, industry groups, congressional leaders, and Mexican government officials. Mexico's proposed labor reforms could also be a key issue for Congress as they consider the agreement. Mexico's proposed labor reforms, a key issue for Congress considering the USMCA, include commitments to establish an independent Labor Court for labor disputes. The reforms, expected before January 1, 2019 to avoid USMCA delay, have not yet been passed. Mexican officials prioritize passing the reforms, aiming for legislation by February 2019. Other issues are also emerging for debate among Members and between the Executive Branch and Congress."
