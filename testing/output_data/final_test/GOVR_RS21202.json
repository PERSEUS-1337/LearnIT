    "content": "The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, P.L. 109-365, added a new purpose statement for the nutrition services program emphasizing its nutritional and socialization aspects, as well as its importance in promoting the health of older people. The program aims to reduce hunger, promote socialization, and improve the health and well-being of older individuals by providing access to nutrition and health promotion services. In 2012, 8.8% of U.S. households with elderly members experienced food insecurity, with slightly higher rates for elderly living alone. The Administration on Aging administers nutrition services programs targeting low-income older individuals, including minorities, those with limited English proficiency, and those at risk for institutionalization. Means tests are prohibited, but participants are encouraged to contribute to costs. Services cannot be denied based on income. The Administration on Aging administers nutrition services programs for low-income older individuals, including minorities and those at risk for institutionalization. Older individuals cannot be denied services for failure to contribute. Congregate nutrition services provide meals and related nutrition services to older individuals at various sites, offering nutrition education, screening, assessment, and counseling. Individuals aged 60 or older and their spouses, as well as persons under age 60 with disabilities in housing facilities for the elderly, may participate in the program. In FY2011, 39% of meals were served in congregate settings, totaling 85.9 million meals to 1.6 million participants. Home-delivered nutrition services prioritize meals for homebound older individuals and serve as a primary access point for other services. In FY2011, approximately 61% of meals were home-delivered, totaling 137.2 million meals to just under 847,000 participants aged 60 or older and their spouses. These meals are crucial for family caregivers and help maintain their health and well-being. Services may also be available to individuals under age 60 with disabilities if they reside with an older individual. The Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP) provides funds for congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs, serving a larger proportion of meal participants in congregate settings but delivering more meals to home-delivered participants. Congregate meal settings serve many participants less frequently, while home-delivered meals are received more frequently. Established in 1974, NSIP is funded by the OAA to purchase food for these programs. The Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP) was established in 1974 by the OAA and transferred to AOA in 2003. States and entities can choose to receive NSIP allotments as commodities. AOA awards funds for congregate and home-delivered nutrition services to states and territories, which then distribute funds to Area Agencies on Aging. Additionally, separate allotments are awarded to states, territories, and Indian tribal organizations for NSIP funds. The Nutrition Services Incentive Program (NSIP) allocates funds to states and territories based on population aged 60 and over, with a minimum amount set since FY2006. States must match 15% of funds for congregate and home-delivered nutrition programs. NSIP funds are distributed based on total meals served the previous year, with entities choosing between cash or commodities. No matching requirement for NSIP funds in FY2014, totaling $814.7 million. In FY2014, $814.7 million was appropriated for the Title III nutrition services program, with $438.2 million for congregate nutrition, $216.4 million for home-delivered nutrition, and $160.1 million for nutrition services incentive grants. Funding for nutrition services represents 64% of FY2014 funding for Title III, which also supports social services, caregiver support, and health promotion for older individuals. Funding for OAA nutrition services has decreased over the past two decades, with a decline in relative funding for congregate meals and NSIP programs. The total appropriation for congregate meals, home-delivered meals, and NSIP fell from $1,052.4 million in 1990 to $814.7 million in 2014, a decline of $237.7 million. Funding for congregate meals decreased by $206.5 million, NSIP funding decreased by $102.8 million, while funding for home-delivered meals increased by $71.7 million. This reduction in purchasing power led to a decline in the number of meals served by 21.1 million from FY1990 to FY2011. The number of individuals age 60 and older has increased from 42 million in 1990 to 62 million in 2013, a 50% increase. Per person spending for nutrition services in constant 2013 dollars has declined by half during this time period. Total federal funding for nutrition services decreased from $25 per older individual in 1990 to just over $12 per older individual in 2013. States use various funding sources besides OAA funding to provide nutrition services to older individuals. In FY2011, OAA funds comprised 42% of local AAA's Title III program budgets. Over 223 million meals were provided to older adults, with home-delivered meals increasing from 42% to 62% of total meals served from 1990 to 2011. Home-delivered meals grew by 35%, while congregate meals declined by 40% due to states transferring funds and federal funding growth for home-delivered services. In recent years, state funding transfers have resulted in a decrease of funds available for congregate nutrition services, with states transferring $82.3 million out of congregate nutrition program funds. States are allowed to transfer allotted funds among congregate and home-delivered nutrition services, as well as supportive services, with limitations on the percentage that can be transferred between programs. In FY2012, states transferred $82.3 million from congregate nutrition services to home-delivered nutrition or supportive services, resulting in a 18.8% decrease in congregate program funds. Funds for home-delivered meals and supportive services increased by 14.7% and 13.8% respectively due to state initiatives to meet the demand for home-based services. State and local officials moved funds to address the greater need for home-delivered meals and supportive services. The average expenditure for meals in 2011 ranged from $1.56 in Puerto Rico to $18.81 in Alaska. Providers must offer at least one meal per day, five days a week, following dietary guidelines. Meals must meet certain dietary requirements based on the number of meals served per day. Providers must offer meals that comply with state or local laws for safe food handling, provide a minimum of two-thirds of DRIs for two meals per day and 100% for three meals per day. They should follow advice from dietitians and participants, offer nutrition screening and education, and consider intergenerational meal programs. P.L. 109-365 suggests using multivitamin-mineral supplements for addressing poor nutrition in older individuals. The Older Americans Act suggests using multivitamin-mineral supplements to address poor nutrition among older individuals. A National Survey of OAA participants in 2012 showed that congregate nutrition recipients, many of whom were 75 and older, benefited from the meals program by receiving at least half of their daily food intake and fostering greater socialization. The 2012 survey on home-delivered meals recipients found that 70% were age 75 and older, 58% lived alone, and 22% had an annual income of $10,000 or less. 54% stated that the program provided at least half of their daily food intake. 38% reported needing assistance with activities of daily living, and 83% needed help with instrumental activities of daily living. The 1996 national evaluation of the nutrition program for the elderly showed that participants were older, more likely to be poor, live alone, and be members of minority groups. Recipients had income below the federal poverty level and health limitations putting them at nutritional risk. The program plays a crucial role in providing daily nutrients for participants. The evaluation of the nutrition program for the elderly found that for every federal dollar spent, the program leveraged $1.70 for congregate meals and $3.35 for home-delivered meals from various sources. The 2006 reauthorization legislation mandated an evidence-based study by the Institute of Medicine to evaluate the program's impact on participants' health, nutrition status, and ability to live independently. Recommendations for improving outcomes and meal quality are pending. The AOA has not yet conducted a study to evaluate the nutrition services program, but prior to the 2006 reauthorization, they had started the process. The evaluation will include an assessment of program impacts on participants' nutrition, health, socialization, and food insecurity, a cost analysis per meal, and a process evaluation at state and local levels. The participant outcomes component will involve a matched comparison group and similar survey methods as the NHANES study. The OAA Amendments of 2006 authorized appropriations for OAA-funded activities, including nutrition programs, through FY2011. The 113th Congress may reauthorize the act, potentially amending existing authorities or establishing new ones related to nutrition services. Congress will also consider annual appropriations for these activities. Congress will likely consider annual appropriations for nutrition programs under the OAA Amendments of 2006. Issues for consideration include measuring unmet need for nutrition services, funding flexibility, and cost-sharing. GAO reports show that in 2008, meals services did not reach most low-income older adults in need due to limited funds. The lack of federal guidance and data makes it difficult for states to estimate the full extent of need and unmet need for OAA Title III services, including nutrition services. AOA requires uniform data collection procedures for states to assess receipt of services, need, and unmet need, but lacks standardized definitions or measurements for states to use. States use various limited approaches to estimate need and unmet need for services. The GAO recommends that HHS partner with agencies serving older Americans to develop consistent definitions of need and unmet needs for data collection. States use statutory flexibilities to transfer funding among Title III programs, with some suggesting consolidating nutrition program funding. Consolidating nutrition program funding between home-delivered and congregate nutrition programs is suggested for the next OAA reauthorization to provide states more flexibility in directing services to identified needs. Congress may consider additional flexibilities, such as consolidating Title III funding streams or increasing funds available for transfers to states and AAAs. Concerns may arise regarding funding reallocation and Congress may seek to specify or limit funding flexibility. Alternatively, Congress may decide that current funding flexibilities are sufficient and choose to maintain the status quo. The Older Americans Act (OAA) allows for voluntary contributions from clients for nutrition services, with contributions making up a small percentage of AAA budgets. While cost-sharing is permitted for some Title III services, it is not required for meal programs. Implementing additional cost-sharing arrangements could provide more funding for OAA programs, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The GAO also recommends studying the implementation of cost-sharing for OAA services to assess potential burdens. The Administration on Aging (AOA) is considering cost-sharing for OAA services to address burdens and may recommend legislative changes. They propose expanding consumer contributions in the next OAA reauthorization, allowing states to request waivers for cost-sharing for nutrition and case management services. Low-income individuals would be exempt from these arrangements."
