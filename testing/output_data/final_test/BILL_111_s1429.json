Since October 2001, approximately 1,640,000 members of the Armed Forces have been deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom. 300,000 members are suffering from major depression or post-traumatic stress, and 320,000 have received brain injuries. Only 43 percent of those with traumatic brain injuries have received medical evaluations. Records from the Department of Veterans Affairs reveal that 120,000 former Armed Forces members have been diagnosed with mental health issues, with half of them having PTSD. Only 53 percent of those with PTSD or depression sought professional help in the past year. Rates of PTSD and depression are highest among female members and Reservists. Improving access to quality mental health care is crucial for supporting both active duty members and veterans. Members of the Armed Forces and veterans may experience lower work productivity without quality mental health care, affecting their physical and mental health, as well as family and social relationships. Cultural and personal stigmas contribute to low rates of veterans seeking mental health care. Improving access to mental health care providers is crucial for returning members from deployment, with community-based providers being valuable assets. Coordination among government and nongovernmental agencies is crucial for successful treatment of Armed Forces members returning from deployment. The Commission on Veterans and Members of the Armed Forces with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, or other mental health disorders caused by service in the Armed Forces is established. The Commission on Veterans and Members of the Armed Forces with PTSD, TBI, or other mental health disorders is established with a chair and 11 members appointed by the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense, including active duty members, retired veterans, VA and DoD employees. The Commission on Veterans and Members of the Armed Forces with PTSD, TBI, or other mental health disorders is established with members appointed by the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense, including active duty members, retired veterans, VA and DoD employees, recognized medical authorities, mental health professionals, and veterans who have undergone treatment for mental health disorders. The commission's duties include consulting with nongovernmental organizations representing veterans, members of the Armed Forces, and their families. The Commission oversees monitoring and treatment of veterans and Armed Forces members with PTSD, TBI, and other mental health disorders. They also conduct a study on the long-term consequences of these disorders, including effective treatments. The Commission monitors and treats veterans and Armed Forces members with PTSD, TBI, and other mental health disorders. They study the effects of seeking mental health care on military careers and the continuity of care during the transition from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs commission develops recommendations to address adverse consequences and reduce stigmas related to mental health disorders in veterans and Armed Forces members. They submit annual reports to Congress detailing their findings and conclusions. The commission under the Department of Veterans Affairs visits treatment locations for veterans with mental health disorders and can request information from federal agencies to carry out oversight and monitoring. The commission may request testimony from members of the Armed Forces, veterans, caregivers, and other sources without interfering with career development. It will be terminated jointly by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense. $1,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010, with additional appropriations for subsequent years as needed. In fiscal year 2010, $1,000,000 is authorized for necessary expenses under this section.
