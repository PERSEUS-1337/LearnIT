Two approaches are explored to enhance generalization and speed of learning, including a novel regularization technique called meta-step gradient pruning and increasing network depth. Empirical evaluation shows improved few-shot image classification results with fewer iterations on Mini-ImageNet dataset and surpassing benchmarks on Omniglot dataset with deeper networks. Traditional machine learning algorithms often require large amounts of training data. In the study, the focus is on meta-learning algorithms that can quickly adapt to new concepts with limited data. Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is highlighted as an approach that learns network initialization on a dataset of tasks, specifically for few-shot image classification. This approach addresses the challenge of learning with sparse data availability and the need for large amounts of training data in traditional machine learning algorithms. The approach of few-shot image classification involves training on a small set of examples per class to classify test images. MAML introduced a first-order variant to reduce computational costs by treating second order derivatives as constants. Reptile algorithm simplified the implementation of first-order meta-learning by eliminating the need for a test set. Our study focuses on using Reptile to improve generalization in first-order meta-learning for fast concept generalization with limited data in few-shot image classification tasks. In this study, techniques like regularization and deeper networks are explored for higher task generalization in first-order meta-learning. The introduction of meta-step gradient pruning helps in regularizing parameter updates, achieving benchmark few-shot image classification accuracies with fewer iterations. Deeper networks in the meta-learning setting also surpass current benchmarks in few-shot image classification. The meta-learning algorithm aims to surpass current benchmarks in few-shot image classification by learning parameter initialization for adapting to new data with few examples. Tasks consist of N classes with K training examples each. The algorithm involves optimizing initialization parameters through training on a dataset of tasks. The approach of MAML involves computing initial parameters \u03b8 to minimize task loss after m iterations. Our approach introduces a regularization method for first-order meta-learning called meta-step gradient pruning. This method simplifies the first-order update by replacing the gradient vector with the difference between updated parameters and initial parameters. This technique is further developed in Section 3 and evaluated empirically in Section 4. The approach introduces meta-step gradient pruning for first-order meta-learning, using hyper-parameters \u03b3 and \u03c8 to control the meta-step update process. Algorithm 1 outlines the modified meta-learning algorithm with gradient pruning, emphasizing smaller updates towards the end of training. Our new addition of meta-step gradient pruning has helped reduce the performance gap between train and test accuracies in few-shot image classification tasks. Additionally, introducing deeper networks in the inner-loop of the algorithm led to a significant increase in accuracy for the Omniglot image classification task. The study introduced meta-step gradient pruning, resulting in improved accuracy for the Omniglot image classification task. Experiments utilized Omniglot BID4 and Mini-ImageNet BID12 datasets for few-shot image classification tasks. Network architectures and data preprocessing followed MAML BID1 methods. Results were compared with first-order MAML BID1 and Reptile BID7. The effects of meta-step gradient pruning were evaluated by analyzing train and test accuracies during training. The study introduced meta-step gradient pruning, showing improved generalization in 1-shot 5-way image classification tasks on Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet datasets. Results after 5000 iterations on Omniglot and 10000 iterations on Mini-ImageNet demonstrated reduced gap between train and test accuracies, outperforming Reptile. Few-shot image classification on Mini-ImageNet also yielded promising results, matching benchmark performance with 10 times fewer iterations, indicating a 10x increase in convergence speed. Our approach of introducing deeper networks in the inner-loop outperformed previous implementations of first-order MAML and Reptile, setting new benchmark results on Omniglot few-shot image classification tasks. However, weaknesses were observed in increased computations and time consumption. The proposed novel approach of meta-step gradient pruning demonstrated enhanced generalization effects on first-order meta-learning outcomes, reducing gaps between train and test set accuracies during training of Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet few-shot classification tasks. Our algorithm improved generalization on the train set, almost matching first-order MAML and Reptile benchmarks with fewer iterations. Deeper networks in the inner-loop for Omniglot few-shot classification surpassed current benchmarks but increased computational complexity. This approach is less efficient when applied to richer input data like Mini-ImageNet. In the future, further analysis and techniques are needed for meta-step gradient pruning and regularization in meta-learning. First-order meta-learning could also be explored in applications like reinforcement learning."
