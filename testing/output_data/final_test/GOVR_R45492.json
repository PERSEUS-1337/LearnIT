    "content": "The 116th Congress may oversee water resource development legislation and address conflicts over water supplies, especially in the West and Southeast. There is interest in federal assistance for water projects, new infrastructure, and improved management of water resources. The 116th Congress may address water resource policy questions regarding federal involvement in infrastructure maintenance, planning, and construction. Congress historically authorizes regional projects for navigation, water supply expansion, flood and drought mitigation, and ecosystem restoration. The Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are responsible for planning and constructing federal water resource projects. Reclamation focuses on projects in arid states for irrigation, while USACE works nationwide to improve navigation, reduce flood damages, and restore aquatic ecosystems. Congress also funds water resource science and monitoring activities at federal agencies like the U.S. Geological Survey. The US Geological Survey (USGS) plays a key role in federal water resource science and observation, including streamgages and groundwater data. Other federal agencies with water-related programs are not covered in this report. The report focuses on topics relevant to the 116th Congress, such as projects by US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and Bureau of Reclamation, Indian water rights settlements, international waters, and water resource science at USGS. Funding for aging and new water projects and transitioning to federal partnerships are also discussed. The 116th Congress may consider questions about trends in annual and supplemental appropriations for US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) water resource activities. Congress typically authorizes USACE projects and policies in an omnibus bill, with annual appropriations around $7 billion. Supplemental appropriations for USACE emergency activities, like flood response, exceeded $17 billion during the 115th Congress. The effectiveness and efficiency of these funding processes may be scrutinized. The omnibus USACE authorization bill, known as a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), is typically considered biennially. Recent acts include America's Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA), the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN Act), and the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014). The 116th Congress may continue the tradition of biennial legislation authorizing USACE studies. The 116th Congress may address USACE-related issues such as funding, financing, project operations, decision-making, and planning practices. Topics include the use of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, investments in coastal harbor projects, USACE budget priorities, public-private partnerships, water storage pricing, recreational policies, security of facilities, tribal consultation policies, nonstructural alternatives, and consideration of future hydrologic conditions. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) faces challenges in managing its $96 billion construction backlog, with annual construction appropriations totaling $2.18 billion for FY2019. Policymakers are considering advancing projects in the backlog, including large-scale projects like the Coastal Texas Protection and Restoration feasibility study estimated at $23 billion to $32 billion. Other studies focus on controlling aquatic nuisance species and addressing future hydrologic conditions. The US Army Corps of Engineers is exploring options for construction financing and contracting for projects like the Asian carp control study and the New York/New Jersey Harbor study. Reclamation has historically built water projects in western states, including the California Central Valley Project and dams on the Colorado and Columbia River systems. Water supplies from Reclamation projects are primarily used for irrigation, with some municipalities also receiving water. Many facilities produce hydropower and offer benefits like flood damage reduction, recreation, and support for fish and wildlife. However, some operations are controversial due to environmental effects. Reclamation's focus has shifted to managing water resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner since the 1980s. Increased population has also influenced their mission. Since the 1980s, Reclamation has focused on managing water resources in an environmentally and economically sound manner. Increased population, prolonged drought, fiscal constraints, and water demands for various purposes have led to pressure to alter project operations. Congress has shown interest in both individual project management and broader agency policies. Recent years have seen expanded authorities and funding for alternative technologies like water recycling, aquifer storage, and desalination to increase water supplies in the West. Some stakeholders support expanded authority and funding for alternative water technologies like aquifer storage and desalination to address water shortages in the West. Others prefer focusing on traditional priorities such as water storage construction projects and infrastructure maintenance. Reclamation projects are typically considered individually by Congress, with authorizations slowing down due to earmark moratoria. Legislation or oversight related to Reclamation water projects may be addressed in the 116th Congress. During the 116th Congress, management issues such as water storage projects, dam safety, infrastructure aging, and drought mitigation may be addressed. Congress may also focus on issues related to the Central Valley Project (CVP) and Reclamation's operation of pumps in the Bay-Delta, particularly concerning water users and endangered species. The WIIN Act of 2016 addressed controversies surrounding water storage projects and authorized a new process for Reclamation projects. The Act's authorities are set to expire in 2020, prompting discussions in the 116th Congress for reauthorization or modification. Other river basins of congressional interest include the Colorado, Columbia, Klamath, and Rio Grande. In the 19th century, federal policies did not address water needs for Indian reservations, leading to disputes over reserved water rights. The 116th Congress may consider approving new Indian water rights settlements and funding existing settlements. Some support settlements to resolve legal issues and provide water delivery certainty, while others may argue against new settlements. The 116th Congress may consider approving new Indian water rights settlements and funding existing settlements. As of 2018, 36 Indian water rights settlements had been federally approved, with total costs exceeding $5.8 billion. Congress has appropriated funding for these activities, including in recent appropriations bills. The primary challenge facing new Indian water rights settlements is the availability of federal funds for implementing ongoing and future agreements that require resources. Settlements often involve constructing new water infrastructure for tribal communities to access their water rights, with federal funding being difficult to obtain. Some settlements are controversial for their potential impact on existing resources. The United States and Canada amended the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 2012 to address environmental challenges and restore the Great Lakes ecosystem. The agreement includes provisions to prevent ecological harm, address aquatic invasive species, habitat degradation, climate change effects, and threats to health and the environment. The United States and Canada have provided funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to address environmental challenges and restore the Great Lakes ecosystem. Congress authorized $300 million annually from FY2017 to FY2021 for the initiative. The International Joint Commission issued the First Triennial Assessment of Progress on Great Lakes Water Quality. The First Triennial Assessment of Progress on Great Lakes Water Quality in November 2017 reported progress in meeting GLWQA objectives, including restoration of contaminated areas, habitat conservation, and prevention of invasive species. Challenges identified included harmful algal blooms, slow chemical concern addressing, invasive species spread, and inadequate waste infrastructure investments. Congress also expressed concerns about a proposed nuclear waste repository. Congress has expressed concerns about a proposed deep geologic repository for nuclear waste by the Bruce nuclear power facility in Kincardine, Ontario, located near Lake Huron. The U.S. Secretary of State was directed to submit a report detailing actions taken and planned to engage Canada in referring the repository to the International Joint Commission for study. The report also requested information on diplomatic and legal steps to address concerns about the Great Lakes water basin protection and review of alternative repository options. The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) is an international agreement between the United States and Canada for the cooperative development and operation of the water resources of the Columbia River basin. Implementation began in 1964, and most provisions continue indefinitely unless terminated with 10 years' notice after 2024. The Columbia River Treaty (CRT) between the United States and Canada can be terminated with at least 10 years' notice. Both countries have shown interest in modifying the treaty, with discussions focusing on the future operation of USACE facilities on the Columbia River. USACE and BPA recommended continuing the treaty after 2024 with modifications, while the Canadian entity overseeing the CRT released its own recommendations in March 2013. The Province of British Columbia recommended continuing the Columbia River Treaty (CRT) with modifications within the Treaty framework in March 2013. Negotiations between the U.S. and Canada began in May 2018, with four rounds completed by the end of 2018. The executive branch may seek Senate approval for any modifications to the CRT, while Congress can also provide oversight on CRT review and negotiation activities. The United States and Mexico share multiple rivers, including the Colorado River and the Rio Grande, which are vital to border communities. The United States and Mexico share multiple rivers, including the Colorado River and the Rio Grande. In 1944, they entered into the 1944 Water Treaty to establish the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) for oversight. Congress oversees IBWC's actions on managing water and infrastructure for drought and ecosystem protection. Hydrologic conditions and state actions on a drought contingency plan may influence agreements with Mexico, such as Minute 323. The agreement with Mexico, known as Minute 323, is in effect from September 2017 through December 2026. Congress oversees topics related to Minute 323 implementation, operations, and deliveries during shortage conditions. Mexico has had challenges meeting its Rio Grande water delivery obligations to the United States since 1994. The IBWC is working to improve the predictability and reliability of Mexico's water deliveries. The USGS conducts water resource science in the United States, assisting decision-makers and federal agencies in managing water resources. It is divided into seven mission areas, including the Water Resources Mission Area, which focuses on collecting, assessing, and disseminating hydrological data and research. The USGS Water Resources Mission Area focuses on streamflow, groundwater, water quality, and water availability. They collect data from 8,200 streamgages, 1,900 water quality-sampling stations, and 1,800 groundwater observation wells nationwide to support disaster responses and water infrastructure operations. The USGS Water Resources Mission Area collects data from thousands of streamgages, water quality-sampling stations, and groundwater observation wells nationwide to support disaster responses and water infrastructure operations. The demand for streamgages has exceeded available resources, with some operated through cooperative partnerships. Congress traditionally focuses on funding streamgages through the National Streamflow Information and Cooperative Water subprograms. Maintaining and expanding observations with cooperative partners is a persistent challenge for USGS. The 116th Congress may oversee USGS water observation programs and funding, addressing recommendations from the 2018 NAS report on challenges in the next 25 years. Recommendations focus on water data collection, standards, and integration of advanced observation capabilities. Aging water infrastructure like dams, locks, and levees poses risks to local and national communities. Aging water infrastructure like dams, locks, and levees poses risks to local and national communities. Major capital investments for repair and rehabilitation would cost billions of dollars, with no comprehensive federal funding solutions enacted. Proposals include modifying loan programs, utilizing project beneficiary revenues, or transferring projects to nonfederal entities. Congress may need more uniform funding mechanisms for water resource infrastructure. In the 115th Congress, proposed legislation aimed to increase reporting on Reclamation's aging infrastructure backlog. Some stakeholders are frustrated with the slow pace of federal funding for water resource projects, leading to local sponsors seeking limited federal support or future reimbursement. Increased nonfederal contributions to project costs were authorized in the WIIN Act. The WIIN Act, WRRDA 2014, and AWIA expanded nonfederal entities' ability to use their funds for USACE projects. New partnership models raise concerns about federal oversight and the appropriate federal investment. Title X of WRRDA 2014 authorized the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) pilot program. The Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) authorized a pilot program for loans and loan guarantees for flood damage reduction, water supply, and wastewater projects. The program is administered by USACE and the EPA, with only the EPA portion currently operational. USACE is developing policies to implement its WIFIA authority, while the 116th Congress may discuss how endangered species designations impact water resource project construction. The 116th Congress may address environmental topics related to water resources, including habitat restoration, aquatic species conservation, harmful algal blooms, and public-private partnerships. Restoration efforts for various ecosystems like the Everglades, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast, Bay-Delta, Chesapeake Bay, Salton Sea, and Klamath Basin may be prioritized. Congress has authorized restoration activities in these areas due to habitat loss and development impacts. The 116th Congress may consider legislation for governance and restoration plans for ecosystems like the Salton Sea, Everglades, and Gulf Coast. Funding challenges for restoration initiatives could arise as decisionmakers evaluate investment priorities. Congress may also assess existing restoration efforts' funding and performance, as well as their balance between water resources and species conservation. Additionally, responses to flood disasters, including improving flood resilience, may be on the agenda. In the United States, flood-related responsibilities are shared between federal and state governments. Congress has established federal programs to assist in reducing flood risks, with states and local governments having discretion in land use decisions. Congress is concerned about financial exposure to flood losses and may consider the costs and benefits of protecting natural features for flood control. In the United States, federal programs aim to conserve and restore natural coastal areas like mangroves and wetlands to reduce flood risks. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act established the Coastal Barrier Resources System to protect low development coastal areas. Nature-based approaches, such as living shorelines and green infrastructure, are used for flood management and risk reduction, supported by various agencies for multiple benefits like erosion reduction and habitat restoration. The WIIN Act mandates federal agencies to consider natural and nature-based features for flood risk management, storm damage reduction, and ecosystem restoration projects. The 116th Congress may examine funding for nature-based infrastructure to protect natural features that reduce flood risk and ensure groundwater, critical for domestic and agricultural water supply, is preserved. Groundwater is a critical component of the U.S. water supply, with nearly half of the population relying on it for domestic and agricultural needs. In 2015, irrigation accounted for 69% of total fresh groundwater withdrawals. Congress typically leaves groundwater management to the states, but there is growing interest in using surface water to recharge aquifers for future use. Aquifer recharge, storage, and recovery are seen as alternatives or additions to surface water reservoirs. Federal support for these efforts is being considered, especially in facilitating state, local, and private groundwater management. Congress has limited guidance in this area but has authorized projects under the WIIN Act. A connection between federal water projects and groundwater enhancement already exists in Arizona. The Central Arizona Project in Arizona and the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in California are examples of state laws aimed at replenishing groundwater. Federal projects like the California Central Valley Project may also play a role in recharging aquifers. Several bills in the 115th Congress addressed groundwater recharge, storage, and recovery. The 116th Congress may introduce legislation addressing groundwater storage projects in specific locations due to increased pumping of groundwater in the western United States. Factors shaping water resource issues include demand for reliable water supplies, hydrologic conditions, infrastructure safety, and alternative financing. The Congress may consider measures proposed in the 115th Congress and new legislative proposals related to water resources. In the water resource area, legislative activity is specific to federal water resource management agencies and water use by various sectors. Congress addresses issues such as coordination of federal water activities, conflicting objectives, environmental statutes, and institutional mechanisms within a federalist framework. In the water resource area, federal water resource responsibilities are shared with state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. Key questions for the 116th Congress include the federal role in maintaining existing water facilities and the involvement in planning and construction of new projects. The Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been instrumental in building large dams and water diversion structures in the United States. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and reservoirs in arid states, providing water for agriculture and millions of people. They also operate power plants generating electricity. In contrast, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers focuses on navigation improvements and flood damage reduction nationwide. USACE is responsible for constructing flood damage reduction and navigation projects, including dams, reservoirs, and hydroelectric plants. They have built thousands of projects across the country, maintaining nearly 12,000 miles of waterways and 1,000 harbors. USACE also helped construct 9,000 miles of the nation's levees, with nonfederal entities operating the majority. The agency's federal water resource construction activities decreased in the late 20th century, ending earlier expansionist policies. Federal investments in dams, hydropower facilities, navigation locks, irrigation diversions, and flood control levees have decreased due to fiscal constraints, changing national priorities, limited construction locations, and environmental impacts."
