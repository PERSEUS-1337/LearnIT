    "content": "Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution outlines the President's power to nominate and appoint various government officials with the Senate's advice and consent. Some appointments made by President Obama and Cabinet Secretaries have been referred to as \"czars,\" either as a title or to suggest centralized power in the White House. The term \"czar\" in political science literature refers to White House policy coordination or intense focus on significant issues. Congress has examined these appointments, with legislative action focusing on prohibiting the use of funds for certain appointees. P.L. 113-76 prohibits funds for specific White House positions. The term \"czar\" in political science literature refers to White House policy coordination or intense focus on significant issues. Legislative action has focused on prohibiting funds for certain appointees in various White House positions, including the Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, Senior Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury, and White House Director of Urban Affairs. P.L. 112-74 and P.L. 113-76 have included provisions to restrict funding for these positions. The President has authority to supervise the Executive Branch, obtain advice, and carry out constitutional responsibilities. Congress may question appointments made outside the Senate's advice and consent process and whether appointees are accountable to Congress. This report provides background information on the role of White House appointees. The President has the authority to supervise the Executive Branch and obtain advice. Congress may question appointments made outside the Senate's advice and consent process. This report provides background information on the role of White House appointees and discusses options to enhance their accountability to Congress. The President's Committee on Administrative Management recommended that the President should be given assistance in managing the Executive branch. The President was recommended to have executive assistants to help manage the government. The Reorganization Act of 1939 allowed the President to propose reorganization plans and appoint administrative assistants. Executive Order 8248 created the Executive Office of the President (EOP), where the President's closest advisors and assistants are located. The EOP includes components established by the President and Congress, such as the White House Office and Office of Management and Budget. Some key components of the White House Office, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, and National Security Council have remained permanent. However, a President may require additional assistance from new offices or positions. The White House is adaptable to a President's changing priorities and can create new structures to support new initiatives or respond to crises. The \"czar\" moniker has been attached to special assistant positions since President Roosevelt's Administration. Various Presidents have appointed special assistants referred to as \"czars,\" such as the energy \"czar\" appointed by President Nixon in 1973. John Love was appointed as the energy \"czar\" in 1973, and John Koskinen was appointed as the Y2K \"czar\" in 1998. President Obama created new positions like Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, Deputy Assistant to the President for Urban Affairs, and Director of the White House Office of Health Reform, all referred to as \"czars.\" Some sub-Cabinet-level positions requiring Senate confirmation have also been termed \"czars,\" like David Hayes, who was called the \"water czar\" during his time as Deputy Secretary at the Department of the Interior. The Brownlow Commission recommended a few executive assistants to the President with no decision-making power, described as possessing high competence and a passion for anonymity. Their role was to extend the President's power to listen. The President's executive assistants were delegated to extend his power to gather information and make decisions. Their functions were not clearly defined, giving them flexibility and ultimate responsibility. They were not an independent institution but an extension of the Presidency itself. Presidents have continued to appoint special assistants to reassure the public of immediate attention. Presidents appoint special assistants to provide immediate attention and a broad viewpoint on crisis situations. However, there is a fundamental imbalance in resources and institutional capacity, leading to politicization and centralization in presidential efforts. The Administration of President Dwight Eisenhower appointed special assistants known as \"Very Special Assistants for Very Special Problems\" to address complex public policy issues quickly. These assistants, also referred to as White House \"Czars,\" allowed the President to take charge and expedite governmental processes without the need for Senate confirmation. The White House appoints special assistants, also known as \"czars,\" to address specific policy issues quickly. These individuals are tasked with cutting red tape and ensuring coordinated efforts, although their effectiveness can vary. The success of these appointees in working with other government entities is uncertain. The White House appoints special assistants, or \"czars,\" to address specific policy issues quickly. These individuals are tasked with driving those they work with towards a plan to present to the president, but some aspects of their role are undefined. Budgetary power, accountability to Congress, and the capacity to dictate policy are unclear. The ability to impose solutions through sheer force of personality is possible in some cases. Concerns are raised about the size of the White House staff and the potential for too many advisors to insulate the President and diminish his direct influence. In his book, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. discusses how a growing staff can lead to endless meetings, useless paperwork, and shield the President from important information. Czars appointed to address specific policy issues may disrupt lines of authority, compromise discipline, and undermine morale within the Executive branch. The concentration of power in White House assistants has led to the decline of the Cabinet's role, as officials feel overshadowed and marginalized. This shift has been noted since the Kennedy administration, with the Cabinet being described as enfeebled and reduced to faceless clerks. Senator Hollings highlighted the diminishing influence of the Cabinet in a 1971 speech. The White House assistants now hold more power, overshadowing Cabinet officials who feel marginalized. Cabinet roles have diminished since the Kennedy administration, with officials like Secretary of Commerce having to consult White House staff for information. Former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta acknowledges the importance of Cabinet secretaries but notes that cross-agency issues are prioritized by the President. The White House aims to centralize decision-making to align with the president's priorities, utilizing czars to bypass bureaucratic obstacles. However, this approach may not enhance government efficiency as intended, as presidents often prioritize political connections over institutional capacity. Presidents often bring issues to the White House to achieve policy objectives, but this can strain limited resources. A study found that White House assistants have gained power without accountability. There is debate on whether Senate approval should be required for senior White House staff positions. The debate revolves around whether Senate confirmation should be necessary for senior White House staff positions, with one viewpoint emphasizing the need for bipartisan deliberation and the other highlighting the president's inherent right to seek advice and consent. Regardless of the perspective, the Constitution grants Congress extensive authority to oversee executive branch activities. Section 105 of Title 3 of the United States Code allows the President to appoint employees in the White House Office, with salary limits for high-ranking positions. Section 113 requires the President to submit annual reports to Congress on White House office activities. The annual reports to the public include information on the number of employees in specific White House offices paid at certain salary levels, as well as the aggregate amount paid to these employees. The annual report must include details on employees in White House offices paid below the minimum GS-16 rate, individuals detailed for more than 30 days, and services procured under 3 U.S.C. Chapter 2. The report must be submitted within 60 days after the fiscal year. Additionally, the President is required to submit an annual report on White House Office personnel to the Senate Committee on. The President must submit an annual report on White House Office personnel to Congress, including names, positions, titles, and pay rates. Exclusions can be made for national defense or foreign policy reasons, with details provided to Senate and House committees upon request. President Obama submitted the most recent report on July 1, 2013. The term \"czar\" has been applied to various political positions in the federal government, filled through political appointment rather than civil service selection. These positions are usually filled at the beginning of each administration, requiring a vetting process for nominees. The vetting process for presidential appointees involves examining nominees' backgrounds, assessing their qualifications, and meeting Senate confirmation demands. It includes FBI background checks, financial disclosure reviews by the Office of Government Ethics, and White House data statement reviews. Some aspects are legally mandated, while others, like the content of the White House data statement, vary. The vetting process for presidential appointees involves examining nominees' backgrounds, assessing qualifications, and meeting Senate confirmation demands. The honesty and thoroughness of the individual being vetted are crucial for a smooth process. Background investigations vary based on the individual's circumstances and are formalized in executive orders. The requirements for background checks are formalized in various executive orders, directives, and laws. These checks serve different purposes, involve different processes, and are conducted by different authorities. They include questionnaire responses, database searches, and interviews with various individuals. Vetting investigations differ from security clearances, with vetting often being time-sensitive and secretive, while security clearances are more extensive and less secretive. Suitability checks are for government employment, while security clearances are for determining access levels. The U.S. Secret Service conducts background investigations for individuals in close proximity to protective assignments for high-level officials. Security clearances are more extensive than suitability checks for government employment. The Secret Service conducts background investigations for individuals in close proximity to protective assignments for high-level officials in the Executive Office of the President. The President has the authority to exempt individuals from background investigation requirements. The President has the authority to exempt individuals from background investigation requirements for certain hires, as outlined in Executive Order 13467 issued by President George W. Bush in 2008. The Executive Order exempts certain individuals from background investigation requirements for specific hires within the executive branch, excluding the President, Vice President, and their respective employees as specified by law. The order allows the President and Vice President to appoint and determine the pay of employees to assist in their executive duties. The definition of \"agency\" in E.O. 13467 reinforces presidential discretion and includes executive agencies, military departments, and other entities within the executive branch that handle classified information. E.O. 12968 exempts the President and Vice President from background investigation requirements for specific hires within the executive branch. The financial disclosure requirements for federal government officers and employees, including those appointed by the President, depend on their compensation and days worked. Those compensated above a certain threshold and working more than 60 days in a year must file public financial disclosure reports. Federal government officials meeting compensation thresholds and working a certain number of days must file public financial disclosure reports annually under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Reports are submitted within 30 days of assuming a position and on May 15 each year, reviewed by designated ethics officers, and made public within 30 days of filing. Senate-confirmed nominees must comply with these requirements. When the President nominates someone for Senate confirmation, the nominee must file a financial disclosure statement within five days. This statement is submitted to the agency ethics officer and then to the Office of Government Ethics, who shares it with the Senate committee. Confidential financial disclosure reports are required for those below salary thresholds to complement public disclosures. The confidential reporting requirements apply to lower-level employees compensated below a certain threshold rate, who have duties related to government contracting, grants, subsidies, auditing, or other governmental tasks that require avoiding financial conflicts of interest. These employees may need to file a confidential report if they perform these duties for more than 60 days. The disclosure provisions of federal law and regulation apply to \"special Government employees\" in the executive branch who serve on advisory committees for more than 60 days. This does not apply to representatives of outside entities appointed to advisory committees. Presidential appointees to full-time noncareer positions may not receive compensation from outside employment activities during their appointment. This includes employees appointed to positions in the Executive Schedule or by Presidential appointment, with some exceptions. Statutory limitations on outside income apply to federal officials who are not full-time employees, but work for the government for more than 130 days a year. These restrictions are based on the official's federal compensation rate and days of government employment. Federal officials are subject to statutory limitations on outside earned income based on their federal compensation rate, days of government employment, and nature of appointment. Covered officials cannot exceed 15% of the annual pay for a Level II executive and are restricted from receiving compensation for certain professional services involving a fiduciary relationship. Federal officials are subject to limitations on outside earned income based on their federal compensation rate. Covered officials cannot serve for compensation as an officer or member of the board of any entity, or receive compensation for teaching without approval. These restrictions apply to those compensated above a GS-15 level or 120% of the minimum rate of base pay for a GS-15. A \"covered noncareer employee\" is defined as someone appointed to a position above GS-15 or with a pay rate equal to or greater than 120% of the minimum GS-15 pay rate, excluding certain positions like those in the uniformed services or foreign service below a certain level. A covered noncareer employee is someone appointed to a position above GS-15 or with a pay rate equal to or greater than 120% of the minimum GS-15 pay rate, excluding certain positions like those in the uniformed services or foreign service below the level of assistant Secretary or Chief of Mission. The term \"officer or employee\" excludes \"special Government employees\" who work no more than 130 days in a year. All executive branch officers and employees must adhere to conflict of interest and ethical standards. Concerns have been raised about the President's hiring of advisors potentially bypassing the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes the process for appointing Ambassadors, public Ministers, Judges of the supreme Court, and other Officers of the United States. Senate confirmation is required for principal officers, while Congress may choose to vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President, courts of law, or heads of departments. The Appointments Clause in the U.S. Constitution outlines the process for appointing government officials. Congress has the authority to create and structure the executive branch, while the President cannot establish executive offices. Congress can use its legislative power to determine qualifications, appointments, and standards for office operation. The judiciary generally does not interfere with this process. The Appointments Clause in the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to create and structure executive branch offices. The judiciary only interferes when Congress oversteps its power. It is crucial for Congress to adhere to the strictures of the Appointments Clause when appointing individuals to certain offices, distinguishing between officers and employees to determine compliance with constitutional requirements. The Appointments Clause in the U.S. Constitution allows Congress to create and structure executive branch offices. It is important to differentiate between officers and employees to ensure compliance with constitutional requirements. Congress must establish an office for officers subject to Senate confirmation, while inferior officers may be appointed in various ways. The Supreme Court has clarified that employees are subordinate to officers of the United States. The Supreme Court has clarified that employees are subordinate to officers of the United States. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court analyzed provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which established the Federal Election Commission (FEC) with a specific composition requirement. The Supreme Court analyzed the powers and duties of the FEC, concluding that it exercises executive power due to its enforcement authority. The Court established that the Appointments Clause applies to agencies with any connection to the executive branch. The Supreme Court ruled that the Appointments Clause applies to agencies connected to the executive branch. The Federal Election Campaign Act's method of appointment violated this clause as certain powers could only be exercised by \"Officers of the United States,\" who must be appointed in accordance with the clause. The Court defined \"Officers of the United States\" as appointees with significant authority under US laws, including both principal and inferior officers. The FEC commissioners were considered inferior officers and their appointment needed to comply with the Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court found that FEC commissioners were inferior officers requiring Senate confirmation for appointment, as they held significant authority under US laws. Justice White further elaborated on the duties and powers of the FEC, confirming them as \"Officers of the United States.\" In Edmond v. United States, it was declared that significant authority under US laws determines the distinction between officer and non-officer for Appointments Clause purposes. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) further clarified that a federal government appointee to a position with significant authority is required to be an 'Officer of the United States,' with three independent conditions that must be met. OLC interprets \"significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States\" as shorthand for essential elements of a public office, involving delegation of sovereign powers and a continuing position. The concept of an \"office\" for the Appointments Clause involves a position with delegated sovereign authority that is permanent or temporary, depending on certain factors. These factors include the position not being personal, not being transient, and having duties that are more than incidental to government operations. The nature of the delegated authority determines if a temporary position qualifies as an office. For example, the special independent counsel position in Morrison v. Olson was considered an office under the Appointments Clause. The special independent counsel position in Morrison v. Olson was deemed subject to the Appointments Clause due to its indefinite nature, core prosecutorial powers, and court-defined jurisdiction. The position required the appointment to comply with the Appointments Clause when it involved delegation of sovereign authority and ongoing duties. The Appointments Clause requires a determination of whether an officer is a principal or inferior officer based on their authority. Senate confirmation is needed for principal officers, while Congress can appoint inferior officers without advice and consent. The distinction between principal and inferior officers is not clearly defined by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has noted the unclear distinction between 'inferior' and 'principal' officers for Appointments Clause purposes. Factors considered include removal by a higher officer, limited duties, narrow jurisdiction, and limited tenure. In Morrison v. Olson, the special independent counsel was deemed an inferior officer. Each government position must be evaluated individually. The term 'inferior officer' typically involves supervision by higher-ranking officers below the President. In analyzing whether one may be an inferior officer, the Court's decisions focus on the extent of the officer's discretion to make policy choices and the powers to supervise and remove the officer. Advisor positions have unique characteristics and duties. This section examines the application of the Appointments Clause to positions like the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Director of the White House Office. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is responsible for developing and overseeing national drug control policy. The Director of ONDCP is appointed by the President and holds a Cabinet-level rank. The Director evaluates the effectiveness of drug control programs and sets specific goals and performance measurements. The Director of ONDCP, appointed by the President, is responsible for establishing policies, goals, and priorities for the National Drug Control Policy. This includes submitting the National Drug Control Strategy, overseeing its implementation, making recommendations to agency heads, and representing drug policies to Congress. The Director of ONDCP has the power to appoint officers and employees, as well as fund projects to reduce drug use. The question of whether the Director qualifies as a US officer is raised due to the nature of their responsibilities. The Director of ONDCP has significant authority, appoints officers and employees, funds projects, and may be considered a principal officer of the United States. President Obama established the White House Office of Urban Affairs within the EOP, headed by the Deputy Assistant to the President, Director of Urban Affairs. The Director coordinates urban policy development across executive departments, ensures effective spending of federal funds in urban areas, and reports to key officials within the administration. The Office of Urban Affairs, established by President Obama, aims to coordinate urban policy development, ensure effective federal fund spending in urban areas, and collaborate with state, local officials, nonprofits, and the private sector. It works closely with specified agencies and does not interfere with existing authorities or functions. The Director of Urban Affairs, despite having political influence and the \"ear of the President,\" does not exercise significant legal authority like other officers in the government. The Secretary of the Treasury established the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, known as the \"Pay Czar,\" under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The Special Master serves at the pleasure of the Secretary and has the authority to interpret restrictions on executive compensation. The Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, or \"Pay Czar,\" has the authority to interpret and administer restrictions on executive compensation for TARP recipient employees. This includes reviewing past compensation payments, approving current payments and structures, providing advisory opinions, and other related duties as delegated by the Secretary. The Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation has the authority to interpret and administer restrictions on executive compensation for TARP recipient employees. The Special Master's final determinations are considered final and binding, treated as the determination of the Treasury, and not subject to review by the Secretary. The Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation may be exercising significant authority, raising a constitutional issue on whether he should be appointed by the President subject to Senate confirmation. The Special Inspector General for TARP questioned if the Special Master is a principal officer due to the lack of control by the Secretary over his actions. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) concluded that the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation is not a principal officer and can be removed at will. OLC disagreed with the Special Inspector General for TARP's interpretation that the Secretary lacks control over the Special Master's decisions. Treasury's view is that the Secretary can review the Special Master's decisions, as the regulation does not clearly preclude Secretarial supervisory authority. OLC concluded that the Special Master is an officer rather than an employee of the United States, qualifying as an inferior officer. However, establishing this office through a rule may raise constitutional concerns as Congress did not explicitly establish the Office of Special Master or grant the Secretary the authority to appoint such an officer. The Special Master is considered an officer, with the argument that Congress implicitly authorized the office's establishment. An Appointments Clause analysis should be done on a case-by-case basis, looking at the functions and duties of the position to determine if significant authority is exercised. Exerting political influence does not necessarily equate to legal authority under US laws. The Appointments Clause analysis should be done on a case-by-case basis to determine if significant authority is exercised in a position. Congress has broad legal authority to obtain information for oversight purposes, which is essential to its legislative function as established by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has emphasized Congress's power to investigate waste, fraud, abuse, and maladministration within government departments. This investigative power allows Congress to expose corruption, inefficiency, and waste in federal agencies. The Court has recognized Congress's authority to inquire into and publicize corruption and inefficiencies in government agencies. The scope of Congress's power of inquiry is described as penetrating and far-reaching. The Supreme Court has emphasized Congress's power to investigate waste, fraud, abuse, and maladministration within government departments, stating that the scope of its power of inquiry is as penetrating and far-reaching as its power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution. The Court has also affirmed that the issuance of subpoenas by Congress is a legitimate use of its investigative power, as obtaining necessary information is essential for effective legislation. The power of congressional inquiry is essential for effective legislation, but it must be exercised within limits set by the Supreme Court. Congress's investigative power is as broad as its power to legislate, but it cannot be used solely for exposure. The Watkins Court emphasized that Congress is not a law enforcement agency and inquiries must be justified by legislative functions. The power of congressional inquiry is essential for effective legislation, but must be related to a legitimate task of Congress. Investigative committees have substantial authority within their jurisdiction. Special advisors to the President are criticized for lack of Senate confirmation, leading to limited congressional oversight. The connection between confirmation power and oversight is based on practice, not legal grounds. The Senate's confirmation power is constitutionally grounded, while congressional oversight is based on tradition and practice. The lack of a confirmation hearing for special advisors to the President does not impact Congress's authority to conduct oversight. In recent years, Senate committees have found that obtaining on-the-record commitments from nominees during confirmation hearings has improved future oversight efforts. These commitments have changed the practical relationship between Congress and the executive branch but have not altered the legal dynamic. Nominees' promises have allowed Congress to fulfill oversight responsibilities without resorting to compulsory measures like subpoenas. However, the executive branch is not legally required to comply with congressional requests. The executive branch is not legally obligated to respond to congressional committee requests unless a subpoena is issued. Even if a nominee commits to cooperating with oversight during confirmation hearings, the executive branch can still assert privilege or legal rights to withhold information. Congress has not relinquished its ability to extract information through subpoenas. The relationship between the branches remains contentious, as evidenced by the reluctance of nine Cabinet-level officials to comply with requests. The relationship between the executive branch and Congress remains contentious, with nine Cabinet-level officials facing contempt of Congress for failing to produce subpoenaed documents. Congressional oversight authority is broad, allowing committees to seek testimony even from unconfirmed officials. Confirmation hearings may make oversight less acrimonious, but lack of confirmation does not affect Congress's ability to exercise oversight prerogatives. Congress's oversight authority allows inquiries of presidential advisors, who may claim privileges for sensitive information. The Administration can assert \"deliberative process\" privilege for policy development details. The \"deliberative process\" privilege protects internal communications during policy development to maintain decision-making integrity and prevent premature disclosure of proposed policies. Congressional practice allows for discretion in accepting such privileges, but appellate courts may override it with a showing of need. The \"executive privilege\" or \"presidential communications privilege\" can be claimed by the Administration to protect certain presidential advisors' roles. Most interbranch disputes are resolved through negotiation rather than court intervention. The presidential confidentiality privilege was established during the Watergate-related lawsuits in the 1970s. The presidential communications privilege, rooted in the U.S. constitutional scheme of separated powers, has been established through court decisions involving interbranch information access disputes. These rulings, including United States v. Nixon, have outlined the broad contours of the privilege, allowing the President to invoke it to protect documents reflecting presidential decision making and deliberations. The presidential communications privilege allows the President to protect materials reflecting decision making and deliberations, which can be overridden with a showing of need. Courts can balance executive privilege against congressional demands if accommodation efforts fail, with gaps in the law addressed in key judicial rulings. The presidential communications privilege allows the President to protect decision-making materials, which can be overridden with a showing of need. The D.C. Circuit panel in In re Sealed Case addressed key issues regarding the privilege, potentially altering the legal landscape for resolving disputes. The D.C. Circuit's ruling in the Judicial Watch case reinforces the importance of the presidential privilege in resolving disputes. In re Sealed Case addressed unresolved issues related to the privilege, such as its parameters, extent down the chain of command, and requirements to overcome a valid claim of privilege. The case stemmed from an OIC investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, where President Clinton ordered an investigation by the White House Counsel's Office. The White House Counsel's Office prepared a report for the President, publicly released on October 11, 1994. Secretary Espy announced his resignation on October 3. The Independent Counsel was appointed on September 9, and a grand jury issued a subpoena for documents related to the report on October 14. The President withheld 84 documents citing executive and deliberative process privileges. The district court quashed the subpoena, but the appeals court reversed the decision. The appeals court reversed the district court's decision regarding executive privileges. The court distinguished between the \"presidential communications privilege\" and the \"deliberative process privilege,\" explaining their differences and thresholds for overcoming them. The presidential communications privilege applies only to direct decision-making by the President and requires a substantial showing to be overcome. On the other hand, the deliberative process privilege applies generally to executive branch officials, has a lower threshold of need to be overcome, and disappears in cases of government misconduct. The presidential privilege applies to all documents, covering final, post-decisional, and pre-deliberative materials. The court ruled that the privilege extends to communications made by presidential advisors in preparing advice for the President, even if not directly to the President, to ensure advisors have freedom from the public spotlight and access to information. The court limited the presidential privilege to White House staff with \"operational proximity\" to direct presidential decision making to prevent the privilege from expanding to a large swath of the executive branch. The presidential communications privilege should be narrowly construed to protect the confidentiality of the President's decision-making process. It should only apply to White House staff with significant responsibility for formulating advice to the President, not extending to staff in executive branch agencies. The presidential communications privilege applies to communications close to the President, authored or solicited by advisers advising on official government matters. It should not shield information on governmental operations not requiring direct decision-making by the President. The presidential communications privilege applies to communications of \"dual hat\" presidential advisers involved in advising the President on key decision-making processes. The appeals court limits this privilege to direct decision-making by the President, focusing on functions central to presidential authority. In a specific case regarding the President's appointment and removal power concerning Secretary Espy, the court emphasized the core of presidential power. The court's decision limits the presidential communications privilege to direct decision-making by the President, tying it to Article II functions that are \"quintessential and non-delegable.\" This contrasts with \"presidential powers and responsibilities\" that can be delegated or performed without the President's direct involvement. The court's decision limits the presidential communications privilege to direct decision-making by the President, tying it to Article II functions that are \"quintessential and non-delegable,\" such as the commander-in-chief power, the sole authority to receive ambassadors, negotiate treaties, and grant pardons. Decision making by agency heads in areas like prosecutorial decision making, rulemaking, and environmental policy would not necessarily be covered. The President's role in supervising and coordinating decision making in the executive branch remains unimpeded, but his communications may not be protected by a constitutionally based privilege. The court's view of the presidential communications privilege is based on the President's Article II powers and responsibilities, aiming to ensure confidentiality for high-quality decision-making. The privilege is rooted in the need for candid and honest advice to explore policy alternatives thoroughly. The presidential communications privilege ensures confidentiality for high-quality decision-making by allowing the President to explore policy alternatives thoroughly. This privilege should not be used to shield information that does not require direct decision-making by the President, as seen in the Judicial Watch case. The district court held that the presidential communications privilege did not extend to internal Justice Department documents related to advising the President on his constitutional pardon authority. The appeals court reversed this decision, stating that such documents are protected by the deliberative process privilege if they were not solicited and received by the President or his Office. The panel majority emphasized that the \"solicited and received\" limitation is necessary for the presidential communications privilege, as seen in the Espy case. The privilege can only be invoked when presidential advisors in close proximity to the President who advise on non-delegable matters have solicited and received documents or the President has received them. The court rejected the government's argument that the privilege should apply to all departmental and agency communications related to the Deputy Attorney General's pardon recommendations for the President, stating that such a rule is inconsistent with the nature of the privilege and the public interest. The presidential communications privilege applies to documents and recommendations submitted to the President by the Deputy Attorney General, ensuring protection for internal communications with immediate Presidential advisers. The Judicial Watch panel clarified that the presidential communications privilege does not extend to Cabinet department heads or their staff, emphasizing the unique role of the President in this privilege. The Espy court extended the presidential privilege down the chain of command to the President's immediate White House advisors, ensuring full and frank advice while considering openness in government. The Judicial Watch court tested the principles established in the Espy case regarding the presidential privilege. It determined that communications from staff outside the White House in executive branch agencies, not solicited and received by immediate White House advisors, were not protected. The court found that officials involved in the pardon decision were too remote from the President and his senior advisors to be covered by the privilege. The 2008 district court opinion in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers defined the outer contours of executive privilege. In response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, President Bush asserted executive privilege regarding the termination and replacement of U.S. Attorneys. The White House Counsel asserted executive privilege in response to subpoenas, ordering Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten not to produce documents or testify. The House approved criminal contempt citations against them, leading to a civil action for enforcement of the subpoenas. The district court's 2008 opinion rejected the executive's broad conception of executive privilege. The district court's 2008 opinion rejected the executive's position that senior advisors to the President are immune from congressional subpoenas, noting that advisers routinely testify before Congress. The court reaffirmed Congress's oversight role and the enforcement of its subpoenas, but did not address specific claims of executive privilege. The Obama Administration negotiated a compromise with the House regarding the release of documents and testimony from Ms. Miers. This compromise set important qualifications on the presidential communications privilege, requiring the communication to relate to a \"quintessential and non-delegable presidential power.\" The presidential communications privilege is limited to White House and Executive Office boundaries, requiring close advisor involvement. It can be overcome by a showing of need by an investigating authority. The privilege did not apply in Judicial Watch case. The law of executive privilege applies to potential congressional oversight of presidential advisors on a case-by-case basis. Advisors within the Executive Office of the President may claim the \"presidential communications privilege,\" but it is unclear if information sought from them would meet the criteria for withholding under executive privilege. Advisors within the Executive Office of the President may claim the \"presidential communications privilege,\" but it is essential that the communications relate to a \"quintessential and non-delegable presidential power\" to qualify for protection. While advisors like the National Security Advisor likely meet this criteria, others such as the Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change may not. The presidential communications privilege is a qualified one that can be overcome by a showing of need and unavailability of information elsewhere. Legislation by Congress may satisfy the need requirement, and the difficulty of obtaining information will depend on the source. Advisors placed in executive agencies may find it harder to justify the privilege the farther they are from the Executive Office of the President. Advisors in executive agencies may struggle to justify the presidential communications privilege, leading them to assert the common law \"deliberative process\" privilege instead. This privilege is subject to the discretion of the committee chair and raises more difficult political concerns. Advisors within agencies, like the Pardon Attorney in Judicial Watch, may not be considered protected under the presidential communications privilege due to lack of \"operational proximity\" to the President. One option that might be considered is a change to the President's authority to hire non-advice and consent persons within the EOP. Currently, federal law allows the President to hire EOP employees at specific salary levels without needing to justify to Congress how those positions are filled or salaries determined. Adopting a solution to this lack of information could involve legislative or non-legislative options. One solution to the lack of information on how EOP positions are filled or salary levels determined could be a \"report and wait\" provision, requiring Congress to review materials before selected personnel can start work. Federal courts have upheld such provisions as a constitutional exercise of Congress's oversight functions. The United States Congress has a well-developed committee system, where committee chairmen and members gain expertise in specific subjects. The executive branch must consider and keep these committees informed, responding to their inquiries. Committees can wield significant influence over executive branch actions without needing a \"report and wait\" provision. This informal cooperation is necessary due to the separation of powers in the U.S. government. While \"report and wait\" provisions are constitutionally valid, they do not legally obligate Congress to take any action. Under this provision, if Congress does not act within a specified timeframe, the employee can begin work. Congress must follow constitutional requirements for bicameralism and presentment to nullify a presidential action, requiring passage by both houses and the President's signature. Other mechanisms for Congress to express its views include committee hearings and other means. Congress could potentially codify positions within the Executive Office of the President on a case-by-case basis, subjecting them to the Senate confirmation process. This would address concerns about presidential advisors exerting political influence without Senate oversight. In the past, Congress has taken similar actions, such as during the Nixon Administration. During the Nixon Administration, Congress passed legislation requiring Senate confirmation for Directors and Deputy Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), setting four-year terms and transferring powers from the President to the OMB Director. Despite arguments against confirmation, Congress believed the OMB's role had evolved, justifying the need for Senate confirmation. The establishment of the OMB in 1921 justified Senate confirmation for its Director and Deputy Director. Congress could consider codifying positions created by the President for his assistants, but questions arise about making these positions permanent. Options include reducing the number of employee-assistants the President can hire or requiring Senate confirmation for them. Congress could potentially limit the President's ability to hire employee-assistants by reducing the number allowed or requiring Senate confirmation for these positions. This could force the President to rely on existing agency positions for policy coordination. However, the President could still utilize individuals outside the government for similar roles. In the past, Congress has considered requiring Senate confirmation for certain positions in the Executive Office of the President. Future appointments of certain positions in the Executive Office of the President may be subject to Senate confirmation, as proposed by a bill focusing on key roles such as the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs believes these officers have significant responsibilities beyond mere advisors to the President. Congress's insistence on limiting exemptions from confirmation to genuine staff assistants aims to uphold the intended role of the confirmation process as outlined in the Constitution. However, subjecting these employees to Senate confirmation could potentially diminish the significance of the advice and consent requirement typically reserved for higher-ranking officers. The process of Senate confirmation for certain positions in the Executive Office of the President is debated, with concerns about potentially diminishing the significance of the advice and consent requirement. Congressional oversight may involve conducting hearings on related issues. Congress may want to conduct oversight hearings on issues related to White House staff positions, such as reporting requirements, duties, responsibilities, planned initiatives, and vetting processes for high-level appointees. This could include examining the content of the White House questionnaire and background investigations. Congress may consider creating a special joint committee to address the increase of presidential advisors not subject to Senate confirmation. This committee would have jurisdiction over executive branch employees created by non-legislative actions, such as executive orders or presidential memoranda. It could consist of both House and Senate members to exercise oversight prerogatives held by both chambers. Congress could establish a committee, through a concurrent resolution, to review the qualifications and responsibilities of presidential appointees not requiring Senate confirmation. The committee would have bipartisan membership and authority to hold hearings, issue subpoenas, and report findings, similar to a confirmation hearing process. A committee could be established by Congress to review the qualifications of non-confirmation presidential appointees. This committee would have the authority to hold hearings and provide oversight on the hiring of advisors in the executive branch, without the need for a final vote on their qualifications. The specialized function of this committee would allow for consistent review of advisors' qualifications and legal issues they may face. A committee could be established by Congress to review the qualifications of non-confirmation presidential appointees in the executive branch. This specialized committee would focus solely on oversight of advisor hiring, allowing for consistent review without distractions from other legislative concerns. However, existing standing committees may already possess the necessary knowledge and expertise to conduct oversight effectively. The Senate committees held hearings on the appointment of \"czars\" in the Executive Branch in October 2009. Senator Russell Feingold emphasized the need for oversight to ensure that individuals in the White House are exercising legal authority. The Senate committees held hearings on the appointment of \"czars\" in the Executive Branch in October 2009 to ensure individuals in the White House are not exercising unauthorized legal authority. Senator Tom Coburn emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in government, while Senator Richard Durbin highlighted the need for public officials to be transparent and accountable to Congress. Public officials, including those who work for the President, should be responsive to congressional inquiries. Members of Congress can expect to be fully informed about the activities of executive branch officials designated by the president. Senator John Cornyn expressed concerns about the accountability of President Obama's czars, noting that some may have authority typically reserved for principal officers. Some of Obama's czars may have significant authority similar to principal officers, raising concerns about lack of Senate confirmation. Their unchecked decision-making and control over taxpayer funds without accountability is troubling. Testimony from five witnesses highlighted these issues before a subcommittee. Bradley H. Patterson, Jr., a scholar on the presidency, discussed the definition of \"czar\" and the lack of Senate confirmation for White House advisors. He stated that White House staff members, including czars, do not require Senate approval and do not typically testify before congressional committees unless criminality is alleged. In discussing the concept of \"czars\" in the White House, it is highlighted that these advisors do not require Senate approval and typically do not testify before congressional committees unless criminality is alleged. White House staff members are responsible solely to the President and are not held accountable to Congress or the Supreme Court. The President is ultimately accountable to the American electorate. The rise of government by bureaucrats, due to power delegation from Congress to administrative agencies, has led to efforts by presidents to control the bureaucratic state through various mechanisms, including the appointment of czars. Tuan Samahon, associate professor at Villanova University School of Law, discussed the meaning of the term \"officer\" under the Constitution. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion in 2007 synthesizing the Supreme Court's opinions on who qualifies as an officer for appointments clause purposes. To be considered an officer, one must hold a position delegated with significant authority by legal authority and the position must be continuing. John C. Harrison discussed the legal requirements for exercising authority and whether White House staff meet these criteria. The appointments clause is a necessary condition for legal authority in the government, requiring individuals in the executive branch to be appointed as either superior or inferior officers. Only the president has constitutional power, making it doubtful if White House staff, often referred to as czars, can exercise legal authority. Influence in the government may differ from formal legal authority. In the government, White House staff members have significant influence but lack formal legal authority. The question of whether this division is beneficial is a complex policy issue. TJ Halstead testified on the Appointments Clause and the limitations on White House advisors' authority. The Appointments Clause applies to White House advisors, but it's unclear if legal challenges would be successful. Legislative proposals may not limit presidential use of advisors. Congress's oversight role may be the most effective response to this issue. The oversight prerogatives of Congress, recognized by Supreme Court precedent, allow for engagement in oversight related to legislative functions. Congressional power extends to receiving testimony from presidential advisers, as shown by past instances. The oversight process requires sustained effort from members of Congress and their staff. A robust oversight regime focusing on specific executive actions taken by political advisers could help Congress assert its constitutional prerogatives. Senator Feingold clarified that none of the witnesses had concerns about appointments clause issues for White House advisers. He questioned what actions would trigger such concerns and how the duty to coordinate policy development should be analyzed. Mr. Harrison and Mr. Spalding discussed the potential issues with White House advisers coordinating policy development between departments, highlighting concerns about giving orders with legal authority or taking binding measures themselves. Mr. Spalding used the example of the climate czar negotiating automobile emissions standards based on a Supreme Court interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act was discussed in relation to potential issues with White House advisers coordinating policy development between departments. Concerns were raised about the extent of influence an NSC staffer may have on foreign policy decisions compared to a Senate-confirmed assistant secretary of state. Senator Feingold questioned the balance of power in these situations. Mr. Patterson noted that President Obama did not accept the recommendation for the assistant to the president for national security affairs to be confirmed by the Senate and have more authority. Recommendations from NSC staff would go through the national security advisor. Senator Coburn asked for a legal analysis of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation's position on recovering executive compensation. Mr. Harrison highlighted the need to determine the secretary of the treasury's authority in this matter. The question at hand is whether the secretary of the treasury had the authority to create the office for Mr. Feinberg under TARP or other legislation, and if he is appropriately exercising it. Additionally, it needs to be determined if Mr. Feinberg, as an inferior officer, receives adequate supervision from a Senate-confirmed principal officer. The extent of oversight by the secretary of the treasury or another higher officer in the Department of the Treasury is crucial in this evaluation. The Supreme Court and lower courts have addressed the level of supervision required for inferior officers to operate within permissible limits. The inferior officer must be subject to substantial supervision from a higher authority. Testifying about the legal relationship between the secretary of the treasury and Mr. Feinberg can shed light on the level of supervision. The Treasury Department likely considers Mr. Feinberg an inferior officer due to his significant authority. Mr. Spalding emphasized the need for Congress to be cautious in granting legislative discretion that led to the creation of czars, citing the TARP legislation as an example. Mr. Spalding emphasized caution in granting legislative discretion that led to the creation of czars, citing the TARP legislation as an example. Mr. Samahon highlighted the importance of statutes clearly defining who has the power to appoint inferior officers. Senator Feingold questioned if Mr. Feinberg, an officer in the Treasury Department, could testify, to which Mr. Halstead confirmed there were no restrictions. Since the end of World War II, roughly 75 instances have occurred where high-level presidential advisers have appeared before congressional committees. While there is no structural separation of powers prohibition against their appearance, it can be challenging to compel their testimony. The Senate often secures commitments from nominees to appear before committees when requested, including the secretary of the treasury or other appointed individuals. The Senate secures commitments from high-level presidential advisers to appear before committees, including the secretary of the treasury. Mr. Spalding emphasized the importance of responsibility and accountability in the modern administrative state. Senator Feingold highlighted the need for clear laws to define accountability. Senator Feingold raised concerns about the potential overlap of responsibilities between a special envoy to Sudan and the assistant secretary for the bureau of African affairs. Mr. Harrison stated that as long as the special envoy is appointed correctly and lines of authority are clearly defined, there should not be a constitutional issue. The main concern is ensuring clarity in decision-making and accountability. Mr. Samahon and Mr. Halstead discussed the importance of clarity in government roles and the potential legal issues surrounding the appointment of a special envoy. They emphasized the need for proper setup and functioning of the government, with Mr. Samahon highlighting concerns about the OLC opinion on diplomatic functions and officerhood requirements. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on \"Presidential Advice and Consent: The Past, Present, and Future of Policy Czars\" on October 22, 2009. Mr. Halstead emphasized the importance of congressional oversight in investigating allegations of maladministration and governmental inefficiency. Senator Feingold raised concerns about positions created by administrations without Senate approval, suggesting the need for proper checks and balances in place. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs held a hearing on \"Presidential Advice and Consent: The Past, Present, and Future of Policy Czars\" on October 22, 2009. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins raised concerns about the consolidation of power in the White House through the appointment of officials known as \"czars,\" questioning the impact on Congress's oversight responsibilities. The proliferation of czars in the White House diminishes Congress's oversight abilities and accountability. These officials can create confusion, duplicate authority, and bypass Senate confirmation, undermining the constitutionally mandated process. The national security advisor and the chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board do not raise the same concerns with accountability, transparency, and oversight as they are recognized in law and subject to Senate confirmation. Congress should have the ability to call officials like the president's climate czar to inquire about significant policy changes. The White House climate czar's negotiations were not conducted by the EPA administrator, but by the White House. A proposed amendment called for the president to allow Congress to request testimony from individuals responsible for interagency development, and to provide written summaries of their activities twice a year. Senator Robert Bennett raised concerns about accountability and transparency in the White House. In November 1997, the speaker requested President Clinton appoint a Y2K czar, later appointed as John Koskinen. Regular consultations were held, contrasting with current circumstances. Congress passed a law creating the Council of. The speaker questions who has the president's ear on the economy, mentioning Paul Volcker, Larry Summers, and Nancy-Ann DeParle. Senator Claire McCaskill noted the Y2K czar's role and the influence of Nancy-Ann DeParle in decision-making. During a discussion on White House advisors and testimony before Congress, Senator Lieberman read an excerpt from a letter by Senator Robert Byrd to President Obama regarding the authority granted by Congress to White House staff. White House staffers receive salaries through Congress spending authority. Presidential assistants must answer Congress questions for oversight. Witnesses testified before a subcommittee, including Thomas J. Ridge discussing clear responsibilities for advisors. The text discusses the importance of clear delineation of responsibilities and reporting authority for White House czars to avoid potential conflicts and management issues. It questions the accountability of these individuals to the president, secretary, or both, and highlights the need for clarity in their roles in developing and directing policy. The appearance of potential conflict can diminish the capacity of both advisor and secretary to operate effectively in accordance with the department's mission. It may cause confusion for those under the chain of command of the secretary and outside the department's purview. White House advisors have power and influence but it is derived from the president. They can communicate orders but cannot give orders themselves. White House czars play essential roles in coordinating tasks for the president. Czars play roles in coordinating tasks for the president, but their proliferation can confuse presidential authority and create layers between the president and Cabinet secretaries. They may pull issues into the White House that should be settled at the Cabinet level, and often lack the authority to enforce decisions on departments or agencies. White House staffers have proximity to the president, while Cabinet secretaries struggle to secure presidential attention. Congress plays a significant role in policymaking, as outlined in the Constitution. White House advisors have limited authority and cannot transform executive branch policy into US policy. The Justice Department's position is that White House advisors do not need Senate approval and cannot create legal obligations. The president can only implement policy through appointed officers accountable to Congress. Separation of powers issues arise when discussing advice given to the president. The use of policy \"czars\" by Presidents for war mobilization has historical precedent, with examples such as William S. Knudsen, Donald Nelson, and James F. Byrnes accountable to Congress. The key issue is ensuring that these czars do not overstep their delegated authority. During the Senate Special Committee hearings from April 1941 to April 1943, Knudsen, Nelson, and their deputies appeared before Congress. Mr. Relyea suggested alternative ways for Congress to obtain information when a president prohibits testimony by a czar or presidential agent. This could include a Freedom of Information Act request, written answers, testimony by department officials, or briefings for congressional committee leaders or staff. The Senate Special Committee hearings discussed the adequacy of allotments and reporting requirements for White House advisors. Senator Lieberman questioned the validity of their actions and whether they should be compelled to testify before Congress. The Senate Special Committee hearings debated whether Congress should compel White House advisors to testify about their policy coordination role. Mr. Casey and Mr. Ridge expressed concerns about regulating presidential advice without infringing on separation of powers. Senator Collins raised issues with undisclosed advisor functions within the White House. The Senate committee discussed a troubling example of a czar position related to weapons of mass destruction prevention. The position was created by legislation but never filled by Presidents Bush or Obama. Instead, they appointed a White House policy czar with similar functions. The Senate committee discussed the troubling issue of a White House policy czar being appointed to a position related to weapons of mass destruction prevention, which was originally created by legislation but never filled by Presidents Bush or Obama. Mr. Ridge and Mr. Pfiffner found this circumvention of a statutorily confirmed position created by Congress to be very troubling. Mr. Casey, however, did not share the same concerns and suggested that the position may have remained unfilled due to its proximity to the president's authority. The Senate committee discussed concerns about a White House policy czar appointed to a position related to weapons of mass destruction prevention, which raised separation of powers issues. Suggestions were made to eliminate the White House unit and replace it with a Senate-confirmed, statutorily created entity. Senator McCaskill agreed that the WMD coordinator position should be repealed as it is not appropriate for Senate confirmation. Senator Collins also supported the idea of filling the position through a congressional creation.

Suggestions were made to eliminate the White House unit and replace it with a Senate-confirmed, statutorily created entity. Senator McCaskill and Senator Collins supported the idea of filling the position through congressional creation. Senator Lieberman questioned the need for statutory positions within the White House, while Mr. Relyea highlighted Congress's reluctance to interfere with the president's staffing decisions. Mr. Casey raised concerns about potential limitations on the president's choice of advisors and the constitutional implications of creating such offices. The Senate committee discussed separation of powers issues regarding White House advisor positions. Suggestions were made for comity between branches to avoid conflicts. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins considered legislation to address concerns about executive orders. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins discussed the need for Congress to uphold its oversight responsibility while maintaining a balance with the executive branch, as reflected in the Constitution."
