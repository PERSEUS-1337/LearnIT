    "content": "The report details five educational assistance programs available to veterans through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, with the most recent being the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Congress regularly considers improvements for these programs. The VA administers educational assistance programs for veterans, with ongoing discussions on contribution requirements, types of service warranting benefits, and the value of the benefits. Eligible individuals receive a 36-month entitlement to educational assistance, with payments reducing the entitlement period based on training. The entitlement period for educational assistance is reduced based on training, with eligibility continuing through the academic term or a 12-week period if not on a term schedule. Entitlement is not reduced if called to active duty, and can be restored for incomplete courses or programs. This report outlines the five GI Bills enacted before 2008 and related veterans' educational assistance programs. It covers eligibility requirements, benefits, linkages between programs, and participation/expenditures data. Since the Revolutionary War, the United States has provided benefits to injured or disabled war veterans, but able-bodied veterans did not receive the same extent of benefits. In 1932, after World War I, unrest among jobless veterans led to military intervention. Military service was seen as a fundamental obligation of male citizenship in early U.S. history. WWII saw over one-third of working-age males serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. During WWII, over one-third of working-age males served in the U.S. Armed Forces. The original GI Bill of 1944 provided resources to veterans, including educational assistance, loans, job counseling, and unemployment benefits. It was successful in averting unemployment and raising the educational level of the workforce. Subsequent GI Bills have also been passed, such as the Korean Conflict GI Bill. The Korean Conflict GI Bill (P.L. 82-550) was enacted in 1952 under the Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act to help veterans enter the workforce. The War Orphans' Educational Assistance Act of 1956 (P.L. 84-634) provided educational assistance to children of servicemembers who died in the line of duty. This program later expanded to include spouses and children of servicemembers who died, became disabled, missing-in-action, captured, or hospitalized. The Post-Korean Conflict and Vietnam Era GI Bill (P.L. 89-358) provided benefits to veterans and active duty servicemembers. The Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 provided benefits to veterans and active duty servicemembers through an education loan program. It was repealed in 1981 and sparked debates on the level of educational assistance for military personnel. Some argued for monetary contributions to increase responsibility, while others saw it as compensation for service. High assistance levels were believed to promote attrition from the military. Since the expiration of the compulsory military draft in 1973, educational assistance programs have been enacted to aid in recruitment and retention of high-quality military personnel. These programs have evolved to include various types of education and training beyond traditional college education. Currently, there are multiple educational assistance programs available to veterans, servicemembers, and their families, with the oldest being the Post-Vietnam Era GI Bill enacted in 1976. The Post-Vietnam Era GI Bill, enacted in 1976, provides educational assistance based on contributions from servicemembers' pay. Other programs include the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty, Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve, Reserves Educational Assistance Program (REAP), and Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA). The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program provides benefits to spouses and children of disabled, deceased, or detained servicemembers. The Post-9/11 GI Bill increased educational assistance for individuals with active duty service after September 10, 2001. DEA was established in 1956 and is codified under Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program, established in 1956 under Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35, provides educational benefits to eligible individuals, including children and surviving spouses of veterans who died or became disabled as a result of military service. This includes those with total permanent disabilities, missing in action, captured by hostile forces, or forcibly detained by a foreign government. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program provides educational benefits to eligible individuals, including children and surviving spouses of veterans who died or became disabled as a result of military service. Children must be under 26 at the time of eligibility event. Spouse and children cannot receive DEA benefits if in the Armed Forces or released under dishonorable conditions. Eligibility for DEA benefits and the Fry Scholarship can be combined. The Fry Scholarship is available to children of individuals who die in the line of duty after September 11, 2001, while serving in the Armed Forces. It covers a wide range of educational programs, including courses at accredited and nonaccredited institutions leading to certificates or degrees, preparatory courses for higher education, and licensing tests for specific professions. The eligible programs of education for the Fry Scholarship include national tests for admission to higher learning institutions, cooperative programs, apprenticeship training, secondary education, vocational courses for disabilities, and special restorative training. These programs must be approved by a state agency or the VA. Educational institutions covered include elementary and secondary schools, vocational schools, and professional schools. The curr_chunk discusses various types of educational institutions eligible for the Fry Scholarship, including schools, colleges, technical institutions, alternative teacher certification programs, and entrepreneurship course providers. It also includes establishments providing apprentice or on-the-job training, self-employment training, state and federal vocational education boards. The DEA program provides monthly allowances to participants and special assistance for educationally disadvantaged individuals. Additional payments are available for tutorial assistance and qualified tests. Legislation restricts some recipients from receiving DEA and other VA-administered benefits concurrently, but spouses, children under 18, and helpless children may receive both. Once a child over 18 starts receiving DEA, they can no longer receive other payments. Once a child over 18 years old starts receiving DEA, they can no longer receive additional payments based on school attendance. Recipients receive a monthly allowance for various expenses directly. Benefit amounts are adjusted annually and for FY2019, the maximum allowance for full-time institutional enrollment is $1,224. Individuals in apprenticeship or on-the-job training receive different monthly allowances. For FY2018, individuals in apprenticeship or on-the-job training receive monthly allowances ranging from $191.00 to $760.00. Participants in farm cooperative training can receive up to $837.00 monthly. Spouses pursuing education exclusively by correspondence receive 55% of the institution's charges. Advance payments are available for individuals planning to enroll more than half-time and who have not received educational assistance benefits in 30 days or more. An accelerated payment of the monthly allowance is available for education leading to employment in a high-technology occupation in a high-technology industry. If the costs of the program of education are more than double the monthly assistance allowance, the individual may receive 60% of the program's costs for the term or the individual's remaining entitlement. Special assistance is provided to educationally disadvantaged individuals without a high school diploma to pursue postsecondary education. For postsecondary education, individuals can receive a monthly educational assistance allowance, with benefits not affecting the entitlement period for the first five months. Special restorative training is available for those with disabilities hindering their education pursuit, with an extension of the entitlement period if needed. In FY2018, individuals can receive $1,041.00 monthly for full-time special restorative training, with additional assistance for tuition and fees exceeding $322 monthly. Tutorial assistance up to $100 monthly is also available. An individual can receive up to $100 monthly for tutorial assistance, with a maximum of $1,200 over the entitlement period. The educational institution must certify the necessity of the cost. Reimbursement of up to $2,000 is available for approved licensing or certification tests, not exceeding the individual's remaining entitlement. The entitlement period is reduced by one month for each payment equal to the monthly benefit. Reimbursement is also available for national tests for admissions and course credit at an IHL. The entitlement period for educational and training benefits is limited to 45 months if the individual enrolls using DEA before August 1, 2018, and 36 months if enrolled on or after that date. Spouses can receive educational benefits for 10 years from the date of eligibility or VA notification, and for 20 years if the servicemember dies on active duty or is determined to have total permanent disability within three years of discharge. The Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) is a Title 10 U.S.C. DOD program administered by the VA for members of the Selected Reserve. It provides educational benefits for children after they achieve a high school diploma or equivalent, or after they reach 18 years of age but before 26 years of age. Specialized vocational training can begin at age 14. The program is an incentive for Reserve members to stay in service and is available for various Reserve components. The MGIB-SR program offers educational assistance to reservists in the Selected Reserve, including the National Guard, who commit to a six-year service obligation. Benefits are available for those who enlist, re-enlist, or extend an enlistment for six years after June 30, 1985, and for reserve officers who agree to an additional six-year service. Reservists must complete initial active duty training, have a high school diploma, and meet training requirements. Failure to meet training requirements may result in active duty orders or repayment of educational assistance. The MGIB-SR program provides educational assistance to reservists in the Selected Reserve, excluding full-time active duty or National Guard duty for organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training. Benefits can be used for approved programs at various educational institutions, leading to educational, vocational, or professional objectives. This includes courses at accredited institutions, licensing or certification tests, and courses required by the Small Business Administration for financial assistance. The curr_chunk discusses various approved tests and courses for vocational or professional purposes, including entrepreneurship courses, national tests for admission to higher education, preparatory courses for admission tests, apprentice training programs, cooperative programs, refresher courses, and special education or training courses. The MGIB-SR program provides monthly allowances for reservists enrolled in approved education or training programs, with additional payments available for specific purposes. The monthly allowance amount varies based on enrollment status and can be adjusted annually. Reservists enrolled less-than-half-time and receiving DOD tuition assistance are not eligible for MGIB-SR benefits. The MGIB-SR program provides monthly allowances for reservists in approved education or training programs. Monthly allowance amounts vary based on enrollment status and can be adjusted annually. Reservists receiving DOD tuition assistance cannot receive MGIB-SR benefits. Participants in apprenticeship or on-the-job training receive varying percentages of the monthly benefit for the first six months, second six months, and thereafter. Individuals pursuing education by correspondence receive 55% of the institution's charges for completed courses, while those in flight training receive 60%. MGIB-SR participants can choose to receive the monthly allowance as an advance or accelerated payment. The Tuition Assistance \"Top-Up\" program was established to promote retention under the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. Military branches may pay for education through TA programs. The Tuition Assistance Top-Up program allows MGIB-SR servicemembers with at least two years of active duty to receive additional benefits to cover tuition expenses not covered by their military branch. This benefit is limited to 36 months and reduces the individual's MGIB-SR entitlement period. Tutorial assistance is also available, up to $100 monthly and $1,200 total, for those enrolled at least half-time. The Tuition Assistance Top-Up program allows MGIB-SR servicemembers with at least two years of active duty to receive additional benefits to cover tuition expenses not covered by their military branch. This benefit is limited to 36 months and reduces the individual's MGIB-SR entitlement period. Tutorial assistance is also available, up to $100 monthly and $1,200 total, for those enrolled at least half-time. The educational institution must certify the necessity and customary nature of the cost. A fee of up to $2,000 may be reimbursed for each approved licensing or certification test, not exceeding the individual's remaining MGIB-SR entitlement. The Tuition Assistance Top-Up program allows MGIB-SR servicemembers with at least two years of active duty to receive additional benefits for tuition expenses not covered by their military branch. The benefit is limited to 36 months and reduces the individual's entitlement period. Military service branches may use supplemental assistance for additional years of service and critical skills to recruit and retain capable individuals. The promised benefit amount is deposited into the DOD Educational Benefits Trust Fund until individuals use the benefit, at which point it is transferred to the VA for payment. Supplemental assistance, up to $350, is added to individuals' monthly housing allowance. Supplemental assistance for critical skills may be offered to recruit or retain individuals with critical skills in the regular Armed Forces or Selected Reserve. A critical skill is a skill in high demand or difficult to recruit or retain personnel for. The MGIB-SR provides 36 months of educational benefits for reservists, with exceptions for certain individuals. Educational assistance may be extended if prevented from pursuing education involuntarily. The MGIB-SR provides educational benefits for reservists, with the option to transfer benefits to family members. House hearings in the 1980s discussed military recruitment challenges and the possibility of reinstating the draft. Some witnesses argued for eliminating servicemembers' monetary contribution towards educational benefits due to low retention rates. The proposal to allow universal transfer of entitlement to spouses and children after 10 years of service was deemed too expensive. The Duty (MGIB-AD) program, originally known as the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program, was established to provide educational assistance and support recruitment and retention of qualified personnel in the Armed Forces. It requires individuals to have a high school diploma or equivalent to participate. The MGIB-AD program requires individuals to have a high school diploma or equivalent, or 12 credit hours of postsecondary education to be eligible for benefits. Category 1 individuals must meet specific service requirements to qualify for educational assistance benefits. The MGIB-AD program requires individuals to meet specific service requirements to qualify for educational assistance benefits, including being discharged with a service-connected disability, hardship, or for the government's convenience. Selected Reservists and National Guard members must serve two continuous years of honorable active duty service and a minimum of four continuous years in the Reserves. Category 2 individuals with remaining entitlement under the Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill and active duty after June 30, 1985 are eligible. Category 3 individuals must elect MGIB-AD before separation, while Category 4 includes VEAP participants with remaining entitlement or who transferred to MGIB-AD by October 9, 1997. Category 4 includes VEAP participants who served on active duty from October 9, 1996, through April 1, 2000, and made the requisite contributions. National Guard members who served on full-time National Guard active duty between June 30, 1985, and November 29, 1989, were eligible to contribute during a specific period. The active duty service period requirements exclude certain types of service. During a 12-week period of active duty for training in the National Guard and Reserves, individuals must meet specific service requirements and educational qualifications to be eligible for MGIB-AD benefits. This includes time spent organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training in the National Guard, completion of a high school diploma or equivalent, and being discharged under honorable conditions. Individuals must not decline the benefit in writing and allow the first 12 months of military pay to be reduced by $100 per month. Servicemembers who initially declined the benefit can enroll in the program under certain circumstances. Covered MGIB-AD participants receive a monthly allowance and additional payments for various purposes. They must be charged no more than in-state tuition and fees. Participants are members of the Armed Forces on active duty for more than 30 days in the state where the public institution of higher education is located. The MGIB-AD program provides monthly allowances for veterans attending public institutions of higher education, ensuring they are charged no more than in-state tuition and fees. Participants must be active duty members for over 30 days in the state where the institution is located, with eligibility extending to spouses and dependent children. The monthly allowance covers subsistence, tuition, fees, supplies, books, and equipment, with a maximum of $1,928 for full-time training starting October 1, 2017. The monthly allowance for veterans attending public institutions of higher education is $1,928 for full-time training. A reduced allowance is provided for less than full-time training and for those who served less than three continuous years on active duty. The maximum monthly benefit amount is adjusted annually based on the average cost of undergraduate tuition in the United States. Individuals in apprenticeship or on-the-job training receive a reduced monthly allowance for the first six months, second six months, and thereafter. Individuals in cooperative training receive 80% of the monthly allowance, while those pursuing education exclusively by correspondence receive 55% of the institution's charges for completed courses. MGIB-AD participants can choose to receive the monthly allowance in advance or accelerated payment, with a maximum supplemental assistance of $950. Category 2 individuals may receive an increased monthly allowance based on training type, rate of pursuit, and number of dependents. For example, a full-time institutional training with two dependents could receive $2,183 per month. Servicemembers can receive a total monthly allowance of $2,183.00 with two dependents. They can also contribute up to an additional $600 while on active duty and receive up to $5 monthly for each $20 contributed through the $600 Buy Up Program. Each dollar contributed is matched by the government with an additional $9 in benefits, totaling up to $5,400 over 36 months for a $600 investment. Educational benefits are available to servicemembers after serving two continuous years on active duty. No educational benefits can be paid after the delimiting date for active component members, which is 10 years after discharge. Members of the Selected Reserve are entitled to educational benefits for up to 10 years after completing four years of duty. Most individuals can receive 36 months of educational assistance. Active duty servicemembers discharged before completing the minimum service time are entitled to benefits for a period equal to their service time, up to 36 months. Reservists are entitled to benefits based on their active duty and Selected Reserve service time, up to 36 months. The MGIB-AD death benefit is available to certain beneficiaries of eligible individuals who served after June 30, 1985. The MGIB-AD death benefit is available to beneficiaries of individuals who served after June 30, 1985, and died for service-connected reasons while on active duty or within one year of discharge. The benefit is paid to the beneficiaries of the individual's Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance policy, with priority given to surviving spouse, children, or parents. The benefit amount, up to $1,200, is based on the servicemember's contributions to the MGIB-AD program. Eligible individuals can transfer up to 18 months of their educational assistance benefits. The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) was enacted to support reservists called to active duty due to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. It will end on November 25, 2019, as per the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) provides educational benefits to reservists who have served at least 90 consecutive days in qualifying duty authorization after September 10, 2001, and before November 25, 2015. It aims to offer benefits proportional to active duty service and is administered by the VA as a DOD program. The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) provides educational benefits to reservists who have served in qualifying duty authorization. Benefits increase with continuous service, and most participants receive a monthly allowance. Additional payments are available for specific purposes.

Participants can receive up to 80% of the maximum MGIB-AD allowance for education or training. Additional payments are available for specific purposes, and participants can choose to receive the allowance in advance or accelerated payment. The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) provides educational benefits for up to 36 months, regardless of active duty eligibility period. Benefits may be extended for individuals who received REAP benefits before November 25, 2015. Those losing REAP eligibility can potentially qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. No benefits are paid after separation from the reserves. Individuals called to active service in the Selected Reserve must remain in the Selected Reserve. The Ready Reserve is one of the three major reserve components along with the Standby Reserve and Retired Reserve. Ready Reservists will usually be called to active duty before the other components and include Selected Reservists. Individuals who complete the 90-day service requirement and their service contract under honorable conditions remain eligible for benefits for 10 years after separation from the Selected Reserve. Individuals separated from the Ready Reserve due to a disability not caused by their own misconduct have 10 years from becoming eligible for benefits. The Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) was established under Title IV of the Veterans' Education and Employment Assistance Act of 1976 to provide educational benefits to individuals who entered active duty on or after January 1, 1977. VEAP was designed as a recruitment incentive for the Armed Forces during peacetime, offering benefits to both active duty and reserve components simultaneously. Eligible individuals can transfer their REAP educational assistance benefits to family members, although no branch currently offers such a program. The Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) provides benefits to individuals who entered active duty between January 1, 1977, and July 1, 1985. Eligibility requires a minimum of 24 continuous months of active duty or 181 days for certain individuals. Servicemembers must complete their first obligated period of active duty or six years, whichever is less. The VEAP program provides education benefits to individuals who entered active duty between January 1, 1977, and July 1, 1985, excluding certain periods of service. Eligibility requires a minimum of 24 continuous months of active duty. Participants must make an irrevocable decision to receive benefits under VEAP and contribute to their educational fund. Participants in the VEAP program must contribute to their educational fund during their military service, with monthly deductions of $25 to $100 for up to $2,700. After 12 contributions, individuals can withdraw from the program but lose eligibility for benefits. Eligible programs include courses leading to educational, vocational, or professional objectives, high school diploma courses, and courses required by the Small Business Administration.

Eligible programs include courses for vocational or professional objectives, high school diploma courses, and courses required by the Small Business Administration. Financial assistance is available for licensing or certification tests, entrepreneurship courses, national admission tests, apprentice training, and cooperative programs. Monthly allowances are provided to most VEAP participants. Additional payments and allowance increases are possible for specific purposes. The VEAP program provides a monthly allowance for subsistence, tuition, fees, supplies, books, and equipment to recipients enrolled in training or education programs. Individuals are entitled to three times their contribution plus any DOD contributions, with a maximum monthly benefit of $300. The entitlement period is reduced for individuals taking correspondence courses, and those incarcerated for a felony conviction can only receive an allowance for tuition, fees, and necessary supplies. Individuals in flight training programs receive 60% of the program's charges. Veterans and servicemembers must use their educational assistance benefits within 10 years of discharge or release from active duty. Under VEAP, individuals are entitled to a maximum of 36 months (or the equivalent for part-time attendance) or the number of months in which contributions were made, whichever is less. Veterans and servicemembers can combine benefit programs administered by the VA to receive no more than 48 months of educational benefits. Veterans and servicemembers can combine multiple GI Bill programs but must elect one for credit based on their military service period. Benefits cannot be received concurrently. DEA-eligible individuals can combine benefits with other VA programs for up to 81 months of education benefits. The Post-9/11 GI Bill details are included in a separate report. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 requires the VA to carry out a five-year High The Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-48) mandates a five-year High Technology Pilot Program for GI Bill-eligible veterans. The program offers high technology education programs in fields sought by employers, with up to $15 million annually allocated for it. The VA contracts with qualified providers to offer nondegree programs in computer programming, software, media application, data processing, or information sciences. Qualified providers must have operated for at least two years. The VA's High Technology Pilot Program for GI Bill-eligible veterans requires qualified providers to offer high technology education programs in fields sought by employers. Providers must have been in operation for at least two years and meet VA approval criteria. The VA reimburses providers for tuition and fees, with preference given to those offering tuition reimbursement for students who do not find employment within 180 days of program completion. GI Bill-eligible veterans enrolled full-time receive a monthly housing allowance based on the E-5 with dependents BAH. For individuals enrolled in educational programs, the monthly housing allowance is based on the E-5 with dependents BAH for the area, adjusted according to enrollment rate. Counseling services are available for those receiving educational assistance under various programs. Counseling services are required for recipients of educational assistance, especially for those who may need specialized vocational training or have not completed high school. The VA's VetSuccess on Campus program aims to support servicemembers, veterans, and their families in achieving their educational and employment goals. The VetSuccess on Campus program assigns a full-time VA counselor and part-time outreach coordinator to each participating college campus. These representatives provide various services to veterans, including career and academic counseling, vocational testing, and access to VA benefits. Ninety-four colleges and universities have been participating in the program since 2014. The VR&E program by the VA offers job training and employment services to veterans with service-connected disabilities. Eligibility requires a 20% service-connected disability and an employment handicap, or a 10% disability with a serious employment handicap. Program counselors help veterans set employment goals and determine necessary services, such as tuition, counseling, and a subsistence allowance. As of October 1, 2015, the maximum monthly subsistence allowance for a VR&E beneficiary enrolled full-time at an institution of higher learning with two dependents is $885.00. The allowance varies based on enrollment status and dependents. VR&E benefits are typically limited to 48 months, but entitled veterans may receive benefits longer under certain circumstances. Veterans eligible for VR&E and MGIB-AD can receive benefits from both programs concurrently. VR&E beneficiaries enrolled in a program meeting MGIB-AD criteria cannot receive certain benefits like tuition, fees, and subsistence allowance. They can still access counseling and disability-related services. Veterans eligible for both programs cannot receive total allowances exceeding 100% disability compensation. The Veterans Work Study Program offers additional financial assistance to VEAP, MGIB, Post-9/11 GI Bill, and VR&E participants in exchange for employment. Priority is given to veterans with a 30% disability rating, but other individuals may also participate if enrolled at least three-quarter-time. The VA considers various factors when selecting program participants for the Veterans Work Study Program, including educational assistance needs, transportation access, motivation, and compatibility with work assignments. Participants agree to work a certain number of hours in exchange for compensation, up to 25 hours per week. They are paid the greater of the state or national minimum wage rates. Eligible activities include VA outreach services programs and preparation of necessary paperwork. The Veterans Work Study Program includes various activities such as paperwork preparation at educational institutions or VA facilities, medical care for veterans, administration of benefits, and cooperative programs with IHLs. Participants can receive a lump sum advance payment after signing a contract. The Veterans Work Study Program allows individuals to receive a lump sum advance payment after signing a contract to complete work-study hours. Participation in various education benefits programs has increased, with the Post-9/11 GI Bill showing significant growth. Participation in various education benefits programs has increased, with the Post-9/11 GI Bill showing significant growth. Participation in VEAP, MGIB-SR, and DEA has fluctuated over the years, with projections indicating VEAP participation will end in 2025. The Post-9/11 GI Bill had the largest participation and obligations in FY2016, with over 790,000 participants and total obligations exceeding $11 billion. The original GI Bill of Rights, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, provided unprecedented benefits to veterans returning from WWII, including educational assistance, vocational rehabilitation, loans for homes, farms, and business property, employment services, and unemployment benefits. The program with the smallest participation was VEAP, with eight participants and total obligations of $14,000. MGIB-AD provided benefits averaging $7,717 per participant compared to $14,661 for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The GI Bill of Rights provided educational assistance, vocational rehabilitation, loans, employment services, and unemployment benefits to veterans returning from WWII. Eligible individuals had to serve on active duty in the military or naval service after September 16, 1940, and before December 31, 1946, with a minimum of 90 days of service or a service-incurred injury. Eligible veterans had to start an education program within two years of discharge or release, extended to four years by P.L. 79-268. They were entitled to at least one year of education or the length of their chosen program if shorter. Veterans whose education was interrupted by military service were entitled to educational benefits for at least as long as they served during WWII, but not more than four years. The restriction was later removed to provide the same benefits to all veterans. No educational benefits could be paid after July 25, 1956. Initially, eligible educational institutions included public or private schools, colleges, vocational schools, and professional schools. The GI Bill provided educational benefits to veterans, including payments up to $500 a year for tuition, books, and training costs at approved training institutions. Stricter criteria were established for vocational schools and on-the-job training programs, with recreational training programs eventually being prohibited. Veterans had to maintain satisfactory progress in their chosen program of education. The GI Bill was revised in 1945 to provide veterans with higher annual tuition and fees payments in exchange for a reduction in entitlement period. Subsistence allowances were also increased for single veterans and those with dependents. Part-time attendees or those in apprentice training received lower allowances. Correspondence courses were authorized for tuition payments but did not qualify for subsistence allowances. The GI Bill was revised in 1945 to increase tuition and fees payments for veterans. Subsistence allowances were also raised for single veterans and those with dependents. Limits were set on total earnings for veterans in apprentice or on-the-job training. Lessons learned included the need for standards in eligible training programs to prevent overpayments and abuse by for-profit institutions. The GI Bill was revised in 1945 to increase tuition and fees payments for veterans, with limits set on total earnings for veterans in apprentice or on-the-job training. The program aimed to ensure quality education and workforce preparation, with emphasis on veterans identifying educational objectives. The nation spent $14.5 billion to provide education and training to 7.8 million WWII veterans, with an average expenditure of $1,859 per participant. The Korean Conflict GI Bill, also known as the Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952, aimed to help veterans from the Korean Conflict adjust to civilian life. It was intended to provide education and benefits similar to those given to WWII veterans, with a lower number of Korean Conflict veterans compared to WWII veterans. The bill was designed to avoid issues faced in the original GI Bill implementation. The Korean GI Bill, also known as the Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952, provided education benefits to veterans of the Korean Conflict. Eligibility was similar to the original GI Bill, with veterans needing to have served during the Korean Conflict and meet certain discharge requirements. Unlike WWII veterans who received up to four years of benefits, Korean Conflict veterans were limited to 36 months. Korean Conflict veterans were entitled to educational benefits for up to 36 months, with the option to extend to 48 months by combining benefits with other programs. Correspondence course students could receive benefits for six times the duration of their active duty service. No benefits could be paid seven years after discharge. The Korean Conflict GI Bill provided educational benefits for up to 36 months, extendable to 48 months by combining with other programs. Benefits could be paid up to eight years after discharge or release, or until January 31, 1965. Eligible institutions were listed, with state approving agencies created to oversee educational courses. Provisions were added to prevent misuse of benefits. Several provisions were added or changed from the original GI Bill under the Korean GI Bill. Veterans had to declare an educational objective or certificate/degree and could only change it once under specific conditions. Benefits were not provided for avocational and recreational courses. Criteria for approving training establishments and educational institutions were strengthened. New enrollments of veterans in non-accredited courses below the college level offered by private for-profit institutions were disapproved. The Korean Conflict GI Bill added provisions disapproving enrollment of veterans in non-accredited courses below college level offered by private institutions if over 85% of charges were paid for by the institution. It also set standards for apprentice, on-the-job, and on-the-farm training. The Korean Conflict GI Bill expanded courses approved by accrediting agencies and certain unaccredited courses. Benefit payments were made only to veterans, not institutions, to prevent abuse. Direct payments to veterans aimed to promote responsible spending and discourage using benefits for income. The Korean Conflict GI Bill expanded approved courses for veterans, providing benefits for subsistence, tuition, fees, supplies, books, and equipment. Allowances varied based on veteran status and type of training attended. Some veterans were found to be overpaid, resulting in adjustments to allowances for apprentice or on-the-job training. Veterans receiving training or education benefits under the Korean Conflict GI Bill had specific guidelines to follow. They could receive a monthly allowance of up to $310, but only if they completed coursework or training. Flight training received 75% of the cost, unless combined with other coursework. Absences from unaccredited courses or training for over 30 days could result in the allowance being withheld. Veterans needed to certify attendance and progress, and were not allowed to receive duplicate benefits from other educational sources. The Korean Conflict GI Bill provided education and training to almost 2.4 million veterans at a cost of $4.5 billion. The Post-Korea Conflict and Vietnam Era GI Bill, passed in 1966, aimed to recruit new servicemembers and extend benefits to all who fulfilled their compulsory service. President Lyndon B. Johnson had reservations about the high cost but Congress passed the bill unanimously. The Post-Korea Conflict and Vietnam Era GI Bill aimed to provide education and training to veterans who fulfilled their compulsory service. Congress expanded the benefits over time, making them available to all veterans who served on active duty after January 31, 1955, and entered military service before January 1, 1977, with a minimum of 180 days of service. The Post-Korea Conflict and Vietnam Era GI Bill provided education and training benefits to veterans with at least 180 days of service. The program was later amended to include National Guard and Reserves members with one year of active duty. Servicemembers meeting eligibility requirements could also receive benefits after two continuous years on active duty. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill, enacted in 1966, retroactively covered active duty servicemen since 1955 with no period of ineligibility for educational assistance benefits since 1940. Initially providing one month of entitlement for each month of service, it was later increased to 1\u00bd months for every month served, with a maximum of 45 months for all eligible persons by 1976. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill, enacted in 1966, provided educational benefits for veterans. Amendments in 1974 and 1976 extended the eligibility period and maximum benefits. Veterans could combine benefits with other VA programs for up to 48 months of education. Eligible programs included courses at various educational institutions. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill, enacted in 1966, provided educational benefits for veterans, including flight training courses offered by eligible institutions. The list of eligible institutions was later expanded to include elementary schools, schools for adults, businesses offering apprenticeships, and farm cooperative training. Apprenticeship and on-the-job training programs meeting Department of Labor standards were also allowed under the bill. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill of 1966 offered educational benefits for veterans, including flight training at approved non-IHL flight schools. Training programs had to provide progression based on skills learned, fair compensation, job guarantee, 6 months to 2 years of training, and resources for training. Flight training required approval by state and federal agencies, a valid pilot's license, and was necessary for a vocational objective in aviation. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill of 1966 provided educational benefits for veterans, including flight training at approved non-IHL flight schools. The bill included provisions to ensure benefits were used for quality workforce preparation, such as only allowing recipients to take courses necessary for their educational or vocational objectives. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill of 1966 provided educational benefits for veterans, focusing on quality workforce preparation by restricting courses to align with educational or vocational objectives and disallowing avocational or recreational courses. Restrictions were also placed on absences, eligibility for new courses at private for-profit institutions, and the use of open circuit television or radio for certain types of courses. Various regulations were implemented to address low completion rates and ensure quality education for veterans. These regulations included disclosure and refund requirements for correspondence schools, suspension of payments for courses with ineligible trainees, approval requirements for programs outside the US, and limitations on benefits for flight training. Congress also restricted flight training at non-IHL flight schools for individuals without a private pilot's license. The GI Bill benefits for veterans and servicemembers included allowances for subsistence, tuition, fees, supplies, books, and equipment. Payments varied based on enrollment status and number of dependents, with a maximum monthly amount of $510 for individuals with two dependents. Active duty servicemembers and students on a less-than-half-time basis were reimbursed for completed courses, up to $376 monthly. Correspondence course completions were reimbursed at 55% of cost, with a reduced entitlement period. The GI Bill benefits for veterans and servicemembers included allowances for subsistence, tuition, fees, supplies, books, and equipment. Payments varied based on enrollment status and number of dependents, with a maximum monthly amount of $510 for individuals with two dependents. Veterans and servicemembers had to certify actual attendance, lessons completed, and satisfactory progress before payments were made. Various provisions were added for students pursuing education through independent study or while incarcerated. Veterans were not allowed to receive duplicate educational benefits from the U.S. Treasury. The P.L. 95-202 in 1977 allowed state or local governments to establish programs with the VA for veterans to use accelerated payments to repay certain VA loans. Veterans had to be enrolled full-time, complete the program with a degree, diploma, or certificate, and tuition and fees had to exceed $700 for a term. The state or local government would pay the VA a matching amount of the accelerated payment if requirements were met. The Predischarge Education Program (PREP) allowed servicemembers with 180 days of active duty to receive an allowance for non-correspondence courses leading to a high school diploma or any deficiency course. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill was amended to provide special assistance and training for the educationally disadvantaged. Veterans without a high school diploma could receive the regular allowance for additional secondary school courses without reducing their entitlement period. Tutorial assistance was also provided for a maximum of 12 months. The Post-Korean Conflict GI Bill provided tutorial assistance of $50 monthly (increased to $84 monthly) for veterans and servicemembers enrolled in postsecondary education. The assistance was for a deficiency in a required course, certified by the educational institution. Tutorial assistance did not reduce their regular entitlement period. Additionally, a veteran work-study allowance was created for full-time students, eventually increased to minimum wage or $625, paid based on an agreement with the veteran. The Post-Korea and Vietnam Era GI Bill provided education and training to veterans through work-study programs and outreach services. Over 1.4 million Post-Korean Conflict era and 6.8 million Vietnam era servicemembers benefited from the program, with about 60% of eligible individuals taking advantage of it. Program expenditures exceeded $41.5 billion by the end of FY1990. The Veterans and Dependents Education Loan Program, established by the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, provided support to veterans attending high-cost institutions. Eligible individuals had to be enrolled at least half-time in an education program leading to a standard college degree or a six-month non-college degree. Loans were not eligible for correspondence courses or apprenticeship. The Veterans and Dependents Education Loan Program, established by the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, provided loans up to $600 annually (later increased to $2,500) for education expenses at high-cost institutions. Repayment began nine months after enrollment dropped below half-time and was completed within 10 years. Loans were made without considering other financial assistance programs. The Veterans and Dependents Education Loan Program, established by the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, provided loans for education expenses. The default rate increased significantly, and it cost the VA more to administer the program than the Department of Education. P.L. 97-35 repealed the VA education loan program in 1981."
