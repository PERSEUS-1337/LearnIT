    "content": "Recent high-profile military justice issues include dismissal of charges in an Aviano court-martial related to sexual offenses, alleged sexual assault by an officer at the Pentagon, and sexual assaults at Lackland Air Force Base. These incidents raise questions about how the military addresses sexual assault allegations and the authority to convene a court-martial. The U.S. Constitution ensures fair enforcement of laws. The Constitution ensures fair enforcement of laws, considering the objectives of the legal system and individual liberties. In criminal law, objectives include discovering the truth, punishing the guilty, acquitting the innocent, and preventing further crime. Military justice aims to enhance discipline and national defense, with Congress having the power to regulate the Armed Forces and the President as Commander in Chief. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate the Armed Forces and the President as Commander in Chief. Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) to govern military criminal laws worldwide, implemented through the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM). Courts-martial are not considered Article III courts and are not subject to all federal court rules. The Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) contains the Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM), the Military Rules of Evidence (MRE), and the UCMJ, covering almost all aspects of military law. Military courts have limited jurisdiction under Article I of the Constitution, with courts-martial having jurisdiction over servicemembers, retired members entitled to pay, hospitalized reserve members, persons serving a sentence, and other designated individuals. Courts-martial have jurisdiction over servicemembers, retired members entitled to pay, hospitalized reserve members, persons serving a sentence, and other designated individuals. The President can prescribe punishments within limits set by Congress. Military offenses are tried in courts-martial, listed in the UCMJ. Some offenses have civilian equivalents, while others are exclusive to the military. The General Article allows for trial of offenses not specifically covered. The Armed Forces utilize Art. 134 to assimilate state and federal offenses without UCMJ equivalents for court-martial jurisdiction. Punishments for violations align with civilian offenses, with sex-related offenses defined under various punitive articles such as rape, sexual assault, stalking, and forcible sodomy. The offenses of stalking and forcible sodomy are often included in legislative proposals addressing sex-related offenses under the UCMJ. Maximum punishments range from dismissal to death or life in prison. Immediate commanders conduct inquiries into reported offenses, which can vary in complexity and involve military and civilian law enforcement officials. The commander can dispose of charges in various ways after gathering evidence and completing an inquiry. The first step in a court-martial is preferral of charges, where a charge sheet is drafted and signed by the accuser. Charges can then be referred to summary, special, or general courts-martial based on the seriousness of the offenses alleged. The convening authority must have sufficient legal authority to convene the court-martial. The convening authority, usually the unit commander, has legal authority to convene military courts-martial. Congress regulates the Armed Forces through Title 10 of the U.S. Code, specifically addressing the military courts-martial system in the UCMJ. Article 36 of the UCMJ authorizes the President to prescribe rules for court-martial procedures, following principles of law and evidence used in U.S. district courts. The military justice system established three types of courts-martial: summary, special, and general. Summary courts-martial handle minor offenses, while special and general courts-martial deal with more serious offenses like sexual assault. Sex-related offenses are typically found in Art. 120. Special courts-martial can try servicemembers for noncapital offenses, with a minimum of three members needed for a trial. Unlike civilian trials, only two-thirds agreement is required for a guilty verdict. Maximum punishments include confinement for one year, hard labor for up to three months, forfeiture of pay, reduction in pay grade, and a bad-conduct discharge. A general court-martial is the highest trial level in military law, used for serious offenses. It can adjudge a wide range of punishments including confinement, reduction in pay grade, punitive discharge, fines, and even death penalty. The accused is entitled to a military attorney or can hire civilian counsel at no expense. Prior to convening a general court-martial, a pretrial investigation known as an Article 32 hearing must be conducted. The investigating officer, a commissioned officer, presides over the hearing where the accused can examine evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and present arguments. If new evidence is uncovered, new charges can be recommended, or if evidence is insufficient, charges may be dropped. After an Article 32 investigation, the investigating officer recommends to the convening authority whether to proceed with a court-martial or dismiss the charges. Convictions with punitive discharge undergo post-trial review by the CA. The staff judge advocate reviews the trial record and advises the CA on further action. This review is crucial for the accused's potential relief. The Court of Appeals (CA) has broad powers to act on court-martial cases, including suspending sentences or disapproving findings. Once the CA takes action, the conviction is ripe for appeal. If the conviction is not reviewable by service appellate courts, a judge advocate reviews it for legal and factual correctness. If needed, the case is forwarded for corrective action by the convening authority or the Judge Advocate General. Convictions by court-martial are subject to automatic appeal. Convictions by a special or general court-martial are subject to automatic appeal to a service Court of Criminal Appeals for certain sentences. The appellant may request further review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and potentially the U.S. Supreme Court, but Supreme Court review is limited to cases where the CAAF has conducted a review. The CAAF has jurisdiction over denials of petitions for extraordinary relief. Servicemembers can seek further review through collateral means, such as petitioning for habeas corpus to an Article III court. Congress has introduced legislative proposals to address sexual assaults and sex-related offenses under the UCMJ, including prohibiting enlistment of individuals with prior sexual offense convictions and eliminating the statute of limitations on prosecution. The House and Senate have included provisions addressing sexual assault in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. The House version includes 20 provisions for changes to the UCMJ and Rules for Courts-Martial, while the Senate version has 26 changes. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced new initiatives to address sexual assaults in the military, similar to proposals in the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA. This report focuses on selected proposals due to the extensive provisions in the House and Senate versions. The report addresses selected proposals in the FY2014 NDAA related to sexual assault, including the creation of special victims' counsel programs, changes to disposition and clemency authorities, mandatory minimum punishments, commander's authority to transfer an accused, and protections for recruits and trainees. The Air Force Special Victims' Counsel Program, implemented in January 2013, provides support to victims of sexual assault through independent representation and has represented clients in various legal proceedings. The Department of the Navy and Coast Guard have implemented special victims' counsel programs. The House requires each military service to designate legal counsel as \"Victims' Counsel\" for victims of sex-related offenses. Victims' Counsel provide various legal assistance services for qualifying sex-related offenses under UCMJ Articles. The Senate FY2014 NDAA requires the implementation of Special Victims' Counsel programs in each military service, providing legal assistance for offenses under UCMJ Articles 120 and 80. The Senate limits qualifying offenses to alleged violations of rape, sexual assault, and attempted rape. The Senate FY2014 NDAA mandates Special Victims' Counsel programs for offenses under UCMJ Articles 120 and 80, including rape and sexual assault. Both House and Senate versions allow for legal assistance in civil litigation, raising questions for Coast Guard attorneys under the Department of Homeland Security. Secretary of Defense Hagel announced the implementation of special victims' advocacy programs across the military services, with each Service establishing a program to provide legal advice and representation to victims throughout the justice process. Disposition authority grants commanders the discretion to pursue prosecution of offenses, as outlined in Rules for Courts-Martial 306. The commander has various options to handle charges, including taking no action, administrative action, non-judicial punishment, preferring charges, or forwarding to a higher authority. Factors like nature of offenses, mitigating circumstances, accused's character, and military service must be considered. The FY2014 NDAA addresses the commander's ability to consider the accused's character and military service in initial offense disposition, with restrictions on sex-related offenses. The FY2014 NDAA addresses the commander's ability to consider factors like nature of offenses, mitigating circumstances, accused's character, and military service in initial offense disposition. The House and Senate versions differ on whether to allow consideration of these factors for all alleged offenses or only sex-related offenses under the UCMJ. Ambiguity in the proposed language regarding Rule 306 of the MCM could be clarified by specifically citing Rule 306 of the RCM. The Department of Defense implemented a policy in 2012 under Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, requiring only officers with special court-martial convening authority and grade of O-6 or higher to have initial disposition authority for certain sex-related offenses. The authority of O-6 grade or higher includes initial disposition authority for specific UCMJ offenses. Secretary Hagel added reporting requirements for unrestricted sexual assault cases. The policy must be implemented by November 1, 2013. Recent congressional focus on Convening Authority's clemency power arose from a case where a conviction was dismissed. The CA dismissed the conviction of an Air Force officer for sexual assault, which is not appealable. The victim currently has no right to participate in the clemency phase. The FY2014 NDAA addresses the CA's authority to act on court-martial findings and sentences. The CA can dismiss or modify charges unless it's a qualifying offense. Qualifying offenses exclude certain serious charges. The CA must provide a written explanation for any changes made. The FY2014 NDAA addresses the CA's authority to modify court-martial findings. The Senate language in the FY2014 NDAA differs from the House version in defining qualifying offenses and requiring a written justification for any actions taken by the Convening Authority (CA) during post-trial review. The new language also grants the complaining witness the right to be heard during the clemency phase. The House and Senate versions differ in language creating a new right for the complaining witness to participate in clemency. The House allows submission of matters before clemency, while the Senate allows review of accused submissions. The CA cannot consider character matters not presented at court-martial. The new right applies to all UCMJ offenses, not just sex-related ones. Secretary Hagel has directed the Department of Defense General Counsel to develop draft language for an executive order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial to allow victims to participate in the post-trial phase. This will give victims the right to provide input on courts-martial post-trial actions. The military justice system allows for discretion in sentencing at court-martial, with the possibility of no punishment beyond the conviction. The UCMJ grants commanders discretion in handling offenses, allowing for various actions such as no action, administrative action, non-judicial punishment, charges, or referral. Congress mandates specific punishments for certain offenses like spies and premeditated murder. Language in the House FY2014 NDAA requires mandatory punishment for sex-related offenses. Section 533 of the House FY2014 NDAA mandates a minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, including rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy, and attempts to commit these offenses. These offenses must be tried only at a general court-martial, with a minimum sentence that includes a dishonorable discharge or dismissal from the service. Another section, 550a, adds the requirement of confinement for two years in addition to the mandatory punishment. The House FY2014 NDAA mandates minimum punishment for sex-related offenses at general court-martial, including rape, sexual assault, and sodomy. The Senate FY2014 NDAA also addresses minimum punishment for sex-related offenses and court-martial jurisdiction, with differences in qualifying offenses. The FY2014 NDAA in both the House and Senate versions allows commanders to temporarily reassign or remove servicemembers accused of sex-related offenses for protection against retaliation. The House includes offenses under UCMJ Articles 120, 120a, 120b, and 120c, while the Senate adds Article 125. Accused individuals may be reassigned for maintaining discipline, not as punishment. The Secretaries of the Military Departments have been directed to develop policy for reassigning members accused of sexual assault for maintaining order and discipline within the unit. Lackland Air Force Base has faced complaints of sexual misconduct involving military trainers and trainees. The sexual misconduct allegations at Lackland Air Force Base involving military trainers and trainees have sparked congressional interest. 26 instructors have been tried for offenses like rape and sending inappropriate messages. The House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA address this issue differently. The House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA address sexual misconduct allegations at Lackland Air Force Base differently. The House requires prosecution under the UCMJ for violators, while the Senate focuses on prohibiting sexual acts between military instructors and trainees. Hagel directed actions to address the issue. Secretary of Defense Hagel directed the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to ensure consistent policies on inappropriate relations between trainers and trainees. A survey's findings are due to be reported to Secretary Hagel by November 1, 2013. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced a bill, S. 967, addressing sex-related offenses under the UCMJ. The Manual for Courts-Martial is being modified to eliminate factors related to the accused's character and military service, change the authority to convene courts-martial, set deadlines for military judges, modify clemency authority, and require command action on reports of sexual offenses. It is uncertain if the bill will be introduced in its entirety during the Senate debate on the FY2014 NDAA. Section 2 of the bill would create a bifurcated military justice system for offenses with maximum confinement greater than one year. The new military justice system creates a separate process for offenses with a maximum confinement of over one year. Certain offenses like spies and wrongful use of controlled substances remain under the current system. Disposition authority is held by an O-6 officer or higher with trial experience, outside the chain of command of the accused. The officer decides whether to proceed with a special or general court-martial, with the decision binding on the convening authority. The new military justice system establishes a separate process for offenses with a maximum confinement of over one year. Disposition authority is held by an O-6 officer or higher with trial experience, outside the chain of command of the accused. The officer decides whether to proceed with a special or general court-martial, with the decision binding on the convening authority. Section 3 modifies the MCM to eliminate the factor relating to the character and military service of the accused in the initial disposition of charges. Section 4 changes the officers authorized to convene general and special courts-martial, potentially removing certain officers' convening authority. The new military justice system grants convening authority to an O-6 officer or higher for offenses with a maximum confinement of over one year, except when the accused and/or victim are in the officer's chain of command. New offices called \"Chief of Staff on Courts-Martial\" are created within each military service to convene courts-martial and detail military judges. Section 5 establishes a 90-day deadline for a military judge to call general and special courts-martial into session after the authority determines to try such charges by court-martial. The new military justice system establishes a 90-day deadline for a military judge to convene courts-martial, but there is a conflict with UCMJ Article 40 regarding granting continuances. Section 6 addresses the convening authority and clemency, with differences between the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA. Section 7, if enacted, would require commanding officers to act immediately upon receiving a report. Section 7 of the new military justice system would mandate commanding officers to promptly refer reports of sexual-related offenses to the criminal investigation office, potentially leaving some offenses unreported due to lack of definition."
