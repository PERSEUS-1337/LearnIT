    "title": "SB 879",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. California is facing an extreme housing shortage, with 2.2 million low-income renter households competing for only 664,000 affordable rental homes, leaving 1.54 million of the state's lowest income households without access to affordable housing. Homelessness in California is on the rise, with 115,738 homeless people in 2015, accounting for 21% of the nation's homeless population. California also had the highest rate of unsheltered people at 64%, the largest numbers of unaccompanied homeless children and youth, the largest number of homeless veterans, and the second largest number of people in families with chronic homelessness. California has 21 of the 30 most expensive rental housing markets in the country, impacting the middle class and working poor. The state requires the third highest wage in the country to afford housing, with a \"housing wage\" of $26.65 per hour needed to rent a two-bedroom apartment without exceeding 30% of income on housing. Minimum wage earners would need to work three jobs to afford rent in some areas. Low-income families in California are struggling to afford rent, leading to sacrifices in other basic needs. State funding for affordable housing has significantly decreased, with $5 billion from Proposition 46 and Proposition 1C already spent. The loss of redevelopment funds has left critical housing programs unfunded. Investment in existing housing programs is crucial to address high housing costs and shortage in California. This will benefit homeless individuals, low-income earners, and vulnerable populations such as foster youth, persons with disabilities, farmworkers, elderly, single parents, and survivors of domestic violence. Additionally, investments should be made in housing for Medi-Cal recipients and family day care providers. Investment in housing, particularly through the Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018, creates jobs and local benefits. Building 100 rental apartments in a typical area results in $11.7 million in local income, $2.2 million in taxes, and 161 local jobs. The recurring impacts include $2.6 million in local income, $503,000 in taxes, and 44 local jobs. The terms \"Board,\" \"Committee,\" and \"Fund\" are defined in relation to the Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018. This part will only be effective if approved by voters in the November 6, 2018, election. The Affordable Housing Bond Act Trust Fund of 2018 is established in the State Treasury to fund housing-related programs. Bonds issued for this purpose will be allocated according to specified purposes. The Affordable Housing Bond Act Trust Fund of 2018 establishes the Multifamily Housing Account with $1.5 billion for housing programs and the Transit-Oriented Development and Infill Infrastructure Account with $600 million for specific purposes. The curr_chunk states that $300 million will be deposited into the Transit-Oriented Development Implementation Fund for the purpose of developing higher density uses near transit stations to increase public transit ridership. These funds can also be used for other program purposes. Three hundred million dollars will be deposited in the Infill Infrastructure Financing Account for infill incentive grants to support high-density affordable and mixed-income housing in designated infill locations. The funds can be used for park creation, water/sewer infrastructure, transportation improvements, traffic mitigation, and other program purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of funds for various housing programs, including the Building Equity and Growth in Neighborhoods (BEGIN) Program and the Special Populations Housing Account. These funds are designated for downpayment assistance for first-time home buyers and low- to moderate-income buyers, as well as for other authorized purposes of the programs. Three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) allocated to the Joe Serna, Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant Fund for grants or loans to construct or rehabilitate housing for agricultural employees and their families, address displacement issues, and acquire manufactured housing. Three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) allocated to the Local Housing Trust Matching Grant Program Account for competitive grants or loans to local housing trust funds for affordable housing projects and pilot programs demonstrating innovative approaches. Funds can be derived from private or governmental sources and used for authorized program purposes. Three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) allocated to the Home Ownership Development Account for the CalHome Program to provide direct, forgivable loans for development projects involving multiple home ownership units, self-help mortgage assistance programs, and manufactured homes. The Legislature may amend laws related to allocated funds to improve program efficiency and further program goals. The Legislature has the authority to adjust the allocation of bond proceeds to promote affordable housing development in the state. CHAPTER 3. Fiscal Provisions: Bonds totaling $3 billion are authorized for the purposes outlined in this part and to reimburse the General Obligation Bond Expense Revolving Fund. The state's full faith and credit are pledged for the timely payment of both principal and interest on the issued bonds. The bonds authorized by this part shall be prepared, executed, issued, sold, paid, and redeemed as provided in the State General Obligation Bond Law. The Housing Finance Committee is continued in existence for the purpose of authorizing the issuance and sale of the bonds authorized by this part. The committee may adopt guidelines for its financing programs to protect bond validity and tax exemption. The Department of Housing and Community Development and California Housing Finance Agency are designated as the \"board\" for programs they administer. Upon request, the committee determines the need for issuing bonds for specified actions. Bonds may be issued progressively and bear interest. A sum of money is collected annually to pay off the bonds. All officers must ensure the collection of this additional sum. The State Treasury appropriates funds from the General Fund for bond payments and to carry out Section 54024 without regard to fiscal years. The board may request a loan from the Pooled Money Investment Account for purposes of this part, not exceeding the unsold bonds authorized to be sold. The board shall execute necessary documents to obtain and repay the loan, with the amount deposited in the fund for allocation. The Director of Finance may authorize the withdrawal from the General Fund of amounts not exceeding the unsold bonds authorized for sale. The withdrawn amounts will be deposited in the fund for allocation and must be returned to the General Fund with interest earned from the sale of bonds. The bonds authorized by this part may be refunded in accordance with the Government Code. Approval by the electors of this act shall also approve any refunding bonds issued. The maturity date of these bonds shall not exceed 35 years from the date of each bond. The Legislature declares that proceeds from bonds authorized by this part are not considered \"proceeds of taxes\" under the California Constitution, exempting them from certain limitations. The Treasurer may maintain a separate account for investment earnings from the sale of bonds authorized by this part, order payment to comply with rebate requirements under federal law, and direct the use and investment of proceeds to maintain tax-exempt status and obtain advantages under federal law for the state funds. All moneys from premiums and interest on bonds sold under this part go to the General Fund for bond interest. Premiums may be used for issuance costs before transfer. Section 2 becomes active upon voter adoption of the Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018. Section 2 will be on the November 6, 2018, ballot. This act is urgent for public peace, health, or safety and takes immediate effect. To ensure timely analysis and preparation of the bond act proposed in Section 2, this act must take effect immediately."
