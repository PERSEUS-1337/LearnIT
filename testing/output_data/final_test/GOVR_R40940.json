The People's Republic of China has increased its diplomatic and economic influence in the developing world, earning international goodwill through infrastructure projects and state enterprise ventures. While some praise China for meeting unmet development needs, others criticize its lack of promotion of democracy, equitable development, and environmental preservation in these countries. China's economic assistance in developing countries has raised concerns among some U.S. policy-makers and observers. They believe that China's aid without conditions undermines the influence of other donors in areas like democracy, human rights, and economic reforms. Critics argue that Chinese financing has led to excessive debt in some countries. Despite being difficult to quantify, China's foreign aid is seen as ad hoc without a centralized system or regularized funding schedule. Beijing does not publicly release foreign aid data, leading analysts to speculate on the extent of China's contributions. China's foreign aid data is not publicly released by Beijing, leading to varied estimates of China's economic assistance. This assistance includes low-interest loans, investments, and development aid, with a small portion categorized as official development assistance. The lack of official data and disparate definitions of aid contribute to the wide range of estimates. China's foreign aid includes poverty-reduction programs, humanitarian assistance, and food aid, with little military and security-related assistance. Unlike major OECD donors, China's economic assistance focuses on its development needs, promoting exports of raw materials and sourcing project materials from China. Beijing is working towards centralizing and making its foreign aid process more transparent, coordinating with other aid providers, and offering development-oriented assistance. China has also started sending \"youth volunteers\" abroad for teaching, similar to the U.S. Peace Corps volunteers. China's foreign aid includes sending \"youth volunteers\" abroad for teaching and training in various subjects. Some analysts view China's economic activities abroad as foreign aid, sponsored by PRC government agencies or state enterprises. There are differing opinions on whether these activities constitute foreign direct investment. Many estimates of China's foreign aid may not fully capture the extent of economic assistance provided. China's economic assistance activities are not fully captured by traditional measurements. The China Statistical Yearbook 2003-06 reported an annual aid figure of $970 million, while other sources suggest annual foreign aid from China ranges from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Some analysts believe China's aid levels are comparable to countries like Australia, Belgium, or Denmark. In contrast, the U.S. has the largest official development assistance among OECD member countries. The U.S. foreign operations budget in FY2008 was estimated at $24 billion, but broader definitions of foreign aid suggest that China's economic assistance impact may be greater than conventional measurements indicate. China's economic assistance activities in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia exceed officially reported ODA and FDI totals combined. In 2006 and 2007, China's annual FDI outflows totaled roughly $21 billion annually. The NYU Wagner School research team found that 66% of Chinese economic assistance was provided in these regions between 2001 and 2008. The NYU Wagner School research team found that 66% of Chinese economic assistance in developing countries was in the form of loans, 29% as state-sponsored investment, and 5% in grants, debt relief, and in-kind aid. However, caution is needed in interpreting the estimated totals as some values may be inflated, projects may have been cancelled, and investments may also qualify as FDI. Chinese economic assistance in developing countries may be underestimated due to unreported projects or data, and exclusion of Chinese materials and labor. The value of Chinese assistance often exceeds its monetary worth, as loans and investments are provided quickly and without stringent conditions. China focuses on projects in areas avoided by other donors, leading to disproportionate appreciation for their contributions. The NYU Wagner School findings suggest that Chinese economic assistance in developing countries, such as national cultural centers, stadiums, and highways, symbolizes friendship and is driven by the PRC's need for natural resources. This report may inform U.S. policy responses to China's growing foreign assistance and investment in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Chinese economic assistance in developing countries, driven by the PRC's need for natural resources and diplomatic objectives, aims to open foreign markets for Chinese goods and help PRC companies invest overseas. Unlike major OECD aid donors, China lacks a centralized aid agency and primarily provides concessional loans through the Ministry of Commerce. Africa received the largest year-on-year increases in Chinese economic assistance during the 2002-2007 period. During 2002-2007, Chinese economic assistance to Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia saw significant growth. PRC government-backed investments accounted for 53% of assistance, with concessional loans at 42%. Infrastructure projects received 44% of loans, while natural resources and agriculture sectors received 44.5% of assistance. China's economic assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa has grown dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s, with a focus on infrastructure projects, public health assistance, and scholarships. Motivations include diplomatic relations and competition with Taiwan. Only four countries in the region still maintain official relations with Taiwan. In 2007, China offered Malawi aid and investment worth $6 billion, leading to a switch in diplomatic relations. However, in 2008, China promised Malawi only $287 million. Chinese engagement in the region now includes larger development projects serving China's economic interests. China's economic assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa has significantly increased since the 1970s and 1980s, focusing on infrastructure projects, public health aid, and scholarships. Estimates of China's aid to Africa vary, with reports suggesting amounts ranging from $1-2.7 billion annually. In 2006, the World Bank mentioned PRC infrastructure financing in Africa worth $7 billion. The China Exim Bank and China Development Bank provided concessional loans and set up a $5 billion China-Africa Development Fund for various projects. Research found that PRC economic assistance and investments in Africa during 2002-2007 averaged $6.6 billion annually.

Research found that PRC economic assistance and investments in Africa during 2002-2007 averaged $6.6 billion annually. U.S., U.K., and France are the largest bilateral donors of ODA to Africa, providing significant assistance in recent years. In 2006, OECD countries pledged $5 billion in ODA for infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. The United States invested $1.5 billion in Africa out of $36 billion in global FDI received by the region that year. China's FDI flows to Africa totaled $392 million in 2005, while India had more cumulative investment in Africa in 2004. China's investment in Africa has been significant, with reports of $2.6 billion in cumulative FDI and over $0.5 billion in annual investment in 2006. China has become Africa's third largest trading partner, with trade worth $106.6 billion in 2008. The economic assistance and investments in Africa are driven by China's need for oil and minerals, with African oil accounting for 80% of China's trade in the region. China's economic assistance to Africa is mainly through concessional loans and export credits provided by the Ministry of Commerce and Eximbank. PRC loans to Africa have been used to finance infrastructure projects in over 35 African countries, with a focus on hydropower and transportation. China's share of the African oil market is estimated to be between 10%-16%, with a larger role in the continent's minerals markets. Angola, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Sudan receive a significant portion of PRC infrastructure financing due to their major oil fields. Europe and the United States remain the largest buyers of African petroleum. The Wagner team compiled a list of PRC economic assistance and investment projects in Africa during 2002-2007, totaling $33 billion. 54% was for infrastructure projects, 28.5% for natural resources, and 2.5% for humanitarian activities. Loans are often repaid in kind, such as oil or commodities. One example is a $9 billion investment agreement between Congo and China for mining projects in exchange for rights over copper and cobalt deposits. China's engagement in Africa includes development and humanitarian aid, such as building schools and hospitals, providing medical training and equipment, and offering agricultural technical assistance. In Latin America and the Caribbean, China's interest is mainly driven by gaining access to natural resources like oil, ores, and soybeans, isolating Taiwan, and expanding its diplomatic presence in the region. In 2007, a Central American country established diplomatic relations with the PRC, terminating ties with Taiwan. The PRC aims to open up new markets for Chinese goods and investments, but analysts note that the US remains the dominant influence in the Western Hemisphere. The EU and the US are the largest sources of FDI in Latin America, while PRC investment in the region is relatively low, with most funds going to off-shore financial havens for reinvestment in China. China's investment in the Western Hemisphere is relatively low compared to other regions, with most funds being reinvested in China through off-shore financial havens. Latin American companies have invested $20 billion in China, and trade between China and Latin America has grown significantly. Despite the United States importing more oil from Venezuela, China is becoming an important trading partner in the region, second only to the US. China is the second largest importer of commodities and goods from Latin America, with key trading partners being Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Peru. Chinese economic assistance and investment projects in the Western Hemisphere from 2002-2007 totaled $26.7 billion, with a focus on natural resources and infrastructure. Recent humanitarian assistance includes infrastructure repair in Costa Rica, hospitals in Cuba, funding for mudslide victims in Bolivia, and aid for earthquake victims in Peru and flood victims in Uruguay. In 2008, China committed $350 million to the Inter American Development Bank for public and private sector projects. China's economic activities in Latin America are commercial, with a focus on natural resources. The US, EU, and Japan are major providers of official development assistance in the region. China is a significant source of infrastructure financing in Southeast Asia, although not a major provider of ODA according to the OECD. China's economic presence in Southeast Asia is significant due to its proximity and historical ties to the region. In 2008, China's trade with ASEAN countries was $230 billion, surpassing its trade with Africa. Southeast Asia's largest sources of FDI in 2006 were the EU, Japan, the United States, South Korea, and China. Japan, the EU, China, and the United States are the region's largest trading partners. China's economic presence in Southeast Asia is significant, with trade with ASEAN countries at $230 billion in 2008, larger than trade with Africa and Latin America. China provides economic and military assistance to countries like Burma, Cambodia, and Laos, financing infrastructure and development projects in the region. Chinese assistance is diversifying to include support for counter-trafficking and counter-narcotics efforts. China's economic presence in Southeast Asia is significant, with trade at $230 billion in 2008. Chinese assistance includes support for counter-trafficking and counter-narcotics efforts, programs involving Chinese youth volunteers in Laos, elections and historical preservation in Cambodia, and financing railway construction, hydropower development, and ship building facilities in Vietnam. China is a major financer and investor in infrastructure, energy, agriculture, and mining in the Philippines, providing preferential loans to Indonesia. The Philippines is the largest recipient of PRC loans in Southeast Asia, totaling $2 billion in 2007. In 2008, the Indonesian state electricity company borrowed $615 million from China's Eximbank to build coal-fired plants. The Wagner School team compiled a list of PRC economic assistance and investment projects in Southeast Asia from 2002-2007, totaling $14.8 billion. Japan is the largest bilateral aid donor in Southeast Asia, providing $2 billion in 2006, while the United States funded an estimated $517 million in aid. In 2008, the United States provided $517 million in aid programs to Southeast Asian countries, with increased assistance after 2001 for security in the Philippines, health activities in Cambodia, and HIV/AIDS programs in Vietnam."
