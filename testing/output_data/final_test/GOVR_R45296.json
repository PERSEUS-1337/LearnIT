    "content": "During the 115th Congress, various housing issues were addressed, including housing finance, tax provisions, assistance programs, and HUD regulations review. This report offers a high-level overview of these issues, providing background information and legislative activities. It aims to give a broad perspective without detailed analysis, referencing more in-depth reports where available. The section also discusses housing and mortgage market conditions to set the context for later housing policy discussions. Since the late 2000s housing crisis, national housing market indicators have shown recovery from price declines and foreclosures. While some areas still lag, overall trends indicate increasing house prices and declining foreclosure rates. Housing market indicators show recovery from the late 2000s crisis, with declining foreclosure rates and increasing house prices. Affordability remains a concern for both homebuyers and renters, as prices have outpaced incomes in many areas. The available housing inventory and mortgage access are factors affecting housing affordability. Limited inventory and tight mortgage credit post-housing crisis impact affordability. Low levels of new home construction contribute to limited housing inventory. Mortgage standards are loosening for certain types of mortgages. Housing market indicators during the 115th Congress show rising home prices and low inventory levels. Home prices are increasing, inventory levels are low, housing starts are rising but still below historical levels, and home buying activity is returning to pre-crisis levels. Mortgage foreclosures and negative equity have eased, but local housing markets may not have fully recovered. Housing demand and affordability are impacted by mortgage availability and costs. On a national basis, nominal house prices have been increasing year-over-year since 2012, with changes above 5% since 2015 and over 6% since 2017. House prices vary across local markets, some exceeding pre-recession levels. Rising prices reduce affordability for buyers but benefit current homeowners with increased equity. Mortgage interest rates have been low for several years, making it easier for households to purchase homes or refinance. Rates have increased since 2018 but decreased slightly in December 2018, ending the year at 4.64%. Rising interest rates may impact affordability for some households, adding to homeownership affordability pressures. Despite rising house prices and concerns about affordability due to increasing mortgage interest rates, metrics suggest that owner-occupied housing remains relatively affordable. Rising incomes and historically low interest rates contribute to homes being considered affordable, despite recent price increases. Some factors affecting affordability may not be fully captured. Some factors affecting housing affordability, such as down payment requirements and other upfront costs, may not be fully captured by metrics that measure monthly mortgage payment affordability. Other factors like mortgage qualification, housing market availability, regional price differences, and demographic disparities can also impact homeownership accessibility. Housing affordability may become more challenging due to increasing house prices and interest rates. Low housing inventory levels contribute to rising prices, with the months' supply of homes for sale consistently below the historical average. This shortage has persisted for several years, impacting the housing market. The low housing inventory levels have been a persistent issue for several years, impacting the housing market. Factors affecting inventory include homeowners' decisions to sell and the amount of new construction, which has been relatively low due to various considerations like labor shortages and building costs. Housing starts, the number of new housing units where construction begins, are used as a measure of new construction activity. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts for single-family homes has been increasing in recent years, reflecting the rise in demand. However, they still remain below the levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. From 2000 to 2007, the annual rate of housing starts was generally around 1.2 million. The annual rate of housing starts for one-unit residential buildings ranged from 1.2 million to 1.8 million per month before dropping to 400,000 to 600,000 until 2013. Recently, housing starts have been increasing, with an average rate of 850,000 in 2017 and 824,000 in November 2018. Despite limited inventory and rising prices, home sales have been on the rise, with existing home sales reaching about 5.5 million in 2017, the highest level since 2006. New home sales are typically in the hundreds of thousands annually. The number of new home sales in 2017 reached about 614,000, the highest level since 2007. However, this is lower than the levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some potential homebuyers may face challenges in obtaining mortgages due to various financial factors. Balancing access to credit for homebuyers with the risk of repayment is a key debate in the housing market. Access to mortgage credit is a subject of ongoing debate, with experts noting tighter standards compared to the early 2000s. Some argue that credit standards are still too tight, while others believe they are easing too much, especially for FHA-insured mortgages. Some experts argue that easing credit standards for mortgages in recent years may increase the risk of certain types of loans and contribute to higher house prices. The FHA is monitoring trends such as higher debt-to-income ratios and certain down payment assistance programs that could pose risks. Lenders can choose to hold mortgages in their portfolio, sell to private companies, or to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises that bundle mortgages into securities. In the aftermath of the housing bubble burst, there was a rise in government-insured or guaranteed mortgages, raising concerns about increased government risk exposure and limited private capital in the mortgage market. Approximately two-thirds of mortgages originated in the first three-quarters of 2018 were either federally guaranteed by agencies like FHA or VA (22%) or backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (45%). The share of new mortgage originations insured by a federal agency or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac has decreased from nearly 90% in 2009. However, it remains elevated compared to the 2002-2007 period when FHA and VA mortgages were less common. The homeownership rate has also decreased since the housing market turmoil began. Since the housing market turmoil, the homeownership rate has decreased while the percentage of renter households has increased. The rise in renters has led to lower vacancy rates and higher rents, causing more renter households to be considered cost-burdened. The share of renters has been increasing for the last decade, reaching close to 37% of all occupied housing units in 2016, the highest since the early 1990s. The homeownership rate has correspondingly decreased, falling from 69% in 2004 to just over 63% in 2016. The share of renters decreased slightly in 2017 to about 36%, while the homeownership rate increased to nearly 64%. The number of renter households has been increasing, with 43.1 million in 2017. This increase in renters has led to lower rental vacancy rates in many areas. The rental housing supply has not kept up with the increase in demand, leading to a national rental vacancy rate of over 10% from 2008 to 2010. The rate has since declined to about 7% by the end of 2017, with fluctuations in between. Affordable rental units are particularly scarce, with many new constructions targeting higher-end markets. Rental housing affordability is impacted by factors like supply, demand, and new construction. Recent years have seen an increase in demand for rental housing, leading to higher rents. New construction has focused on higher-end units, contributing to the affordability challenge. Median renter incomes have been increasing, sometimes surpassing rent increases, but over the long term, rents have risen faster than incomes. Between 2001 and 2017, median rent for recent movers increased by over 25% while median renter income only rose by about 6%, reducing rental affordability. Rising rental costs and stagnant renter incomes can lead to housing affordability issues, especially for lower-income households. Housing is considered affordable if a household spends no more than 30% of its income on housing costs, with those paying more than 30% being considered cost-burdened and those paying over 50% being severely cost-burdened. The number of cost-burdened renter households has increased in recent years, with lower-income households being most affected. In 2016, 80% of renter households with incomes below $30,000 were cost-burdened. Moderate-income households have also seen a rise in cost burdens. Renter households have seen significant increases in cost burdens since the early 2000s, with 8.3 million considered to have \"worst-case housing needs\" in 2015. This represents an increase from previous years and is a key issue during the 115th Congress related to housing financing. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 led to legislative and regulatory responses, including requirements on financial institutions related to mortgages. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 implemented many of these requirements. Debate continues on balancing consumer protection and financial system stability without restricting credit access. Bills in the 115th Congress aimed to amend financial regulatory requirements. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 115-174) was passed in May 2018 to amend financial regulatory requirements, including those related to mortgages. It allows certain mortgages held by small depository institutions to be considered \"qualified mortgages\" and makes changes to property appraisal requirements. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act amended financial regulatory requirements related to mortgages, including changes to the ability-to-repay rule, property appraisal requirements, exemptions for small banks and credit unions from new reporting requirements under HMDA, grace periods for mortgage originators switching positions, expanded exclusions for manufactured home retailers from mortgage originator definitions, and waiving waiting periods for lower interest rate offers. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act made changes to mortgage regulations, including lower interest rates, refinancing practices, protections for renters in foreclosed properties, and a one-year protection against foreclosure. Opponents argue that these changes weaken consumer protections. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act made various changes to mortgage regulations, including protections for active duty servicemembers, alternative credit scoring models for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and requirements for Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans. It also included changes to small public housing agencies, HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency program, and mandated reports on lead paint hazards and foreclosures in Puerto Rico post-Hurricane Maria. The U.S. housing finance system, supported by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, holds over $10 trillion in single-family mortgage debt and $1 trillion in multifamily mortgage debt. These government-sponsored enterprises purchase mortgages meeting specific criteria from lenders and either sell them as mortgage-backed securities or retain them as investments. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Department of the Treasury purchased over $200 billion of new senior preferred stock from each GSE. Treasury has received nearly $280 billion in dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Since 2012, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac drew on their lines of credit with Treasury in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to changes in deferred tax assets from the tax revision law. Policymakers have sought comprehensive housing finance reform legislation to transform or eliminate the GSEs' role. There is agreement on increasing the private sector's role in the mortgage market but disagreement on how to achieve this and the technical details of a restructured housing finance system. The 113th Congress did not enact housing finance reform legislation, while the 114th Congress considered targeted reforms to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In the 115th Congress, housing finance reform was indicated as a priority but little legislative action occurred. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin suggested housing finance reform would be a focus in the 116th Congress. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Hensarling released a discussion draft of a comprehensive housing finance reform bill in September 2018. Chairman Hensarling plans to reintroduce the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act (PATH Act) from the 113th Congress for housing finance reform. The reintroduced PATH Act (H.R. 6746) is unlikely to pass, so he will pursue a discussion draft bill as an alternative. The Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the draft bill in December 2018, which could also consider changes to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to make affordable mortgages more available. During the 115th Congress, attention was given to issues related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including retaining capital, drawing on lines of credit, and making contributions to affordable housing funds despite Treasury support agreements. During the 115th Congress, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced issues such as retaining capital, drawing on lines of credit, and making contributions to affordable housing funds despite Treasury support agreements. Additional information on the housing finance system, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA can be found in various CRS reports. FHA, part of HUD, insures mortgages made by private lenders to increase affordable mortgage credit availability. The FHA charges borrowers upfront and annual fees for mortgage insurance premiums to ensure affordable mortgage credit availability. The HUD Secretary is responsible for maintaining the FHA single-family mortgage insurance fund's financial soundness and compliance with a 2% capital ratio requirement. Premiums were raised during the housing market turmoil but lowered in 2015 as delinquency rates decreased. The FHA lowered annual premiums in 2015 as mortgage delinquency rates decreased. HUD planned to decrease premiums further in January 2017, but the Trump Administration suspended the decrease to analyze its impact on the FHA insurance fund. The FHA planned to decrease premiums in 2017, but the Trump Administration suspended the decrease to analyze its impact on the insurance fund. The lower premiums would have resulted in less revenue and more insured mortgages, potentially lowering the capital ratio. Reverse mortgages insured by FHA are also negatively impacting the fund. The performance of the reverse mortgage portfolio raises questions about the impact on premiums for forward-mortgage borrowers. FHA-insured mortgages have specific requirements for condominiums that may affect eligibility for insurance. For more information on FHA-insured mortgages, refer to CRS Report RS20530 and CRS Report R42875. To insure a mortgage on a condominium unit, the entire condominium project must have FHA approval. Requirements for approval include a minimum percentage of owner-occupied units, limits on nonresidential space, and restrictions on units behind on association dues. Condominium buildings must undergo certification and periodic recertification processes. In 2009, HUD tightened requirements and ended \"spot approval\" for FHA insurance. These requirements aim to ensure FHA approval for condominium projects. The FHA approval requirements for condominium projects aim to ensure well-managed and financially stable buildings to reduce risk for mortgages. However, some argue that the changes are too strict, limiting access to FHA-insured mortgages. The debate revolves around balancing access to mortgages with protecting the FHA insurance fund. In 2016, the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act (HOTMA) was enacted, with provisions related to FHA's requirements for insuring mortgages on condominium units. These provisions aimed to streamline the recertification process, make changes to commercial space limits, adopt FHFA regulations on transfer fees, and address the required percentage of owner-occupied units in buildings. HUD issued a proposed rule in September 2016 to implement these provisions. The proposed rule related to approval of condominium projects, incorporating HOTMA provisions but broader in scope. It suggested a single-unit approval process for FHA-insured mortgages in non-FHA-approved buildings. In June 2018, over a hundred Members of Congress urged HUD to finalize the rule, but as of the end of the 115th Congress, it had not been issued. For more information on HOTMA provisions, refer to CRS Report R44358. Two of the largest tax incentives for homeowners are the mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction. Homeowners can deduct interest on mortgage debt up to $1.1 million if they itemize their deductions. Homeowners can deduct interest on mortgage debt up to $1.1 million. They can also deduct state and local property taxes. Not all homeowners claim these deductions, as some may not have a mortgage or may live in low-cost areas with small mortgages and property taxes. Itemization rates may vary based on factors like income tax in different states. Itemization rates are lower in states with income tax, leading to fewer homeowners claiming deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes. The majority of benefits from these deductions go to higher-income households due to their financial incentive to itemize taxes, larger mortgages, higher property taxes, and higher marginal tax rates. Some argue that these deductions incentivize homeownership, citing perceived benefits of owning a home. Some researchers suggest that tax benefits for homeownership may not significantly impact the homeownership rate as they do not reduce upfront costs. However, these benefits may incentivize homebuyers to purchase larger homes, increasing purchasing power and deductions with more expensive homes and larger mortgages. Refer to CRS Report R41596 for a detailed analysis of these tax benefits. In late 2017, a tax revision law (P.L. 115-97) changed the federal tax system, reducing the maximum deductible mortgage debt to $750,000 for debt incurred after December 15, 2017. Refinanced mortgage debt is treated based on the original mortgage date. Home equity loan interest remains deductible if used for home-related purposes. After the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97), the maximum deductible mortgage debt was reduced to $750,000 for debt incurred after December 15, 2017. Home equity loan interest is still deductible, but counts towards the maximum eligible mortgage amount. The mortgage limit will revert to $1 million after 2025. The deduction for state and local property and income taxes is limited to $10,000 until the end of 2025. The standard deduction was increased to $12,000 (single) or $24,000 (married), which will reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize deductions. Some households may pay more in taxes due to these changes. The lower limits on mortgage interest deduction could impact areas with high property taxes and home prices. The effects of these changes are unclear. Congress has extended temporary tax provisions, including housing-related ones like canceled mortgage debt exclusion and mortgage insurance deduction. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income associated with a primary residence from taxation to help distressed borrowers during the housing market turmoil of the late 2000s. Arguments for and against the exclusion of qualified canceled mortgage debt income from taxation have been debated. Proponents argue it minimizes hardship for distressed households and supports the housing market and economy. Opponents raise concerns about incentivizing debt forgiveness and fairness. Some argue the exclusion may be less necessary now as housing markets and the economy have improved. Homeowners can deduct interest paid on their mortgage, property taxes, and qualifying mortgage insurance premiums if they itemize their tax deductions. The deduction was initially available in 2007 and has been extended multiple times. Arguments for the deduction include promoting homeownership and housing market recovery, but its impact on homeownership rates is unclear. The deduction for homeowners has uncertain effects on homeownership rates and the housing market recovery. Extending the deduction may lead to a misallocation of resources towards the housing industry, but could help households in financial distress. Congress recently extended the exclusion for canceled mortgage debt and the ability to deduct mortgage insurance premiums in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended tax provisions such as the deduction for homeowners, exclusion for canceled mortgage debt, and ability to deduct mortgage insurance premiums through 2017. The low-income housing tax credit incentivizes affordable rental housing development through federal tax credits administered by the IRS. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program incentivizes affordable housing development by offering tax credits to investors. Developers sell the credits to investors to finance housing projects. LIHTC developments historically had to meet either a \"20-50\" or \"40-60\" income test, but a new option for income averaging was added by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 introduced income averaging as an option for LIHTC developments, allowing for income averaging between 20-50 or 40-60 tests. This change aims to make it easier to include more deeply income-targeted units, increase eligibility for LIHTC properties, and facilitate mixed-income housing. Additionally, the Act increased LIHTC credits available to states by 12.5% per year. The broader tax revision law (P.L. 115-97) did not directly impact the LIHTC program, but changes such as corporate tax rate reductions could affect demand for LIHTCs. The increase in tax credits under P.L. 115-141 may help mitigate concerns about the tax law's impact on LIHTC prices. For more information on LIHTC and recent changes, refer to CRS Report RS22389. Some housing-related issues in the 115th Congress involve federal programs providing housing assistance to low-income households. Concerns about federal budget deficits have led to interest in reducing discretionary funding, impacting HUD's budget for housing assistance programs. More than three-quarters of HUD's appropriations are dedicated to rental assistance programs like the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, project-based rental assistance, and public housing. Despite funding increases, these programs can only serve one in four eligible families, leading to long waiting lists for assistance. Public housing has been underfunded for years, creating pressure to provide increased funding. In a budget environment with limits on discretionary spending, the pressure to maintain current services for HUD's largest programs must be balanced against demands to fund other HUD programs like the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and grants for homelessness assistance. The Trump Administration's budget requests for FY2018 and FY2019 proposed decreases in HUD funding and the elimination of several programs, citing budget constraints. The Administration proposed that state and local governments take on more housing and community development activities due to budget constraints. The Bipartisan Budget Act of FY2018 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 increased overall funding for HUD by nearly 10% compared to FY2017. Final FY2019 appropriations for HUD had not yet been enacted as of the end of the 115th Congress. HUD programs and activities were funded under continuing resolutions through December 21, 2018, at which point funding lapsed. The funding lapse was still ongoing when the 115th Congress ended. HUD administers three primary direct rental assistance programs serving over 4 million families at a cost of nearly $40 billion per year. HUD administers three primary direct rental assistance programs that serve over 4 million families at a cost of nearly $40 billion per year, accounting for the majority of HUD's budget. These programs offer rental vouchers, subsidized apartments, and allow low-income individuals and families to pay affordable rent. Approximately half of the families served are elderly or have disabilities, while the other half are families with children. Despite being the largest federal housing assistance programs, they only reach about one in four eligible families due to funding limitations, leading to long waiting lists for assistance. In the 115th Congress, various policy proposals and debates were driven by cost considerations, welfare reform ideas, and administrative efficiencies regarding HUD rental assistance programs. HUD Secretary Carson introduced the Making Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 (MAHWA) legislative proposal in April 2018, aiming to change how tenant rents are calculated. MAHWA suggested eliminating current income deductions and implementing two rent structures based on gross income, potentially increasing rents for assisted housing recipients and reducing federal subsidies. The Making Affordable Housing Work Act of 2018 proposed changes to HUD rental assistance programs, including two rent structures based on gross income and allowing local discretion in establishing rent structures and work requirements for recipients. The proposal aimed to increase rents for tenants but allowed for phased implementation by the Secretary. HUD described the changes as setting the programs on a more fiscally sustainable path. In a proposal, HUD aims to make rental assistance programs more fiscally sustainable and promote self-sufficiency. Low-income housing advocates are concerned about increased rent payments. Legislation to implement the proposal was not introduced in the 115th Congress. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) was an Obama Administration initiative to address the backlog in public housing capital needs by allowing conversion to Section 8 vouchers or project-based rental assistance. PHAs face limitations in raising private capital due to federal deed restrictions. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) allows for the conversion of public housing properties to Section 8 vouchers or project-based rental assistance by removing federal deed restrictions. RAD conversions must be cost-neutral and were initially limited to 60,000 units, but Congress has since expanded the program to allow up to 455,000 units of public housing to participate. In FY2018, Congress raised the cap to allow 455,000 units of public housing to convert to Section 8 under RAD. Nearly half of all public housing units could potentially convert. While RAD conversions are popular, a recent GAO study raised concerns about HUD's oversight and private funding raised through the conversions. Congress also mandated HUD to expand the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration by 100 PHAs, a waiver program providing flexibility for PHAs in managing public housing and voucher programs. The GAO raised concerns about HUD's oversight of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration, including the lack of monitoring of policy changes' effects on tenants. HUD solicited comments on the expansion process for MTW in 2017 and issued revisions in 2018, selecting the first expansion cohort. During the 115th Congress, various housing assistance bills were approved, including the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 115-174) which made changes to the Family Self Sufficiency program and offered regulatory streamlining provisions for small PHAs. Additionally, the Housing Choice Voucher program was also addressed. H.R. 5793, the Housing Choice Voucher Mobility Demonstration Act of 2018, aimed to test regional administration of the program to encourage moves to lower-poverty areas. H.R. 5735, the THRIVE Act, required HUD to undertake a demonstration. Neither bill was enacted during the 115th Congress. The Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities Act of 2017 aimed to create a federal preference for youth aging out of foster care and at risk of homelessness in federal housing assistance programs. The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2017 sought to address homelessness among children and youth. Both bills were not enacted before the end of the 115th Congress. The Homeless Children and Youth Act of 2017 aimed to expand the definition of homelessness for HUD programs to include homeless families with children and youth certified as homeless under other federal programs. Native Americans in tribal areas face housing challenges, with conditions generally worse than the national average. The main federal program providing housing assistance to Native American tribes is the Native American Housing Block Grant. The Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) was authorized by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) to provide formula funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income Native Americans or Alaska Natives in tribal areas. Another program, the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG), offers funding for affordable housing activities benefiting Native Hawaiians on Hawaiian Home Lands. In addition to NAHBG, other federal housing programs also assist tribes, such as the Tribal HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (Tribal HUD-VASH) program. The Tribal HUD-VASH program provides rental assistance and supportive services to Native American veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. It was created and funded through the FY2015 HUD appropriations act (P.L. 113-235) and has received funding in FY2017 and FY2018. No separate authorizing legislation currently exists for the program. The most recent authorization for NAHASDA programs expired in FY2013, and reauthorization bills have been introduced in Congress but not enacted. In the 115th Congress, NAHASDA reauthorization bills were introduced in both the House and the Senate but were not enacted. The bills would have reauthorized the NAHBG and NHHBG, as well as two home loan guarantee programs for Native Americans and Native Hawaiians. However, the House bill did not include reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian programs. Both bills also proposed changes to NAHBG program requirements and authorized a demonstration program for tribes to use their funds in specified ways. The NAHASDA reauthorization bills aimed to support private financing for housing activities in tribal areas and set aside 5% of HUD-VASH funding for the Tribal HUD-VASH program. Concerns were raised about tribes not spending their NAHBG funds timely, leading to a provision to reduce funding for tribes with large unexpended balances. Disagreements in Congress arose over specific provisions, such as setting maximum rents for NAHASDA-assisted housing units exceeding 30% of tenant incomes. Disagreements in Congress have arisen over Native Hawaiian housing programs, reflecting a broader debate about federal government involvement with Native Hawaiians. Supporters argue funding is necessary due to poor housing conditions on Hawaiian Home Lands. A Senate bill aimed to codify the Tribal HUD-VASH program, but the House did not consider it. For more information on NAHASDA and NAHBG, refer to CRS Report R43307. During the 115th Congress, major disasters triggered aid through FEMA, providing housing-related assistance like emergency shelter and long-term housing recovery. Congress also allocated supplemental funding, including $37 billion, through HUD's CDBG-DR grant program for long-term recovery efforts following disasters. The 115th Congress allocated $37 billion in total supplemental CDBG-DR funding in FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 to aid disaster-affected communities with long-term recovery efforts. There are concerns about the lack of formal authorization for the CDBG-DR program, leading to varying rules and oversight. Some members of Congress are interested in authorizing the program to address these issues. The House Financial Services Committee ordered H.R. 4557, the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of 2017, to authorize the CDBG-DR program and improve financial controls. Advocates and some Members of Congress criticized FEMA's housing response to 2017 hurricanes, calling for HUD to have a larger role, especially for Puerto Rico residents displaced by Hurricane Maria. They urged FEMA to collaborate with HUD for longer-term rental assistance, similar to past agreements after Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, and Sandy. The Disaster Housing Assistance Program (DHAP) was requested by the governor of Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, but FEMA denied it in 2018. Instead, FEMA provided temporary housing assistance for displaced Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States. The Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) program provided funding for Puerto Ricans displaced to the mainland United States, but expired in September 2018. Concerns about housing affordability have been increasing, leading to the introduction of several bills in the 115th Congress to address the issue through different approaches. Several bills in the 115th Congress aimed to address housing affordability through different approaches. Some focused on demand-side solutions, like creating a renter credit through changes to the tax code. Others focused on supply-side solutions, such as providing additional resources for existing affordable housing programs. Representative Waters introduced bills to increase resources for public housing and homeless assistance programs. In the 115th Congress, various bills were introduced to tackle housing affordability. One bill, S. 3231, proposed a task force to study the impact of a shortage of affordable housing on life outcomes and federal programs. Another significant proposal was S. 3503, the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act of 2018, which included authorizations for new funding for affordable housing programs totaling $44.5 billion per year for 10 years. The American Housing and Economic Mobility Act of 2018 proposed significant funding allocations for various housing programs, including $44.5 billion per year for 10 years for the Treasury's Capital Magnet Fund and $2.5 billion for HUD's Native American Housing Block Grant. It also included the creation of a $4 billion middle-class housing emergency fund, new funding for USDA rural housing programs, and grants for states to assist homeowners with negative equity. Additionally, the act called for reforms to local land use policies, down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers in low-income communities affected by redlining, and modifications to the Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Housing Act. The Trump Administration issued Executive Order 13777 in February 2017, directing agencies to evaluate existing regulations. In May 2017, HUD requested public comments to identify regulations for potential modification or repeal. These changes were part of a larger conversation about addressing housing affordability. HUD has suspended, withdrawn, or considered modifying regulations and policy decisions in response to a Federal Register notice seeking public input on outdated or burdensome regulations. These actions impact various HUD programs, including the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. HUD has introduced Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) at the zip code level in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, using more localized data from the American Community Survey to calculate subsidy levels. HUD introduced SAFMRs at the zip code level in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, aiming to increase accuracy and promote mobility. A demonstration was conducted in selected communities to test SAFMRs. In November 2016, a rule was finalized requiring certain PHAs with high voucher concentrations in high-poverty areas to use SAFMRs. Some supported the change for its benefits, while others expressed concerns about potential cost increases. 24 communities were mandated to use SAFMRs for their HCV programs, with other PHAs having the option to adopt them starting October 1, 2017. Following the suspension of SAFMRs by HUD Secretary Carson, fair housing advocates sued HUD, leading to a court injunction reinstating the mandatory use of SAFMRs for 24 communities. Other PHAs have the option to voluntarily implement SAFMRs for their HCV programs. HUD issued a Federal Register notice in January 2018 to review regulations related to manufactured housing, inviting public comment on potential changes. HUD issued a Federal Register notice in January 2018 to review regulations on manufactured housing, seeking public input on potential changes. Some argue that certain HUD rules drive up costs and limit access to affordable housing options. Specific rules under scrutiny include on-site completions, construction of add-on features, and foundation requirements in freezing areas. Public comments were requested on these topics and other manufactured housing regulations. The House-passed FY2018 appropriations bill aimed to restrict funds for certain HUD directives on manufactured housing regulations. Although not included in the final law, HUD was directed to review these directives, balance consumer safety with costs, and consider state and local jurisdiction over on-site completion of manufactured homes. HUD is required to administer programs in a way that promotes fair housing, with funding recipients also obligated to further fair housing goals. In July 2015, HUD published a final rule (AFFH rule) that defines affirmatively furthering fair housing and requires program participants to submit an Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) instead of an Analysis of Impediments (AI). HUD will provide data and tools to assist in preparing AFHs. HUD extended the deadline for local governments receiving over $500,000 in CDBG funds. HUD extended the deadline for local governments receiving more than $500,000 in CDBG funding to submit their AFHs until after October 31, 2020, stating that more time and technical assistance were needed. On May 23, 2018, HUD issued three notices suspending the implementation of the AFFH rule and reverting to the previous AI process. HUD withdrew the local government assessment tool for AFH submissions under the AFFH rule due to significant deficiencies, making it burdensome for participants. HUD plans to create a more effective tool in the future and will accept public input on improvements. The Restoring Fair Housing Protections Eliminated by HUD Act of 2018 aimed to reinstate the assessment tool for local governments. HUD withdrew the local government assessment tool for AFH submissions under the AFFH rule due to significant deficiencies. The Restoring Fair Housing Protections Eliminated by HUD Act of 2018 aimed to reinstate the tool for local governments, but no further action was taken during the 115th Congress. HUD announced an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) on August 13, 2018, seeking public comments on potential changes to the AFFH regulations, stating that a new approach is required. HUD is committed to achieving fair housing opportunity for all but believes the current rule is not fulfilling its purpose efficiently. The Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, and familial status in housing. It applies to various types of housing and real estate transactions. The Supreme Court confirmed in 2015 that the FHA also prohibits housing decisions with a disparate impact on protected groups. The FHA prohibits housing decisions with a disparate impact on protected classes. Courts recognize two types of disparate impacts under the FHA: when a decision has a greater adverse impact on one group than another, and when it perpetuates segregation. The Supreme Court and HUD have confirmed the cognizability of disparate-impact claims under the FHA. HUD and courts had different criteria for determining when a neutral policy causing disparate impact violates the FHA. HUD established uniform standards in 2013, but the Inclusive Communities Court adopted a similar three-step burden-shifting test for assessing liability under the FHA. The Supreme Court outlined criteria for determining liability in cases of disparate impact under the FHA, emphasizing the need for evidence supporting statistical disparity and causality. Lower courts and HUD should rigorously evaluate claims and dispose of them swiftly if a prima facie case is not established. HUD published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register on June 20, 2018. HUD published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in June 2018, seeking public feedback on potential amendments to the 2013 disparate impact regulations in light of the Inclusive Communities decision. The agency specifically asked for comments on issues such as the balance between encouraging legitimate disparate impact cases and avoiding unmeritorious claims, as well as the causality requirements for establishing such cases. The public comment period for potential amendments to the 2013 disparate impact regulations closed on August 20, 2018."
