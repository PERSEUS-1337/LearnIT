    "content": "The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) is the workers' compensation system for federal employees, including those in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, federal jurors, and Peace Corps volunteers. FECA is authorized by statute at 5 U.S.C. Sections 8101 et seq and administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). Benefits are paid out of the federal Employees' Compensation Fund, financed by appropriations from Congress and reimbursed by federal agencies. The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) provides federal agencies with estimates of the cost of FECA benefits to assist in budget preparation. Agencies must include an appropriation in their budget requests to cover FECA costs from the previous fiscal year. By October 15, agencies must reimburse the Employees' Compensation Fund for these costs. Administrative costs for the FECA program are funded through the appropriations process. The U.S. Postal Service and certain non-appropriated entities must also pay for their employees' benefits administration. The FECA program paid out $3.117 billion in benefits during the chargeback year, covering disability, medical, and survivor benefits for federal employees. Coverage includes all civilians employed by the federal government, full-time and part-time workers, volunteers, federal jurors, and certain groups like law enforcement officers and Peace Corps volunteers. Under FECA, workers' compensation benefits are provided to covered employees for disabilities or deaths resulting from work-related injuries or illnesses. There are no specific conditions listed as covered or not covered, but benefits are not granted for injuries caused by willful misconduct, intention to harm oneself or others, or intoxication. Felony convictions related to fraudulent FECA benefit applications result in forfeiture of all benefits. Additionally, benefits are not provided to individuals confined in institutions. The benefits of any person confined in jail, prison, or an institution pursuant to a felony conviction are suspended for the duration of the incarceration and may not be recovered. All FECA claims are processed and adjudicated by OWCP. Initial decisions on claims are made by OWCP staff based on evidence submitted by the claimant and his or her treating physician. OWCP can order a claimant or beneficiary to submit to a medical examination. Dissatisfied employees can request a hearing before OWCP or an OWCP review of the decision, with a final appeal to the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB). Claims for disability or death benefits must be made within three years of the injury or death. FECA claims must be filed within three years of the injury or death. For latent disabilities, the time limit starts when the employee becomes aware of the disability's cause. Traumatic injury qualifies for continuation of pay, equal to 100% of the employee's rate. Lost work time beyond 45 days is considered a disability. USPS employees have a three-day waiting period for continuation of pay eligibility. Employees must satisfy a three-day waiting period to be eligible for continuation of pay. If partially disabled, they can receive compensation benefits equal to two-thirds of the wage difference for singles or 75% for those with dependents. Benefits are capped at 75% of the maximum basic pay at rate GS-15, not taxed federally, and adjusted for cost of living annually. Payments are made for the duration of disability or the beneficiary's life. If an employee has a permanent partial disability, they are entitled to a scheduled benefit in addition to any other disability benefits received. The scheduled benefit is based on the type of disability and the employee's wage-earning capacity as determined by OWCP. The list of scheduled benefits is provided in Appendix A, and the employee receives standard FECA benefits for the specified number of weeks. Even if the employee returns to full-time work, they may still receive a scheduled award. If an employee suffers severe disfigurement on the face, head, or neck affecting employment, they can receive up to $3,500 in additional compensation. Total disability results in monthly benefits based on pre-disability wages, capped at 75% of GS-15 pay, and adjusted for cost of living. Benefits continue until the employee is no longer totally disabled. If an employee dies in the course of employment or from a latent condition caused by work, survivors may receive compensation benefits based on the employee's monthly wage at the time of death. Spouse and children are eligible for monthly benefits, with special rules for cases without a spouse or children. If a spouse remarries before age 55, benefits may be affected. If an employee dies in the course of employment or from a work-related condition, survivors may receive compensation benefits based on the employee's monthly wage at the time of death. Spouse and children are eligible for monthly benefits, with special rules for cases without a spouse or children. If a spouse remarries before age 55, they are entitled to a lump-sum payment equal to 24 months of benefits, after which all benefits cease. If a spouse remarries at age 55 or older, benefits continue for life. A child's benefits end at age 18, or age 23 if the child is still in school. Benefits continue for life if the child is disabled and incapable of self-support. Compensation benefits for death are capped at 75% of the maximum basic pay at rate GS-15, not subject to federal taxation, and subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment. The personal representative of the deceased employee is entitled to reimbursement for costs associated with terminating the formal relationship with the federal government, up to $200. Additionally, the personal representative is entitled to reimbursement of funeral costs up to $800. Under FECA, a beneficiary is entitled to full coverage of all medical costs related to a covered injury or illness, including medical devices, therapies, and medications. The federal government pays for these costs, and the beneficiary does not have to pay any coinsurance or use personal insurance. A fee schedule is used to determine reimbursement rates for medical providers, and the beneficiary can choose their own provider. Additionally, the government covers funeral costs up to $800 and will pay for shipping the body from the place of death to the employee's home. In the case of death while working in a contingency operation, a special gratuity payment of up to $100,000 is payable to designated survivors. Under FECA, a beneficiary can choose their own medical provider and receive reimbursement for transportation costs. Providers must be authorized by OWCP and can lose authorization for violating rules or fraud. Additional benefits of up to $1,500 per month are available for those needing constant personal care. The Secretary of Labor may require vocational rehabilitation, with costs covered by the government. Failure to participate may result in reduced benefits. Federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), with contributions made through payroll taxes. Both systems provide defined benefit pensions for retired and disabled employees, with FERS also including participation in Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan. Federal employees receiving FECA benefits do not contribute to CSRS or FERS but continue to accrue time for retirement eligibility. They cannot contribute to Social Security or TSP. Once eligible for CSRS or FERS retirement, they can choose between those benefits or remain on FECA. FERS basic annuity increases from 1% to 2% of high-three average pay during disability. The high-three average pay for federal employees receiving FECA benefits is increased to 2% to partially replace lost retirement income. Both CSRS and FERS offer disability retirement annuity options for employees unable to work due to disabilities. An employee must be unable to perform their current job due to a medical condition expected to last at least one year and have five years of service to qualify for disability retirement. An employee must have five years of service to qualify for disability retirement benefits under CSRS and 18 months of service under FERS. The amount of an employee's disability annuity is generally lower than a regular retirement annuity. FECA beneficiaries can choose between disability retirement benefits or remaining in the FECA program. FECA is covered by the public disability offset provisions of the Social Security Act. If a FECA beneficiary also receives SSDI benefits, the total amount is adjusted accordingly. The total amount of a Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiary's monthly benefit, including benefits for spouse or dependents, and FECA benefit cannot exceed 80% of their average monthly wage at the time of disability. Federal employees under the FERS system are covered by Social Security. If entitled to both FECA and Social Security retirement benefits, the FECA benefit is reduced by the Social Security retirement benefit. Congress and the President have focused on issues within the FECA program in recent years. In the 112th and 113th Congress, there were legislative efforts to reform the FECA program for federal employees, including postal workers. Bills such as H.R. 2309, H.R. 2465, S. 1789, and S. 1486 were introduced but did not become law. President Obama also proposed FECA reforms in his budget requests from FY2012 to FY2016. The President's FY2016 FECA reform proposal aimed to reduce benefits for new beneficiaries, encourage conversion to federal retirement benefits, ensure agencies pay program administrative costs, and address program integrity. Postal workers, who make up a significant portion of the FECA program, had a high rate of injuries compared to the rest of the federal government in FY2016. In 2006, Congress changed the three-day waiting period for postal workers with traumatic injuries under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. Workers must now satisfy the waiting period before the continuation of pay period to reduce FECA costs to the USPS. FECA benefits are payable for the duration of disability with no maximum age or duration. Beneficiaries eligible for CSRS or FERS retirement may choose to remain in the FECA program, receiving benefits up to 75% of pre-disability wage with annual cost-of-living adjustments and tax-free benefits. The FECA program provides cost-of-living adjustments to benefits, tax-free benefits, and potentially higher monthly benefits compared to CSRS or FERS annuities. FECA beneficiaries may not contribute to Social Security or TSP, affecting retirement income. Less than 2% of new injury cases stay on FECA rolls for over two years. Approximately 45,000 cases receive long-term disability benefits, with one-third involving beneficiaries aged 66 or older. The FECA rolls include postal workers aged 55 or older, with some aged 80 or older and even over 100. The provision of FECA compensation benefits to workers after retirement age has evolved over time. The provision of FECA compensation benefits to workers after retirement age has changed over time. Between 1949 and 1974, benefits could be reduced at age 70, but this was repealed in 1974. The question of whether benefits should continue past retirement age depends on their intent to replace lost income due to injury or illness. If FECA disability benefits are intended to provide relief beyond wage replacement, stopping benefits at any age while the disability continues would deprive the beneficiary of deserved benefits. Currently, 11 states and the District of Columbia place restrictions on benefits after retirement age. Currently, 11 states and the District of Columbia limit permanent total disability benefits under workers' compensation systems, with restrictions on the duration of benefits. Federal workers' compensation benefits through FECA are more generous than state systems, offering continuation of pay for traumatic injuries and annual adjustments for cost of living. No state system provides continuation of pay like FECA. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) adjusts benefits annually based on cost of living, unlike many state systems. The maximum FECA benefit is 75% of GS-15, Step 10 pay rate, higher than state maximums based on average wages. FECA basic benefit rate for total disability is two-thirds of pre-disability wage, similar to 38 states and DC. Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act benefits are also set federally. New Hampshire's total disability benefit rate is 60% of the worker's pre-disability wage, while New Jersey and Oklahoma pay benefits at 70% of the worker's wage at the time of injury. Texas benefits are based on 75% of the worker's average wage. Five states base benefits on net wages, not gross wages. Three states have systems with no direct comparison to FECA total disability benefit rate. The FECA program provides total disability benefits at a rate of 75% of pre-disability wages for beneficiaries with dependents, which is higher than any state workers' compensation system. In 2014, disability benefits made up 65.6% of total benefits paid by the FECA program, compared to 48.4% in state workers' compensation programs. The FECA program offers higher disability benefits compared to state workers' compensation systems. The administration and provision of benefits differ significantly, with FECA not involving private insurance or third-party administration. State workers' compensation benefits are typically provided by private insurance, state funds, or self-insurance. Only four states do not allow private insurance for workers' compensation. In 18 states, employers can choose between state fund or private carriers for insurance. Private insurance pays most state workers' compensation benefits, with 58.6% paid by private insurers, 15.7% by state funds, and 25.7% by self-insured firms. This means that nearly three-quarters of benefits are paid through third-party insurance. In the District of Columbia, workers' compensation insurers or self-insured firms can settle claims through compromise and release agreements. These settlements involve the insurer or firm making a lump-sum or periodic payment to the claimant in exchange for being released from all future obligations. Claimants must agree to forgo future benefits for immediate payment, while insurers give up the possibility of lower future payments in exchange for clearing the claim immediately. The FECA program does not allow for the settlement of claims, unlike workers' compensation programs in some states. This means FECA claimants cannot receive immediate payment in exchange for clearing their claim, as seen in approximately one-fifth of claims in the private sector. Compounding in workers' compensation involves mixing multiple medications to create new ones, often used for pain treatment. There has been a significant increase in the use and cost of compounded medications in the FECA program, raising concerns about safety, efficacy, and costs. Costs for compounded medications in the FECA program rose significantly from $2 million in FY2011 to $263 million in FY2016, with a sharp increase from $80 million to $214 million in FY2015 alone. In FY2015, compounded medication costs surpassed all other medication costs in the program. The USPS Office of Inspector General noted similar cost increases for postal workers, with compounded drug costs rising from $4.9 million in 2011 to $98.7 million in 2015. Compounded medications accounted for 34% of USPS FECA prescriptions and 53% of associated prescription costs in 2015. In response, USPS requested a $68 million reduction in chargeback to address the rising costs. The Department of Labor denied a request to reduce chargebacks by $68 million due to increased costs from compounded medications in the FECA program. Concerns were raised about expensive compounded medications, such as a $67,000 ointment and a $32,000 cream, leading to new guidelines requiring prior authorization for compounded prescriptions based on medical necessity. The use of compounded medications in workers' compensation programs has led to increased costs, prompting the need for prior authorization based on medical necessity. State and federal programs have implemented policy reforms to reduce spending on compounded drugs, resulting in significant cost savings. Express Scripts and TRICARE have reported substantial decreases in spending on compounded medications after implementing restrictions on coverage. The use of compounded medications in workers' compensation programs has led to increased costs, prompting the need for prior authorization based on medical necessity. State and federal programs have implemented policy reforms to reduce spending on compounded drugs, resulting in significant cost savings. Express Scripts and TRICARE have reported substantial decreases in spending on compounded medications after implementing restrictions on coverage, with medications dropping from $497 million in April 2015 to $10 million in June 2015. The new OWCP guidelines do not include provisions such as reimbursement caps, drug formularies, and the mandatory use of PBMs that were associated with state reforms. Tricare's strategy involves using a proprietary list of compounded medication ingredients developed by Express Scripts, the Tricare PBM, that are excluded from coverage. The FECA program has its origins in legislation from the late 1800s, with major amendments passed by Congress in 1916 that are still in effect today. The FECA program, with major amendments passed by Congress in 1916, has endured through subsequent changes in 1949, 1960, 1966, and 1974. The program maintains a workers' compensation system for federal employees in line with longstanding principles. The first workers' compensation law for federal employees dates back to 1882, providing benefits for hazardous occupations like the United States Life Saving Service. In 1908, Congress passed a workers' compensation law for federal employees in hazardous occupations, providing up to one year of salary for disability or death. However, only a quarter of federal workers were covered by this law, which was designed for the most dangerous jobs. President Theodore Roosevelt acknowledged the law's limitations before signing it. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Employees' Compensation Act into law on September 7, 1916, extending modern workers' compensation protections to nearly all federal employees. This original FECA law remains the basis for the federal civil service workers' compensation system, providing coverage for nearly all civilian employees. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act of 1916 provided coverage for federal government employees injured or killed in the line of duty, with full medical coverage and disability compensation. Survivors of deceased employees were entitled to cash benefits and funeral cost assistance. The law created the Federal Employees' Compensation Commission. The 1916 legislation established the Federal Employees' Compensation Commission to administer the FECA program, with benefits and administrative costs funded by the Employees' Compensation Fund. Congress aimed to align federal employee protections with state laws, ensuring comparable benefits and compensation for disabilities. The 1916 FECA legislation aimed to provide workers' compensation coverage to all federal employees, aligning with state laws and correcting the limited coverage of the 1908 act. Senator George Sutherland criticized the 1908 law for denying compensation based on occupation, stating that industries should bear the burden of injuries caused by them. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) was sponsored by Senator George Sutherland in the Senate. He emphasized the need to compensate for injuries, regardless of the hazardous nature of the work. Major amendments to the FECA program were passed in 1949, 1960, 1966, and 1974, with coverage for occupational illnesses added in 1924. The 1949 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act expanded coverage to include federal government officers and doubled the maximum disability benefit level. The amendments aimed to modernize and liberalize the program, providing better security for workers and their families. The 1949 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act expanded coverage to include previously excluded employees like Foreign Service Officers in dangerous overseas areas. The increase in the maximum benefit level was necessary to ensure full benefits for workers. Several provisions of the amendments increased benefits, including eliminating the waiting period for disability compensation lasting more than 21 days and creating a schedule for partial disabilities. The 1949 amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act aimed to align the program with state workers' compensation programs and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. They introduced augmented compensation for injured workers with dependents, bringing benefits up to 75% of the worker's pre-disability wage. This provision was intended to support disabled workers and survivors economically. The 1949 amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act increased benefits for injured workers with dependents to 75% of their pre-disability wage. Concerns were raised about the adequacy of the two-thirds benefit level for dependents, and a provision was added to review and potentially reduce benefits for workers aged 70 or older based on their reduced wage-earning capacity. The 1949 amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act included provisions for increased benefits for injured workers with dependents and allowed for vocational rehabilitation services at the government's expense to improve return-to-work prospects. This was opposed by some representatives from federal employee organizations due to concerns about the mandatory retirement age of 70 and potential hardships for workers with disabilities. The 1949 amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act established the FECA program as the exclusive remedy for federal workers with work-related injuries, illnesses, and deaths, aligning it with workers' compensation laws in the states. This rule aimed to reduce FECA-benefit costs for the government and facilitate the return of employees to work. The 1960 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act introduced the chargeback process, requiring federal agencies to reimburse the costs of FECA benefits provided to their employees. This was due to federal employees opting to sue the government for greater financial benefits rather than relying on the limited benefits offered by the FECA program. The 1966 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act required federal agencies and government corporations to pay their fair share of FECA administrative costs. These changes aimed to promote safety by holding agencies responsible for the costs of injuries, illnesses, and deaths of their employees. The amendments also introduced the use of the GS Scale to set minimum and maximum benefit levels for FECA benefits. The 1966 amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act introduced the use of the GS Scale to set minimum and maximum benefit levels for FECA benefits. The amendments also included an annual cost-of-living adjustment for benefits. The 1974 amendments made three major changes to the FECA program. The 1974 amendments to the FECA program introduced continuation of pay for up to 45 days for traumatic injuries, allowing injured employees to receive full pay instead of FECA compensation. This was implemented due to delays in processing FECA claims, with Congress citing an average processing time of 49 to 70 days. The 1974 amendments to the FECA program allowed employees to choose their own treating physicians and eliminated the provision of reduced benefits after age 70. This aimed to address delays in processing claims and align the program with recommendations for workers' compensation systems. The 1974 amendments to the FECA program eliminated the provision of reduced benefits after age 70, citing it as unnecessary and discriminatory. There have been no major amendments to the program since 1974, but the 109th and 110th Congresses made changes addressing some program issues. The FECA waiting period for postal employees was changed by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, requiring postal employees to satisfy a three-day waiting period before receiving compensation benefits. This change was recommended by the President's Commission on the USPS to align the Postal Service's workers' compensation system with state workers' systems and reduce costs. The service's workers' compensation system is being aligned with state systems. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of benefits for civilian employees injured or killed in combat zones. A death gratuity of up to $100,000 is provided for federal employees killed while serving alongside the Armed Forces. The death gratuity of up to $100,000 is provided to survivors of federal employees who die from injuries during service in a contingency operation, in addition to regular FECA compensation."
