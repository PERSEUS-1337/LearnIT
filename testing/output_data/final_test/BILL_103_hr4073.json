    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Interstate Municipal Solid Waste Control Act\" and it amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to address interstate transportation of nonhazardous solid waste. The Governor of a State has the authority to limit the quantity of out-of-State municipal solid waste received for disposal at landfills or incinerators. This limit can be based on prior years' quantities, with a maximum limit of 30 percent of all municipal solid waste received during specific calendar years. The Governor of a State can limit out-of-State municipal solid waste disposal at landfills or incinerators, with a maximum limit of 30 percent of all waste received in specific years. Starting in 1995, the Governor can further reduce this limit to 20 percent in 1996 and 1997, and to 10 percent in subsequent years. The Governor of a State has the authority to restrict the disposal of out-of-State municipal solid waste in new landfills or incinerators, as well as in existing facilities that do not meet federal and state laws regarding design, location, monitoring, and financial assurance. The Governor can restrict out-of-State municipal solid waste disposal in landfills or incinerators not meeting federal and state laws. Counties have similar authority, with a 30 percent limit for counties. In cases where both a county and the State have established prohibitions, the most restrictive one applies. Limitations imposed by a Governor apply statewide and cannot discriminate based on the origin of solid waste. County limitations apply county-wide and also cannot discriminate based on the origin of solid waste. Any Governor intending to exercise authority under subsection (a) must submit information on out-of-State municipal solid waste received for disposal in the state during 1990-1992. Counties must also submit this information to the Governor within 120 days. The Administrator will then notify the Governor of each State based on the information received. The Administrator shall notify the Governor of each State and the public, providing a 30-day comment period. Within 210 days, a list of out-of-State municipal solid waste received in 1990-1992 must be published. Governors may restrict the exportation of in-State municipal solid waste according to waste management plans. The Governor may not limit the exportation of materials separated for recycling. Reporting requirements mandate annual reports on out-of-State waste disposal. The State must report on municipal and industrial solid waste disposed of in landfills and incinerators, including out-of-State waste percentages. Exemptions include materials intended for recycling or reuse. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions related to solid waste disposal, including internal disposal by industrial facilities and air transportation waste. It defines terms like \"new landfill\" and \"existing landfill.\" The curr_chunk defines criteria for landfills authorized to receive out-of-state municipal solid waste, including existing landfills with prior permits and proposed landfills with approvals before January 1, 1993. The curr_chunk defines terms related to incinerators, including new incinerators and existing incinerators that received out-of-state waste in specific years. The curr_chunk defines municipal solid waste as refuse generated by the general public or from various sources, excluding hazardous waste and waste from response actions under specific sections. The curr_chunk defines industrial solid waste as waste from manufacturing or industrial processing operations, distinct from municipal solid waste, including construction and demolition debris. An affiliated person is defined as someone who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the generator of solid waste. An affiliated person is someone who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the generator of solid waste. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include interstate transportation of nonhazardous solid waste. The amendments will take effect 6 months after enactment."
