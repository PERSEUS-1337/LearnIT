    "content": "Avian influenza, or \"bird flu,\" is a contagious virus that normally infects birds but can also infect humans. The H5N1 virus has caused numerous severe cases and deaths in humans, raising concerns about a potential global pandemic. The Bush Administration issued a report in 2005 outlining the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, addressing the potential outbreak of avian influenza. The report highlighted concerns about the H5N1 virus potentially becoming transmissible between humans, leading to catastrophic consequences. Countries have been stockpiling antiviral drugs and developing vaccines as part of their infection control strategy against the threat of a global flu pandemic. The President's plan proposes to spend $1 billion to build a national reserve of antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Relenza to contain a pandemic outbreak. The Strategic National Stockpile contained 36 million courses of antiviral medications as of June 2007, with a goal of 50 million courses by the end of 2008. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services aims to stockpile enough drugs to treat 25% of the U.S. population. The U.S. government is promoting the development of new antiviral drugs to combat influenza, including a new drug awarded a $100 million contract. Tamiflu, manufactured by Roche, is an efficient antiviral treatment for influenza, easing symptoms by preventing the virus from spreading. Research shows it is effective against certain virus strains, but its effectiveness in a pandemic is uncertain. Tamiflu's efficacy in controlling a pandemic is uncertain due to the need for early ingestion within 48 hours of flu symptoms. Stockpiles of the drug may go unused as it has a shelf life of five years. Roche, the exclusive manufacturer of Tamiflu until 2006, struggled to meet demand due to the complex manufacturing process that takes six to eight months. In 2005, Roche faced a shortage of Tamiflu due to limited manufacturing capacity. Pressure mounted to allow other companies to produce generic versions to increase supply and affordability. The key ingredient, shikimic acid, extracted from star anise, posed a challenge due to limited availability. Roche began experimenting to address the shortage. Roche addressed the shortage of Tamiflu by experimenting with a fermentation process using genetically altered E. coli bacteria to produce shikimic acid. The majority of shikimic acid is now derived from this process, which is more effective than processing star anise. Counterfeit drugs pose public health concerns, but the U.S. FDA believes that counterfeiting is rare due to regulatory oversight and preventive measures by drug manufacturers and distributors. The U.S. drug supply is vulnerable to sophisticated threats, including an increase in counterfeiting activities. Fake Tamiflu pills with trace amounts of the active ingredient have been intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Counterfeit Tamiflu shipments have been seized by authorities, posing a threat to the global medicines market. Prosecuting overseas manufacturers of fake Tamiflu may be challenging, requiring cooperation from foreign governments. Roche has issued guidelines to help consumers avoid purchasing counterfeit Tamiflu online, including buying from websites with the VIPPS seal. To avoid purchasing counterfeit Tamiflu online, consumers should be cautious of websites without a telephone contact, extreme price variations, and generic versions. Genuine Tamiflu packaging should be inspected for any suspicious alterations, with specific details on the appearance of authentic packaging provided. One primary purpose of United States patent law is to provide economic incentives for research and development by granting inventors a limited monopoly over their discoveries. This allows patent holders to recoup their investment and prevent competitors from free riding on their efforts. Patent holders have the right to exclude others from using, selling, or importing the protected invention, and infringement can result in liability. The patent holder is liable for infringement and has the right to exclude others from using the invention. Compliance with federal laws may be required. Remedies for patent infringement include injunctions, damages, and attorney fees. Patents can be sold through an assignment or licensed for others to use. A patent license is the patent owner's permission for another entity to use the invention in exchange for royalty payments. Legal title to the patent remains with the patent holder, and an exclusive licensee is granted the sole right to practice the invention within a specific territory. The terms of the licensing agreement may include restrictions on the licensee's activities. The patent holder can impose restrictions on the licensee, such as limiting the use of the invention for a specific purpose or within a certain geographic territory. These restrictions are legally enforceable and common in patent licensing agreements across various industries, including pharmaceuticals. Private parties have the freedom to contract as they choose, as long as it does not violate any laws. A licensee exceeding the scope of a patent license may be liable for breach of contract and patent infringement. Gilead Sciences licensed Tamiflu to Roche for FDA approval and production, but terminated the agreement in 2005 due to a material breach clause. Roche and Gilead reached a settlement in 2005 after Gilead terminated the agreement due to Roche's failure to meet manufacturing and promotion obligations. Roche reimbursed Gilead $62.5 million in cost adjustments, and Gilead retained $18.2 million in disputed royalties. Gilead's share of Tamiflu royalties remains unchanged, ranging from 14 to 22 percent. Joint committees were established to oversee the agreement. Roche and Gilead will establish joint committees to oversee global manufacturing, commercialization, and pandemic planning. Patent law issues arose in past public health crises, such as the supply of Cipro during the anthrax scare and access to affordable medication for HIV/AIDS. Arguments were made for overriding patent rights to allow generic suppliers to enter the market, similar to the case of Tamiflu in 2005 when Roche refused to license a generic version. The company cited the complex drug manufacturing process as the reason for retaining exclusive rights to produce Tamiflu, facing criticism from government leaders. Calls were made to override patent rights to allow generic suppliers to enter the market. Roche faced pressure to allow generic versions of Tamiflu due to public health concerns. They agreed to discuss sublicensing with interested parties but emphasized the need for quality and regulatory compliance. By 2007, Roche had increased Tamiflu production to over 400 million treatments annually through partnerships with 19 external production partners. The threat of compulsory licensing may have influenced Roche to sublicense production of Tamiflu to meet demand. While Roche has expanded manufacturing, the issue of intellectual property rights conflicting with public health needs may resurface. Legal mechanisms for increasing production include compulsory licenses under government authority. In the United States, compulsory licenses can be issued under government authority or through international treaties. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment allows the federal government to take intellectual property for public use, as outlined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a), with compensation to the patent holder. The federal government can issue compulsory licenses under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, allowing third-party use of patented inventions without the patent holder's authorization. The patent holder's remedy is to seek compensation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for the unauthorized use and manufacture of their patented invention. The federal government can issue compulsory licenses under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, allowing third-party use of patented inventions without the patent holder's authorization. Compensation in a patent takings case is limited to a \"reasonable royalty,\" which the pharmaceutical industry argues would discourage research and development of new antivirals and vaccines for health crises like avian flu. Patent protection is crucial for drug companies to benefit from their investment in research and development. Patent protection allows drug companies to benefit from research investments and encourages further development. Compulsory licenses for drugs like Tamiflu were debated in congressional hearings, with concerns about violating patents and impacting future research incentives. Roche's willingness to work with generic manufacturers may eliminate the need for compulsory licenses. The TRIPS Agreement sets minimum standards for intellectual property protection, including patents. Article 31 allows WTO members to issue compulsory licenses under certain conditions, such as domestic law permitting it. This is relevant to the manufacturing of drugs like Tamiflu. Compulsory licenses under Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement allow for manufacturing of patented inventions for domestic supply. Authorization must cease if circumstances change, and adequate remuneration must be paid to the patent owner. If attempts to obtain a voluntary license fail, a compulsory license may be issued for national emergencies or extreme urgency. Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement allows for compulsory licenses in cases of national emergencies or extreme urgency without the need for prior voluntary license attempts. The WTO clarified this provision in 2001 and 2003, affirming the right of WTO members to protect public health and ensure access to medicines. The Doha Declaration specifies that each member state can determine what constitutes a national emergency, including public health crises like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. The WTO's \"Paragraph 6 Agreement\" allows member states to import generic drugs produced under compulsory licenses issued by other countries in cases of national emergencies or extreme urgency, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. This agreement waives the restriction on using compulsory licenses predominantly for the domestic market, enabling countries to export generic drugs to other WTO members in need. The TRIPS \"national emergency\" provision allows countries to export generic drugs under compulsory licenses to meet urgent needs. Developed countries, including the United States, opted out of using compulsory licenses as importers, possibly to discourage their use by developing countries. The United States opted out of importing pharmaceuticals under the TRIPS system to assist poor countries, despite having a strong pharmaceutical manufacturing base. This decision may hinder developed countries from importing generic versions of Tamiflu. In late 2005, criticism arose due to Roche's production limitations affecting countries' ability to procure enough Tamiflu. In late 2005, a bill was introduced in the 109th Congress regarding the U.S. opting out of importing pharmaceuticals under the TRIPS system. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary downplayed the consequences of this decision, stating that in a global pandemic, countries will likely only have access to domestically produced flu drugs. If Tamiflu was subject to a compulsory license, Roche would still receive royalties but have no control over the drug's sale price. Roche prefers alternatives to compulsory licensing to control drug sale prices. Licensing agreements allow third parties to manufacture and market Tamiflu with conditions set by Roche. Roche has signed sublicensing agreements with 19 contractors in nine countries to manufacture Tamiflu. Critics argue that these agreements may only benefit rich countries by allowing Roche to control pricing and profit from generic Tamiflu. Roche has provided over 5 million treatment courses of Tamiflu to the World Health Organization for regional stockpiles to combat a potential pandemic. They have also agreed to special pricing for government orders and reduced prices for low-income countries. The 2005 Tamiflu supply shortage raised concerns about intellectual property rights affecting medicine availability during health crises. Several manufacturing partners have increased Tamiflu production to meet global demand, alleviating concerns about intellectual property rights hindering pandemic influenza preparations."
