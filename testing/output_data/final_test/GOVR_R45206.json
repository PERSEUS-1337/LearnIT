In FY2017, over $8.5 billion was provided to various U.N. entities. Congressional debates on U.N. funding typically focus on the level of U.S. contributions, their effectiveness, and alignment with U.S. policy priorities. President Trump's FY2019 budget request proposes significant cuts to U.N. funding, prompting ongoing congressional consideration. This report offers an overview of U.N. funding processes and mechanisms. The United States is a major financial contributor to the United Nations, with Congress shaping U.S. policy through funding and oversight. The report provides an overview of U.N. funding processes, U.S. contributions, and selected policy issues for Congress. The U.S. plays a lead role in the organization, with funding authorized through the U.N. Participation Act of 1945. Both Congress and the executive branch influence U.S. policy towards the U.N. The United States plays a significant role in the United Nations, with Congress shaping policy through funding and oversight. The U.S. is represented by the executive branch in U.N. bodies, with Ambassador Nikki Haley leading the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. The U.S. is a member of key U.N. bodies, including the Security Council, General Assembly, and specialized agencies. Congress holds varying views on U.S. funding to the U.N., but generally supports its mission. In FY2017, U.S. funding to the United Nations included $1 billion in assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget and specialized agencies; $1.9 billion in assessed contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations; $295 million in voluntary contributions to U.N. funds and programs; and $5.6 billion in voluntary contributions to U.N. humanitarian-related entities. Some policymakers have criticized the United Nations for actions that may not align with U.S. policy priorities or lack effective accountability mechanisms. Congress has addressed concerns about U.N. funding by adjusting levels and imposing financial conditions. Oversight includes committee hearings, reporting requirements, and consulting with executive branch agencies. The U.N. system comprises specialized agencies, voluntary funds, peacekeeping operations, and the U.N. organization itself. Each U.N. member is required to contribute to expenses. Article 17 of the U.N. Charter mandates member contributions to U.N. entities through assessed and voluntary contributions. Assessed contributions fund core administrative costs, peacekeeping operations, and specialized agencies. Payment of contributions is a treaty obligation for U.N. members. The U.N. regular budget is negotiated by the General Assembly every two years, with decisions made by a two-thirds majority. The approved budget for 2018-2019 is $5.39 billion. Assessment levels for contributions are based on a country's \"capacity to pay,\" with the U.S. currently contributing. The United States is assessed at 22% of the U.N. regular budget, the highest among member states. Other top contributors include Japan, China, Germany, and France. The Assembly will adopt new assessment rates for 2019-2021 in December 2018. There are 15 specialized agencies in the U.N. system, each with its own constitution, rules, and financial resources. The U.S. is a member of all specialized agencies except for the U.N. Industrial Development. The United States is a member of most U.N. specialized agencies and contributes to peacekeeping operations worldwide. It plays a significant role in funding and authorizing these operations as a permanent member of the Security Council. The Security Council authorizes the General Assembly to create special assessed accounts for U.N. peacekeeping operations funded by member contributions. The total budget for current operations is $6.8 billion, with the U.S. having the highest assessment at 28.43%. Other major contributors include Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The U.N. system relies on voluntary contributions to finance various programs and entities. Member governments decide on funding during each budget cycle, with contributions fluctuating yearly. Congress typically authorizes assessed and voluntary contributions through Foreign Relations Authorization Acts, with appropriations provided to the Department of State and USAID. Congress has waived authorization requirements and appropriated funds through U.N. accounts in annual SFOPS appropriations acts when authorization bills are not enacted. Various congressional committees oversee U.N. funding, with authorizing committees including the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and House Committee on Foreign Affairs. State-Foreign Operations Subcommittees of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations handle most U.N.-related appropriations. Other authorizing and appropriations committees may oversee specific U.N. activities related to global health, labor, defense, or the environment. Most U.S. funding to the United Nations is authorized and appropriated through annual SFOPS appropriations acts. Funding is divided into four categories, including assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget and specialized agencies, funded primarily through the State Department's Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) account, and assessed contributions to U.N. peacekeeping, funded mainly through the State Department's Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account. The U.S. funds the United Nations through various accounts, including the Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) account for regular budget and specialized agencies, Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account for peacekeeping, and voluntary contributions for U.N. funds and programs through the International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) account. Additionally, voluntary contributions to U.N. humanitarian entities are funded through global humanitarian accounts like the State Department's Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) accounts, and USAID's International Disaster Assistance (IDA) and Food for Peace (P.L. 480, Title II) accounts. Congress appropriates funding for these accounts, while the executive branch determines allocation based on humanitarian needs and policy priorities. The process for authorizing and appropriating funding to the United Nations is complicated by factors like the difference in fiscal years between the U.S. and the U.N. This discrepancy, along with recosting, changes in U.S. assessment levels, unforeseen circumstances, and withholdings, can lead to funding shortfalls or overruns in U.N. accounts. The State Department has paid U.N. assessments on a deferred basis since the 1980s, causing delays in U.S. payments. Congress and the executive branch have used various methods to address funding issues, including multiyear funding, applying U.N. credits, transferring funds between accounts, and using carryover funding. However, there have been instances where funding shortfalls were not covered, leading to the U.S. falling behind in payments and accumulating arrears to U.N. entities. The challenge for U.S. policymakers is tracking the full scope of U.S. funding to the U.N. system due to the complex nature of budget processes and decentralized structure. Congress has enacted reporting requirements to address this issue, but few have consistently captured the complete U.S. contributions to the U.N. system. The U.S. funding described in this report represents the majority, but not all, of U.S. contributions to the U.N. system. Selected U.S. contributions to the U.N. system through annual SFOPS appropriations acts since FY2015 are outlined. Congress appropriates lump sums to U.N.-related accounts without directing contributions to specific U.N. entities. The Trump Administration has expressed general support for the United Nations' mission but has also criticized the organization. The Trump Administration has criticized the United Nations for its lack of effectiveness and disproportionate funding from the U.S. The FY2019 budget proposes reductions in funding for assessed contributions and peacekeeping operations, aiming for cost control and burden sharing among U.N. members. Voluntary contributions to U.N. funds and programs are also eliminated. The FY2019 budget proposes reductions in funding for U.S. contributions to U.N. budgets, including a 32% decrease in humanitarian assistance and elimination of certain accounts, potentially causing the U.S. to fall behind in payments to U.N. bodies. The President's FY2019 budget proposes a $372 million decrease in funding for the CIO account, with $863.39 million designated for U.N. entities. If enacted, the U.S. may pay less than owed to U.N. bodies, leading to funding shortfalls and possible arrears accumulation. The State Department's Contributions for International Peacekeeping (CIPA) account funds most U.N. peacekeeping operations, international criminal tribunals, and mission monitoring. The Trump Administration has proposed $1.19 billion for the CIPA account in FY2019, a decrease from previous years. The FY2019 request for the CIPA account is based on reducing the U.S. assessed rate of contributions and cutting down on U.N. peacekeeping missions to cover the unfunded portion. U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping have declined due to policy changes and a cap on the U.S. assessment at 25%. Funding shortfalls have been addressed by raising the cap temporarily and using excess U.N. funds from previous missions. The Trump Administration's actions have led to full U.S. payments to U.N. peacekeeping, but Congress has not raised the cap since FY2017. This has resulted in arrears of $274.6 million in FY2017 and $251.6 million in FY2018. The FY2019 budget proposal eliminates the IO&P account, suggesting that some activities funded through it could receive contributions elsewhere. For FY2018, Congress provided $339 million for the entire IO&P account, with $296.2 million allocated to U.N. entities like UNICEF, UNDP, and UNFPA. U.S. humanitarian assistance to U.N. entities is mainly funded through global humanitarian accounts, separate from U.N. assessed contributions. Total U.S. funding for U.N. humanitarian activities often equals or exceeds contributions to peacekeeping. In FY2017, U.S. contributions to U.N. entities totaled nearly $5.6 billion, compared to $4.16 billion in FY2016 and $3.39 billion in FY2015. Funding to these organizations fluctuates yearly based on U.S. priorities and global needs. The FY2019 budget proposal does not specify how humanitarian funding will be distributed among U.N. entities or if U.S. contributions will be reduced or expanded. Members of Congress have debated U.S. funding to the United Nations since 1945. Some policymakers argue that U.S. assessments for the U.N. budget and peacekeeping operations are too high, with the U.S. providing the bulk of funding while having minimal influence. There are concerns about the cap on U.S. peacekeeping assessments, currently set at 25%. Congress has capped U.S. assessments at 25%, which plays a crucial role in preventing them from increasing. Some argue that current assessment levels allow the U.S. to share funding with other countries at a lower cost and maintain influence in the United Nations. Decreasing U.S. contributions could lead to other countries undermining U.S. interests. Members of Congress may monitor U.N. negotiations on assessment scales for 2019. The ongoing U.N. negotiations for the scale of assessments for 2019-2021 are expected to result in new budget and peacekeeping assessments. The Trump Administration aims to reduce the U.S. peacekeeping assessment to 25%. Congress has historically capped U.S. payments to U.N. budgets to address concerns about high assessments. In the past, Congress has capped U.S. contributions to the U.N. regular budget at 22% and peacekeeping assessment at 25%. Congress has also withheld funding from specific U.N. entities or activities for various reasons, sometimes requiring executive branch waivers. Members of Congress have placed holds on U.N. funding through foreign affairs appropriations for policy reasons, with little public information available on the details of the hold. The Administration can unilaterally decide to withhold funding to specific U.N. entities if Congress does not authorize or appropriate funding. Congressional views on U.S. withholdings vary, with some concerned about weakening U.S. influence and standing within the organization, while others argue for using U.S. financial leverage to push for policies in the best interests of the United States. The United States can withhold funding from U.N. entities to push for policies that benefit its interests. The impact of withholdings on U.N. budget and operations varies depending on the funding source. Withholding U.S. contributions may have little immediate impact if covered by surplus funds, but can affect operations if funding is primarily from member contributions. The U.S. withholding of funding from U.N. entities could significantly impact their operations and budgets, especially for bodies where the U.S. contributes a large portion of funding. Accumulating arrears to the United Nations can result in the loss of voting rights in the General Assembly. Each U.N. body has its own payment timeline and system for tracking arrears. Accumulating arrears to the United Nations can lead to the loss of voting rights in the General Assembly. U.S. arrears vary by U.N. entity and can be influenced by factors like caps on assessments and deferred payments. Congressional actions play a role in accumulating arrears, with the practice of deferred payments starting in the Reagan Administration. In the 1990s, the United States almost lost its vote in the General Assembly due to outstanding balances for the U.N. budget and peacekeeping. The \"Helms-Biden Agreement\" in 1999 established conditions for some U.S. arrears to be paid. As of September 2017, U.S. arrears to the U.N. regular budget are $347 million, and to peacekeeping budgets are $536 million. Congressional views on paying these arrears are mixed. Some Members argue U.S. arrears should be fully paid, while others do not recognize them as arrears. Congress has enacted reporting requirements to track U.N. funding, including details on sources of funds and purposes of disbursements. Additional reporting requirements have been periodically enacted in the past decade. The Office of Management and Budget is required to submit annual reports to Congress on U.S. contributions to the United Nations, including in-kind services, with a value greater than $100,000. The challenge lies in self-reporting by participating agencies, which are responsible for the accuracy of the information provided. The agency is responsible for the accuracy of information in reports, but not all executive branch agencies provide requested data. Some reporting requirements are incomplete, not showing the full scope of U.S. contributions. The United Nations has evolved as international stakeholders seek to improve its efficiency through reform. Some Members of Congress have pushed for U.N. reform by linking U.S. funding to specific benchmarks in the past. In the past, Congress tied U.S. funding to U.N. reform and budget policies favoring the U.S., including caps on assessments rates and internal oversight. Recent legislation links funding to management reforms for transparency and accountability. There is also a focus on U.N. reforms related to sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers. Some Members have introduced legislation for a government-wide review of U.S. multilateral aid. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, mandates a report from the Secretary of State on assessing and prioritizing contributions to international organizations. Supporters of linking U.S. funding to U.N. reform argue for using financial leverage to push for comprehensive reform, citing slow progress despite diplomatic pressures. Tying funding to reform could incentivize countries to find common ground on divisive issues. Opponents argue that linking U.S. funding to U.N. reform may not be effective and could weaken U.S. influence. Some believe U.N. reform proposals are unrealistic and reforms cannot be achieved in proposed timeframes. It is suggested that the U.S. can achieve reform objectives through collaboration with like-minded members and the U.N. Secretary-General. Policymakers note that countries receiving U.S. aid sometimes vote against U.S. interests in U.N. bodies. The debate on linking U.S. foreign assistance to U.N. voting continues periodically. The United States has debated linking foreign assistance to U.N. voting records of aid recipients. The Reagan Administration supported this policy to influence support for U.S. priorities in the U.N. Congress mandated an annual report on member voting records. Some Members of Congress have proposed legislation for aid reductions based on voting behavior. Some argue that reducing foreign aid based on U.N. voting records could undermine U.S. assistance effectiveness. Critics question State Department criteria for aid cuts, noting priorities may not align with U.N. votes. They fear withholding aid could harm citizens in need. President Trump and Ambassador Haley have supported this approach. President Trump and Ambassador Haley have expressed support for linking U.S. foreign aid to U.N. votes, but implementation prospects are unclear. Congress appropriates foreign assistance, and the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not propose aid reductions based on U.N. votes. Debates on U.N. funding in Congress involve competing priorities and questions on the U.N.'s role in U.S. national security. President Trump's \"America First\" stance raises concerns about future U.S. participation and funding of the United Nations. Members of the 115th Congress may consider how the President's budget aligns with congressional views on U.N. funding. The FY2019 budget proposal aligns with congressional perspectives on U.N. funding. Congress may take action in the absence of Administration support for certain U.N. activities. The impacts of U.S. financial withholding on U.S. influence in U.N. bodies and the effectiveness of U.N. activities are of concern. Members of Congress may consider U.N. funding issues in the changing global landscape and ways to increase efficiency and accountability in U.S. contributions to the United Nations. The U.S. Congress is exploring ways to ensure effective use of U.S. contributions to the United Nations. This includes examining the implications of reduced U.S. participation and funding, potential reforms within the U.N., and the advantages of multilateral vs. bilateral assistance. Additionally, there is a focus on maximizing the United Nations' comparative advantage over other multilateral organizations. The table lists CIO account funding by U.N. and U.N.-affiliated entities since FY2015, including amounts appropriated by Congress and U.S. assessment levels. FY2018 funding levels for individual U.N. bodies are not yet available. Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) Account by U.N. Peacekeeping Operation lists funding by peacekeeping operation since FY2015, including amounts appropriated by Congress. FY2018 funding levels for individual peacekeeping missions have not yet been finalized. International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) Account by U.N. Entity lists U.S. contributions to U.N. entities through the IO&P account since FY2015. Timeline of U.S. Peacekeeping Assessment Cap outlines changes to the U.S. peacekeeping assessment and enacted U.S. peacekeeping cap since FY1994, including related legislation. Global Humanitarian Accounts are also included. The curr_chunk provides an overview of top U.S. voluntary contributions to U.N. humanitarian-related activities through global humanitarian accounts since FY2015. Funding for U.N. entities in FY2018 has not been finalized. The selected legislation highlighted ties U.S. funding to U.N. reform from 1986 to the present. In the mid-1980s, the Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment was passed by Congress to address concerns about U.S. influence over the U.N. budget. This legislation required the U.S. assessed contribution to be reduced to 20% unless major financial contributors had a greater say in the budget process. Subsequently, the General Assembly adopted a new budget and planning process in 1986 to give higher assessment level members a potentially greater voice. In 1993, the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services was established due to concerns about oversight and accountability within the U.N. system. In 1993, Congress directed that 10% of U.S. assessed contributions to the U.N. regular budget be withheld until an independent oversight office was established. The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established in 1994 to provide auditing, investigation, and consulting services. In 1999, the Helms-Biden Agreement furthered U.S. reform policy at the United Nations. The Helms-Biden bill authorized payment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations based on reform benchmarks. The U.S. agreed to pay $819 million in arrears and forgive $107 million in peacekeeping costs if the UN applied it to U.S. arrears. Congress required reductions in U.S. contributions to the UN regular budget and peacekeeping. The UN General Assembly reduced the regular budget assessment from 25% to 22% and peacekeeping share from 30.4% to 28%. The U.S. peacekeeping assessment decreased from 30.4% to 28% and currently stands at 28.43%."
