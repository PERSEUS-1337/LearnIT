The fair occupied 76 city blocks, with the Palace of Fine Arts being the only building to survive. The United States Mint issued five different coins in connection with the Exposition, including the first commemorative coins to bear the motto \"In God We Trust\". The 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco featured various buildings representing states and foreign governments. The United States Mint issued commemorative coins, including a silver Panama-Pacific half dollar and four gold coins, with the largest being a unique $50 octagonal coin.
