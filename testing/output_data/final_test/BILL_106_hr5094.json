    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Care Fraud Prevention and Paperwork Reduction Act of 2000\". It establishes the Federal Commission on Billing Codes and Forms Simplification. The Commission on Billing Codes and Forms Simplification is established under the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Paperwork Reduction Act of 2000. Its duties include recommending standardized forms for health care claims and reducing the number of billing codes. The Commission's membership is appointed by the Comptroller General and includes individuals from the medical community. The Commission on Billing Codes and Forms Simplification, established under the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Paperwork Reduction Act of 2000, includes members of the medical community. The Commission is required to submit periodic reports on its recommendations to Congress and the President. MedPAC provisions apply to the Commission in a similar manner as they do to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. SEC. 3. EDUCATION OF PHYSICIANS AND PROVIDERS ON MEDICARE PAYMENTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a process for physicians to request assistance with questionable codes and procedures under the Medicare program. Carriers must respond within 30 business days with the correct billing or procedural answer. Written statements can be used as proof in future audits, except for cases of fraudulent billing. The Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration will restore a toll-free hotline for physicians to inquire about the Medicare program. Definitions for \"physician\" and \"carrier\" are provided in this section. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. SEC. 4. Policy development for E&M guidelines under Medicare program. HCFA must follow specific steps before implementing new evaluation and management guidelines under the Medicare program, including assessing the guidelines with physicians, setting goals to improve physician participation, conducting pilot projects in different regions, and ensuring objectives will be met. Each pilot project must be of sufficient length for consultation. The pilot projects under this subsection must be conducted in consultation with medical societies and focus on peer review methods by physicians evaluating medical record information for statistical outlier services relative to CPT guidelines. The pilot projects will examine the impact of E&M guidelines on different physician practices and the costs of compliance, patient, and physician satisfaction. HCFA will submit a report on the objectives met to relevant committees and councils. The objectives for E&M guidelines include enhancing documentation accuracy, reducing administrative burdens, decreasing non-clinical documentation, improving reviewer accuracy, educating physicians, promoting appropriate E&M code use, and ensuring adherence to CPT coding rules. Definitions for this section and related sections include the meaning of \"physician\" as defined in the Social Security Act, \"carrier\" as a contracted entity administering benefits under part B of the Act, \"Secretary\" as the head of Health and Human Services, \"HCFA\" as the Health Care Financing Administration, and \"medicare program\" as the program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. SEC. 5. Overpayments under the Medicare program. If a carrier conducts a post-payment audit of a physician under Medicare, they must provide the physician with personalized notice of billing issues within 3 months. The notice should offer suggestions for resolving the problems. Physicians are allowed to repay Medicare overpayments within 3 months without penalties or interest. If a physician identifies an overpayment before being notified by the carrier, they can reimburse Medicare without penalty, and the Secretary cannot audit or target them based on this. If a physician's Medicare billing error is a first-time error and they have not been previously audited, the carrier cannot fine them through extrapolation unless a fraudulent claim is submitted. The carrier must inform the physician of potential claim problems within one year before using extrapolation for reimbursement or penalties. Physicians can dispute charges by submitting additional information and documentation. Following a post-payment audit, a carrier conducting a pre-payment screen on a physician service under Medicare cannot delay reimbursements for more than one month. Once the physician submits a corrected claim, the carrier must remove the pre-payment screen. Enforcement provisions under the Medicare program state that inspectors cannot enter a physician's office with a gun or deadly weapon for arrest, and must have a valid warrant unless the physician is fleeing or dangerous."
