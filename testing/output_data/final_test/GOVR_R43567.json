    "content": "President Obama's FY2015 budget request for Energy and Water Development was released in March 2014, totaling $34.26 billion. The final funding for FY2015 was included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, totaling $34.78 billion, $519 million above the request. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill for FY2015 with a total spending level of $34.20 billion. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill for FY2015 on July 10, 2014, with a total spending level of $34.20 billion. Several floor amendments were approved, including increases in funding for Corps of Engineers construction, Bureau of Reclamation's Water and Related Resources account, DOE non-defense environmental cleanup, and DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2014Energy. The Senate Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on Energy and Water Development approved its version of the FY2015 bill on June 17, 2014, with a total of $34.21 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee's subcommittee approved the FY2015 Energy and Water Development bill with a total of $34.21 billion. Funding increases were allocated for the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation. The full committee markup was postponed due to objections regarding an amendment on EPA regulations. No further action was taken on the Senate draft bill. The FY2015 Energy and Water Development bill includes funding for various agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of the Interior's Central Utah Project, Bureau of Reclamation, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Appalachian Regional Commission. The bill's appropriations were influenced by the Budget Control Act of 2011, with spending limits enforced by sequestration. Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act in 2013, establishing less stringent spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015. The Obama Administration proposed the Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative in the FY2015 budget, a $56 billion fund split between defense and nondefense spending. The initiative aimed to be funded through spending cuts and closed tax loopholes. However, it was not included in the final FY2015 consolidated bill. The initiative would have allocated an additional $1.6 billion for the Department of Energy, including funds for climate change resilience and energy programs. The FY2015 budget included funding for various energy initiatives, such as grants to states, weatherization programs, distributed energy generation, and nuclear weapons programs. The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, a $56 billion fund proposed by the Obama Administration, aimed to allocate additional funds for the Department of Energy but was not included in the final bill. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the civil program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), which plans, builds, operates, and maintains water resources facilities. Congress enacted the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 to authorize new Corps projects and studies. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 authorized new Corps projects and altered policies. Congress appropriated $5.454 billion for the Corps in FY2015, exceeding the President's budget request of $4.561 billion. In FY2014, Congress provided $5.468 billion for the Corps. Additionally, the agency received supplemental funds for riverine and coastal flooding in recent years. The Army Corps receives supplemental funds for specific projects, not distributed based on formula or competitive grants. Congress historically earmarked additional projects for funding. In the 112th Congress, earmarks for site-specific projects were subject to a moratorium. Congress has not added funding at the project level since FY2010. Instead, they have provided \"additional funding\" for select categories of Corps projects. In FY2015, $974 million was allocated for these projects. This approach is consistent with previous appropriations bills. The backlog of authorized Corps studies and projects that have not received funding or are incomplete is a significant issue. The backlog of authorized projects, with estimates ranging from $20 billion to over $80 billion, raises policy questions on funding priorities. Recent budget requests have limited new studies and construction starts, with some appropriations allowing for a few new projects. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no new starts be funded, while the Senate Appropriations subcommittee recommended funding new start studies and construction projects. The enacted measure provided for 10 new study starts and four new construction starts during FY2015. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund support federal navigation infrastructure investments and have received attention in recent years. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund has a surplus balance, while the Inland Waterways Trust Fund faces a shortfall. Both funds are subject to appropriations and are addressed through legislation like Water Resources Development Acts. The Harbor Maintenance Tax was enacted in 1986 to recover O&M costs at U.S. harbors, with revenues deposited into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for dredging projects. The HMT rate was increased to 12.5 cents per $100 of cargo value, leading to a surplus in the HMTF. The maritime industry wants to spend down the surplus, as some harbor channels are not being maintained properly. This could impact funding for other Energy and Water Development activities under congressional budget caps. The Administration's FY2015 budget requested $915 million from the HMTF, with an estimated end-of-year balance of over $9.5 billion. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 aimed to increase HMTF spending based on targeted percentages of collections, without affecting funding for other Corps activities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended over $1.1 billion for HMTF activities, while the Senate subcommittee found it challenging to reach the targeted WRRDA level of $1.2 billion in FY2015. Since FY2015, funding for harbor maintenance activities has been a challenge due to limited discretionary allocations. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) activities were funded at a level similar to FY2014, around $1.09 billion. Expenditures for construction and rehabilitation projects on inland waterways have been cost-shared between the federal government and users through the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) since the 1980s. There has been a shortfall in the IWTF since FY2007, prompting Congress to take measures to ensure temporary solvency. Since FY2015, funding for harbor maintenance activities has been a challenge due to limited discretionary allocations. Expenditures for construction and rehabilitation projects on inland waterways have been cost-shared between the federal government and users through the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF). In the past, proposals to increase IWTF revenues through fees have been opposed by users and rejected by Congress. Users endorsed a plan to raise the fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon in the 113th Congress to address funding issues. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) is expected to use up most of its revenues on the Olmsted Lock and Dam project on the Ohio River, limiting funding for other navigation construction projects. Without new revenue sources or changes directed by Congress, the number of inland waterway construction projects is expected to be limited. The Administration's FY2015 budget requested $85 million from IWTF and an additional $80 million from the General Fund of the Treasury for inland waterway spending. The Administration requested $85 million from the IWTF and an additional $80 million from the General Fund for inland waterway spending in FY2015. The majority of the requested IWTF funds were for the Olmsted Project. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to IWTF cost share requirements and increased funding for rehabilitation projects from the General Fund. The House recommended significant funding from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) for projects, allocating $169 million for the Olmsted Project and $112 million for other projects. The Senate included an additional $60 million for unspecified IWTF projects. P.L. 113-235 allocated $160 million for Olmsted and $112 million for other inland waterways construction projects. The Corps portion of the Energy and Water bill typically includes funding for ecosystem restoration projects, such as the Everglades in South Florida. Funding requests for Corps environmental activities, including ecosystem restoration projects, have remained steady. The Administration requested $336 million for ecosystem restoration projects in FY2015, representing 7% of the total request. No breakdown for these projects was available in the House committee or Senate subcommittee recommendations. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $56.8 million for eight CAP sections, significantly more than the Administration's request of $10 million for four CAPs in FY2015. The Senate subcommittee recommended $50 million for these projects, while P.L. 113-235 included $36.8 million spread over eight programs. The Energy and Water Development bill includes funding for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Act (CUPCA). The FY2015 request for these activities was $1.043 billion, with a net discretionary authority of $986 million after offsets. Additional funding is expected from \"permanent and other\" funds. The Administration requested $7.3 million for CUPCA in FY2015. The Administration requested $7.3 million for CUPCA in FY2015, $1.4 million less than FY2014. The House recommended $9.9 million for the project, while the Senate subcommittee agreed with the Administration's request but prohibited delegation to the Bureau of Reclamation. P.L. 113-235 provided $9.9 million for CUPCA. The Bureau of Reclamation has been involved in building large dams and water diversion structures in the West. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water projects in the West, providing water for irrigation and hydroelectric power. It supplies water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people, also offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Operations can be controversial due to impacts on wildlife and competing water users. The Bureau of Reclamation's budget consists mainly of project funding lines, similar to the Corps of Engineers. Earmark disclosure rules have affected Reclamation projects in the past, but the current moratorium on earmarks limits direct congressional funding. The largest account, Water and Related Resources, covers traditional programs like construction, operations, dam safety, and ecosystem restoration. For FY2015, the Administration requested $1.04 billion for this account and other Reclamation projects. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.013 billion and the Senate subcommittee recommended $1.23 billion for Reclamation programs. P.L. 113-235 provided $1.13 billion for all Reclamation accounts, $87 million more than the Administration's FY2015 request. The FY2014 enacted bill provided $1.113 billion for Reclamation projects. Drought conditions in California and other states have received attention in recent appropriations bills. P.L. 113-76 included provisions related to Reclamation drought response and authorities, extending loan authority through FY2017 for projects mitigating drought losses. The Secretary of the Interior's authority was expanded for nonfederal groundwater banking in California. Certain reporting provisions for transfer of irrigation water among federal water contractors were waived. Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service were directed to expedite environmental compliance for CVP water transfers. The authorization of the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act was extended through 2015. The House and Senate subcommittees encouraged Reclamation to address the drought using available authorities. The Administration requested an extension of Reclamation's authority under the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act. The Senate proposed increasing appropriations for the Emergency Drought Relief Act from $90 million to $110 million and directed Reclamation to provide maximum water supplies to certain contractors in California's Central Valley. Reclamation's FY2015 request included funding for projects addressing drought effects, such as $1.5 million for the WaterSMART program. Reclamation proposed $1.5 million in new funding for the WaterSMART program under the Drought Response Program, which received congressional attention due to ongoing drought effects. The House provided $1.47 million in funding, while the Senate recommended increasing it to $15 million. The final bill allocated $50 million for \"Western Drought Response.\" Legislation like S. 2198 suggested expanding Reclamation WaterSMART funds for drought-related concerns, but this was not included in FY2015 appropriations. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund was established under the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act for implementation purposes. The San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act established a fund for fisheries restoration and water management. The fund is supported by reallocating Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and accelerated payments from Friant water users. $88 million was provided without further appropriation. Additional funding will not be available until October 2019 without further congressional action. The Administration requested $32 million for San Joaquin restoration activities in FY2015. The House provided no funding for the restoration settlement, but the Senate subcommittee agreed with the request. P.L. 113-235 provided funding within the Central Valley Project appropriation for the Friant Division. Reclamation has combined funding for water conservation programs into the WaterSMART Program, focusing on water conservation, re-use, and planning. The FY2015 WaterSMART programs requested $52 million, with the House approving $51 million and the Senate recommending $115 million. The program included new components for Drought Response and Resilient Infrastructure to address climate change effects. The Resilient Infrastructure Program aimed to adapt Reclamation facilities for climate change and wildfire effects, while the Drought Response Program funded planning and implementation actions for water conservation. The House and Senate approved funding for drought response and plans, with the Senate recommending $13.5 million more than the Administration's request. P.L. 113-235 allocated $50 million for \"Western Drought Response\" separately from the WaterSMART program. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, fossil energy, and environmental cleanup. The FY2013 continuing resolution funded DOE programs at $25.1 billion. The FY2015 DOE budget was $27.9 billion, slightly lower than the Administration's request of $28.4 billion. President Obama prioritized energy efficiency and renewable energy for job creation and economic growth. President Obama aimed to double generation from wind, solar, and geothermal sources by 2020, but Congress did not support increased spending for these programs. The proposed budgets for EERE were consistently reduced from FY2011 to FY2014. In FY2015, DOE requested $2.32 billion for EERE programs, a $416 million increase from the previous year. Additionally, an extra $180 million was requested for OE programs. The FY2015 request emphasized five broad initiatives across EERE programs: Grid Integration, EV Everywhere Grand Challenge, and SunShot Grand Challenge. These initiatives aimed to address electric grid integration barriers, promote affordable plug-in electric vehicles, and achieve cost-competitive solar power by 2020. The DOE-wide initiative aims to achieve cost-competitive solar power by 2020. The Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative focuses on improving U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing clean energy products. The Wide Bandgap Semiconductors for Clean Energy Initiative explores next-generation semiconductor technology for high-power-conversion electronics. The House Appropriations Committee recommended cutting overall EERE funding by $112.7 million, expressing concern about budget expenses and focusing on efforts to curb gasoline and electricity prices. They emphasized prioritizing research with commercialization possibilities only in the distant future and identified oversight initiatives for EERE and OE. The committee also raised concerns about the proliferation of centers like Energy Innovation Hubs and Clean Energy Manufacturing Institutes. The House Appropriations Committee recommended cutting EERE funding by $112.7 million, prioritizing research with distant commercialization possibilities. They raised concerns about the proliferation of centers like Energy Innovation Hubs and Clean Energy Manufacturing Institutes, urging DOE for transparency, evaluation, and prioritization. The committee encouraged DOE to assess ultraconductive copper as a crosscutting technology area. The European Commission launched an \"ultrawire\" R&D initiative in 2013 with directives for FY2015 funding. One directive specified no funding for the Grid Integration Initiative under certain programs. The committee also sought a rescission of $18.1 million for EERE funding. In FY2015, EERE funding was affected by various amendments, including reductions and increases in funding for renewable energy construction. Additionally, there were restrictions on spending for lighting efficiency standards enforcement and the Cape Wind Energy Project. The draft committee report highlighted concerns about overlap and duplication among energy efficiency programs at DOE, HUD, and EPA, directing DOE to lead a report on the topic and establish a coordinating council mechanism. The draft committee report encouraged DOE to form partnerships with non-profit groups for grid technology testing and technical assistance to address renewable power generation variability. The program aims to reduce petroleum use, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollutants while supporting research and development of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. The fuel cell program targets a cost below $40 per kilowatt and a durability of 5,000 hours by 2020. The goal for hydrogen produced from renewable resources is to bring the cost below $4.00 per unit. The Department of Energy aims to reduce the cost of hydrogen produced from renewable resources to below $4.00 per unit by 2020. The funding requested for research and development in this area was $93 million, with additional support for early market fuel cell demonstrations and equipment standards. The House committee recommended a $7 million increase, while the Senate report suggested maintaining the FY2014 funding level. The final appropriation was $4 million higher than the previous year, with the goal of fostering a domestic bioenergy industry to reduce oil dependence and greenhouse gas emissions. The program aims to reduce oil dependence, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and promote economic development in farms and forests through biofuels and bioproducts. Challenges include fluctuating oil prices. The focus is on converting raw biomass to solid pellets or \"green crude\" bio-oil for easy transport. Goals now include developing biofuels to meet Renewable Fuel Standard targets, such as biomass-based hydrocarbon fuels, hydrocarbons from algae, and biobutanol. The aim is to support the production of non-food \"drop-in\" liquid fuels compatible with existing infrastructure. The DOE requested $253 million in FY2015 for Bioenergy programs, aiming to reduce oil dependence and promote biofuels. The program focuses on developing non-food \"drop-in\" biofuels like hydrocarbons from algae and biobutanol. The House committee proposed a $52 million cut below FY2014, while the draft Senate report recommended a $21 million increase. The final appropriation for DOE's biomass projects was cut by $7 million from the FY2014 level, with concerns raised about the narrow interpretation of biomass. The House committee did not provide funding for the joint biofuels initiative with the Navy and Department of Agriculture, while the Senate recommended $60 million, resulting in up to $45 million allocated. For the Solar Program, DOE requested $282 million to support the SunShot Initiative goal of achieving cost-competitive solar power by 2020. The Solar Program aims to make solar power cost-competitive without subsidies by 2020 through various R&D activities and innovative manufacturing technologies. Funding cuts were proposed, with a final reduction of $24 million below the FY2014 level. The Wind Program has goals for reducing energy costs for land-based windfarms. The Department of Energy aims to reduce the cost of utility-scale turbines to 5.7 cents/kwh by 2020 and 4.2 cents/kwh by 2030. For offshore settings, the goal is to decrease energy cost to 17 cents/kwh by 2020. The overall goal is to increase windfarm capacity to 125 gw by 2020 and 300 gw by 2030. DOE requested a $27 million increase in funding for advanced offshore wind projects and an initiative to optimize wind farms for improved performance and lower costs. The House approved a $19 million cut below FY2014 for materials and manufacturing processes for longer wind blades. The draft Senate report recommended a $21 million increase over FY2014. The final appropriation increased funding by $19 million. The program aims to lower power production costs for hydrothermal power to 6 cents/kwh by 2020 and for new technologies by 2030. DOE requested $62 million for site characterization of FORGE. The Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) is a site for testing new technologies in enhanced geothermal systems. Funding in FY2015 would support \"play fairway\" analyses to assess exploration risk and map new resources. The House committee proposed similar funding to FY2014, while the Senate recommended $16 million more. The final appropriation increased funding by $9 million. Water power technologies utilize marine and hydrokinetic resources to generate electricity, including wave, tidal, current, and ocean thermal energy. The DOE requested $63 million for the Water Power Program in FY2015 to support the launch of HydroNEXT, focusing on R&D for increased hydropower opportunities and development of low-cost modular hydropower systems. Funding would also support marine and hydrokinetic activities for next-generation systems, despite a proposed $20 million cut by the House committee bill. The House committee bill proposed a $20 million (34%) cut below FY2014, while the draft Senate report recommended a $10 million (18%) increase. The final appropriation increased funding by $2 million over FY2014. The program aims to achieve EV affordability and convenience by 2022 through advanced battery technology and cutting oil use trends. The program also targets a fuel economy of 62 mpg for cars by 2025 and a 50% increase in heavy-duty truck fuel economy by 2015. The DOE requested a $359 million budget for the Grid Integration Initiative and EV Everywhere initiative in FY2015, with a $69 million increase. The increase includes funding for batteries and electric drives, outreach and deployment, materials technology, and fuels and lubricants. Key focuses include reducing weight and costs, developing motors without rare earths, emphasizing carbon fiber and lightweight materials, and improving power electronics. Funding for fuels and lubricants would rise by $11 million to expand work on drop-in biofuel compatibility with components and infrastructure. The House committee bill proposed a $12 million cut below FY2014, while the draft Senate report recommended nearly the same amount. The final appropriation cut funding by $10 million below the FY2014 level for a program aimed at reducing building-related energy costs by 50% by 2030 through energy efficiency measures. DOE requested $212 million for FY2015, an increase of $34 million over the previous year. The funding focuses on emerging technologies for energy efficiency in buildings, with a goal of achieving 20% energy savings by 2020. This includes R&D on sensors, controls, and grid integration, as well as new air conditioning technologies. The House committee bill proposed a $13 million cut below FY2014 for DOE funding focused on R&D on sensors, controls, and grid integration, and new air conditioning technologies. The final appropriation was a $6 million cut below FY2014. Constraints on FY2015 funding for building technologies were adopted by the House, including amendments affecting DOE energy efficiency standards programs. The House committee bill proposed cuts to DOE funding for R&D on sensors, controls, and grid integration. Amendments were made to limit funding for building technologies and prohibit DOE from enforcing certain lighting efficiency standards. The Advanced Manufacturing Office focuses on national interests like job creation and international competitiveness. The Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) aims to reduce energy use in manufactured goods by 50% over 10 years. DOE requested $305 million for FY2015, with a focus on Advanced Manufacturing R&D Facilities and Projects. The goal is to help leading companies cut energy intensity by 25% and install 40 gigawatts of combined heat and power equipment by 2020. The proposed $109 million increase for Advanced R&D Facilities includes funding for new Clean Energy Manufacturing Institute (CEMI) and support for existing institutes focused on nanomaterials, electric machines, bio-manufacturing, and smart manufacturing. The CEMIs aim to improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness through collaboration between universities, industry, and the government. The Clean Energy Manufacturing Institute (CEMI) is part of the President's initiative for a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. It aims to improve U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing clean energy products like solar panels and wind turbine blades. CEMI institutes will provide small- and medium-sized enterprises access to cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities and technology. DOE plans to invest $70 million-$120 million in each institute over a five- to seven-year period. The House committee bill included $56 million for the four CEMI institutes, while the draft Senate report recommended $98 million. Future funding requests for additional CEMIs must include specific research topics. A competitive process, committee notification, and performance measures are required for the third and subsequent CEMIs. An EERE report will assess the effectiveness of existing CEMIs and the Critical Materials Hub focuses on technologies for manufacturers. The Critical Materials Hub, established in FY2012, focuses on technologies for manufacturers to use critical materials efficiently, including rare earth elements. The Department of Energy requested $25 million for the Hub's fourth year, which was approved in the final appropriation. Additionally, $10 million was requested for the Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which was also fully funded. The House committee bill proposed a $25 million budget increase for these initiatives. The House committee bill proposed a $25 million increase for the Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The final appropriation provided a $19 million increase for the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) to support expanded marketing and outreach for energy efficiency goals. The final appropriation cut funding for an administrative program by about $1 million below the FY2014 level. DOE requested $185 million, a $20 million increase over the FY2014 level, to consolidate information technology and establish an active project management system. The House committee bill proposed a $12 million cut below FY2014, while the final appropriation cut funding by $2 million below the FY2014 level. The Office of Strategic Programs focuses on accelerating development and adoption of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. DOE requested a $2 million decrease in funding compared to FY2014, with the final appropriation cutting nearly $3 million. The program addresses barriers faced by state and local governments. The Department of Energy (DOE) is working to address regulatory, financial, and planning barriers faced by state and local governments in providing home energy services to low-income families. DOE requested a $54 million increase in funds for FY2015, but the House committee proposed a $29 million cut. The final appropriation provided $19 million more than FY2014, supporting administrative and program activities at state energy offices. The proposed increase of $13 million for FY2015 would support a new $10 million program for Clean Energy and Economic Development Partnerships in shale gas growth zones. The program aims to assist in creating sustainable economic development roadmaps to address challenges in infrastructure and services. Additionally, $4 million in state grant funding would establish a Local Technical Assistance Program to support energy efficiency and clean energy technologies. The final appropriation for FY2015 remained at the FY2014 level. The Department of Energy (DOE) focuses on modernization, resiliency, and emergency preparedness in the energy sector. Funding requests for FY2015 included increases for Infrastructure Security and Smart Grid R&D subprograms. The final appropriation remained flat at the FY2014 level, with no detailed figures provided for specific subprograms. The Smart Grid R&D subprogram aims to modernize the electricity distribution system with a requested increase for R&D on microgrids and higher performance smart grids. The Cybersecurity R&D subprogram saw a nearly $4 million increase approved by the House. The Infrastructure Security and Energy Restoration subprogram aims to secure U.S. energy infrastructure against various hazards and assist in restoring energy quickly after disruptive events. The House approved $16 million, while the draft Senate report recommended $23 million for FY2014, with a directive for a study on the future resilience of the nation's power grid. The draft Senate report emphasized integrating renewable energy into the power grid and expanding microgrid partnerships. The appropriations act allocated $913.5 million for nuclear energy programs, with a net appropriation of $833.5 million after rescissions. DOE's FY2015 nuclear R&D budget aimed to enhance safety and reliability. The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy aims to improve safety, reliability, and economics of nuclear power plants, develop waste management technologies, and minimize nuclear proliferation risks. A major initiative called Supercritical Transformational Electric Power Generation (STEP) seeks to commercialize the Brayton cycle for power plants, with potential efficiencies of up to 50%. The STEP program aims to reach a 50-50 cost sharing agreement with the private sector in FY2015 to develop a 10 megawatt Brayton cycle pilot plant. The funding request for the STEP initiative within the nuclear energy budget totaled $27.5 million for FY2015. The House Appropriations committee recommended $899.0 million for nuclear energy, but an amendment on the House floor reduced this total by $73.3 million. The Senate subcommittee draft report recommended $777.0 million for nuclear energy programs, cutting the Administration's request for small modular reactor licensing support. The Administration's request for small modular reactor licensing support was reduced to $97 million, while funding for reactor concepts R&D was cut by 45%. The House Appropriations committee agreed with the $27.5 million request for the STEP initiative and authorized DOE to adjust the cost-sharing goal for pilot plants. The Senate recommended full funding for STEP but advised limiting the program's scope, schedule, and cost. The consolidated appropriations act allocated $5.0 million for STEP under Nuclear R&D and an additional $10.0 million under Coal R&D. The Reactor Concepts program area focuses on advanced small modular reactors and enhancing the sustainability of existing light water reactors. The consolidated appropriations act provided $133.0 million for Reactor Concepts, $32.5 million above the request and $20.0 million above the FY2014 level. The program had previously focused on the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor demonstration project. DOE decided not to proceed with a demonstration plant design at that time but would continue research on the technology. Potential obstacles facing NGNP include low natural gas prices. The NGNP research activities were shifted to the Advanced Reactor Concepts subprogram in FY2014 due to obstacles like low natural gas prices. The Advanced Reactor Technologies subprogram, with a funding request of $70.2 million in FY2015, focuses on Generation IV reactors and fast reactors. The House Appropriations committee recommended $138.0 million for Reactor Concepts, $37.5 million more than the request and $25.0 million above FY2014. International research collaboration in nuclear technology development focuses on \"fast reactors,\" fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactors, and high temperature gas-cooled reactors under the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). The committee agreed to consolidate Advanced SMR research with Advanced Reactor Concepts, boosting funding for the latter to $101.0 million, including research on high temperature gas reactors. The House approved an amendment to reduce the total nuclear funding level without specifying cuts in individual programs. The Light Water Reactor Sustainability subprogram conducts research on extending the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years. The program studies aging reactor materials, analyzes safety margins of aging plants, and researches prevention and mitigation measures for disasters like Fukushima. The House panel recommended $35.0 million for this subprogram, while the draft Senate bill proposed $5.8 million for Light Water Reactor Sustainability. The draft report directed DOE to focus the Light Water Reactor Sustainability subprogram on understanding accident scenarios like those in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. $33.0 million of Reactor Concepts funding is designated for graphite fuel research previously conducted under the NGNP program. Rising costs for large conventional nuclear reactors have led to interest in small modular reactors (SMRs) with capacities ranging from 40 to 300 megawatts. Multiple SMRs would be installed together to form a power block with a single control room. The consolidated appropriations act provided $54.5 million for technical support for licensing small modular reactors, with DOE paying up to half the costs for NRC design certification and licensing. The program focuses on LWR designs for near-term deployment, costing DOE a total of $452 million through FY2017. The DOE's program for supporting small modular reactors (SMRs) focuses on LWR designs for near-term deployment, costing a total of $452 million through FY2017. The first award recipient, Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) consortium, received around $226 million over five years to design and license a commercial demonstration of the mPower SMR. However, B&W reduced spending on the project to $15 million per year and delayed the design certification application to NRC indefinitely due to a lack of investors and customer contracts. The DOE's program for supporting small modular reactors (SMRs) focuses on LWR designs for near-term deployment, with Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) consortium receiving funding to design and license the mPower SMR. However, B&W reduced spending on the project and delayed the design certification application to NRC indefinitely due to a lack of investors and customer contracts. DOE selected NuScale Power SMR for assistance, with a generating capacity of 45 megawatts and plans for commercial operation by 2025. Funding for the SMR program was reduced in FY2015, with all remaining funds directed to the NuScale project. The Senate draft report recommended no new funding for SMR licensing support, citing the availability of $85.0 million in prior-year funds that could be reprogrammed for the NuScale project. Small modular reactors would go against the trend in nuclear power technology towards larger reactors, but proponents argue they are economically viable due to factory assembly and simpler safety systems. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, focusing on separating radioactive constituents for re-use or stable waste forms. The program received $197.0 million in FY2015, with a proposed increase for the Used Nuclear Fuel R&D subprogram from $60.0 million to $79.0 million. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program received $197.0 million in FY2015, with a proposed increase for the Used Nuclear Fuel R&D subprogram from $60.0 million to $79.0 million. The subprogram focuses on establishing a new spent fuel management system and conducting research on potential waste repositories. DOE released a strategy for the management and disposal of used nuclear fuel, calling for a consent-based siting process for storage and disposal facilities. The program also proposed mandatory appropriations for spent fuel management starting in FY2018. The Fuel Cycle R&D Program focuses on accident-tolerant fuels, fuel cycle options, preventing nuclear material diversion, and increasing nuclear fuel resources. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $182.0 million for the program, with allocations for accident-tolerant fuels research, Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition, and long-term dry cask storage. The Senate draft report recommended $230.0 million for Fuel Cycle R&D, including funds for Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition and developing a consolidated spent fuel storage facility. The draft report recommended $89.0 million for a consolidated spent fuel storage facility and $60.1 million for accident-tolerant fuels. Funding was also allocated for used nuclear fuel disposition R&D and the Administration's waste management system. No funding was provided for the Senate-authorized spent fuel storage facility. The Obama Administration requested $475.5 million for the Fossil Energy Research and Development program in FY2015. The FY2015 budget for Fossil Energy Research and Development (FE R&D) was $571.0 million, which was $95.5 million above the President's request and $8.9 million above the FY2014 amount. The Carbon Capture sub-program saw a decrease in funding by $4 million, while the Carbon Storage sub-program focused on long-term geologic storage of CO2. The Regional Sequestration Partnerships were set to be renamed. The FY2015 budget for Fossil Energy Research and Development (FE R&D) was $571.0 million, which was $95.5 million above the President's request and $8.9 million above the FY2014 amount. The Regional Sequestration Partnerships would be renamed Storage Infrastructure. No funding was requested for beneficial use/reuse of CO2 (-$8.9 million). The Advanced Energy Systems sub-program focuses on improving availability and efficiency of fossil energy systems integrated with CO2 capture. The Cross-Cutting Research activity serves as a bridge between basic and applied research by fostering development and deployment of innovative systems. National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Coal R&D supports in-house research activities. Congress noted that it would provide $15 million above the President's request to continue support for extracting rare-earth elements from coal and coal byproduct streams. The FY2015 budget for Fossil Energy Research and Development (FE R&D) was $571.0 million, exceeding the President's request. The budget includes funding for various programs such as the Supercritical Transformational Electric Power (STEP) Generation Program, Natural Gas Technologies, and Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies. The STEP program is a joint initiative with the Office of Nuclear Energy and the Solar Energy Program, aimed at promoting large-scale development. The FY2015 budget for Fossil Energy Research and Development (FE R&D) was $571.0 million, exceeding the President's request. Congress allocated funds for various programs including the Supercritical Transformational Electric Power (STEP) Generation Program and Natural Gas Technologies. $15 million was designated for methane hydrates research and $10.1 million for collaborative research on hydraulic fracturing to improve economics, recoverability, and address environmental risks. Congress directed DOE to submit a comprehensive program plan within 180 days after enactment of P.L. 113-235. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 and consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas. It provides security against oil supply disruptions and fulfills U.S. obligations under the International Energy Program. The SPR reached its maximum capacity in 2010 and the federal government has not purchased oil for it since 1994. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) reached its maximum capacity in 2010 and has not received oil purchases from the federal government since 1994. In 2011, a sale of 30.6 million barrels reduced the SPR inventory to 695.9 million barrels. In 2014, a test sale was conducted to evaluate the ability to sell, draw down, and distribute crude oil given changes in domestic production and infrastructure. The SPR Test Sale delivered 4,998,146 barrels of crude oil over a 47-day period, generating $468.6 million in cash receipts for the U.S. government. The SPR Petroleum Account balance is currently $250.8 million. The FY2015 House Appropriations Committee report criticized the timing of the announcement of the first regional gasoline reserve in the Northeast, funded by the SPR test sale receipts, and the lack of prior consultation with Congress. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 rescinded all funds in the SPR Petroleum Account and repealed the federal government's authority to accept oil. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 prohibited the waiver of Jones Act requirements for transporting crude oil from the SPR until adequate measures are taken. The Administration requested $205.0 million for FY2015 to operate the SPR, with a funding cut to $200.0 million in the final appropriations measure. The funding increase is primarily for maintenance programs to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance backlog. The DOE Office of Science received $5.068 billion in FY2015, similar to the previous year's funding. It conducts basic research in various program areas and is a significant federal funder of research in the physical sciences. The Obama Administration requested $5.111 billion, the House recommended $5.066 billion, and the draft Senate bill proposed $5.079 billion for FY2015. The Explanatory Statement for FY2015 appropriations law adopts House report recommendations, with ASCR receiving a $78 million increase and FES facing a $28 million decrease. The House report recommended the largest increase for ASCR and a decrease for BER, while the draft Senate report proposed a substantial increase for ASCR and a decrease for FES, mainly due to termination of U.S. involvement in the ITER project. The FY2015 appropriations law adopts House report recommendations, with ASCR receiving a $78 million increase, totaling $541 million. The Administration's request and the House report recommendation align with this funding level. The draft Senate report proposed $557 million for ASCR, with a focus on exascale computing activities for national security and economic competitiveness. Exascale computing is a DOE priority for national security and economic competitiveness. The House and draft Senate reports recommended funding levels for ASCR-funded Exascale Computing, ALCF, and ORLCF. However, they diverged on funding for NERSCC at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The final agreement provided $91 million for ASCR-funded Exascale Computing. The final agreement allocated $91 million for ASCR-funded Exascale Computing, $104 million for ORLCF, $80 million for ALCF, and $76 million for NERSCC. Additionally, $3 million was provided for the Computational Sciences Graduate Fellowship program. BES received $1.733 billion in FY2015 funding, a $70 million increase from FY2014. The majority of the increase was for scientific user facilities and construction projects, with plans to transition NSLS-II from construction to operations in FY2015. The Administration requested $63 million for research and development activities, long-lead procurements, and prototyping for the Linac Coherent Light Source-II (LCLS-II) in FY2015. The House report recommended $128 million for BES construction, including $24 million for Computational Materials Science. Additionally, the House report recommended funding for NSLS-II operations, Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs), Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and Computational Materials Sciences. The draft Senate report also recommended funding for EFRCs. The draft Senate report recommended funding for various research programs including EFRCs, Batteries and Energy Storage Innovation Hub, EPSCoR, Computational Materials Sciences, and the Fuels from Sunlight Innovation Hub. The final agreement included funding for EFRCs, Batteries and Energy Storage Innovation Hub, EPSCoR, Computational Materials Sciences, Fuels from Sunlight Innovation Hub, and LCLS-II construction. The Explanatory Statement allocated $592 million for BER in FY2015. The Explanatory Statement allocated $592 million for BER in FY2015, close to the FY2014 funding level. The Administration requested $628 million, while the House report recommended $540 million. The Administration sought to reduce funding for Biological Systems Science by $12 million, with a focus on shifting from nuclear medicine research to bioenergy and environmental research. Funding for Climate and Environmental Sciences would have increased by $30 million, mainly for Climate Model Development and Validation. The House report recommended $75 million for Bioenergy Research Centers, $46 million for Environmental Molecular Science Laboratory, and no funding for Climate Model Development and Validation. The Senate draft suggested $29 million for the Climate Model Development and Validation activity. The FY2015 funding for Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) is $468 million, with the Administration requesting $416 million. The House report recommended $540 million, while the draft Senate report suggested $341 million, mainly due to differences in funding for the ITER project. ITER aims to generate fusion power at unprecedented levels, but concerns exist about its cost and management. The FY2015 budget request for the U.S. contribution to ITER was $150.0 million, less than previous funding levels. The Administration expressed concerns about ITER's schedule and proposed $225 million annual cap on funding. The House recommended $225 million for ITER, with $200 million for in-kind hardware contributions. The U.S. contribution to ITER in FY2015 was $225 million, with $200 million for in-kind hardware contributions and $25 million for cash contributions. The House and Senate had differing views on funding, with the Senate recommending withdrawal from ITER due to concerns about cost and completion date. The FY2015 agreement funds ITER at $150 million, with U.S. cash contributions withheld until management recommendations are implemented. Additionally, the FY2015 FES budget proposed a reduction in funding for High Energy and the closure of the Alcator C-Mod facility at MIT in late FY2016. The House report recommended $315 million for domestic fusion research, $22 million for Alcator C-Mod, and $18 million for High Energy Density Laboratory Plasmas. The Senate report suggested $17 million for High Energy Density Laboratory Plasmas. The Explanatory Statement allocated $22 million for Alcator C-Mod and directed DOE to plan for its shutdown. The FES sought community engagement for its strategic planning and priorities report. In FY2015, High Energy Density Laboratory Plasmas received $18 million. The Explanatory Statement allocated $318 million for FES research. HEP received $766 million in FY2015, $9 million less than FY2014. The Administration requested a reduction to $744 million for HEP in FY2015. Both House and Senate reports recommended maintaining funding levels close to FY2014 for HEP in FY2015. The HEP request included reductions in various areas and increases in others, excluding funding for the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment. The House and draft Senate reports recommended increases for various physics programs, including Energy Frontier Experimental Physics, Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics, Theoretical and Computational Physics, and Advanced Technology R&D. They differed on funding for Accelerator Stewardship, with the House recommending $3 million and the Senate recommending the requested $19 million. The House also recommended $22 million for LBNE R&D and design activities. The House and draft Senate reports recommended increases for various physics programs, including Energy Frontier Experimental Physics, Cosmic Frontier Experimental Physics, Theoretical and Computational Physics, and Advanced Technology R&D. The House recommended $22 million for LBNE R&D and design activities, while the Explanatory Statement provides $22 million for LBNE, including $10 million for R&D and $12 million for engineering and design. Nuclear Physics receives $596 million in FY2015, $41 million more than FY2014. The FY2015 request for Nuclear Physics (NP) was $594 million, with the House report recommending $600 million and the draft Senate report recommending $602 million. The largest change in the FY2015 NP request was a $35 million increase in construction funding for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University, partially offset by a $9 million reduction in funding for the 12GeV CEBAF Upgrade project. Both the House and draft Senate reports recommended the requested level for FRIB. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) was authorized to support transformational energy technology research. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) was established by the America COMPETES Act to support energy technology research projects. ARPA-E's mission is to overcome long-term technological barriers in energy development. FY2015 funding for ARPA-E is $280 million, with the Administration seeking $325 million. The House proposed $300 million, while the Senate recommended $280 million. Funding for DOE's nuclear waste disposal activities is under the Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program. The Administration requested $79 million for the Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition subprogram for FY2015, an increase of $19 million from FY2014. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy is carrying out activities formerly conducted by the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management to dispose of highly radioactive waste. Funding for Yucca Mountain was not requested for FY2015, and no new funding was included in the final FY2015 appropriations act. The final FY2015 appropriations act did not include new funding for Yucca Mountain and reduced the request for Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition by $7.5 million. The Obama Administration has determined that developing the Yucca Mountain repository is not feasible and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to explore alternative waste management strategies. The commission recommended a \"consent based\" approach for future nuclear waste facilities and suggested a new organization, with access to the Nuclear Waste Fund, to oversee the process. The DOE released a strategy for managing nuclear waste in response to the Blue Ribbon Commission report. It called for interim storage facilities by 2021 and a permanent repository by 2048. The House approved $150.0 million in FY2015 for DOE's waste disposal activities. The House approved $150.0 million in FY2015 for DOE to restart activities for the Yucca Mountain licensing process at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The House Appropriations Committee noted Yucca Mountain as the only candidate site for a national repository for highly radioactive waste, rejecting the Administration's attempts to develop a new nuclear waste policy unilaterally. Funding boost for Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition in FY2015 would focus on R&D for long-term storage of high-burnup fuels and deep borehole demonstration tests. The DOE budget justification for FY2015 proposed $30 million for an integrated waste management system, including preliminary processes for storage, transportation, disposal, and consent-based siting. The final FY2015 appropriations measure did not include funding for Yucca Mountain or the waste storage facility proposed by the Senate panel, but provided $22.5 million for the Administration's waste management system. The FY2015 budget request proposed changes to the nuclear waste funding system, with discretionary funding continuing to cover expenses. Mandatory appropriations from nuclear waste fees would supplement discretionary funding starting in FY2018. The FY2015 budget proposed mandatory appropriations from nuclear waste fees to supplement discretionary funding starting in FY2018. However, a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling halted DOE's collection of fees, leading to a loss of $750 million in annual revenue from the nuclear power industry. The DOE collected about $750 million annually from the nuclear power industry. The license application for the Yucca Mountain repository was filed in 2008 but DOE tried to withdraw it in 2010. The NRC rejected the withdrawal motion, citing NWPA requirements. The full NRC Commission deadlocked on the issue in 2011, preventing DOE from withdrawing the application. The licensing process was halted in 2011 due to budgetary limitations, with no funding allocated in subsequent years. However, a court ruling in 2013 mandated NRC to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license. The Circuit ruled in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application with available funding. The House passed a bill in FY2015 for $55.0 million for NRC, but it was not included in the final appropriations measure. NWPA required DOE to start taking waste by January 31, 1998, leading to court decisions upholding DOE's obligation to meet deadlines and compensate utilities for damages. DOE estimates liability payments could exceed $20 billion if waste removal begins by 2020. DOE planned to start removing waste from reactor sites by 2020, the original target for opening Yucca Mountain. The Loan Programs Office offers loan guarantees for energy projects and direct loans for advanced vehicle manufacturing technologies. No additional funding for loans and guarantees was requested for FY2015, but $42 million was requested for program administrative expenses, offset by $25 million in fees for a net appropriation of $17 million. The DOE Loan Programs Office requested $6 million for vehicle manufacturing loan program administrative expenses, with $2 million in offsets. The House-passed bill, Senate draft, and final bill approved the requested amounts for loan guarantees for innovative clean energy technology and renewable energy projects. Eligible technology categories include renewable energy, advanced fossil energy, advanced nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and pollution control. The Section 1705 program under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided loan guarantees for already-commercialized renewable energy and electric transmission technologies. The program allowed DOE to provide loan guarantees for up to 80% of construction costs for eligible energy projects, reducing the risk to lenders and enabling financing at below-market interest rates. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz signed agreements in 2014 for the first Section 1703 loan guarantees totaling $6.5 billion for two nuclear reactors in Georgia. Under Section 1705, final loan guarantees have been issued for 24 projects, totaling about $14.4 billion. DOE's first loan guarantee under Section 1705 was issued in September 2009 to Solyndra Inc., a manufacturer of photovoltaic equipment. Solyndra's bankruptcy announcement on August 31, 2011, prompted strong congressional criticism of the Administration's management of the loan guarantee program. Solyndra's DOE loan guarantee totaled $535 million, and the company's bankruptcy placed most or all of that amount at risk. Title XVII requires upfront coverage of estimated future government costs resulting from defaults on guaranteed loans. Subsidy costs are calculated as the present value of possible future net costs to the government for each loan guarantee. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that subsidy cost payments will be too low by at least 1%, leading to adjustments in appropriations bills for loan guarantee authorizations. The authorization for Section 1703 loan guarantees includes a 1% adjustment of the loan guarantee ceiling. Subsidy costs for these guarantees are typically covered by project sponsors, except for the $6 billion appropriated by ARRA for Section 1705 loan guarantees. However, $2 billion of the Section 1705 subsidy cost was transferred to another program, leaving $2.5 billion available. $1.9 billion of this amount was obligated by the program's deadline in FY2011. The FY2007 continuing resolution set a $4 billion cap on loan guarantees under the Section 1703 program. Unobligated appropriations for subsidy costs under the Section 1705 program were no longer available after FY2011. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided $170 million for renewable energy projects under the Section 1703 program. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy and efficiency projects, in addition to $32.8 billion in remaining Section 1703 authority for all technologies. The Act also included a $8.3 billion ceiling for non-nuclear technologies under Section 1703 and $18.5 billion ceiling for nuclear power plants. $4 billion allocated for loan guarantees for uranium enrichment plants ($2 billion conditionally committed). $1.183 billion ceiling for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects under Section 1703, in addition to $170 million for subsidy costs. $2.5 billion for Section 1705 subsidy costs appropriated by ARRA, with $1.9 billion used for existing loan guarantees. The remainder is not available for new guarantees. The DOE administers the ATVM Loan Program for automobile manufacturers to invest in plant capacity for fuel-efficient vehicles. $8.4 billion in loans have been issued, with $579 million no longer active. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established by Congress for national defense. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established by Congress for national defense, aims to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within the DOE. NNSA's activities include managing the Weapons Activities account, with funding details provided in Table 12. The program also oversees the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation program. The nuclear weapons complex, managed by NNSA, consists of three laboratories and four production sites. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress seeks further changes for greater efficiency and smaller footprints at each site. The nuclear weapons complex, managed by NNSA, consists of three laboratories and four production sites. Congress seeks efficiency and smaller footprints at each site. The President provided Congress with a classified report on maintaining delivery platforms, sustaining a safe nuclear weapons stockpile, and modernizing the complex, intending to invest $80 billion in the next decade. The NNSA projected weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs for FY2011-FY2020 at $85.4-$86.2 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NNSA to use a new budget structure for FY2016, including Directed Stockpile Work, Science, Technology, and Engineering, Major Production Capabilities, and Site Operations and Maintenance categories for increased transparency. The NNSA's budget for FY2011-FY2020 was projected at $85.4-$86.2 billion. To increase transparency, a new budget structure was implemented for FY2016. Legislation (P.L. 113-235) included sections on cost and oversight, requiring independent oversight for high-hazard nuclear facilities and cost estimates for projects over $100 million. The Secretary of Energy was also required to provide an analysis of alternatives for major warhead refurbishment programs. The Defense Programs budget for FY2014-FY2015 focused on maintaining and extending the life of existing warheads through various programs, including Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for warheads like the W76 and B61 mod 12. Funding for these programs ranged from $165.4 million to $643.0 million, with specific allocations for each LEP. The NNSA requested funds for the W76 LEP, W88 Alt 370, and a cruise missile warhead LEP in FY2015. The LEP aims to use common components from other programs and enhance warhead safety. The House provided full funding for the B61-12 LEP, W76 LEP, and W88 Alt 370, but no funds for the W78 LEP. Additional funding was allocated for a new life extension study for the cruise missile warhead. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a new life extension study for the cruise missile warhead due to the high cost of the B61-12 LEP. The Senate Appropriations Committee draft report suggested full funding for the B61 LEP, W76 LEP, and W88 Alt 370, expressing concerns about the affordability of the W76 program. No funds were allocated for the W78 LEP, and the cruise missile warhead life extension study was not funded due to insufficient justification provided by the NNSA. P.L. 113-235 provided full funding for the B61 LEP, W76 LEP, and W88 Alt 370, but no funds were allocated for the W78 LEP. The cruise missile warhead life extension study was also included, with a requirement for NNSA to provide a report on military requirements, cost, and schedule. Stockpile Systems funding declined in 2014 due to advancements in the W78/W88 study and Alt 370. The Stockpile Systems funding request declined to $454.5 million for FY2014, appropriated as requested. FY2015 saw a request of $531.1 million, with the House and Senate providing the recommended amount. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) involves storage, dismantlement, and disposition of warheads. Funding for WDD varied over the years, with the House providing $24.3 million above the Administration request for FY2015. The House Appropriations Committee criticized NNSA for cutting funding for dismantlement despite requirements. The Senate recommended $40.0 million to help NNSA meet dismantlement targets and expressed concern about a potential workload gap in the mid-2020s. P.L. 113-235 provided $50.0 million and directed NNSA to report on options to avoid a dismantlement gap while meeting goals. Stockpile Services are crucial for production capability and capacity in the nuclear security enterprise. The FY2015 appropriation for Stockpile Services was $1,108.5 million, with increases for R&D for warhead certification and tritium production. The House provided $1,027.0 million, with a reduction in R&D funding. The NNSA is urged to establish dedicated funding for Significant Finding Investigations and stockpile issues, rather than funding technology maturation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,034.6 million, while P.L. 113-235 provided $1,034.5 million for multi-year, multi-functional efforts supporting nuclear weapons stockpile work. Science Campaign aims to improve warhead performance assessment without nuclear testing. The NNSA funds campaigns to assess warhead performance without nuclear testing, maintain scientific infrastructure, and support experimental facilities like the National Ignition Facility. The FY2014 and FY2015 requests included five campaigns under the renamed \"Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation.\" Funding increased in FY2015 to enhance LEP options, diagnostic capabilities, and technologies for future LEPs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended increased funds for experimental efforts to understand plutonium properties in support of pit reuse. The NNSA received $412.1 million, with $21.0 million designated for designing new radiography capabilities at U1a. This funding supports activities to assess and improve engineering components for nuclear and non-nuclear purposes. For FY2013, $127.7 million was appropriated for activities to assess and improve nuclear and non-nuclear engineering components without underground testing. The FY2014 request of $149.9 million was provided, and the FY2015 request was $136.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $144.6 million for enhanced surveillance of aging nuclear weapons, with P.L. 113-235 providing the requested amount. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign aims to create high temperatures and pressures in the lab for weapons-related research. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is a key component of the campaign to support weapons-related research and attract scientific talent to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. NIF, the world's largest laser, aims to achieve nuclear fusion ignition. Despite delays in achieving ignition, NIF has proven valuable for stockpile stewardship. Initially controversial in Congress, NIF was dedicated in May 2009. Funding for the campaign has varied, with appropriations of $446.7 million in FY2013, $401.0 million in FY2014, and $514.0 million in FY2014. The FY2015 request was $512.9 million, with adjustments made by the House and Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $4.5 million increase for the National Ignition Facility (NIF) campaign. NNSA was directed to provide an assessment on the likelihood of achieving ignition at NIF by December 2015. The Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons for testing weapon behavior and supports nonproliferation efforts. Some doubt the reliability of simulation for this purpose. The Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign receives funding for nuclear weapons testing and nonproliferation efforts. The FY2015 budget request was $610.1 million, with $598.0 million provided in P.L. 113-235. The increase in funding is for transitioning codes to high-performance computers and maintaining resources. The Senate recommended a $10.0 million increase, with $50.0 million allocated for the exascale initiative to enhance computing capabilities. The Readiness Campaign for tritium production received varying funding amounts in FY2013 and FY2014, with a shift in allocations for different subprograms. The FY2015 request focused on the Nonnuclear Readiness subprogram for developing manufacturing capabilities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended establishing an Advanced Manufacturing Campaign instead of funding the Readiness Campaign. The House Appropriations Committee recommended establishing an Advanced Manufacturing Campaign with $93.9 million for nuclear weapons production. The Senate proposed $70.0 million, but P.L. 113-235 allocated $107.2 million for Advanced Manufacturing Development. This program aims to reduce costs at NNSA production facilities using additive manufacturing. In FY2014, NNSA proposed transferring programs totaling $2,450.5 million. The appropriation provided $2,067.4 million for RTBF. For FY2015, the request was $2,055.5 million, with the House and Senate recommending $2,046.0 million and $2,077.5 million respectively. P.L. 113-235 allocated $2,033.4 million and directed NNSA to reduce deferred maintenance backlog and dispose of unneeded facilities. Within RTBF, $224.6 million was allocated for recapitalization activities. Operations of Facilities is the largest subprogram with FY2014 appropriation of $984.5 million and FY2015 request of $896.0 million. The Construction subprogram is the second largest, with FY2014 appropriation of $422.1 million and FY2015 request of $402.8 million. NNSA has encountered problems in building facilities to manufacture nuclear weapon components, specifically the \"pit\" using plutonium and the \"secondary\" using uranium. The Rocky Flats Plant manufactured pits on an industrial scale during the Cold War but production has significantly decreased since then. The NNSA has faced challenges in building facilities for manufacturing nuclear weapon components, particularly pits using plutonium. Projects like the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) have been delayed or canceled due to cost growth. The Nuclear Facility (NF) at Los Alamos National Laboratory was deferred and later canceled, but NNSA still needed to increase pit manufacturing capacity. For FY2015, NNSA proposed shifting tasks from CMR to RLUOB and PF-4 to increase pit manufacturing capacity. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $35.7 million for the CMRR project, with funds allocated under Construction for transparency. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended $35.7 million for CMRR. The Senate Appropriations Committee draft recommended $35.7 million for CMRR, with funds allocated for transferring activities from CMR to RLUOB and PF-4 to help NNSA exit CMR. NNSA has proposed reinforced-concrete \"modules\" for certain operations currently in PF-4, with a call for a thorough analysis of alternatives. The Building 9212 Complex at the Y-12 National Security Complex, built during World War II, is planned to be replaced by the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF), but recent cost projections exceed initial estimates. NNSA is exploring alternatives due to the high cost projection. The FY2015 request stated that NNSA is exploring alternatives to deliver Building 9212 capabilities for not more than $6.5 billion by 2025. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $335.0 million for UPF, with the Senate deeming the original UPF cost estimate as \"unaffordable\" and directing NNSA to provide a program requirements document and form an independent review team for progress assessment. P.L. 113-235 provided $335.0 million for UPF without restrictions. The Explanatory Statement did not include a restriction on use of funds for construction before achieving 90% design completion for UPF. Weapons Activities also has smaller programs like Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear weapons. The House Appropriations Committee reduced funding due to excessive prior-year balances and lack of detailed acquisition plans. The Senate Appropriations Committee draft recommended providing $219.0 million for detailed acquisition plans for certain vehicles. The Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response Program responds to and mitigates nuclear and radiological incidents worldwide. Congress rejected transferring the program to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and provided $228.2 million for FY2014. For FY2015, NNSA requested $173.4 million, and the House provided $202.9 million, including $25.0 million for emergency response-related R&D. The Administration requested no funds for the Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response Program R&D, but the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended providing the requested amount. P.L. 113-235 allocated $177.9 million, with $142.6 million for emergency response activities to support a new stabilization city. The Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation Program aims to understand and counter nuclear terrorism, conducting outreach to strengthen capabilities. NNSA requested $76.9 million for this program in FY2015 under Weapons Activities. The Site Stewardship program, requested $76.9 million in funding for Weapons Activities, was recommended no funding by the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee draft recommended $70.0 million, while P.L. 113-235 provided $46.1 million. The program focuses on environmental compliance, nuclear materials disposition, and developing skills for NNSA's technical workforce. The FY2014 appropriation was $87.3 million, FY2015 request was $82.4 million, with the House providing $79.5 million and P.L. 113-235 providing $76.5 million. The Defense Nuclear Security program, previously part of Safeguards and Security, received $76.5 million in funding from P.L. 113-235. It provides protection against various threats, including terrorism, for NNSA personnel, facilities, nuclear weapons, and information. In FY2014, it became a standalone program with an appropriation of $679.0 million. The FY2015 request was $618.1 million, with the House providing $650.1 million, $32.0 million above the request, due to underfunding concerns. The House Appropriations Committee expects NNSA to request appropriate funding levels in the future for the program's protection efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee draft recommended the requested amount of $636.1 million for protection of special nuclear materials at NNSA sites. Information Technology and Cybersecurity elements include cybersecurity, enterprise secure computing, and Federal Unclassified Information Technology. Legacy Contractor Pensions for UC-operated laboratories were also addressed. When Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories were privatized, UC employees' pensions were mirrored in the contracts with the new operators. NNSA paid into the pension plan for UC employees to make up the difference in pensions provided to employees hired after privatization. The FY2014 appropriation for this payment was $279.6 million, and the FY2015 request was $307.1 million, which was fully funded by P.L. 113-235. The House provided $96.0 million for the Domestic Uranium Enrichment program, with funds allocated to maintain centrifuges in warm standby. The Senate Appropriations Committee draft recommended $110.0 million for the program, directing the Department of Energy to use the funds accordingly. The Department of Energy was directed to use funds to maintain existing centrifuges and facilities for domestic enrichment capabilities. The Explanatory Statement also directed the evaluation of tritium stockpile requirements and prohibited the use of funds to build centrifuges for enriched uranium production in FY2015. The National Nuclear Security Administration administers nonproliferation and national security programs to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons globally. The Administration requested $1,555.2 million for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation programs, but Congress appropriated $1,641.4 million. After adjustments, the total appropriated amount was $1,616.4 million. The bill did not fund international material protection work in Russia and included reductions in nonproliferation programs. Both the House and Senate increased funding for these programs, with the House prohibiting new cooperative programs with Russia. The Senate recommended funding for nuclear security programs with Russia. The Senate subcommittee recommended an increase of $422.8 million above the request for NNSA's budget, expressing concern about the lack of priority on nonproliferation activities. The Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program was funded at $393.4 million for FY2015, with both House and Senate panels recommending an increase in nuclear detection technologies. The House report directed DOE to establish a lead office for national nuclear forensics, while the Senate subcommittee and final bill called for a joint study with DOD on the need for space sensors for atmospheric testing. $66.9 million was allocated for the National Center for Nuclear within these funds. The FY2015 budget includes $66.9 million for the National Center for Nuclear Security to develop advanced warhead monitoring technologies and improve nuclear test detection capabilities. Nonproliferation and International Security programs focus on international safeguards, export controls, and treaties. The House increased funding for technical review of export licenses, but the final appropriation remained at $141.4 million. International Materials Protection and Cooperation works with partner countries to secure nuclear warheads and materials. The International Materials Protection and Cooperation program, which collaborates with partner countries to secure nuclear warheads and materials, saw a decrease in funding to $270.9 million in FY2015. This reduction reflects a shift towards sustainability with Russia, leading to decreased security costs transitioned to the Russian side. The Second Line of Defense program, focusing on border and port detection, also experienced a funding decrease to $117.7 million in FY2015 from $190.0 million in FY2014. The decrease in funding for the International Materials Protection and Cooperation program in FY2015 was attributed to a one-time increase in FY2014 and adjustments made to fund higher NNSA priorities. The House Appropriations Committee excluded funding for IMPC activities in Russia, resulting in a $72.1 million lower appropriation. The Senate subcommittee funded the program $50 million over the request, including $150 million for Second Line of Defense. The final bill did not include $66.9 million for IMPC projects in Russia and prohibited funding for the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System in Russia. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. The Fissile Materials Disposition program in the U.S. faced controversy over the pit disassembly project, leading to a decrease in funding. The FY2012 request was $892.2 million, but only $685.4 million was appropriated, with no funding for the PDCF project. The FY2013 request was $921.3 million, with no funding sought for the PDCF as existing facilities would be used for pit disassembly. The waste solidification facility was completed with no further funding needed. The FY2013 MOX appropriation was $401.0 million out of a total FMD appropriation of $631.6 million. The estimated total cost for the MOX facility increased from $4.8 billion to $7.7 billion, leading to a decision to slow down completion and evaluate alternatives for plutonium disposition. NNSA requested $502.6 million for FMD programs in FY2014, including $320 million for the MOX plant. The House bill would have appropriated the requested amount. The House Appropriations Committee report stated no additional funding would be provided for alternatives to the MOX plant. The Senate Appropriations Committee funded the facility at $430.6 million and total FMD programs at $669.2 million. The final appropriations bill provided $343.5 million for MOX construction and a total of $526.1 million for the FMD program. The FY2015 budget request continued the policy of maintaining the MOX project in cold stand-by while analyzing options for plutonium disposition more efficiently. The FY2015 request for the total FMD program was $311.1 million. The House and Senate provided funding for the MOX fabrication facility, with the House allocating $430 million and the Senate recommending $515.1 million. The Senate directed NNSA to assess alternatives for plutonium disposition within 120 days. The final bill required NNSA to submit a verified cost estimate for completing and operating the MOX facility. The FY2015 appropriation included $345 million for the Savannah River MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility, with the option to complete construction and operate the facility. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative received $325.8 million in FY2015, a decrease from the previous year due to program success in removing excess nuclear materials. The House approved funding for the program at $9.4 million above the request. The House approved funding at $9.4 million above the request for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative in FY2015. The Senate subcommittee recommended additional funding for various nuclear and radiological material removal efforts, including developing a Molybdenum-99 isotope for nuclear medicine. The final FY2015 appropriation did not provide $25.4 million sought for GTRI projects in Russia. It specified that $67.9 million within the GTRI account should be used to secure all buildings in the United States with Category 1 source materials by 2016. The development and production of nuclear weapons for national defense purposes during half a century since the beginning of the Manhattan Project resulted in a legacy of wastes and contamination that continues to present substantial challenges today. In 1989, DOE established the Office of Environmental Management primarily to consolidate its responsibilities for the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production sites that had been administered under multiple offices. These cleanup efforts are broad in scope and include the disposal of large quantities of radioactive and other hazardous wastes generated over decades; management and disposal of surplus nuclear materials; remediation of extensive contamination in soil and groundwater; decontamination and decommissioning of excess buildings and facilities; and safeguarding, securing, and maintaining facilities while cleanup is underway. The Office of Environmental Management is responsible for cleaning up DOE sites involved in nuclear energy research, in addition to nuclear weapons production sites. This cleanup represents the largest environmental liability in the US, requiring billions of dollars annually. Congress is concerned about the long-term financial liability for addressing risks at these sites. The Department of Energy (DOE) has identified over 100 sites in 30 states involved in nuclear weapons and energy research. Cleanup remedies are in place at most sites, with long-term stewardship transferred to the Office of Legacy Management. The Department of Energy has identified over 100 sites in 30 states involved in nuclear weapons and energy research. Cleanup of these sites is ongoing, with some transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers for remediation under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. Once cleaned up, sites are transferred back to DOE for long-term stewardship. The Office of Environmental Management continues to oversee the cleanup of remaining sites, with billions of dollars needed to fulfill the cleanup liability of the United States. The Department of Energy is overseeing the cleanup of 91 sites in 30 states and Puerto Rico, with an estimated cost of $180.9 billion to $219.0 billion. The Hanford site in Washington has the longest cleanup timeline, set for completion in 2070. Challenges include managing radioactive waste stored in tanks at Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. DOE's cost estimates have varied over the years by billions of dollars. DOE estimates cleanup costs for 91 sites, with wide variations over the years. Costs are uncertain due to decisions pending at some sites and methods for waste disposal. Long-term stewardship costs are not included in estimates, adding further uncertainty. Appropriations for FY2015 for environmental management and legacy management offices are discussed. The Office of Environmental Management and Office of Legacy Management are funded through three appropriations accounts. The Defense Environmental Cleanup account is the largest and finances cleanup of former nuclear weapons production sites. The Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup account funds cleanup of federal nuclear energy research sites. The Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund was established to pay for cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities. The federal uranium enrichment facilities near Paducah, KY; Piketon, OH (Portsmouth plant); and Oak Ridge, TN received a total of $5.87 billion in funding for the Office of Environmental Management in FY2015. Various funding issues for the Office of Environmental Management were debated in the FY2015 appropriations, with proposed funding levels ranging from $5.63 billion to $5.94 billion. The adequacy of funding for cleanup milestones across the entire site was also discussed. The Office of Environmental Management faces challenges in meeting cleanup milestones across its site inventory. These milestones are enforceable measures set in compliance agreements with DOE, EPA, and states, establishing time frames for specific actions. DOE anticipated sufficient funds in FY2015 to meet cleanup milestones, but negotiations with regulators may be necessary. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about DOE's ability to fulfill cleanup commitments. The Senate subcommittee expressed concern about DOE's ability to attain cleanup milestones, especially at the Hanford site, due to anticipated funding constraints. While overall funding increased in FY2015, some sites received less than requested, including the Savannah River Site and NNSA sites. Adequacy of funding for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) reopening was a significant issue. The funding for re-opening the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, a repository for defense-related transuranic wastes, was a key issue in the FY2015 appropriations debate. Incidents in 2014 led to the temporary closure of WIPP, but a recovery plan was issued to resume operations by early 2016 with a $320 million appropriation. In 2016, $320 million was appropriated for the Defense Environmental Cleanup account for WIPP, a $104 million increase from FY2014. The increase aimed to support the WIPP recovery effort, with a directive for separate accounting in the President's FY2016 budget request. Initially, the President's FY2015 budget request did not include funds for the recovery effort due to the facility closure incidents. The House Appropriations Committee transferred $120 million from the National Nuclear Security Administration to the Defense Environmental Cleanup account for WIPP recovery efforts. The House bill would have provided up to $356 million for WIPP in FY2015. The Senate subcommittee also commented on the closure of WIPP and DOE's efforts to reopen it. The Senate subcommittee expressed concerns about the closure of WIPP and urged DOE to submit a detailed remediation plan for funding allocation. The Senate subcommittee bill proposed $318 million for WIPP recovery efforts in FY2015. The adequacy of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup of federal facilities was also debated in the FY2015 appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $3.0 billion available for appropriation from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2015. $625 million was appropriated for cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities near Paducah, KY; Piketon, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. This amount was higher than the Senate subcommittee recommendation, House-passed amount, President's FY2015 budget request, and FY2014 enacted appropriations. The FY2015 enacted appropriations allocated $10 million for uranium/thorium licensees' contamination cleanup costs, lower than the House's proposed $20 million. Both the House and Senate directed DOE to ensure sufficient funding for approved claims in future budget requests. The FY2015 appropriations included $463 million for the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, transferred from the Defense Environmental Cleanup account. This payment had been ceased in FY2012 and was historically treated as an offset to the Office of Environmental Management funding. The Explanatory Statement noted that the federal payment would resume in FY2015, but no authority was provided to resume collections. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund would resume in FY2015, with no authority provided to collect assessments from nuclear utilities. The Senate subcommittee bill proposed reauthorizing up to $200 million in assessments on nuclear utilities to generate additional revenues for the Fund, while the House bill did not include this provision. The authority to collect assessments expired in October 2007, and both federal payments and nuclear utility assessments originally financed the Fund based on the premise that both benefited from services provided by federal uranium enrichment facilities. The Obama Administration has noted a need for additional revenues to cover cleanup costs at federal uranium enrichment facilities. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is projected to be depleted by FY2020, leaving a $11.8 billion shortfall for cleanup. DOE would still be responsible for the costs if the fund runs out, pending Congressional appropriations. The Senate subcommittee directed DOE to update its report on the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund as per the Atomic Energy Act. The report should include cleanup milestones, costs, and assumptions for DOE's responsibility for process buildings at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. FY2015 appropriations for DOE Office of Environmental Management are presented in Table 15 of the report. The FY2015 appropriations for the DOE Office of Environmental Management, as outlined in P.L. 113-235, H.R. 4923, and the Senate subcommittee bill, are compared to previous budget requests and appropriations. The Hanford site, Idaho National Laboratory, and Savannah River Site receive the largest portions of funding. The table includes details on major site and program activities, net total funding, and offsets such as unobligated balances and federal payments to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term stewardship of sites with remaining contamination or waste, including those transferred from DOE to the Army Corps of Engineers. It also manages pensions and retirement benefits for former employees. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term stewardship of sites with remaining contamination or waste, including managing pensions and retirement benefits for former contractor personnel who worked at DOE sites. The federal role in managing these pensions and benefits is due to the long-term nature of projects and length of employment. The Office of Legacy Management has been funded within DOE's Other Defense Activities account since FY2009, with an appropriation of $172 million for FY2015. The FY2015 appropriation for the Office of Legacy Management is $5 million less than the previous year, totaling $172 million. The reduction is attributed to savings in pension and benefits costs. The office aims to lower long-term stewardship costs by 2% annually through cost-efficiencies while complying with regulatory requirements. Funding needs may increase as cleanup is completed at more sites, with the office responsible for 96 sites in FY2015, projected to increase to 129 by FY2020. Estimating long-term funding needs is challenging. The Office of Legacy Management faces challenges in estimating long-term funding needs due to the lengthy time horizons involved in cleanup and stewardship of contaminated sites, especially those with radioactive waste. Factors such as monitoring contaminant levels, enforcing land use restrictions, and decay of radioactive elements make it difficult to reliably estimate the financial liability for long-term stewardship. The Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power generated by dams for various purposes like irrigation and flood control. Priority for power is given to preference customers such as municipal utilities and cooperatives at the lowest possible rates. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) sell power generated by dams to entities like municipal utilities and cooperatives at low rates. The PMAs cover expenses, repay debt, and receive federal investment. The FY2015 budget request for PMAs was $82 million, slightly lower than FY2014. Receipts from PMAs were reclassified from mandatory to discretionary in FY2010, offsetting expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA and WAPA requested discretionary funding, while SEPA's receipts cover operating costs. Additionally, $228,000 is requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance. In FY2015, $228,000 is requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance. The House and Senate agreed with the Administration's funding levels for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs). BPA is a self-funded agency under the Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act of 1974 and receives no appropriations, funding some activities through borrowing authority. The borrowing authority was increased in FY2003 and further increased by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) increased the borrowing authority of the Transmission System Act by $3.25 billion to a total of $7.7 billion in bonds outstanding to the Treasury. This allowed the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) to borrow from the U.S. Treasury for planning, financing, or building new electric power transmission lines for renewable energy resources. Other independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.0595 billion for FY2015. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.0595 billion for FY2015. The total funding request is $3.6 million above the FY2014 level but would constitute a net reduction of $1.0 million due to higher offsetting fees. The House approved a total funding increase of $5 million for NRC, while the Senate subcommittee recommended the same amount as the Administration request. The consolidated appropriations act reduced NRC's total spending level by $44.2 million from the request, based on carryover funds and lower staffing levels. The NRC budget request for FY2015 included $237.9 million for new reactor activities, $16.5 million above the FY2014 level. Electric utilities and generating companies applied for licenses for 30 new reactors due to volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. NRC issued licenses for four new reactors in Georgia and South Carolina in 2012, with nine more license applications under review. The NRC's FY2015 budget did not include funds for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository due to the Obama Administration's decision to cancel the project. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered NRC to continue reviewing the license application using leftover funding. The House provided $55.0 million for adjudicating the application, but no funding was included in the enacted appropriation. NRC's FY2015 budget request included $577.3 million for regulating operating reactors. The NRC's FY2015 budget request of $577.3 million for regulating operating reactors included activities such as safety inspections, license renewals, reactor performance data analysis, and security oversight. Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, NRC established a task force to review its regulatory system and issued regulatory orders in response. Concerns were raised about NRC's regulation of nuclear materials vulnerable to theft for potential terrorist use. The subcommittee's draft bill proposed mandatory security standards for radioactive materials vulnerable to theft for potential terrorist use. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended a requirement for NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, excluding certain expenditures. The FY2015 budget request offsets would have resulted in a net appropriation of $124.2 million, but the final bill allocated $119.8 million."
