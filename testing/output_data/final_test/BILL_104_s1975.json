    "content": "The Act titled \"Precision Agriculture Research, Education, and Information Dissemination Act of 1996\" emphasizes competitive grants for promoting precision agriculture. The Precision Agriculture Research, Education, and Information Dissemination Act of 1996 focuses on competitive grants to promote precision agriculture. Subsection (k) of the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act is amended to emphasize Precision Agriculture, including definitions for terms like 'advisory board' and 'agricultural inputs'. Precision agriculture refers to an integrated farming system aimed at increasing production efficiencies and profitability while minimizing environmental impacts. It involves combining agricultural sciences, inputs, databases, and precision techniques. Precision agriculture involves efficiently managing agronomic systems by gathering on-farm information on site-specific factors affecting crop production, integrating data from remote sensing and precision agriculture technologies, and using this information to prescribe site-specific agricultural inputs and management practices. Precision agriculture technologies encompass a range of instrumentation and techniques for measuring, recording, and managing spatial and temporal data, as well as technologies for decision-making and data networking and processing. Precision agriculture technologies involve networking and processing to create valuable systems for farm management decision-making. This includes high bandwidth networks, distributed processing, spatial databasing, object technology, global positioning systems, data modeling, high-performance image processing, satellite imagery, digital orthophotogrammetry simulation, geographic information systems, computer-aided design, and digital cartography. Additionally, machines are used to deliver information-based management practices, such as global positioning satellites, digital field mapping, on-the-go yield monitoring, and automated pest control. Systems research in precision agriculture involves an integrated investigative process that considers multiple components and aspects, including physical-chemical-biological processes, technology development, data collection, and production planning. The Secretary of Agriculture, in collaboration with the advisory board, ensures that research, education, and information dissemination grants support precision agriculture development. Projects focus on components of precision agriculture technologies and systems. Precision agriculture technologies aim to increase production efficiencies, productivity, and profitability through systems research. This includes improving understanding of agronomic systems and promoting the integration of multiple aspects of precision agriculture. The curr_chunk discusses the education of agricultural producers and consumers on the benefits of precision agriculture for increased farm production efficiencies, productivity, profitability, and environmental sustainability. It also emphasizes training programs for various professionals involved in agricultural production. The curr_chunk focuses on priorities for research, education, and information dissemination grants related to precision agriculture technology. It emphasizes the use of precision agriculture technologies to increase production efficiencies, productivity, and profitability on farms. The curr_chunk emphasizes the promotion of efficient use of agricultural inputs and maximizing involvement of various stakeholders in precision agriculture research projects. It also highlights the cooperation among farms managed in precision agriculture systems. The curr_chunk discusses the cooperation among various stakeholders in precision agriculture, emphasizing benefits such as global food production, reducing world hunger, and maintaining the environment. The curr_chunk focuses on the reservation of funds for education and information dissemination projects related to precision agriculture. It highlights the importance of collaboration with multiple agencies and partners to leverage resources effectively. The Secretary ensures information dissemination for precision agriculture projects supported by grants, emphasizing compliance with specified priorities. Partnerships between land-grant colleges, universities, and agricultural stations are encouraged. The entities involved in precision agriculture projects include State Agricultural Experiment Stations, cooperative extension services, colleges, universities, Department of Agriculture agencies, national laboratories, agribusinesses, equipment manufacturers, crop advisers, commodity organizations, government entities, and non-agricultural industries with expertise in precision agriculture. The partnership between national laboratories and the Department of Agriculture aims to promote cooperation in research, technology development, and technology commercialization. The private-sector commercialization of technology includes partnerships eligible for conducting research on precision agriculture and technologies. Research grants for precision agriculture projects require studying diverse production systems and farms using precision agriculture practices. The curr_chunk discusses the use of precision agriculture practices and technologies to increase farm production efficiency and profitability. It includes conducting demonstration projects on farms, involving agricultural producers in projects, transferring information using advanced technologies, and promoting partnerships among producers. The curr_chunk discusses reporting requirements for grant recipients under the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act. Recipients are required to submit periodic reports regarding their research activities. Grant recipients must submit periodic reports on their research, education, and information dissemination activities to enhance the monitoring and evaluation system developed by the Secretary under the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977. Eligible entities for grants include federal agencies, laboratories, corporations, and agricultural input machinery, product, and service providers. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 is amended to include the development and promotion of precision agriculture technologies using a systems research approach. Eligible grant recipients include federal agencies, laboratories, corporations, and agricultural input machinery, product, and service providers. The Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act (section 2 of Public Law 89-106; 7 U.S.C. 450i) is amended to change subsection (b)(9)(A) by replacing \"subsection (j)\" with \"subsection (k)\"."
