    "content": "The \"Plan Colombia Trade Act\" is the short title of the Act. It provides temporary extension of additional trade benefits to certain Andean countries. The Andean Trade Preference Act is amended to include exceptions to duty-free treatment for textile and apparel articles, footwear, tuna in airtight containers, and petroleum products. The Andean Trade Preference Act is amended to include exceptions to duty-free treatment for textile and apparel articles, footwear, tuna in airtight containers, and petroleum products such as watches, sugars, rum, and tafia. During the transition period, preferential treatment applies to apparel articles assembled in beneficiary countries from fabrics and yarns made in the United States, entered under specific subheadings of the HTS. During the transition period, preferential treatment applies to apparel articles assembled in beneficiary countries from fabrics and yarns made in the United States, entered under specific subheadings of the HTS. Apparel articles cut and assembled in beneficiary countries may qualify for entry under subheading 9802.00.80 of the HTS, except if they undergo certain processes like embroidery or washing. During the transition period, apparel articles assembled in beneficiary countries from fabrics and yarns made in the United States may qualify for preferential treatment. Articles assembled in one or more such countries with thread formed in the United States are eligible. An exception allows articles with findings or trimmings of foreign origin, as long as they do not exceed 25 percent of the component cost. Findings and trimmings, such as sewing thread, hooks, snaps, buttons, lace, elastic strips, zippers, and labels, are considered part of the assembled product if they are less than 1 inch wide and used in brassiere production. Certain interlinings of foreign origin, including a chest type plate, are eligible for preferential treatment under specific conditions, as long as their value does not exceed 25 percent of the cost of the assembled article's components. Certain interlinings of foreign origin, such as chest type plates, may be eligible for preferential treatment if they are made of coarse animal hair or man-made filaments. This treatment can be terminated if US manufacturers start producing these interlinings in commercial quantities. An apparel article containing fibers or yarns not wholly formed in the US or beneficiary countries may still be eligible for preferential treatment if the total weight of these fibers or yarns is not more than 7 percent of the total weight of the good. Apparel articles with elastomeric yarns can only receive preferential treatment if the yarns are wholly formed in eligible countries. An article eligible for preferential treatment under certain clauses will not lose eligibility if it contains nylon filament yarn classified under specific subheadings of the HTS. An article eligible for preferential treatment under specific clauses can be duty-free if it is from a country in a free trade agreement with the US. Fabrics not formed from yarns can also qualify for preferential treatment. Beneficiary countries can receive preferential treatment for fabrics not formed from yarns if they are wholly formed and cut in the United States. Articles assembled in beneficiary countries from such fabrics can still be eligible for preferential treatment under specific clauses. During the transition period, articles classifiable under specific headings in the HTS and wholly formed in the United States can enter duty-free and without restrictions. The transition period begins on the date of enactment of the Plan Colombia Trade Act or October 1, 2000, and ends when duty-free treatment ends under this title. Factors affecting designation are also considered. The Andean Trade Preference Act is amended to include the adherence to democratic principles and the rule of law as a factor affecting designation. These amendments take effect on either October 1, 2000, or the date of enactment of the Plan Colombia Trade Act."
