    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Care for Working Families Act\". Congress acknowledges that the lack of health insurance in the United States is a growing issue, with over 40 million Americans without coverage. This has led to poor access to healthcare, delayed treatment, and unnecessary deaths, particularly affecting workers and their dependents. Despite laws ensuring fair treatment in the workplace, the fundamental right to healthcare is not guaranteed for all citizens in the US. Large employers should contribute to retirement security and provide health insurance coverage to their employees and dependents. Those who do not offer coverage should take on this social responsibility. Title II of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 introduces health benefits for employees and their families, requiring large employers to provide health insurance coverage. Each large employer must offer employees the opportunity to enroll in a qualifying health benefit plan that covers the employee and their family. The plan must provide benefits equivalent to or greater than those offered under the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Plan as of January 1, 2002. Each large employer is required to contribute to the cost of a qualifying health benefit plan for its employees and withhold the employee's share of the premium. The employer's contribution must be at least 75% of the total premium, except for part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. Large employers must contribute to a qualifying health benefit plan for employees, with a minimum contribution of 75% of the total premium. For part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week, the employer's contribution is based on the ratio of hours worked to 30 hours. No contribution is required for employers with workers who work less than 10 hours per week. The provisions apply only to large employers, defined as those with at least 100 full-time employees. Large employers are defined as those with at least 100 full-time employees and must contribute to a qualifying health benefit plan for employees. An exception applies if the majority of services are performed on behalf of a single large employer. Contract, temporary, and leased workers are considered employees of the employer, except for temporary workers provided by a temporary employment firm. A temporary employment firm is not required to be covered by a large employer if the firm provides coverage meeting the standards of this title to the worker. SEC. 202. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO TIMING OF COVERAGE AND WITHHOLDING. Coverage under a qualifying health benefit plan from a large employer must start within 30 days of the employee's first hour of service. Employers can withhold premiums from employee payroll. SEC. 203. ENFORCEMENT. SEC. 203. ENFORCEMENT. Civil money penalties and injunctive relief apply to large employers not complying with this title. SEC. 204. PREEMPTION. SEC. 204. PREEMPTION. States can establish standards for employer health insurance unless they conflict with this title. SEC. 205. DEFINITION AND EFFECTIVE DATE. Defines 'family' and 'family member' for employee coverage and sets the effective date for employers. Conforming Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is amended to replace \"this Act\" with \"this title\" and include violations of title II. The Public Health Service Act is amended to require health insurance coverage. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 requires health insurance issuers to provide coverage that complies with the Act's requirements for employees."
