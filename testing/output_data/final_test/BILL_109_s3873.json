The \"Private Property Rights Protection Act of 2006\" states that if a State or political subdivision violates the prohibition on using eminent domain for economic development, they will be ineligible for federal economic development funds for 2 years. If a violation occurs, the State or political subdivision must return the property taken, replace any destroyed property, and repair any damaged property to remain eligible for federal funds. The Federal Government is prohibited from using eminent domain for economic development. Additionally, individuals have a private right of action. Any property owner can bring a lawsuit in Federal or State court for violations of the Act, with the burden on the defendant to prove the taking is not for economic development.

Congress recognizes the importance of property rights, especially in rural areas, for the agriculture industry and economic growth. Rural lands are unique and require long-term certainty for investment decisions. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of New London, abuse of eminent domain threatens property rights of private property owners, including rural land owners. Congress believes that using eminent domain for economic development poses a threat to agricultural and rural property in America, impacting liberty and the economy. The abuse of eminent domain poses a threat to property rights of rural land owners, impacting farmland and rural property. Congress must protect rural Americans from having their land taken for private commercial uses, which can overburden public lands and reduce enjoyment for all citizens. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the definition of \"economic development\" involves taking private property without the owner's consent and transferring it to another private entity for commercial purposes or to enhance tax revenue, employment, or economic health. This excludes transferring property to public ownership or entities that provide public access like roads or railroads. The curr_chunk involves the use of public property for various purposes such as transportation, flood control, leasing to private entities, acquiring abandoned property, and clearing defective chains of title. The curr_chunk defines \"Federal economic development funds\" as Federal funds distributed to improve State economies. The term \"State\" includes States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories. SEC. 9. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE. The provisions of this Act are severable. If any provision is found unconstitutional, it will not affect other parts of the Act. The Act will take effect on the first day of the first fiscal year after enactment, excluding projects with prior condemnation proceedings. SEC. 10. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The U.S. policy is to support private property ownership and protect property owners' rights. SEC. 11. BROAD CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 11. BROAD CONSTRUCTION. This Act is to be interpreted broadly to protect private property rights as much as allowed by the Act and the Constitution. SEC. 12. LIMITATION ON STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION. The Act does not override any provisions of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970. SEC. 13. RELIGIOUS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. No State or political subdivision can use eminent domain over property of a religious or nonprofit organization due to its tax-exempt status. Violation results in ineligibility for Federal economic development funds for 2 years. The Federal Government cannot use eminent domain over property of a religious or nonprofit organization based on its tax-exempt status.
