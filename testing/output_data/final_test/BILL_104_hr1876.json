    "content": "The Landmine Use Moratorium Act of 1995 may be cited as the official title. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Landmine Use Moratorium Act of 1995, also known as the official title, highlights key findings regarding the global issue of antipersonnel landmines. These findings include the goal set by the President to eliminate landmines, international efforts supported by the United Nations, the alarming number of unexploded landmines worldwide, the devastating impact on civilian populations, and the urgent need for action as stated by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has highlighted that landmines are often referred to as \"slow-motion weapons of mass destruction\" due to their devastating impact. There are numerous types of antipersonnel landmines, ranging from simple to self-destructing varieties, all of which cannot differentiate between civilians and combatants. The text chunk discusses the review of the Conventional Weapons Convention. The President will actively support proposals to modify Protocol II to the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention at the 1995 review conference to eventually eliminate antipersonnel landmines. The 1995 review conference is an international event sponsored by the United Nations to review the Convention and Protocol II related to landmines. The 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention prohibits or restricts the use of certain weapons deemed excessively injurious. The 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention, along with protocols, addresses weapons considered excessively injurious or having indiscriminate effects. SEC. 4. MORATORIUM ON USE OF ANTIPERSONNEL LANDMINES. During a one-year period, the United States Government will not use antipersonnel landmines, except along internationally recognized national borders in monitored and protected areas. The President may extend the moratorium if other nations implement similar measures. The President will also encourage other nations to join in solving the issue. The United States urges other nations to implement moratoriums on antipersonnel landmines to address the global crisis, with the goal of eventual elimination. SEC. 5 prohibits the US Government from selling defense articles or services to foreign governments that sell antipersonnel landmines. The President can waive this prohibition in case of an emergency. SEC. 6 of the Act defines \"antipersonnel landmine\" as a munition placed on or near the ground, delivered by various means, and designed to detonate upon contact with a person."
