Congress acknowledges the growing threat of identity theft in the digital age, with millions of Americans falling victim each year, costing the industry billions of dollars. Despite increased awareness, the number of incidents continues to rise, as highlighted by a major case in 2002 involving the sale of personal information of 30,000 individuals. Identity theft is on the rise, with a significant increase in identity theft calls and social security number fraud allegations. Consumer requests for fraud alerts also saw a notable increase. This crime violates privacy, damages reputations, and can lead to financial and employment challenges for victims.
