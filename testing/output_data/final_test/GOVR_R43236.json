    "content": "This report provides a status update on FY2014 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED). The bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to federal departments and related agencies, with discretionary funds representing less than one-quarter of the total funds. The L-HHS-ED bill is typically the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations in the L-HHS-ED bill, which is controversial due to its funding size and program scope. It addresses policy issues like restrictions on federal funds for abortion and research on human embryos. Contact Key Policy Staff for more information on specific agencies and programs funded in the bill. The report provides an overview of major congressional actions on FY2014 appropriations for the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and Related Agencies. It compares proposed and enacted mandatory and discretionary appropriations for FY2014 to FY2013 funding levels. The report focuses on FY2014 appropriations for Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies. It includes details on budget enforcement activities, the Budget Control Act of 2011, sequestration in FY2013 and FY2014, and other budget enforcement issues. The report excludes funding for accounts under other subcommittees' jurisdiction. The L-HHS-ED bill provides appropriations for federal departments and agencies including Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies. Funding totals in the report do not include amounts provided outside the regular appropriations process. The L-HHS-ED bill includes discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Mandatory programs funded through the annual appropriations process are referred to as appropriated entitlements, with little control by appropriators over the amounts provided. The authorizing statute establishes program parameters for entitlements, entitling certain recipients to payments. If Congress does not appropriate necessary funds, entitled recipients may have legal recourse. Most mandatory spending is provided through direct spending budget authority in the program's authorizing statute. The funding amounts in this report only include funds provided through appropriations bills, not direct spending budget authority. Mandatory amounts for the FY2014 President's request reflect current law. The FY2014 President's request for mandatory amounts reflects current law estimates from S.Rept. 113-71, excluding proposed changes to program statutes. The report focuses on discretionary funding, which receives more attention during the appropriations process. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows agencies to spend. Appropriations bills may include budget authority for the current or future fiscal years. The report focuses on discretionary funding and appropriations bills may include budget authority for the current or future fiscal years, with amounts becoming available in future fiscal years referred to as advance appropriations. Appropriations levels in the report refer to total budget authority provided in an appropriations bill, regardless of the year in which funding becomes available. The report also breaks out current year appropriations, which are the amount of budget authority available for obligation in a given fiscal year. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) on January 17, 2014, providing $164 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED, which is 4% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level and 3% less than the FY2014 President's Budget request. The FY2014 omnibus bill provided $164 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED, which was 4% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level and 3% less than the FY2014 President's Budget request. Additionally, the omnibus included $612 billion in mandatory funding for a total of $776 billion for L-HHS-ED. There were two government-wide continuing resolutions before the omnibus was enacted, leading to a funding gap and government shutdown until a short-term CR was passed. The government shutdown in 2013 resulted in a funding gap until a short-term CR was enacted on October 17, 2013. The CR provided government-wide funding through January 15, 2014, maintaining temporary funding until the omnibus bill was signed on January 17, 2014. Action on appropriations during the shutdown was limited to narrow CRs for specific programs. During the 2013 government shutdown, funding for National Institutes of Health, Impact Aid, and Head Start was not provided. Federal agencies implemented contingency plans for staffing and operations. A bill was proposed for full-year FY2014 L-HHS-ED appropriations, with $171 billion in discretionary funding, 9% more than FY2013 post-sequester levels. The Senate committee bill proposed nearly $783 billion in total funding for L-HHS-ED, including $613 billion in mandatory funding. The House did not act on a stand-alone FY2014 L-HHS-ED appropriations bill. President Obama's FY2014 budget requested $170 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED, an increase of 8% from FY2013. Additionally, the budget requested roughly $612 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding, totaling around $782 billion for L-HHS-ED. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 into law on March 26, 2013. The full-year CR for FY2013 funded discretionary L-HHS-ED programs at FY2012 levels with a 0.2% across-the-board rescission, totaling roughly $757 billion in funding. This was lower than the earlier six-month CR for FY2013, which included a 0.612% increase in funding. The FY2013 estimates for discretionary L-HHS-ED programs were based on data in the committee report accompanying the FY2014 Senate committee bill. Operating levels were broken out separately from pre-sequester amounts provided by the full-year FY2013 CR. Operating plans took into account amounts provided in the FY2013 full-year CR, reductions required by the FY2013 sequester, and transfers of funds. In FY2013, L-HHS-ED programs received $827 million in supplemental funding for disaster relief, primarily directed to HHS. FY2013 totals in the report do not include these funds. FY2014 discretionary and mandatory funding levels are compared to FY2013 levels in Table 2. Total budget authority is reflected in the table. HHS received 80% of total L-HHS-ED appropriations in FY2013 and FY2014, mainly due to mandatory funds for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds. Department of Education and Related Agencies received about 9% each in both years. ED appropriations are mostly discretionary. In FY2013 and FY2014, the Department of Labor and Related Agencies received a small share of total L-HHS-ED funds, with HHS receiving the majority of appropriations due to mandatory funds for Medicaid grants. Discretionary funding for ED accounted for a larger share compared to HHS, making up 41% of total appropriations. In FY2013 and FY2014, agencies combined to account for a roughly even split of the remaining 16% of discretionary L-HHS-ED funds. The Department of Labor (DOL) is a federal department comprised of multiple entities that provide services related to employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. Annual appropriations laws direct funding to all DOL entities, which primarily fall into two main functional areas - workforce development and worker protection. The Department of Labor (DOL) administers workforce development and worker protection programs. DOL entities provide funding for employment and training programs, including the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and Job Corps. They also oversee worker protection services through agencies like OSHA and MSHA to ensure worker safety. The Department of Labor (DOL) focuses on worker protection and workforce development programs. The FY2014 omnibus provided $14.18 billion in funding for DOL, with $12.04 billion being discretionary. This funding level was higher than the post-sequester FY2013 level but lower than the FY2014 request. The DOL's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects data on the labor market and related issues. The FY2014 omnibus provided $4.8 billion for programs authorized under Title I of the Workforce Investment Act, which is $202 million more than FY2013 funding levels. The law also increased the Governors' reserve of WIA state formula grants to 8.75% from 5%. The FY2014 omnibus increased the Governors' reserve of WIA state formula grants to 8.75% and provided $434 million for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program. The law also specified funding levels for activities within the Veterans' Employment and Training Service. The FY2014 omnibus increased funding for various programs, including the Governors' reserve of WIA state formula grants and the Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program. It also specified funding levels for activities within the Veterans' Employment and Training Service, allowing for reallocation of funds within VETS up to 3% of the appropriation. The law emphasized the importance of data collection under the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience and encouraged BLS to include contingent work and alternative work arrangements in the Current Population Survey. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a federal department with multiple agencies working to enhance Americans' health and well-being. The L-HHS-ED appropriations laws direct funding to most HHS agencies, including five Public Health Service agencies: HRSA, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and AHRQ, which support various missions related to healthcare services, quality, research, and disease prevention. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for various HHS agencies, including CMS, ACF, and ACL, which focus on healthcare administration, social services, and community supports for vulnerable populations. ACL, established in 2012, aims to increase access to services for older Americans and people with disabilities. The FY2014 omnibus bill provides funding for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), combining several agencies into one. The total funding is approximately $621 billion, with $70 billion being discretionary. This represents a slight increase from the previous year's funding levels. The FY2014 President's Budget requested a significant amount of funding for HHS, with the majority going to CMS for Medicaid benefits and health care trust funds. CMS accounted for 87% of all HHS appropriations in FY2013 and FY2014, while NIH and ACF received 5% each. In terms of discretionary funding, CMS only constituted 6%, with PHS agencies receiving over 60%. NIH typically receives the largest share of discretionary funding among HHS agencies. The FY2014 HHS budget allocated funding to various agencies, with ACF receiving the second-largest share of discretionary appropriations. The section discusses special funding mechanisms in the public health budget and highlights key FY2014 discretionary funding across HHS. It also outlines provisions in annual HHS appropriations laws that restrict spending in controversial areas like abortion and stem cell research. The PHS Evaluation Tap, authorized by Section 241 of the PHS Act, allows the Secretary of HHS to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations for program evaluation. The tap provides funding beyond regular appropriations to over a dozen HHS programs, with a set-aside limit of 1% of eligible program appropriations. In recent years, laws have set a higher maximum percentage for the set-aside, with the FY2014 omnibus maintaining it at 2.5%. The FY2014 omnibus maintained the set-aside limit for the PHS Evaluation Tap at 2.5% of eligible appropriations. The ACA authorized funding for the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) to support public health programs, with $1.5 billion appropriated for FY2014. However, subsequent legislation reduced the PPHF appropriation to $1 billion for that year. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) received a reduced appropriation of $1 billion for FY2014. PPHF funds supplement program funding and support new programs authorized in the ACA. The Secretary can allocate funds to specific accounts, with most funds typically going to CDC for programs like Immunization and Respiratory Diseases and Chronic Disease Prevention. The FY2014 omnibus bill provided $6.1 billion in discretionary funding for HRSA, with increases affecting most programs. Health Professions programs saw the largest proportional increase. The omnibus also transferred administration of the HEAL program from HRSA to the Department of Education, rejecting several President's Budget proposals. The FY2014 omnibus bill provided discretionary funding for various programs, including Heritable Disorders, Poison Control Centers, and Universal Newborn Hearing Screening, at or slightly above FY2013 post-sequester levels. The Pediatric Loan Repayment program was not funded, and the National Health Service Corps did not receive discretionary appropriations in the Labor-HHS-ED bill since FY2011. The FY2014 omnibus bill provided $5.8 billion in discretionary funding for CDC, with increases for various programs such as Environmental Health, Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Global Health, and Injury Prevention and Control. Additionally, there was an increase in PPHF transfers to Chronic Disease and Health Promotion programs. In FY2014, CDC-wide activities will be supported by roughly $380 million for business services and implementation of the CDC Working Capital Fund (WCF), established in FY2012. The President's Budget for FY2014 shows WCF funds embedded within line items for CDC programs, while other columns consolidate total WCF funding into CDC-wide activities. The omnibus provided $29.9 billion in discretionary budget authority for NIH, a $1 billion increase from FY2013 post-sequester levels. The omnibus bill for FY2014 provided funding increases for various NIH Institutes and Centers, including a 3% increase for most and larger increases for selected ones like the National Institute on Aging (+13%) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (+17%). Additionally, $3.4 billion in discretionary funding was allocated for SAMHSA, with a $3 million increase from FY2013 levels. The FY2014 omnibus bill allocated funding increases for various NIH Institutes and Centers, including SAMHSA receiving $3.4 billion in discretionary funding, with a $3 million increase from FY2013 levels. SAMHSA's Mental Health Programs received $463 million, with a new 5% set-aside for evidence-based programs addressing early serious mental illness. AHRQ receives funding from transfers from the PHS Evaluation Tap, with no discretionary budget authority in L-HHS-ED appropriations bills. The FY2014 omnibus bill provided $364 million in Evaluation Tap transfers for one prevention program, with increased support for patient safety research and research innovations. Nearly $4.0 billion in discretionary funding was allocated for CMS, $114 million less than FY2013 levels. The Program Management account received the largest share of discretionary CMS appropriations at $3.7 billion. The FY2014 omnibus bill allocated $294 million for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities, which is below the Senate committee's recommendation. It also called for a review of implementing a Medicare transactional system with \"smart card\" technology. Additionally, $17.7 billion in discretionary funding was provided for ACF, an increase from FY2013 levels. The omnibus bill provided $1.5 billion for Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs, with a focus on the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program due to the increasing number of children arriving in the US. It also showed support for ACF early childhood care and education programs, such as Head Start, with $8.6 billion allocated for it. The omnibus bill allocated $8.6 billion for Head Start, a 14% increase from FY2013 post-sequester levels. It also provided $25 million for costs related to the Head Start Designation Renewal System and $500 million for Early Head Start-Child Care. Additionally, almost $2.4 billion was appropriated for the CCDBG, a 7% increase from FY2013 post-sequester levels. The bill included $1.7 billion for ACL, a 7% increase from FY2013 post-sequester funding. The omnibus bill accepted the transfer of State Health Insurance Programs (SHIPs) and the Paralysis Resource Center to ACL from other agencies, providing funding for these programs in FY2014. SHIPs offer counseling and information assistance to Medicare beneficiaries, while the Paralysis Resource Center offers services to people living with paralysis and their families. The L-HHS-ED appropriations laws contain restrictions on funding for abortions, allowing funding only in cases of endangerment, rape, or incest. Federal programs receiving L-HHS-ED funds are prohibited from discriminating against health care entities that do not provide abortion services. The FY2012 law reinstated provisions prohibiting the use of L-HHS-ED funds for needle exchange programs and CDC spending on gun control advocacy. These provisions were maintained in the FY2013 full-year CR and FY2014 omnibus. The federal government provides support for elementary and secondary education, accounting for roughly 12% of overall funding, with the majority coming from states and local districts. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) plays a significant role in education despite primary responsibility resting with states and school districts. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) plays a significant role in promoting educational standards, gathering data, disseminating research, and administering federal education programs for elementary and secondary education. One of its priorities is improving academic outcomes for disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) administers various higher education programs, including financial aid for college access, vocational rehabilitation, career and technical education, and adult education. The FY2014 omnibus provided approximately $70.60 billion in funding for ED, with $67.30 billion being discretionary. This funding level represented an increase from FY2013 post-sequester levels but was less than the FY2014 request. The FY2014 omnibus increased funding for Education for the Disadvantaged Grants to Local Educational Agencies to $14.38 billion, $625 million more than FY2013 post-sequester levels. The omnibus also funded School Improvement Grants at $506 million, the same as FY2013. The FY2014 omnibus funded School Improvement Grants at $506 million, the same as FY2013 post-sequester levels. Impact Aid received $1.29 billion, $65 million more than FY2013. Race to the Top program received $250 million, $270 million less than FY2013. The FY2014 omnibus directed $250 million towards Preschool Development Grants to support high-quality preschool for low-income families. Additionally, $57 million was provided for the Promise Neighborhoods program to improve educational outcomes for children in distressed communities. The FY2014 omnibus provides funding for Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and Pell Grants program, with amounts slightly lower than the President's Budget request. IDEA Part B State Grants offer federal funding for elementary and secondary education for children with disabilities, while Pell Grants support college education. The FY2014 omnibus allocated $22.78 billion for the Pell Grants program, which is equal to the FY2013 post-sequester funding level but $46 million less than the FY2014 President's request. The discretionary base maximum award for AY 2014-15 remained at $4,860, with a projected total maximum award of $5,730. The FY2014 omnibus provided approximately $70.11 billion in combined mandatory and discretionary funding for related agencies funded through this bill. The FY2014 omnibus allocated $70.11 billion for related agencies funded through this bill, with $14.06 billion being discretionary. The Social Security Administration (SSA) received the largest share of funding, accounting for 97% of the entire related agencies appropriation in FY2014. The bulk of mandatory SSA funding supports the Supplemental Security Income program. The L-HHS-ED bill supports the Supplemental Security Income program for disabled individuals and the elderly. The SSA receives the majority of discretionary funding, covering administrative expenses for Social Security, SSI, and Medicare. The Corporation for National and Community Service is the next-largest agency in terms of funding. Other related agencies receive less than $1 billion annually from the appropriations bill. SSA's FY2014 budget proposal included creating a new Program Integrity Administrative Expenses (PIAE) account for mandatory funding of $1.2 billion for program integrity activities. However, no legislation for this account was introduced in Congress. The FY2014 omnibus bill did not include the proposed PIAE, but did increase program integrity funding by $441 million under the Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) account. The FY2014 budget proposal included $1.2 billion in program integrity funding, an increase of $441 million over pre-sequester funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established spending limits and triggered sequestration for FY2013. President Obama issued the FY2013 sequestration order on March 1, 2013. President Obama issued the FY2013 sequestration order on March 1, 2013, which required reductions in various funding categories. The Office of Management and Budget estimated percentage reductions for different types of funding, which were applied to determine dollar amount reductions for each budget account. The Budget Control Act (BCA) requires annual reductions to both mandatory and discretionary spending for FY2014-FY2021. Sequestration for non-exempt mandatory programs and lower spending limits for discretionary programs are used to achieve these reductions. Subsequent laws have extended sequestration for non-exempt mandatory programs through FY2024. Discretionary spending limits for FY2014 and FY2015 have been modified by other acts. The BCA does not call for sequestration of discretionary spending in FY2014 unless certain limits are exceeded. The Budget Control Act requires annual reductions in spending for FY2014-FY2021 through sequestration and lower spending limits. President Obama issued a sequestration order for non-exempt FY2014 mandatory spending, which took effect on October 1, 2013. The sequestration percentages were 2% for non-exempt Medicare spending and 7.2% for non-exempt nondefense mandatory spending in FY2014. The OMB report displayed the actual dollar amounts to be sequestered from each budget account. Sequestration of discretionary spending was not required in FY2014, as the FY2014 omnibus did not violate the defense and nondefense spending limits. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to discretionary spending caps, including increases in new budget authority for specified program integrity initiatives. Some programs are exempt from sequestration while others are subject to automatic spending reductions. The L-HHS-ED bill exempts certain programs from sequestration, including Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income, while subjecting others to special rules. Programs like unemployment compensation and certain student loans are subject to special rules under sequestration. The BBA of FY2014 resulted from negotiations between the House and Senate Budget Committees. The BBA of FY2014 established a Congressional Budget alternative mechanism for budget enforcement, providing spending levels for FY2014 consistent with discretionary spending limits. The FY2014 omnibus appropriations adhered to these caps. The House and Senate passed their own FY2014 budget resolutions before the BBA was enacted. The House and Senate set spending limits for appropriations subcommittees based on these resolutions. Subcommittee spending caps, known as 302(b) allocations, were established. The House and Senate released revised 302(b) allocations for FY2014. The Senate Appropriations Committee also adopted subcommittee spending guidance for FY2014. No new subcommittee allocations were made public after the BBA was enacted. The House and Senate Budget Committee Chairs submitted new budgetary levels to the Congressional Record. Table A-1 shows L-HHS-ED 302(b) allocations for FY2014 compared to the Senate committee bill and enacted omnibus. The allocations do not reflect revisions from the BBA. Compliance with spending caps is based on budget authority available in the current fiscal year. Table A-1 also displays total L-HHS-ED current year budget authority for FY2014 compared to pre- and post-sequester FY2013 funding levels. The table shows total budget authority available for obligation in FY2014 compared to pre- and post-sequester FY2013 funding levels."
