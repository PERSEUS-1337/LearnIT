    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tackling Excessive Standardized Testing Act of 2015\" or the \"TEST Act of 2015.\" It includes amendments to the ESEA. The TEST Act of 2015 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by introducing new clauses related to academic assessments, starting from the first full school year after the enactment of the Act. The TEST Act of 2015 allows public schools to administer academic assessments in math and reading in specific grades. The TEST Act of 2015 allows public schools at the 15th percentile or above in math to administer academic assessments in specific grades. Elementary or public secondary schools at the 15th percentile or above for reading/language arts must administer academic assessments in grades 3 and 7 following the previous year's achievement data. The Secretary may authorize schools with students below academic achievement requirements to administer math assessments if they show progress in math assessments. The Secretary may authorize schools with students below academic achievement requirements to administer math assessments if they show progress in reading or language arts assessments. The Secretary may authorize schools to administer reading or language arts assessments for students below academic achievement requirements. Limited English proficient students' achievement should not be overlooked. Limited English proficient students' achievement should not be considered for the first 12 months in public schools. This amendment applies to waivers under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The amendment allows waivers under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to exclude Limited English proficient students' achievement for the first 12 months in public schools. Additionally, it provides options for certain academic assessments."
