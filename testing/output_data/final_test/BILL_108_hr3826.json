Congress finds that inefficiency and ineffectiveness in Federal programs undermine confidence in the Government, hinder program improvement efforts, handicap policy making and oversight, and calls for identifying and sharing performance of similar programs to enhance results. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 aims to improve accountability, focus on results, and integrate program performance with budget decisions. It provides a framework for monitoring long-term goals and annual performance of federal departments and agencies. The purpose of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 is to improve accountability, focus on results, and integrate program performance with budget decisions. The Act aims to enhance the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 by evaluating Federal programs to identify strengths and weaknesses, assisting the executive branch in making informed decisions, and providing policymakers with information for effective oversight and evidence-based spending decisions. The Act aims to enhance the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 by evaluating Federal programs to identify strengths and weaknesses, assisting the executive branch in making informed decisions, and providing policymakers with information for effective oversight and evidence-based spending decisions that achieve positive results for the American people. The Act includes a program assessment component. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 amended Chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code to include a new section on program assessments. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in collaboration with federal agencies, must assess each program at least once every 5 fiscal years. Assessments involve evaluating the program's purpose, design, strategic plan, management, and results. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget develops criteria for identifying programs to assess each fiscal year, considering similarities in functions, purposes, and goals. Efforts are made to assess programs more frequently if they are deemed higher priority. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget develops criteria for identifying programs to assess each fiscal year, considering similarities in functions, purposes, and goals. Efforts are made to assess programs more frequently if they are deemed higher priority, special circumstances exist, improvements have been made, or if the head of the relevant agency and the Director determine that more frequent assessment is warranted. At least 90 days before completing the assessments, the Director must publish a list of programs to be assessed and the criteria to be used. The results of program assessments conducted annually are reported to Congress along with the President's budget. The report includes performance goals, assessment criteria, results, any limitations, and modifications to the Federal Government performance plan. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will provide guidance on implementing program assessment requirements. Section 1115(g) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to reflect the changes. This section will not be in effect after September 30, 2013. The table of sections in chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by replacing \"1119\" with \"1120\". SEC. 5. STRATEGIC PLANNING AMENDMENTS. This section amends the deadline and period of coverage for strategic plans in the United States Code. The deadline for the plan is changed to September 30 of each year following a presidential election starting in 2005. The coverage period is adjusted to a 4-year period beginning on October 1 after a presidential election."
