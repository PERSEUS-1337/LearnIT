    "content": "The Act titled \"District of Columbia Fair and Equal House Voting Rights Act of 2007\" aims to address the lack of voting representation for over half a million residents in the District of Columbia. Residents have a history of defending democracy and contribute billions in Federal taxes annually. The Act aligns with the principles of \"one person, one vote\" and \"government by the consent of the governed.\" The District of Columbia is considered a Congressional district for representation in the House of Representatives. Amendments are made to include a single district of Columbia member in the apportionment of House of Representatives members among states. Amendments clarify the determination of the number of presidential electors based on the 23rd amendment, specifically for the District of Columbia. SEC. 4. INCREASE IN MEMBERSHIP OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. Effective with the One Hundred Tenth Congress, the House of Representatives will have 437 Members, including those representing the District of Columbia. The amendment to the Act regarding reapportionment of Members will apply to the regular decennial census. The President must transmit a revised apportionment statement to Congress within 30 days of the enactment of the Act, taking into account the amendments made. The Clerk must report on the revised statement within 15 days of receiving it. Upon receiving the revised apportionment statement, the Clerk of the House of Representatives will send a certificate to each State with the number of Representatives they are entitled to. Additionally, a report will be submitted to the Speaker of the House identifying the State entitled to an additional Representative. SEC. 5. NONSEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. If any provision of this Act or any amendment made by this Act is declared invalid, the remaining provisions shall also be invalid. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE; TIMING OF ELECTIONS. The general election for an additional Representative and the Representative from the District of Columbia for the One Hundred Tenth Congress must meet specific requirements, including the Governor signing a redistricting plan into law by December 5, 2006. The first reapportionment after the 2010 census will result in the election of additional Representatives based on redistricting plans enacted by each State. The new Representatives and the Representative from the District of Columbia will be sworn in and seated together. Nothing in this section affects the eligibility of individuals elected in the November 2006 general election for the One Hundred Tenth Congress."
