    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes provisions to reform the private insurance market and expand health insurance coverage. Key provisions include ending lifetime and annual benefit limits, prohibiting rescissions of policies, requiring coverage of preventive services, extending dependent coverage up to age 26, capping non-medical administrative expenditures, guaranteeing coverage for preexisting conditions for those under 19, and providing assistance for uninsured individuals with preexisting conditions. ACA will fully implement these provisions in 2014. The ACA will restructure the private health insurance market, expand Medicaid coverage, and implement health-related revenue provisions to pay for expanded coverage. This includes taxes on firms in the health care sector, fees on employers, and changes to tax-advantaged health care accounts. Table 1 shows implementation dates and revenue projections for these provisions. According to the CBO and JCT, health-related revenue provisions in the ACA are projected to raise $391.7 billion over 10 years. These revenues come from excise taxes, limitations on employer deductions, and taxes on high income taxpayers. Employer-related provisions account for 37% of total health-related revenues, with over half paid by high income taxpayers. Less than 10% comes from modifications to tax-advantaged accounts, while penalties on individuals and employers also contribute to the revenues. The ACA imposes various taxes and fees on health insurers, plan administrators, and health companies, including excise taxes, annual fees, and limits on deductibility of executive compensation. Additionally, there are provisions affecting all employers providing prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. The ACA imposes taxes on health insurers and limits on deductibility of executive compensation. It also includes a 40% excise tax on health insurers to indirectly limit the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance coverage. The ACA imposes a 40% excise tax on health insurers and health plan administrators for coverage exceeding certain thresholds in 2018. The tax is expected to prompt employers to reduce coverage generosity, leading to increased taxable wages. Thresholds for single and family coverage are set at $10,200 and $27,500 respectively, with adjustments based on CPI-U growth. Retired individuals, aged 55-64, and high-risk workers have higher thresholds. Multi-employer plan employees are only subject to family coverage thresholds. The ACA imposes a 40% excise tax on health insurance coverage exceeding certain thresholds in 2018. Thresholds for single and family coverage are set at $10,200 and $27,500 respectively, with adjustments based on CPI-U growth. Employees in multi-employer plans are only subject to family thresholds. The provision allows employers to adjust health insurance costs based on workforce demographics. Health insurance coverage subject to the tax includes premiums for health, dental, and vision coverage, as well as tax-advantaged health-related accounts. Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are considered health insurance coverage and are included in the threshold calculation for the 40% excise tax imposed by the ACA in 2018. The excise tax will be applied to each component (health insurance, dental and vision, FSAs) based on their share of the total contribution that exceeds the applicable threshold. These thresholds will be adjusted based on the premium growth of the standard health insurance option under the FEHBP. If the cost of that plan rises more than 55% between 2010 and 2018, the excise tax thresholds will be adjusted upward. It is uncertain how many insured individuals would be affected by the tax on high-cost plans. The tax on high-cost plans under the ACA will affect insured individuals due to uncertainty in employer responses, plan design changes, and premium growth. Less than 7% would have been impacted in 2008, with thresholds adjusted annually for inflation. Additional reporting requirements will be imposed on employers providing health insurance coverage. Employers will be responsible for determining and reporting the aggregate amount of health insurance coverage subject to the excise tax, with penalties for under-reporting. The excise tax, not deductible from federal income taxes, is projected to raise $32 billion over 10 years. Special rules apply for determining taxable income of insurance companies. The ACA imposes a fee on health insurers based on their market share of net premiums written, effective from 2014. The fee varies based on the size of net premiums, with exemptions for self-insured plans, government entities, and tax-exempt insurers. Only 50% of net premiums for tax-exempt insurers are considered for the fee calculation. The ACA imposes a fee on health insurers based on their market share of net premiums written, effective from 2014. The fee varies based on the size of net premiums, with exemptions for certain entities. The aggregate fee collected across all health insurers will increase annually until 2018 and then be indexed to premium growth. The fee is projected to raise about $60 billion over a 10-year period. Additionally, ACA will impose an annual fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs based on annual sales to reach revenue targets each year. The ACA imposes fees on health insurers and manufacturers/importers of branded prescription drugs based on annual sales to reach revenue targets each year. The fees collected will be transferred to the Federal Medicare Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund. Additionally, a new excise tax of 2.3% will be imposed on the sale of medical devices, projected to raise significant revenue over a 10-year period. The ACA imposes fees on health insurers and manufacturers/importers of branded prescription drugs based on annual sales to reach revenue targets each year. A new excise tax of 2.3% will be imposed on the sale of medical devices, projected to raise significant revenue over a 10-year period. The ACA will also impose limits on executive compensation deductible by health insurers, projected to raise $600 million over a 10-year period. Employers who provide Medicare-eligible retirees with prescription drug coverage meeting federal standards can receive subsidy payments from the government. The subsidies are 28% of actual spending over $250, up to $5,000 in 2006 dollars. These subsidies are tax-exempt and employers can claim a deduction for retiree drug expenses. Starting in 2013, ACA will require coordination between the subsidy and deduction, reducing the deduction by the subsidy amount. This provision is expected to generate $4.5 billion in revenue. The ACA includes an additional payroll tax of 0.9% on high-income workers with wages over $200,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers. This tax increase will raise $4.5 billion over a 10-year period and the additional revenues will be transferred to the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The ACA imposes a 3.8% tax on net investment income for households with MAGI over $250,000 for joint filers. This tax is projected to raise $86.8 billion over 10 years and excludes distributions from qualified annuities. The ACA imposes a 3.8% tax on net investment income for households with MAGI over $250,000 for joint filers. This tax will apply to capital gains from the sale of a primary residence included in taxable income only if the taxpayer's MAGI exceeded the thresholds. The tax will not apply to active income from trade for self-employed and S-corporations, but only to passive income and income related to commodity trading. The ACA imposes a 3.8% tax on net investment income for households with MAGI over $250,000 for joint filers. Initially, a small percentage of tax filers are expected to be affected by these thresholds. Data on the income distribution of tax filers based on MAGI are not publicly available, but IRS data shows about 1% of single filers have AGI over $200,000. For married filers, about 8% have AGI over $200,000. The share affected by the $250,000 limit would be lower. Since the thresholds are not indexed to inflation, a larger number may be affected over time. The ACA imposes a 3.8% tax on net investment income for households with MAGI over $250,000 for joint filers. Initially, a small percentage of tax filers are expected to be affected by these thresholds. Over time, a larger number of individuals are expected to be affected as the thresholds are not indexed to inflation. The unearned income tax provision is projected to raise $123.4 billion in revenues over a 10-year period, nearly one-third (31.5%) of the health-related revenues in ACA. Various tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending will be impacted by the revenue provisions in Title IX of ACA. Health care flexible spending accounts (FSAs) reimburse employees for health care expenses on a pre-tax basis. In 2010, 39% of workers had access to FSAs, with a maximum contribution limit of $5,000. The ACA will limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 starting in 2013. This provision is projected to increase revenues by $13 billion over 10 years. HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses, available to individuals with a high deductible health plan. Unlike FSAs, HSAs allow rollovers and tax-free distributions for qualified medical expenses. Non-qualified distributions incur a penalty, which will increase to 20% under the ACA. Data on non-qualified distributions are not available, but overall account balances do increase over time. The ACA increases the penalty for non-qualified HSA distributions to 20%, potentially doubling the penalty for accounts held for more than five years. This change is expected to generate $1.3 billion in revenue over 10 years. Additionally, the ACA modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses, excluding over-the-counter medications. This may encourage individuals to save HSA funds for future use rather than using them for non-qualified expenses. The ACA excludes over-the-counter medications as qualified medical expenses, increasing revenues by $5 billion over 10 years. Taxpayers can deduct unreimbursed medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI, including health insurance premiums, transportation, lodging expenses, and long-term care costs. Starting in 2013, the threshold will be raised to 10% of AGI for taxpayers under 65, limiting deductions further. Taxpayers over 65 temporarily excluded from deduction limit of medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI from 2013-2016. Older households and lower-income individuals disproportionately affected. 21% of tax filers aged 65+ claimed medical expense deduction, 43% higher than average. Taxpayers with AGI below $50,000 accounted for 41% of those claiming this deduction."
