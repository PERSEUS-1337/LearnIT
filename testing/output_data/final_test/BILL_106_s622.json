    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999\". Congress recognizes that violence motivated by factors such as race, religion, or gender is a serious national issue that disrupts communities and affects interstate commerce. Existing Federal law is deemed insufficient to address this problem. Violence motivated by bias, including factors such as race, religion, or gender, can involve perpetrators crossing State lines, using interstate commerce, and committing crimes with articles that have traveled across state lines. Federal jurisdiction is necessary to supplement State and local authorities in prosecuting these crimes to ensure justice is achieved in each case. Federal jurisdiction over violent crimes motivated by bias allows Federal, State, and local authorities to collaborate in investigating and prosecuting such crimes. The issue of hate crime is serious, widespread, and interstate, warranting Federal assistance to States and local jurisdictions. The term \"hate crime\" is defined in this Act as per the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Certain acts of violence are prohibited under this Act. Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include harsh penalties for causing bodily injury based on race, color, religion, or national origin, including imprisonment up to 10 years or life if death results from the act. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, includes penalties for causing bodily injury based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability, with imprisonment up to 10 years or life if death results from the act. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, includes penalties for acts such as kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or attempted murder in connection with interstate or foreign commerce. The Federal Sentencing Commission will study adult recruitment of juveniles for hate crimes and may amend sentencing guidelines to enhance penalties for adult defendants who recruit juveniles. The Commission will ensure consistency with other guidelines and avoid duplicate punishments. Additionally, there is a grant program established. The Office of Justice Programs will provide grants to State and local programs to combat hate crimes by juveniles, including training for law enforcement officers. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose. Additionally, there is an authorization for additional personnel to assist State and local law enforcement. The Act authorizes appropriations to increase personnel to prevent and respond to violations of section 245 of title 18, United States Code. If any provision of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act will not be affected."
