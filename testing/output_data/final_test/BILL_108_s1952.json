    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mexican Agricultural Trade Compliance Act\". Congress finds that under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the US Trade Representative must enforce US rights if they are being denied under any trade agreement. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act states that determinations of violations of US rights will be based on findings by the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization. A panel report adopted on January 27, 2000, by the Dispute Settlement Body is referenced in this context. On January 27, 2000, the Dispute Settlement Body found that section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 aligns with US obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements. A panel of the World Trade Organization on January 28, 2000, ruled that Mexico's antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup from the US violated its commitments. The Dispute Settlement Body adopted the panel's report on February 24, 2000. The US and Mexico agreed on April 10, 2000, to a deadline for Mexico to comply with the panel's report by September 22, 2000. On September 20, 2000, Mexico issued a revised antidumping threat determination to evade compliance with the panel report adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body. A panel in June 2001 found Mexico's action failed to meet its WTO commitments. The Appellate Body in October 2001 affirmed the panel's ruling and urged Mexico to comply with its trade obligations. On January 1, 2002, Mexico imposed a discriminatory 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup to evade WTO rulings on antidumping orders. Mexico imposed a discriminatory tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup on April 20, 2002, and lifted its antidumping order on the same syrup. This move was to prevent US imports of high fructose corn syrup due to the tax. The lifting of the antidumping order allowed Mexico to claim compliance with WTO rulings. Mexico imposed a 20 percent tax on high fructose corn syrup from the United States, leading to a drastic drop in imports. The United States has exhausted proceedings under the Dispute Settlement Understanding, with adverse findings against Mexico. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for key terms related to dispute settlement, including the Appellate Body, Dispute Settlement Body, dispute settlement panel, Dispute Settlement Understanding, and GATT 1994. The Act provides definitions for key terms related to dispute settlement, including GATT 1994, Uruguay Round Agreements, World Trade Organization, and WTO Agreement. Enforcement of US rights under trade agreements regarding high fructose corn syrup exports to Mexico. Congress determines that the United States' rights under the Uruguay Round Agreements are being denied by Mexico through the imposition of a 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup, which extends Mexico's unjustified antidumping order on the syrup. The US has exhausted proceedings under the Dispute Settlement Understanding, and Mexico's actions are deemed unjustifiable and restrict US commerce. The United States Trade Representative will take action if Mexico does not eliminate its tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup and preserve US rights under trade agreements. A certification must be submitted within 30 days of the Act's enactment stating Mexico's compliance. The United States Trade Representative will take action if Mexico does not eliminate its tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup to preserve US rights under trade agreements. If certification is not made, USTR will suspend trade agreement concessions with Mexico or impose duties on Mexican goods. The United States Trade Representative may suspend fees or restrictions on Mexico's services for a period determined appropriate."
