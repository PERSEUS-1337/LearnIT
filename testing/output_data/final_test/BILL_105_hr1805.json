This includes no adverse legal claims on the property and compliance with specific sections of the Act. The Secretary has the authority to accept additional acreage in the Tribe's service area for nongaming or nonresidential purposes, as long as gaming activities are not the primary function. Land taken into trust for the Tribe can only be used for nongaming purposes and must comply with all relevant regulations. The Tribe can acquire land for residential purposes in compliance with local zoning ordinances and compact agreements. The Secretary cannot take land into trust for individual tribal members for residential purposes. Additional land acquired for residential use must be contiguous to the initial parcel. A compact is required for any land taken into trust. After the Auburn Indian Restoration Amendment Act, the Secretary cannot take land into trust for the Tribe without a written compact with the local government. The compact must include provisions on the location, permissible use of the land, and an environmental study for mitigation of impacts. The compact between the local government and the Tribe must address law enforcement responsibilities, public services, tax impacts, building standards, and any additional agreed-upon matters for land taken into trust. The land to be taken into trust must provide notice to the public, State, and local governments, allow for a 45-day comment period, and address comments before entering into a local compact. The Tribe and local jurisdiction must negotiate the compact in good faith. Disputes may be resolved through binding arbitration regarding non-compliance or terms of the compact. The Tribe or local government can submit disputes to binding arbitration under the United States Arbitration Act if related to a compact negotiated in good faith. Sovereign immunity cannot be used as a defense, and all parties must comply with arbitration awards. An arbitration board will be established to conduct the arbitration. An arbitration board will be established to conduct arbitration for disputes between the Tribe and local government. The board will consist of three members, with one selected by the Tribe, one by the local government, and a third member chosen by the first two. If the first two members cannot agree on the third member, the presiding judge of the Placer County Superior Court will make the selection. The costs of the arbitration, excluding attorneys' fees, will be awarded to the prevailing party as determined by the arbitration board. The arbitration board's decision is final and subject to judicial review under the United States Arbitration Act. The terms of subsections (d) and (e) are enforceable in court by the Tribe and local government, without the Tribe being able to claim sovereign immunity as a defense. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Auburn Indian Restoration Act is amended to include definitions for 'class II gaming' and 'class III gaming' as per the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act."
