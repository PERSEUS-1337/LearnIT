    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Indian Dams Safety Act of 1993\". It includes findings related to dam safety. The Congress finds that in 1980, the Secretary of the Interior established a dam safety program to address deficiencies in dams, but the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) did not make timely progress. As a result, 53 dams on Indian lands are considered high hazard. Unsafe BIA dams continue to pose a threat due to lack of priority in the dam safety program. Until 1991, the BIA lacked a proper maintenance program for dams under its jurisdiction. Safe working dams are necessary on Indian lands for various purposes such as irrigation, flood control, water supply, and habitat preservation. Inadequate maintenance of BIA dams in the past has led to increased costs for repairs and future maintenance. Many dams have deficiencies that need to be corrected to prevent threats to human life and property. Regular dam maintenance is essential to ensure safety and functionality. Regular dam maintenance and repair program is necessary to ensure safety and functionality of dams on Indian lands, utilizing expertise from BIA, Indian tribal governments, or other Federal agencies. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Indian tribes,\" \"Secretary,\" \"dam safety program,\" \"dam safety operation and maintenance program,\" and \"dam safety condition classifications.\" The Act defines key terms related to dam safety, including \"dam safety condition classifications\" which categorize dams based on their safety conditions as Satisfactory, Fair, Conditionally poor, or Poor. Unsatisfactory dam safety condition requires immediate remedial action to resolve the deficiency. Reservoir restrictions may be necessary until the problem is resolved. The Secretary is authorized to take actions to address unsatisfactory dam safety conditions and may impose reservoir restrictions until the problem is resolved. The Secretary is mandated to establish a dam safety operation and maintenance program for dams on Indian lands, conduct necessary rehabilitation work, and maintain a comprehensive list of dams to ensure their satisfactory condition. The Act mandates the establishment of a dam safety operation and maintenance program for dams on Indian lands, with the purpose of ensuring dam safety and not for expanding storage capacity or developing additional benefits. The Secretary can seek technical assistance from other agencies, but the dam safety programs will remain under the direction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Additionally, the Secretary has contract authority for carrying out the purposes of the Act. The Secretary is authorized to contract with Indian tribes for the dam safety operation and maintenance program under this Act. Authorization is given to appropriate necessary funds for the implementation of this Act."
