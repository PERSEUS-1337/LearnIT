    "content": "The \"Second Amendment Preservation Act of 1999\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows. Congress finds that State and local governments are suing firearms manufacturers, importers, and dealers over the unlawful use of firearms, with the intent to financially burden them. Many of these businesses are small and cannot afford the legal costs of defending themselves in multiple courts. States and local governments, being wealthier entities, can engage in costly legal battles with small firearms businesses. Fairness dictates that governments should bear the costs of unsuccessful lawsuits against gun manufacturers, and taxpayers should not have to fund expensive legal fees from awards meant for crime victims. The Second Amendment is also a consideration. The Second Amendment and the Commerce Clause empower Congress to protect citizens' right to own firearms, including providing safeguards against excessive legal fees. SEC. 3. RULES GOVERNING ACTIONS TO CURTAIL FIREARM SALES FOR LEGAL PURPOSES. Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include rules governing actions brought to curtail the sale or availability of firearms for legal purposes. This section defines such actions as civil cases in Federal or State court against firearms manufacturers, importers, or dealers seeking damages exceeding $1,000,000 or 50% of the defendant's net assets. The actions aim to hold these entities liable for damages caused by firearms. The amended Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, holds firearms manufacturers, importers, or dealers liable for damages caused by unlawful firearm use. In civil actions to curtail firearm sale, attorney's fees for the plaintiff are limited to $150 per hour or 10% of the plaintiff's award. In civil actions to curtail firearm sale, if the defendant is not primarily liable, the plaintiff must reimburse reasonable attorney's fees and court costs. Any decision on the constitutionality of this section is directly appealable to the Supreme Court. The amendment regarding rules governing actions to curtail firearm sale takes effect upon enactment of the Act and applies to pending or future actions."
