    "content": "The \"Recapture Excess Profits and Invest in Relief (REPAIR) Act of 2005\" includes a Temporary Windfall Profits Tax on crude oil, imposing a tax and establishing rules and definitions for windfall profits. The \"Recapture Excess Profits and Invest in Relief (REPAIR) Act of 2005\" imposes a 50 percent windfall profit tax on applicable taxpayers for taxable years 2005 and 2006. Applicable taxpayers include integrated oil companies and other crude oil producers or refiners with gross receipts exceeding $100,000,000. The term 'windfall profit' is defined as the excess of adjusted taxable income over the reasonably inflated average profit for the taxable year. Adjusted taxable income is calculated by increasing taxable income with certain deductions and decreasing it with interest and dividend income, as well as net operating losses. Adjusted taxable income is determined for foreign corporations with income effectively connected to US business. The reasonably inflated average profit for any taxable year is calculated as the average of adjusted taxable income for 2000-2004, plus 10 percent. \"Special rules and definitions under SEC. 5898.\" The Secretary will establish rules for tax withholding and deposit under section 5896. Taxpayers must maintain records and provide information as required. The filing of the windfall profit tax return will be determined by the Secretary. The definition of crude oil includes condensates and natural gasoline. Businesses under common control are defined for this chapter. The Secretary will establish regulations for tax withholding and deposit under section 5896. Businesses under common control will be treated as 1 person for the purposes of this chapter. Chapter 56 introduces a windfall profit tax on crude oil and establishes a Hurricane Relief Trust Fund under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The windfall profit tax is deductible under section 164(a) and the Trust Fund is created in subchapter A of chapter 98. The Hurricane Relief Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to aid victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Funds are appropriated from taxes received under section 5896, and are available to offset supplemental spending bills until January 1, 2008. Any unexpended funds by December 31, 2008, will be credited back to the General Fund. The table of sections for the subchapter is amended by adding a new item. The Hurricane Relief Trust Fund, established under Sec. 9511, will apply to taxable years in 2005 and 2006, with certain amendments taking effect upon the enactment of the Act."
