    "content": "The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) was established in 1970 to improve health worker distribution in underserved areas by providing scholarship support to students in medical professions in exchange for service in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). NHSC recruits professionals in various health fields and has placed over 28,000 health professionals in rural and urban HPSAs. In FY2007, over 4,000 health professionals were placed in HPSAs. The NHSC placed over 4,000 trained health professionals in HPSAs to improve health worker distribution in underserved areas. NHSC aims to add to the supply of primary health care workers, retain them in underserved areas, and increase access to primary health care for underserved populations. The program complements other federal health workforce programs and intersects with health safety net programs like the Health Centers program. The NHSC places trained health professionals in underserved areas to improve health worker distribution. Medicare and Medicaid play a role in financing health care services at federally supported health centers. NHSC clinicians serving in HPSAs receive incentive payments from Medicare. Changes in NHSC recruitment funding could impact the quality of care at community health centers, leading to unmet health care needs. The interconnectedness of health safety net programs suggests that federal policy changes can have ripple effects on the delivery of health care services. The NHSC is a federally supported health workforce program that retains primary care clinicians in exchange for benefits. Congress passed the Health Care Safety Net (HCSN) Act in 2008, reauthorizing NHSC programs through 2012. The NHSC is authorized in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act and administered by the Department of Health and Human Services through the Health Resources and Services Administration. Funding for the NHSC program increased to $135 million in FY2009. The NHSC program received a total funding of $360 million for FY2009 from the ARRA. Policymakers are facing challenges in providing direction for the NHSC amidst health care reform and economic constraints. There is a growing demand for primary health care workers due to various factors, leading to suggestions of giving more responsibility to nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The NHSC program may be significantly affected by changes in workforce size and funding allocation towards nonphysician primary care providers. Recommendations include developing geriatric specialists and establishing a geriatric loan repayment program. Proposals to alter benefits include extending commitment periods and offering more extensive benefits like a pension plan. The NHSC program offers benefits like a pension plan to healthcare workers in HPSAs in exchange for commitment. It is recognized for its success in recruiting and retaining primary care workers, especially after receiving support from the ARRA 2009. The report provides a summary of NHSC, appropriation trends, program profiles, goals and outcomes, workforce capacity, and policy issues of interest to Congress. The NHSC was reauthorized through FY2012 by the HCSN Act of 2008. The HCSN Act of 2008 reauthorized the NHSC through FY2012, providing funds for the Recruitment and Field Programs. The Recruitment Program offers loan repayment awards and scholarships to support healthcare workers in HPSAs. Field Program administrators arrange placements for NHSC clinicians in various healthcare settings. In FY2007, the NHSC Field Program placed 4,000 clinicians in HPSAs, including physicians, mental health professionals, physician assistants, dentists, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, dental hygienists, and a chiropractor. The National Advisory Council advises the Secretary of HHS on NHSC administration, meeting annually. Congress appropriates funds for NHSC programs in the Labor-HHS-Ed bill, with a supplemental appropriation in FY2009 through ARRA. The NHSC appropriation trends from FY2001 to FY2009 are highlighted, with funds supporting loan repayments, scholarships, and administrative activities. The Recruitment Program and Field Program are described in detail, with a total of $300 million appropriated in FY2009, including $75 million available through FY2011. The NHSC's recruitment programs consist of loan repayment, scholarships, and emergency preparedness components. Loan repayors must sign an agreement with a governmental agency, work in a HPSA for a minimum of two years, and have a degree in qualified areas. The federal program pays up to $25,000 a year towards educational loans in exchange for a commitment to serve federally. The NHSC's federal loan repayment program offers up to $35,000 per year for service in a HPSA, with awards increasing from FY2002 to FY2005 but leveling off after. The state loan repayment program requires a 50% contribution from both federal and state governments. The state loan repayment program requires a 50% contribution from the state. State loan repayors may work one additional year after the initial two-year commitment, limited to three years of service. The trend for student loan repayment awards from FY2002 to FY2008 shows fluctuations in the number of awards. In addition to federal and state loan repayment programs, the NHSC administers scholarship programs, including the ongoing NHSC Scholars Program. The NHSC Scholarship Program supports scholars studying in various healthcare fields at accredited universities. It covers tuition, fees, monthly stipend, and other educational expenses for one academic year. The NHSC Scholarship Program covers tuition, fees, monthly stipend, and other educational expenses for scholars studying healthcare fields. Scholars commit to a minimum of two years in clinical service within a HPSA, with each additional year of support requiring one more year of service. Trends in the total number of scholarships awarded between FY2002 and FY2008 show 405 scholarships awarded in FY2002 and an estimated 162 scholarships awarded in FY2008. Congress authorized a pilot project for community scholars in 1990, similar to the NHSC Scholarship Program, but the appropriation authority expired in FY2004. The Community Scholars Program (CSP) had its appropriation authority expire in FY2004, with the last participants finishing in FY2007. Unlike the NHSC Scholarship Program, state or local entities funded CSP scholars who served in HPSAs. Recipients included health centers, universities, and tribal health centers. CSP scholars could pursue entry-level degrees in healthcare fields. Historic data on the program is limited, but in 2002, NHSC recruitment efforts expanded to include a new group of providers called the Ready. The NHSC expanded activities to include Ready Responders, recruited through USPHS Commissioned Corps. These providers assist in public health emergencies like natural disasters. In 2005, 36 Ready Responders aided after hurricanes. They receive federal support through NHSC Field appropriation, with 55 supported in FY2008. The NHSC Field program supports Ready Responders who commit to working for up to three years at a time. NHSC Scholars may serve up to four years, while state loan repayors are limited to three-year commitments. Field administrators implement activities to eliminate health workforce shortages in HPSAs, including recruitment, retention, and placement efforts. The Field Program activities include recruitment, retention, placements, HPSA designations, and program goals. Program administrators coordinate activities for NHSC clinicians, such as orientation programs, mentoring, and state-based efforts. Initiatives like the On Campus NHSC Ambassador Program aim to recruit and retain clinicians in HPSAs. The On Campus NHSC Ambassador Program involves volunteers who do outreach on campuses and in communities to encourage students and clinicians to work with the NHSC. The SEARCH Program provides opportunities for health professions students and residents to work in community health care teams. NHSC placement sites must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary of HHS. NHSC placement sites must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary of HHS, including having a HPSA designation status, providing healthcare services to all individuals regardless of ability to pay, participating in Medicaid, Medicare, and CHIP, and demonstrating the need for NHSC clinicians. The Secretary prioritizes sites based on a scoring system that reflects the need for health professionals in designated population groups, geographic areas, or facilities. HPSAs are designated by the Secretary of HHS based on criteria for health professional shortages. The Secretary of HHS designates HPSAs based on criteria such as low population to physician ratio, lack of access to medical professionals, Native American constituency, and facility status. HPSAs are categorized into primary medical, mental health, and dental care specialties. HHS reports annually on the number of HPSA designations in each specialty. As of FY2008, there were 5,987 primary medical HPSAs, 3,951 dental HPSAs, and 2,947 mental health HPSAs designated. The process for designating a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) involves submitting an application to the state Primary Care Office (PCO). Congress established an automatic designation pilot project to expedite the process for certain facility HPSAs from 2002 to FY2008. The scoring process developed by HHS for automatic designations does not apply to population or geographic HPSAs, or non-automatically designated facility HPSAs. Regulations at 42 CFR Part 5 apply to non-automatically designated HPSAs. In 2008, the Secretary of HHS withdrew the proposed rule for revising the HPSA designation process. The NHSC sets goals for recruitment and field programs, tracking goals such as increasing field strength, clinician retention, individuals served, and vacancies filled from FY2002 to FY2008. The NHSC aims to increase the number of clinicians in underserved areas and improve service to communities in need. The decrease in field strength is attributed to awarding more loan repayment contracts and fewer new clinicians entering the field. This impacts the NHSC's ability to fill vacancies and meet recruitment goals. The NHSC focused on increasing field strength through scholarships and loan repayments. The number of clinicians serving in HPSAs increased by 73% from FY2002 to FY2005. The spike in FY2005 was due to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which exempted NHSC loan repayments from taxable income. NHSC appropriation declined by nearly a quarter from FY2004 to FY2005 and continued to decline through FY2008. The NHSC aimed to increase field strength and retention of clinicians in HPSAs, but faced challenges in meeting these goals. Data on clinician retention rates were inconsistent, making it difficult to assess goal achievement. Another goal was to increase the number of individuals served by NHSC clinicians. The NHSC aimed to increase the number of individuals served by NHSC clinicians. Between FY2004 and FY2006, the population served increased from 3.8 million to 4.5 million, meeting the goal. However, in FY2007 and FY2008, the population served decreased by nearly a million, falling short of the goal. Another goal was to increase the number of list-vacancies filled by NHSC clinicians. The trend for filling list-vacancies by NHSC clinicians was uneven from FY2003 to FY2008. The number of vacancies filled fluctuated, with a low of 1,746 in FY2007. Concerns were raised about a scoring process disadvantaging health centers in receiving NHSC clinicians. A goal was to increase the average HPSA score of sites receiving NHSC clinicians. The Field Program reports on NHSC clinicians practicing in HPSAs nationwide. The map in Appendix A shows the distribution of NHSC clinicians in urban and rural areas for FY2007. States with the highest number of NHSC clinicians were California, Florida, and Missouri, while Vermont, New Hampshire, and Hawaii had the lowest. Six states had over 150 NHSC clinicians each. Appendix B shows the distribution of participants in the NHSC State Loan Repayment Program in FY2007. The NHSC State Loan Repayment Program in FY2007 expanded to include the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Michigan and California had the most state loan repayors, while some states had none. The number of loan repayors in HPSAs increased significantly from FY2001 to FY2005. Physicians were the largest professional group serving in HPSAs in FY2007. In FY2007, physicians were the largest group of NHSC clinicians, followed by mental and behavioral professionals, physician assistants, dentists, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and others. The NAC was established to advise the Secretary of HHS and HRSA on NHSC matters, with 15 members including the Chair. The Committee recommended doubling NHSC's field strength to 10,000 primary care clinicians in underserved areas in 2007. The NHSC's field strength is proposed to double to 10,000 primary care clinicians in underserved areas. An additional appropriation of 8% of loan repayment funding is authorized for State Loan Repayment Programs. The Secretary can conduct demonstration projects at discretion. Reports for NAC meetings are available through HHS. Congress has influenced the NHSC to recruit a wide range of health professionals over the years. In 2002, Congress directed how NHSC funds would be used for health worker recruitment, with a focus on disadvantaged backgrounds. The HCSN Act of 2008 reauthorized NHSC programs and made significant changes, including allowing DC and U.S. territories to participate in the State Loan Repayment Program. The 2002 law rescinded automatic HPSA designation for certain facilities and required NHSC placement sites to promote training for clinicians. In 2009, the Senate Finance Committee discussed health workforce issues and suggested NHSC reforms to attract more qualified individuals to primary care. The NHSC may undergo reforms to attract more qualified individuals to primary care, with suggestions including providing better incentives and extending mandatory service periods in HPSAs. Legislators may consider holding hearings on the NHSC's role as a safety net program and its potential contribution to the health workforce. Previous hearings focused on health safety net programs, with less attention given to the NHSC. Annual appropriations hearings allow for deliberation on NHSC funding and the insertion of legislative directives. Legislative directives may be inserted without statutory action, directing the Secretary to address issues like health care reform, research opportunities, and NHSC clinician needs. Increasing the NHSC's workforce could expand primary care services for underserved populations under health insurance programs. The Massachusetts experience demonstrates the potential benefits of such workforce expansions. The Massachusetts experience highlights the importance of adequate financing for health insurance programs to ensure increased access to care. However, the lack of reliable data on the number of primary care providers in underserved areas hinders efforts to determine the actual need for health professionals, especially as the workforce increasingly includes nurses and physician assistants. NHSC administrators are working to accurately count primary health care workers in HPSAs to meet the benchmark ratio of physicians to population. Some argue for more accurate data on health worker shortages and federal support, while others advocate for increasing nurse practitioners to meet workforce needs. The Institute of Medicine recommends using NHSC as a model for workforce development programs. Proposals for a more robust NHSC with expanded healthcare delivery programs and increased financial resources are being considered. Attempts to expand the NHSC with demonstration projects for various healthcare professionals have faced resistance due to the program's focus on primary care clinicians. A 2001 HRSA-supported study found that the loan repayment program resulted in higher retention rates among NHSC clinicians compared to the scholarship program. The NHSC loan repayment program showed higher retention rates among clinicians compared to the scholarship program. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners reported greater job satisfaction and contributions to community programs than physicians. Clinicians in rural areas had higher job satisfaction than urban counterparts. Mature NHSC clinicians had higher retention rates than younger, less experienced ones. Loan repayment programs were deemed a better long-term investment than scholarships. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the NHSC is a vital safety net provider for vulnerable populations, but improvements are needed for its effectiveness. These include better identification of areas needing NHSC clinicians, improved placement processes, and coordination with other federal and state efforts. GAO has highlighted issues with recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals, with job dissatisfaction among nurses and nurse aides contributing to current and future shortages. More detailed data is needed for analysis and planning. Analysts call for more detailed data to define nursing shortages and better coordination of NHSC placements. In 2002, evaluators found NHSC's performance moderately effective in increasing access to healthcare for underserved populations. The NHSC has shown efficiency improvements by reallocating resources to hire more doctors and clinicians. Evaluators recommend more flexibility in funding allocation between scholarships and loans. However, outcome data for new measures is lacking. HPSA designations have steadily increased from CY2000 to CY2006, indicating a growing need for health professionals in underserved areas. Some argue that the current methodology for designating shortages does not accurately reflect provider-to-population ratios. The NHSC community awaits regulations for accurately identifying shortages of health workers and increasing access to underserved populations. The existing rule for provider-to-population ratios remains in effect, with a proposed rule from 2008 rescinded. Appendices provide data on NHSC workforce distribution, state loan repayors, and growth in designations for Health Professional Shortage Areas. The NHSC community is waiting for regulations to identify shortages of health workers and improve access to underserved populations. Data on NHSC workforce distribution, state loan repayors, and growth in Health Professional Shortage Areas designations are provided in the appendices."
