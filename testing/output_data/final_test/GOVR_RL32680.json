    "content": "There is no official government-wide definition of \"peer review,\" with agency-specific definitions varying. Peer review typically evaluates scientific or technical merit, including hypotheses, research design, data collection, methods, conclusions, and overall product quality. It has been used for centuries in the scientific community to assess the quality of science. Peer review is commonly used by federal agencies to evaluate research proposals and plays a major role in funding decisions. It is also utilized by editors of scientific publications to assess research reports and by research institutions for decisions on retention, promotion, and program reviews. Expert review, including peer review, is deemed the most effective means of evaluating federally funded research programs. Additionally, peer review is used for scientific and technical products related to policies to determine the validity of scientific findings. Peer review is crucial for evaluating scientific findings related to policies and regulations. It was established as EPA policy in 1993 and recommended for economic analyses with significant economic impacts. Reviewers should be experts in their field. Independent peer review is especially important in the regulatory arena to avoid conflicts of interest. Legislative proposals advocate the use of peer review in regulatory contexts to ensure the use of best available, peer-reviewed science. For example, the Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to use peer-reviewed science in decision-making. Bills like the Water Resources Development Act and the Sound Science for Endangered Species Act Planning Act have also emphasized the importance of peer review in decision-making processes. In the 106th Congress, bipartisan legislation (S. 746) was considered but not enacted, which would have required agencies to conduct independent peer reviews of risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses for major rules with significant economic impact. The reviews would involve panels with relevant expertise and independence from the agency, unless the agency and OMB Director certified adequate peer review had already been conducted. The General Accounting Office and recent presidential administrations have supported peer review for assessing scientific research to enhance quality and credibility. Agencies need to plan carefully for the reviews and ensure panels reflect all points of view.OMB and OSTP have encouraged funding peer-reviewed research over nonpeer-reviewed research for most scientific activities. The Clinton and Bush administrations supported peer review for scientific research, recognizing its costs in terms of resources and time. The Bush administration recommended independent, external peer review for economically significant rules, with criteria including disclosure of prior positions on the issues. Some observers have raised cautionary notes about peer review, citing concerns such as significant costs in terms of time and resources for agencies, potential diversion of resources from other areas, and opportunity costs for scientists performing reviews. Some concerns about peer review include variations in methods among federal agencies, lack of peer review for economic analyses of major rules, impact on regulatory activity pace, potential bias and balance issues in review panels. In June 2001, GAO reported limitations in EPA's Science Advisory Board policies for ensuring balance and independence of peer reviewers. The staff office did not consistently verify panel members' financial disclosures, leading to potential conflicts of interest. Panel members were not required to disclose previous positions on the matter being reviewed until after selection, hindering transparency and balance. GAO also found that the public was not adequately informed about the viewpoints represented on the panels. GAO made recommendations to ensure the Science Advisory Board's peer review panels are independent and balanced, emphasizing the need for procedural flexibility in federal agencies' peer review practices. The GAO emphasized the need for procedural flexibility in federal agencies' peer review practices, stating that uniform practices should not be dictated for all agencies or federally funded research. Agencies were found to view a variety of peer review methods as appropriate and essential, reflecting the varying nature of research. The final peer review bulletin was issued under the Information Quality Act and OMB's general authorities. The Information Quality Act (IQA) was enacted in December 2000 as part of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001. It required OMB to issue guidance to federal agencies to ensure the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated to the public. This act has been the subject of significant debate and controversy since its enactment. The Information Quality Act (IQA) required OMB to establish guidelines for information quality and correction mechanisms for agencies. OMB's final IQA guidelines in 2002 encouraged peer reviews for agency-disseminated information, but did not mandate them. Public could challenge data objectivity with a persuasive showing. The final IQA guidelines in 2002 encouraged peer reviews for agency-disseminated information, setting minimum standards for transparency. Executive Order 12866 and OMB's authority were cited as supporting the bulletin's issuance. OIRA within OMB is recognized as the repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues. The executive order in 2002 encouraged peer reviews for agency-disseminated information, emphasizing the importance of peer review for scientific and technical information relevant to regulatory policies. OMB proposed requiring peer review for crucial information, supplementing existing guidelines and agency-specific requirements. OMB's instructions carry substantial weight due to its authority to review regulatory information. OMB's bulletin proposed that covered federal agencies must have all significant regulatory information peer reviewed, especially significant information to higher standards, and provide OMB with yearly updates on upcoming scientific studies for peer review. The bulletin applies broadly to various types of agencies, including cabinet departments, independent agencies like the EPA, and regulatory agencies like the FCC and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The proposed bulletin by OMB requires federal agencies to peer review significant regulatory information that is influential and relevant to regulatory policies. The peer review should be scientifically rigorous and appropriate, depending on the novelty and impact of the information. The proposed bulletin by OMB requires federal agencies to peer review significant regulatory information that is influential and relevant to regulatory policies. The peer review should be scientifically rigorous and appropriate, depending on the novelty and impact of the information. The bulletin also outlines that peer review may not be necessary for certain types of information, such as national defense or foreign affairs-related data, or information disseminated during agency adjudications. Agencies can rely on independent peer reviews and may not need to reexamine studies that have already undergone peer review. The proposed bulletin by OMB requires federal agencies to peer review significant regulatory information that is influential and relevant to regulatory policies. Regulatory information should be subject to specific peer review requirements if it supports economically significant actions, affects public policies or private sector decisions, or is of significant interagency interest. Agencies must select peer reviewers based on scientific expertise and strive to appoint relevant reviewers. The OMB bulletin requires federal agencies to appoint independent peer reviewers with relevant expertise. Reviewers should not have conflicts of interest and agencies must provide them with necessary information for review. Interested parties can submit comments for consideration by peer reviewers. The OMB bulletin mandates federal agencies to appoint independent peer reviewers with relevant expertise, avoiding conflicts of interest. Agencies must provide necessary information to reviewers and consider comments from interested parties. Agencies are required to consult with OMB and OSTP on the sufficiency of their peer review policies and provide annual summaries of studies supporting regulatory information dissemination plans. The OMB bulletin requires agencies to appoint independent peer reviewers for regulatory information. Agencies must submit peer review plans to OMB, including contact information. Additional requirements include incorporating peer review guidelines for significant information, addressing factors for reviewer participation, protecting confidential information, and other provisions. The OMB bulletin mandates agencies to appoint independent peer reviewers for regulatory information, with requirements for peer review plans, disclosure of peer reviewer information, protection of confidential data, and potential waivers for compelling reasons. OMB extended the public comment period on the bulletin multiple times due to feedback received. The OMB received 187 comments on the proposed bulletin on peer review, with varying opinions. Supporters believed consistent use of peer review could enhance regulatory science credibility and protect science-based regulations from criticism and litigation. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Petrochemical & Refiners Association strongly supported OMB's proposed bulletin on peer review to improve the quality and consistency of federal agency implementation. Critics viewed the bulletin as an attempt to introduce political considerations into scientific decision-making. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) received public comments on its bulletin on peer review, with concerns raised about conflicts of interest and the need for the bulletin. Critics questioned the necessity of the bulletin and its impact on federal regulations. OMB received public comments on its bulletin on peer review, with concerns about conflicts of interest and the need for the bulletin. Commenters questioned the focus on \"regulatory\" information and the clarity of the bulletin's scope. OMB responded by revising the bulletin to focus on \"influential\" scientific information instead. OMB revised its bulletin on peer review to narrow the criteria for highly significant information, focusing on \"scientific assessments\" with a $500 million annual impact on public policies or private decisions. The requirements would cover models and data underlying regulatory impact analyses, but not the analyses themselves. Agencies are encouraged to have their regulatory impact analyses peer reviewed. OMB revised its bulletin on peer review to narrow the criteria for highly significant information, focusing on \"scientific assessments\" with a $500 million annual impact on public policies or private decisions. The bulletin exempts time-sensitive medical, public health, and safety disseminations and allows agency heads to waive or defer requirements as needed. Commenters raised concerns about prescriptive procedures and costly peer reviews, prompting OMB to give agencies more discretion in determining the level of peer review required. OMB revised its bulletin on peer review to give agencies more discretion in determining the level of peer review required for documents, emphasizing the importance of considering costs and benefits. The bulletin also incorporated suggestions for selecting peer reviewers from the public and scientific community. The revised OMB bulletin on peer review allows agencies to determine the level of peer review needed, emphasizing cost-benefit considerations. Concerns were raised about excluding qualified reviewers based on funding sources, with OMB clarifying that receiving research grants does not disqualify reviewers. Public participation in the peer review process was questioned, leading OMB to allow agencies to decide on public involvement. OMB revised the peer review bulletin to allow agencies to determine the level of peer review needed, emphasizing cost-benefit considerations. Concerns were raised about excluding qualified reviewers based on funding sources, with OMB clarifying that receiving research grants does not disqualify reviewers. Public participation in the peer review process was questioned, leading OMB to allow agencies to decide on public involvement. OMB estimated that about 125 \"influential\" scientific documents related to rulemaking and 1,250 other documents each year may require peer reviews. Some documents may be exempt or not require peer reviews. OMB estimated that the cost of peer reviews for 1,000 out of 1,250 documents would be $5 million, with an additional $1 million for 20 \"highly influential\" assessments. They acknowledged that these costs may be overestimates due to existing agency peer review practices. The response included an analysis providing a methodology for agencies to decide when a more expensive peer-review study by NAS would be cost-effective. OMB Watch questioned OMB's authority to issue a bulletin on peer review, suggesting that if government-wide peer review requirements are needed, OMB should submit its ideas to Congress for consideration. The American Bar Association recommended that OMB limit peer review to regulatory actions with impacts exceeding $100 million. The American Bar Association recommended that OMB limit peer review to regulatory actions with impacts exceeding $100 million, emphasizing the need for peer review only in complex, novel, or controversial scientific information. They also highlighted the importance of considering potential reviewers' funding sources from both government agencies and private entities. The American Association for the Advancement of Science expressed concerns about the selection criteria for reviewers in the bulletin. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) expressed concerns about the selection criteria for reviewers in the bulletin, stating that excluding qualified scientists based on advocacy could be problematic. They also opposed the proposed bulletin and requested its withdrawal. The AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies recommended evaluating the peer review program to determine its effectiveness. The AEI-Brookings Joint Center for Regulatory Studies recommended evaluating the peer review program to determine its effectiveness, suggesting that OMB should not proceed if a reasonable evaluation approach could not be developed. OMB released a revised bulletin in April 2004, which was seen as a partial retreat in their initiative, providing more agency discretion in peer review selection and clarifying that the guidance does not create new litigation rights. The revised bulletin in April 2004 allowed agencies to use scientists who had received research grants as peer reviewers, a practice discouraged in the proposed bulletin. The scope of the revised bulletin was broader, applying to \"influential scientific information\" beyond regulatory information. Certain types of information within this category were not required to undergo peer review. The revised bulletin in April 2004 expanded the scope to include \"influential scientific information\" and allowed agencies to use scientists who received research grants as peer reviewers. Certain types of information within this category were exempt from peer review requirements, including government-distributed information, responses to FOIA requests, and information related to national security or health. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 expanded to include \"influential scientific information\" and allowed agencies to waive requirements based on a compelling rationale. It required peer review for all influential scientific information and highly influential scientific assessments, with specific standards. The term \"influential scientific information\" was defined in the bulletin. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 expanded to include \"influential scientific information\" and allowed agencies to waive requirements based on a compelling rationale. It defined \"influential scientific information\" as having a clear impact on public policies or private sector decisions, not limited to regulatory policies. Agencies were given discretion to determine if prior peer reviews were adequate, considering the novelty and complexity of the science reviewed. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 expanded to include \"influential scientific information\" and allowed agencies to waive requirements based on a compelling rationale. It defined \"influential scientific information\" as having a clear impact on public policies or private sector decisions. The bulletin gave agencies discretion in determining the appropriate peer review mechanism for any information not previously reviewed, with the level of rigor dependent on the \"novelty and complexity of the science to be reviewed and the benefit and cost implications.\" Peer reviews could range from examinations by federal specialists to formal panels of independent experts. Panels were preferred when time and resources permitted their use. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 expanded to include \"influential scientific information\" and allowed agencies to waive requirements based on a compelling rationale. Peer reviewers were to be selected based on relevant expertise and not have participated in developing the product being reviewed. The bulletin also contained requirements to handle conflicts of interest and make peer reviewers' comments or a summary available to the public. OMB indicated that peer reviews were needed whenever an agency \"reasonably determines\" that scientific information will have a clear impact on important public policies or private sector decisions. The revised bulletin in April 2004 expanded to include \"influential scientific information\" and added specific peer review requirements for such assessments. However, agencies may still struggle to determine the impact of studies on public policies or private sector decisions, leading to inconsistent application of peer review. The revised bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific peer review requirements for \"influential scientific assessments,\" giving OMB and agencies authority to determine when enhanced peer reviews are necessary. The bulletin defined \"scientific assessment\" and \"highly influential scientific assessment\" to clarify their impact on public policies and private sector decisions. The revised bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific peer review requirements for \"influential scientific assessments,\" giving OMB and agencies authority to determine when enhanced peer reviews are necessary. The bulletin defined \"scientific assessment\" and \"highly influential scientific assessment\" to clarify their impact on public policies and private sector decisions. The proposed bulletin enhanced peer review requirements for information with a potential impact of more than $500 million in any year, or involving precedent-setting, novel, and complex approaches. The dollar threshold for enhanced peer review was increased from $100 million to $500 million, making the requirements more broadly applicable beyond just regulations. Additionally, the language regarding \"precedent setting, novel, and complex approaches\" replaced criteria where OMB alone could decide on enhanced peer review for certain information. The revised bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific peer review requirements for \"influential scientific assessments,\" giving OMB and agencies authority to determine when enhanced peer reviews are necessary. The bulletin defined criteria for selecting peer reviewers based on expertise, experience, and diversity of perspectives. Agencies were encouraged to request public nominations for reviewers and to exclude scientists employed by the agency sponsoring the review. The revised bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific peer review requirements for \"influential scientific assessments,\" emphasizing the selection of independent peer reviewers based on expertise, experience, and diversity of perspectives. It also allowed scientists who received research grants through a competitive process to serve on review panels, and agencies could commission external entities to manage the peer review process. The revised bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific peer review requirements for \"influential scientific assessments,\" emphasizing the selection of independent peer reviewers based on expertise, experience, and diversity of perspectives. It also allowed agencies to select peer reviewers and manage the process. The bulletin gave agencies discretion in the area of public comments, stating that agencies could decide whether to make information available for public comment and should consider public comment periods and meetings based on sufficient public interest. The revised bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific peer review requirements for \"influential scientific assessments,\" emphasizing the selection of independent peer reviewers based on expertise, experience, and diversity of perspectives. It also allowed agencies to select peer reviewers and manage the process. The bulletin emphasized the importance of providing peer reviewers with sufficient information to understand key findings and conclusions, requiring them to prepare a report with their findings and conclusions. Agencies were also required to respond to the report and post both documents on their website. Additionally, the bulletin mentioned alternative procedures for agencies to rely on scientific information. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific requirements for peer review of \"influential scientific assessments,\" giving OMB significant authority to decide when agencies should use more rigorous peer review. The bulletin allowed agencies to rely on scientific information produced by NAS, commission NAS for peer review, or use an alternative procedure approved by the OIRA Administrator in consultation with OSTP. Waivers for peer review requirements were permitted for influential assessments with a compelling rationale, but peer review should be conducted as soon as possible thereafter. The proposed bulletin did not include provisions for alternative procedures. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific requirements for peer review of \"influential scientific assessments,\" giving OMB significant authority to decide when agencies should use more rigorous peer review. The bulletin indicated that these procedures should be used for assessments with a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions exceeding $500 million, or involving novel and complex approaches. OMB could unilaterally determine if information is \"novel\" or \"complex\" to trigger additional peer review requirements. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific requirements for peer review of \"influential scientific assessments,\" giving OMB significant authority to decide when agencies should use more rigorous peer review. OMB retained authority over the peer review process, allowing agencies to notify OMB of upcoming studies triggering peer review requirements and post an \"agenda\" on their website every six months for information disseminations subject to peer review. The revised peer review bulletin in April 2004 introduced specific requirements for peer review of \"influential scientific assessments,\" giving OMB significant authority to decide when agencies should use more rigorous peer review. The bulletin required detailed descriptions of peer review plans, including selection of reviewers, public nomination opportunities, and public comment on reviewed information. Agencies were also required to establish a mechanism for public comments on the adequacy of peer reviews. The OMB introduced specific requirements for peer review of \"influential scientific assessments\" in April 2004, allowing public comments on the adequacy of peer review plans. 57 individuals and organizations commented on the revised peer review bulletin, with most supportive of the changes made. Some felt the changes were not enough, while others believed they weakened the bulletin. The National Academy of Sciences praised the revision in a statement released on April 15, 2004. The National Academy of Sciences praised the revision of the peer review bulletin in April 2004, stating it would improve the government's scientific assessments and decision-making. OMB Watch filed a comment criticizing the bulletin for lacking authority and not addressing fundamental complaints. OMB Watch criticized the government-wide peer review problem and recommended transferring some responsibilities to the National Academy of Sciences. They expressed concerns that the revised bulletin would hinder government scientists' participation in peer reviews and cause delays in the regulatory process. OMB Watch suggested that OMB withdraw the bulletin and convene an interagency committee to address peer review flaws. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised concerns about the revised bulletin, stating it had fundamental problems that needed resolution before they could support its issuance. They criticized the blanket exemption for NAS peer reviews, excessive agency discretion, lack of provisions for contesting agency determinations, and insufficient limitations on proprietary information. The Chamber believed the changes made by OMB were severe and eliminated the public benefit of the bulletin. The revised bulletin issued by OMB faced criticism from Members of Congress for being unjustified, overly broad, burdensome, and lacking safeguards against conflicts of interest. They argued that the exemptions created an unbalanced approach, imposed new burdens on agencies, and failed to ensure the integrity of the reviewer selection process. The Members of Congress criticized the OMB bulletin for lacking transparency in disclosing conflicts of interest and hindering government information dissemination. They called it a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" designed to stifle public debate and delay regulatory action. AAAS raised concerns about scientists seeking exemptions from peer review requirements and suggested giving agencies full authority over their peer review procedures. The OMB bulletin was advised to include a disclaimer, agencies should disclose criteria for selecting peer reviewers, and an interagency working group on peer review was recommended to report annually to the public. AAAS praised OMB for addressing scientific community concerns, with other scientific societies also commenting on the issue. Several scientific societies praised the revised peer review bulletin for being more flexible and responsive. In July 2004, a consortium of 13 scientific societies released a statement emphasizing the importance of scientific peer review in policy development and providing considerations for well-designed agency peer reviews. The importance of scientific peer review was emphasized by scientific societies, highlighting the need for independence from politics and the recognition of cultural differences among scientists, policymakers, and the public. It was noted that peer review does not provide a definitive answer for policy decisions due to the inherent uncertainty in science. The integrity of reviewers and professional standards are crucial for effective peer review. OMB released its final bulletin on peer review on December 15, 2004, with minor revisions responsive to public comments. The bulletin requires agencies to disclose peer reviewers' names for influential scientific information and highly influential scientific assessments but does not mandate disclosure of specific reviewer comments. It includes an annual reporting requirement for tracking agency compliance and expects public monitoring. Agencies must designate peer review plans in advance. The final bulletin on peer review released by OMB on December 15, 2004, requires agencies to designate whether peer reviews are \"influential scientific information\" or \"highly influential scientific assessments.\" It provides criteria for what constitutes a \"highly influential scientific assessment\" and clarifies the $500 million impact test. The exemption for time-sensitive health or safety information has been broadened, and agencies must follow the National Academy of Sciences policy for committee selection regarding conflicts of interest. The final bulletin on peer review released by OMB on December 15, 2004, includes changes such as clarifying language on prior peer review, encouraging public participation in reviews, reinstating instructions for peer reviewers to focus on scientific and technical questions, and allowing a rare exception for government premier reviews. The OMB's peer review bulletin, released on December 15, 2004, allows a premier government scientist to participate in peer reviews under certain circumstances. This bulletin is expected to have a significant impact on federal rulemaking and public policy, both directly through enforcement by agencies and indirectly through references in legislation like the Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004. The revised peer review bulletin clarifies that scientists receiving research grants from the agency can still serve as peer reviewers. Exemptions are provided for time-sensitive information, but some issues remain unclear, such as agency discretion and the overall impact on federal peer review practices. The final peer review bulletin gives federal agencies discretion in determining if peer review is needed for specific products, considering factors like novelty and complexity of the science. It no longer requires compliance with all bulletin requirements for an \"adequate\" peer review. The bulletin emphasizes the importance of considering information as \"influential scientific information.\" The final bulletin emphasizes the importance of considering information as \"influential scientific information\" and provides guidelines for selecting peer reviewers with expertise and diversity. OMB has discretion in requiring more rigorous procedures for \"highly influential scientific assessments\" with significant impacts. The OMB has the authority to approve agency decisions with a potential impact of over $500 million, or those that are novel, controversial, or of significant interagency interest. They can also approve alternative peer review procedures. The level of agency discretion and OMB control in peer review programs will vary between administrations. OMB stated that stronger peer review policies were necessary due to the variability in peer review practices across agencies. The OMB has established minimum standards for when peer review is required for scientific information, but the final bulletin may lack consistency in definition and implementation. The bulletin leaves key terms undefined and gives agencies discretion in selecting reviewers, potentially leading to inconsistency in procedures. The OMB's bulletin on peer review standards may face resistance from federal agencies due to concerns about power aggregation. Some commenters worry about the impact of new peer review requirements on the federal rulemaking process and the cost to agencies. Senators Lieberman and Durbin question the cost-benefit analysis of the requirements. OMB provided estimates in the preamble to the revised bulletin indicating that it did not believe the costs of peer reviews would be prohibitive to agencies. However, little empirical data is available on the cost and impact of peer reviews on the federal rulemaking process. There are concerns that the requirements could delay regulatory action, and it is recommended that an evaluation be built into the peer review program to assess its effect on regulatory analyses. An evaluation is needed to determine the impact of the new peer review requirements on regulatory analyses. This evaluation should consider the cost to federal agencies, the pace of rulemaking, and the potential benefits of peer review in reducing judicial challenges and improving rule quality. Factors to consider in evaluating the impact of peer review on the regulatory process include a comparison of proposed, revised, and final peer review bulletins."
