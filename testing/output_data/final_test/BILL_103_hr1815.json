Congress recognizes the importance of recreational hunting for wildlife conservation and management, as well as the valuable input provided by hunters in decision-making processes. Recreational hunting supports the national economy through sales of sporting goods and provides funding for wildlife conservation. Disruptive activities aim to interfere with lawful hunting on Federal lands, endangering both hunters and disrupting wildlife management. Federal and State wildlife management agencies conduct wildlife population and habitat management programs, which may alter program objectives leading to undesirable activity patterns, endangerment of wildlife species viability, and habitat damage. Federal lands are crucial wildlife habitat resources supporting diverse populations and offering opportunities for legal recreational hunting as a management tool for wildlife viability. The right of US citizens to enjoy recreational hunting on Federal lands is important for wildlife management. Ambiguity in State laws can affect the safety and legal rights of hunters participating in lawful hunts on Federal lands. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Federal lands\" include national forests, public lands, national parks, and wildlife refuges. \"Lawful hunt\" refers to the legal taking or harvesting of wildlife or fish on Federal lands during a specified legal season, authorized or licensed by the State and not prohibited by federal law. The term \"national forest\" refers to lands in the National Forest System, while \"national park\" includes lands and waters in the national park system. \"Public lands\" have the same meaning as defined in the Act. The term \"public lands\" is defined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for national forests and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands, national parks, and wildlife refuges. A \"wildlife refuge\" includes lands and waters in the National Wildlife Refuge System. SEC. 4. OBSTRUCTION OF A LAWFUL HUNT.

Upon receiving a written complaint alleging a violation of section 4 from a federal officer, the Secretary will forward it to the United States Attorney and request the Attorney General to initiate a civil action for imposing and collecting specified civil penalties.

The Pitman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act, approved in 1937, supports wildlife restoration projects and activities by State wildlife management agencies. The funds can also be used to enhance wildlife management programs on Federal, private, or State-owned lands. The efforts will benefit wildlife management objectives on Federal lands. SEC. 6. OTHER RELIEF. Injunctive relief can be sought by the head of a State agency, the Attorney General, or any affected person or organization for violations of section 4. Damages and attorney's fees can be recovered in civil actions. SEC. 7. RELATIONSHIP TO STATE AND LOCAL LAW AND CIVIL ACTIONS. SEC. 7. RELATIONSHIP TO STATE AND LOCAL LAW AND CIVIL ACTIONS.
