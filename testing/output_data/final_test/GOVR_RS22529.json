    "content": "The NATO summit in Riga, Latvia in 2006 focused on consolidating support for existing initiatives, particularly in Afghanistan. Key allies emphasized the need for political will, troops, and financing to stabilize Afghanistan over the next five years. Discussions also revolved around enhancing military capabilities, developing multinational cooperation, and addressing partnerships with non-member governments. NATO's mission in Afghanistan, led by ISAF since 2003, aims to subdue the Taliban and create a secure environment for economic reconstruction. The U.S.-led Operation Enduring Freedom targets Al Qaeda remnants. The alliance sees ISAF as crucial in adapting to new global threats like terrorism, involving both NATO and non-NATO states. The alliance, including countries like Australia and Japan, is focused on transforming capabilities with deployable forces and advanced technologies, seen in Afghanistan. There is concern about the future of Afghanistan due to a Taliban insurgency and waning support for President Hamid Karzai's government. NATO faces challenges balancing combat missions with stabilization efforts, emphasizing the need for development and nation-building. NATO Secretary General emphasizes the importance of meeting assistance pledges for stabilization efforts, particularly through Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT). ISAF's stabilization effort in Afghanistan is carried out by Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) operated by NATO. PRTs focus on providing security, reconstruction projects like building roads and hospitals, and supporting regional officials to extend Kabul's authority. The success of ISAF hinges on the Karzai government's ability to establish good governance in a country plagued by corruption, tribal conflicts, and a thriving narcotics trade. NATO has 37,000 troops in ISAF, with a significant portion from the United States, primarily deployed in the south to combat the Taliban and warlords. NATO commanders have requested more troops to combat the insurgency in southern Afghanistan, but member states are hesitant due to public concerns over casualties and troop availability. National \"caveats\" restrict the use of forces, with some countries only allowing their troops to operate in stable northern Afghanistan. There is also no mobile ISAF emergency force in Afghanistan for rapid deployment. At the NATO summit, France and Italy lifted their caveats, allowing their forces to fight where needed in Afghanistan. However, Germany refused to lift its caveats. NATO faces challenges in deploying troops quickly due to the lack of a mobile ISAF emergency force. In Kosovo, KFOR has been maintaining security since 1999 under a U.N. mandate amidst efforts to resolve Kosovo's final status. The final status of Kosovo is likely to be independence from Serbia, but may not be fully accepted by Kosovo Albanians and Serb minority. NATO forces, numbering 17,000, may remain for a period. NATO also supports missions in Darfur, Iraq, and the Mediterranean, with the NATO Response Force (NRF) declared fully operational at the Riga summit. The NRF is a high-readiness force of 20,000-25,000 soldiers able to deploy within 5-30 days. The NATO Response Force (NRF) is a flexible high-readiness force of 20,000-25,000 soldiers that can deploy within 5-30 days. There is debate within NATO about the types of missions the NRF should engage in, with some advocating for combat missions only and others supporting humanitarian assistance. The issue of funding NATO operations has also been raised, with the current system of \"costs lie where they fall\" leading to disproportionate costs for some member governments, acting as a disincentive for participation. At Riga, NATO allies proposed proportional cost-sharing for operations and joint equipment maintenance. A Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) was formed in 2006 to buy transport planes for NATO operations. An initiative to develop a core of Special Operations Forces (SOF) was also launched at Riga. NATO is building forces for irregular warfare, utilizing Special Operations Forces (SOF) heavily in operations like Afghanistan. Joint use of SOF can be challenging due to different government signatures. NATO is engaging countries facing similar threats to enhance security, driven by global terrorism and WMD proliferation. The alliance aims for closer consultation and joint operations with non-member governments to address common needs alongside international organizations like the U.N. and the EU. NATO is working with international organizations and non-member states like Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in Afghanistan. Some NATO governments are hesitant about partnership programs, particularly concerning Israel's involvement and dilution of the alliance's \"Atlantic\" nature. The Partnership for Peace program at Riga saw a surprise development with Serbia's entry, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. This move was made to mitigate potential backlash if Kosovo gains independence. The EU still prohibits Serbian associate status. Critics feel the Riga summit achieved little beyond consolidating existing initiatives. NATO member governments are stretched thin with operations in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Darfur, Africa, and Lebanon. Training missions and capability enhancements are ongoing. The development of partnership and training missions in non-member states have absorbed resources at NATO. Political discussions focus on energy security, threats from Iran and North Korea, and protecting vulnerable pipelines. There is a lack of consensus on whether NATO should manage Iran's nuclear program or if energy security should be left to market forces or the EU. Senator Lugar proposed energy security as an Article V mission. The bills introduced by Representative Tanner and Senator Lugar (H.R. 987 and S. 494) endorse further enlargement of NATO, stating that NATO remains open to qualified candidates. The bills encourage Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia to continue working towards membership and note the interest of Georgia and Ukraine in joining. However, the three candidate states have recently faced challenges in meeting the requirements for membership, including modernizing their militaries and combating corruption. The governments of Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia have made progress in establishing democratic institutions and desire NATO and EU membership. Some European allies are hesitant about further enlargement due to \"enlargement fatigue\" in the European Union. There is concern about \"enlargement fatigue\" in the European Union regarding further enlargement, as member governments worry about diluting the Union's identity and complicating decision-making. NATO faces similar challenges with decision-making becoming more complex due to membership growth. Issues include relations with the European Union, consensus on missions, and considering Ukraine and Georgia as prospective candidate states. The Bush Administration considered proposing advancing Ukraine and Georgia to the MAP process, but some European allies, like Germany and France, are hesitant due to concerns about damaging relations with Russia. Ukraine's potential NATO membership is divisive, with the current Prime Minister opposing it. Georgia faces border and ethnic conflicts, complicating its path to a MAP. The allies offered Georgia an \"Intensified Dialogue\" in 2006 as a step towards potential NATO membership. In 2006, Congress held hearings on NATO issues including Afghanistan conflict, partnerships, capabilities, and political will to counter terrorism and proliferation. Senator Lugar introduced bills on energy security and NATO enlargement. NATO and energy security are emerging issues for the alliance. The \"NATO Freedom Consolidation Act of 2006,\" S. 4014, passed the Senate but no action was taken in the House. Two bills are currently before Congress on the issue of NATO enlargement."
