    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Campus-Based Underage Alcohol Use Reduction Act\" and includes findings related to underage alcohol use on campuses. Congress finds that underage drinking is illegal in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with enforcement efforts needed to reduce underage drinking. Data shows negative consequences of youth alcohol use, including risks of impairment, traffic fatalities, violence, suicide, and unprotected sex. Additionally, a significant portion of alcohol consumption in the US is by underage youth. According to reports, over 11 percent of youth engage in alcohol abuse, with college presidents citing it as the top health issue on campuses. Two out of five college students are binge drinkers, leading to 1,400 alcohol-related deaths annually, 70,000 students experiencing alcohol-related sexual assault, and 500,000 students getting injured under alcohol influence each year. Interventions can help reduce underage drinking and its associated problems. Positive outcomes can be achieved by combining environmental and institutional change with theory-based health education in a comprehensive, community-based approach. Grants aimed at reducing alcohol abuse in higher education are addressed in Section 3. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities to reduce underage alcohol use and binge drinking among higher education students. Eligible entities must submit an application outlining coalition building, targeting underage students, and ensuring implementation of the program. The eligible entity applying for grants must provide a list of coalition members, describe collaboration with state agencies on substance abuse prevention, outline the expected impact on reducing underage alcohol use, and detail outreach strategies to reach students and address community norms. Each eligible entity receiving a grant must use the funds for activities outlined in their application. The Secretary will establish achievement indicators to measure the impact of statewide coalitions on higher education institutions and communities, including changes in alcohol incidents. The grant funds provided under this Act must be used to supplement, not supplant, existing Federal and non-Federal funds for activities related to measuring the impact of statewide coalitions on higher education institutions and communities. Eligible entities include States, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit entities. The curr_chunk defines key terms such as \"institution of higher education,\" \"Secretary,\" \"State,\" and \"statewide coalition.\" The curr_chunk discusses a substance abuse prevention group targeting underage students at institutions of higher education and surrounding communities. It also limits administrative expenses to 5% of the grant. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 2006, with additional funding for fiscal years 2007 through 2010."
