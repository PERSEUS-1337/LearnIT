    "content": "The Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act of 2004 is also known as the \"Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act\". It excludes certain forgiven mortgage obligations from gross income. The Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act of 2004 amends the Internal Revenue Code to include qualified residential indebtedness as excluded from gross income. Special rules and limitations apply to this type of indebtedness. The Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act of 2004 excludes qualified residential indebtedness from gross income, subject to specific limitations. The exclusion amount is determined by subtracting the outstanding principal amount of the indebtedness from the sum of the realized amount from the sale of the property securing the debt (minus sale costs) and the outstanding principal amount of any other debt secured by the property. The Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act of 2004 excludes qualified residential indebtedness up to $50,000 from gross income. Qualified residential indebtedness is debt incurred in connection with a principal residence and secured by real property used for acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or substantial improvement. The Mortgage Cancellation Relief Act of 2004 excludes qualified residential indebtedness up to $50,000 from gross income. This includes debt related to a principal residence secured by real property for acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or substantial improvement. Refinanced indebtedness is also included, with exceptions for qualified farm or real property business indebtedness. Regulations may disallow exclusions in certain cases. The amendment to section 108 of the Tax Code prioritizes the insolvency exclusion over other exclusions like qualified farm or real property business exclusions. This change addresses cases where failure to repay debt is due to the taxpayer's bad faith. The Tax Code amendment adds a new paragraph to prioritize the insolvency exclusion over other exclusions for the discharge of indebtedness related to a principal residence. This change applies to discharges after the enactment of the Act."
