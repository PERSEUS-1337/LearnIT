    "content": "The \"Holocaust Rail Justice Act\" is the short title of this Act. Congressional findings are outlined in the following section. Congress finds that during World War II, thousands of Jews and others were deported from France to Nazi concentration camps on trains operated by SNCF. US citizens, including servicemen shot down over France, were among those deported. Lawsuits have been filed against SNCF in the US seeking redress for these actions. The complaint alleges that SNCF, a separate entity during WWII, operated deportation trains for profit, collaborating with the Nazi regime. They provided rolling stock, scheduled departures, and charged ordinary fares for deportations. The plaintiffs accuse SNCF of herding people into overcrowded train cars without food, water, or sanitary facilities, leading to deaths during transit. The trains were cleaned after each trip, removing the corpses of those who perished. The destination was camps where deportees faced extermination, forced labor, or inhumane conditions, violating the Principles of the Nuremberg Tribunal. SNCF aided and abetted war crimes and crimes against humanity by deporting people to camps where they faced extermination or forced labor. The company has not compensated the deportees or their heirs, and its records on deportation trains are not accessible to the public. SNCF tried to dismiss the lawsuit citing sovereign immunity. SNCF, a large corporation, earns millions in the US but lacks sovereign immunity in France. Lawsuit dismissed, appealed, remanded, and ultimately SNCF granted immunity. Conduct during war crimes condemned. The lawsuit against SNCF for transporting thousands to death camps during WWII was dismissed due to lack of legal redress in Federal court today. The case presents important issues for US citizens and veterans, many of whom are elderly and unable to travel abroad to pursue their claims. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 is relevant to this lawsuit. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 did not prevent a lawsuit against SNCF for its actions during World War II. Access to United States courts for Holocaust deportees is addressed in Section 3. The United States district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions for damages related to deportation to Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1944, brought against railroads that owned or operated the trains. Other laws do not apply to these cases. The United States district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions for damages related to deportation to Nazi concentration camps between 1942 and 1944, brought against railroads that owned or operated the trains. Sections 1330 and 1601 through 1611 of title 28, United States Code, or any other law limiting the jurisdiction of the United States courts, shall not preclude any action under subsection (a). An action described in subsection (a) shall not be barred by a defense that the time for bringing such action has expired under a statute of limitations. This section applies to any action pending on January 1, 2002, and to any action commenced on or after that date. The Secretary of State is required to submit a one-time report to Congress on access to wartime records of railroads involved in deportations to Nazi concentration camps from 1942 to 1944, in efforts to educate on the Holocaust and anti-Semitism globally."
