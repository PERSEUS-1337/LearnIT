    "content": "The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to include a Matching Grant Program for School Security under Subpart 1. This amendment also introduces the School Resource and Safety Officer Grant Program under Subpart 2, with defined terms in Section 2711. In this subpart, key terms are defined including 'career law enforcement officer', 'Director', 'Indian tribe', 'school', and 'school resource and safety officer'. The term 'school resource and safety officer' refers to a career law enforcement officer deployed in community oriented policing to protect schools for at least 75% of their duty time. The term 'unit of local government' refers to a county, municipality, town, township, village, parish, borough, or other government unit below the State level. \"SEC. 2712. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Director can grant funds to local governments and tribes for school resource and safety officers. The grants are to be used for hiring and training law enforcement officers for school security. The maximum grant amount per officer or training program is $200,000. The Director may issue a waiver for the hiring or training program funded under a grant. Funds can be available for up to 3 fiscal years, with the possibility of renewal if used as required and financial need is demonstrated. The Director may reserve up to 2 percent of funds for administrative costs. Funds must not supplant existing funds and should be used to increase the total amount available. The Director shall establish guidelines for training school resource and safety officers to distinguish between minor disciplinary infractions and major security problems, and to use alternatives to law enforcement involvement in school disciplinary measures. Grants under this subpart will be awarded with an emphasis on equitable distribution. The Director shall ensure equitable geographic distribution among regions of the United States and urban, suburban, and rural areas. SEC. 2713. APPLICATIONS. To request a grant under this subpart, the chief executive of a unit of local government or Indian tribe must submit an application to the Director with detailed explanations of fund usage, prevention of school violence, and improvement of student and school safety. The application should also demonstrate the ability to enhance safety without Federal assistance and include a memorandum of understanding with the law enforcement agency providing school resource and safety. The Director will establish guidelines within 90 days of enactment to implement the section regarding the responsibilities of school staff and faculty in disciplinary actions. The Director is required to submit an annual report to Congress on grants funded under this subpart, including the number of grants, funds allocated, and the support for school resource officers. Recipients of funds must also submit reports on their activities. Authorization of appropriations is outlined in Section 2715. \"Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2014 through 2023 is outlined in Section 2715.\""
