    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Wild and Scenic Rivers Act\". The Congress designated a 29-mile segment of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers for study of potential addition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The study determined that all three segments of these rivers are eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System based on their free-flowing condition. The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers are eligible for National Wild and Scenic River Designation based on their free-flowing condition and various values. The towns adjacent to the segments have shown support for the designation through town meeting votes. A comprehensive management plan has been prepared to ensure long-term protection of the rivers' values and compatible land management. The Study Committee recommended including the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System for management according to the River Conservation Plan. SEC. 3. WILD, SCENIC, AND RECREATIONAL RIVER DESIGNATION. Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate 29 miles of river segments in Massachusetts, including the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers, as scenic and recreational river segments. These segments will be administered accordingly. The designated river segments in Massachusetts will be administered by the SUASCO River Stewardship Council in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior. The management will be done through cooperative agreements with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its political subdivisions, following the \"Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Wild and Scenic River Study, River Conservation Plan\" dated March 16, 1995. Federal funding will support these activities. The Federal Government will fund up to 50% of activity costs under the Plan, including in-kind contributions. A SUASCO River Stewardship Council will be established by the Secretary of the Interior to oversee long-term protection and implementation of the Plan. The SUASCO River Stewardship Council, established by the Secretary of the Interior, will oversee the implementation of the Plan. The Council's responsibilities and administrative procedures are outlined in the Plan, and it is not considered a Federal advisory committee. The Director of the National Park Service or their designee will represent the Secretary in implementing the Plan and reviewing federally assisted water resources projects affecting the established segments. The Director shall offer cooperative agreements with relevant entities for the protection and enhancement of the segment, providing technical assistance and funding as needed. Implementation of the Plan is limited to a total cost of $100,000 per fiscal year to the Federal Government. Segments not part of the National Park System shall not become part of it, be managed by it, or be subject to its regulations. Water resources projects must be evaluated for adverse effects on the segment's values. The Secretary will consider the project's impact on the values of segments in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, with a focus on consistency with the Plan. The Plan, including the Water Resources Study, will be the main source of information on necessary flows for resource protection and water withdrawals. Land management in specific towns will be governed by zoning bylaws. The towns of Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Lincoln, Concord, Carlisle, Bedford, and Billerica in Massachusetts are deemed to satisfy standards under section 6(c) as 'villages'. Federal acquisition of lands along segments or tributaries is prohibited under this provision. The provision prohibits Federal acquisition of land along specified segments, without establishing distinct lateral boundaries, and authorizes funding of up to $100,000 per fiscal year for implementation."
