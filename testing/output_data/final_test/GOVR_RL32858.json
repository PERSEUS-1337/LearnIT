These systems should support electronic collection and exchange of patient information as part of a national health information infrastructure. The U.S. healthcare industry lags behind in IT investment compared to other sectors. The healthcare industry lags in IT investment despite the benefits it can bring. Congress and the Administration are working on creating incentives for adoption. Key steps have been taken, such as establishing electronic prescription standards and a Commission for Systemic Interoperability. President Bush has called for widespread adoption of health IT. President Bush called for widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) in 2004, leading to the establishment of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT). ONCHIT developed a 10-year plan to transform healthcare delivery by adopting EHRs and creating a National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII). Policy options for incentivizing EHR adoption included grants, low-rate loans, amending federal rules, and using Medicare reimbursement. Lawmakers in the 109th Congress were considering these options. In the 109th Congress, lawmakers are likely to consider legislation to boost federal investment in health IT, provide incentives for EHR adoption, and create regional health information networks. The groundwork for the NHII was laid out in the 1996 HIPAA, which instructed the HHS Secretary to develop privacy and security standards for electronic patient information. Recently proposed and enacted legislation aims to promote EHR use and NHII development, highlighting the benefits of expanding information application. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits and barriers of broadening the application of information technology in healthcare, the federal government's goals for health IT adoption, and a framework proposed by the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. It emphasizes the importance of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in providing real-time access to patient information and a complete record of care. Electronic Health Records (EHR) provide a complete longitudinal record of care, allowing physicians to update patient information continuously. Integrated EHR systems include medical history, diagnostic reports, medications, allergies, and preventive services schedule. Linking EHR to Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems offers real-time diagnostic and treatment recommendations, supporting evidence-based medicine with up-to-date medical knowledge at the point of care. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems, integrated with Electronic Health Records (EHR), provide real-time diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on up-to-date medical knowledge. Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) minimizes errors by allowing providers to enter orders electronically, including medications, diagnostic procedures, referrals, discharges, and transfers. A National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) includes electronic connectivity for exchanging patient health information securely and promoting interoperability between IT systems. The critical goal of interoperability is the ability of IT systems to communicate and exchange health data. Various communities and healthcare systems have established secure platforms for this purpose. The IOM's report emphasized the need for improvement in key areas of healthcare quality. IT can play a significant role in enhancing quality of care. Health IT can improve quality of care by reducing errors in drug prescribing, improving efficiency, promoting compliance with guidelines, and enhancing coordination of care. It is especially beneficial for underserved populations and helps reduce geographic variability in access to quality care. Specialty information can be accessed in real-time, promoting an equitable healthcare system. Physicians can improve care coordination for Americans with multiple chronic conditions, reducing hospitalizations and adverse reactions. Health IT infrastructure supports national objectives like homeland security and public health services, aiding in disease outbreak detection and vaccination campaigns. Additionally, it is crucial for biomedical research and health services. The importance of IT in biomedical research and health services is highlighted, with a focus on the slow integration of electronic information systems in the U.S. healthcare industry. Despite the potential benefits, obstacles such as lack of interoperability standards hinder the development of electronic health records and community-based health information networks. The slow development of electronic health records in the U.S. healthcare industry is hindered by a lack of interoperability standards. The federal government is leading efforts to encourage the adoption of common standards for exchanging health information among providers. The Health Informatics (CHI) initiative is part of the eGov initiatives supporting President Bush's Management Agenda. Its goal is to establish federal health information interoperability standards for sharing information across federal departments and serving as a model for the private sector. Agencies have adopted 20 sets of standards, including messaging, clinical lab results, retail pharmacy transactions, and image retrieval. HHS has also licensed SNOMED CT, a standardized medical vocabulary. SNOMED CT, available through the National Library of Medicine, is a comprehensive clinical vocabulary that helps structure medical records and improve data consistency for patient care and research. The Institute of Medicine provided guidance on essential functionalities for electronic health records, focusing on information availability and decision support capabilities. The guidance did not address specific data standards like terminology or diagnostic codes. Health Level Seven (HL7) has incorporated core functionalities identified by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) into its draft EHR standard, undergoing a two-year trial before official approval. Coordinating patient care from multiple providers does not require transmitting the entire EHR; ASTM International is developing the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) with key patient information for continuity of care. The Continuity of Care Record (CCR) contains essential patient information for continuity of care, such as provider details, insurance information, health status, recent care provided, and recommendations for future care. It allows for the exchange of clinical information among providers and can be used as a brief summary of recent care. The groundwork for establishing an National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII) was laid out by Congress through HIPAA in 1996. The NHII aims to establish data standards and security measures for electronic health data exchange. Privacy standards under HIPAA give individuals access to their medical information and restrict unauthorized use or disclosure. Concerns exist about the scope of privacy standards in protecting patient data. Financial obstacles hinder the adoption of electronic health records. Financial obstacles, including investment costs and misalignment between costs and benefits, hinder the adoption of EHR and the development of an NHII. The investment in IT, such as a full clinical IT system, can cost tens of millions of dollars for a large hospital, with additional costs for training and support. Small physician practices may find the start-up and maintenance costs of IT systems particularly burdensome, with an average cost of an EHR ranging from $16,000 to $36,000. Physicians face barriers in adopting IT systems due to technology complexity, implementation time, and changes in workflow patterns. The perception that IT benefits mainly payers and patients, not providers, adds to the challenge. Physician reimbursement systems prioritize volume over quality, incentivizing billable services rather than quality care. Investing in clinical IT systems can improve patient care and reduce complications. Physicians may benefit from direct payments for using IT systems or a pay-for-performance scheme rewarding quality care. Federal laws may hinder electronic connectivity in healthcare, causing uncertainty among providers. The Medicare physician self-referral (Stark) law and anti-kickback law are of chief concern. The Stark law prohibits physicians from referring patients to entities they have financial relationships with, while the anti-kickback law prohibits offering or accepting remuneration to induce patient referrals or purchases of services covered by federal health care programs. These laws discourage arrangements promoting the adoption of health IT in healthcare. On March 26, 2004, CMS published an interim rule creating exceptions under the physician self-referral law for IT items and services to enable participation in health information systems. President Bush called for widespread adoption of interoperable EHRs within 10 years and established the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. David Brailer, a health IT expert, was appointed to the position. David Brailer, MD, PhD, a leading health IT expert, was appointed by President Bush to the position of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Brailer, along with Thompson, released a strategic plan in 2004 to transform healthcare delivery by adopting EHRs and creating a National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII). The framework emphasized a bottom-up approach, with HHS promoting private sector involvement in building community-level networks to eventually connect and form an NHII. The plan outlined four major goals with strategic action areas, including informing clinical practice. The strategic plan released in 2004 by David Brailer and Thompson outlined four major goals for transforming healthcare delivery through EHR adoption and creating a National Health Information Infrastructure (NHII). These goals include informing clinical practice, interconnecting physicians, personalizing health care, and improving population health. Key strategies involve incentivizing EHR adoption, building interoperable health information infrastructure, empowering individuals to manage their wellness, and enhancing timely collection and analysis of health data. The final goal of improving population health through timely collection, analysis, and dissemination of clinical information is essential for evaluating healthcare delivery, public health monitoring, and biosurveillance. Various policy options are suggested to incentivize Electronic Health Record (EHR) adoption, such as regional grants, low-rate loans, updating federal rules, using Medicare reimbursements, and funding pay-for-performance programs. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) signed into law in 2003 also plays a role in this initiative. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 included provisions for electronic prescribing standards, medication history, and decision support for drug interactions. It also called for the establishment of a commission to develop health IT data standards and authorized IT grants for physicians. Despite bipartisan support, no further action was taken on the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act in the 108th Congress. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions unanimously approved a patient safety bill (S. 544) in March 2005, which encourages reporting of medical errors and establishes confidentiality protections. The bill also requires the adoption of national interoperability standards for health care information exchange. The House-passed bill in the 108th Congress included health IT grants for physicians and hospitals, and the creation of a Medical Information Technology Advisory Board (MITAB). Several bills were introduced to boost federal investment in IT for EHR adoption and the development of a NHII, with quality-of-care provisions. In the 109th Congress, two health IT bills have been introduced, including the National Health Information Incentive Act of 2005 (H.R. 747) and S. 2907. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, various health IT bills were introduced to encourage the adoption of health information technology. Tables compare incentives in different bills, while detailed summaries of patient safety and health IT provisions are provided. Legislation like H.R. 663 and H.R. 877 aimed to amend the Medicare statute and apply to hospitals. The Ways and Means bill would amend the Medicare statute for hospitals and health care facilities under Medicare Part A, while the Energy and Commerce measure would have broader coverage under the Public Health Service Act. Following negotiations, it was agreed that the new law should be written into the PHS Act, and the Energy and Commerce bill would be brought to the full House for consideration. The first National Report on Healthcare Disparities was released on Dec. 22, 2003, focusing on disparities in health care delivery related to racial and socioeconomic factors in priority populations. The report is available online."
