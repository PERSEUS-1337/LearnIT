    "content": "Radioactive materials are used worldwide for various purposes, but their security is lacking, especially in foreign countries. Terrorists could create a radiological dispersal device (RDD) by obtaining radioactive material and detonating an explosive next to it, causing contamination, economic disruption, and long-term health effects. This report examines radiation effects, prevention measures, response strategies, and recovery plans for Congress to consider. Gamma rays are emitted by radioactive decay and are a form of ionizing radiation that can damage living cells. Higher doses of radiation increase the risk of cancer, radiation sickness, or death. In the United States, radiation dose is measured in rem, with the average background dose for the population estimated at 620 millirem per year. An RDD attack is likely to expose few people to a dose of more than a few rem per year, with differing views on the harm from that dose. Federal standards vary for low doses, with the EPA using a standard of 25 mrem per year and the NRC setting an occupational dose limit of 5 rem per year. No single level marks the line between an acceptable and unacceptable dose in the event of an RDD attack. The EPA and FEMA issued guidance for protective actions following nuclear and radiological incidents, recommending protective action guides (PAGs) based on projected doses. FEMA divides incident response into early and intermediate phases, with recommendations for sheltering in place, evacuation, and relocation of the public based on projected doses. FEMA recommends \"relocation of the public\" for projected doses of radiation. The late phase involves recovery and cleanup, with no specific PAG. The International Atomic Energy Agency lists 16 radionuclides that could pose a threat, with threshold radiation values for each. The code categorizes radiation sources into three categories based on potential harm to individuals. Category 1 sources could cause permanent injury or death, Category 2 sources could cause injury over hours to days, and Category 3 sources could cause injury over some hours. Cesium-137 chloride is a particular concern among the 16 radionuclides. Category 2 quantities are typically small but can contaminate a large area. An example of a possible RDD attack on Washington, DC, using 50 grams of cesium-137 chloride is provided, contaminating 0.81 to 5.10 square miles. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates security measures for radiation sources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates security measures for Category 1 and 2 radiation sources, with Category 2 considered risk-significant by the NRC. An RDD attack could result in prompt casualties, economic disruption, asset denial, decontamination requirements, and long-term casualties. A study estimated total U.S. losses at $8.5 billion for exports and $26.0 billion for imports in the event of an attack on the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach using RDDs. Despite thefts of radioactive material, there has not been a successful RDD attack due to various obstacles terrorists would face, such as learning about radiation, obtaining suitable materials, bypassing security measures, and assembling the bomb without detection. The U.S. response to potential RDD attacks involves layered defense strategies including licensing, tracking, and securing radioactive sources to reduce the risk of terrorist acquisition. The main concern before 9/11 was safe handling of radioactive materials used worldwide in various applications. The materials of greatest concern for RDDs are made in nuclear reactors, making it difficult for terrorists to obtain them without insider help, theft, or purchase. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) have taken steps to secure radioactive sources to reduce the risk of an RDD attack. The NRC regulates the civilian use of radioactive materials to protect public health and safety, while the NNSA's Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) enhances the security of radioactive sources. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) enhances security for domestic radioactive sources through the Domestic Materials Protection Program and Off-site Source Recovery Project. The Radiation Source Protection and Security Task Force, established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, addresses security challenges and disposal pathways for unused sources. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also involved in reducing risks associated with radioactive sources. The EPA, DHS, and DOD are working to reduce the use of sealed radiation sources in industrial applications. The NRC grants licenses to DOD components for sealed sources, ensuring compliance with security regulations. The Radiation Source Protection and Security Task Force addresses challenges related to disused and unwanted sources. The Security Task Force highlighted the risk of disused and unwanted radiation sources in the United States, emphasizing the importance of proper security measures. Despite the low level of radioactivity in most sources, there have been no successful thefts or sabotage incidents. NRC data shows no loss of high-level sources, with recovered Category 3 sources. U.S. Customs and Border Protection uses systems to detect radioactive material at ports and border crossings, while other DHS components deploy radiation detection equipment within the country. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office cooperates with state and local agencies to deploy equipment for detecting nuclear weapons and materials, including RDD-suitable material. Various U.S. agencies contribute to analyzing intelligence on CBRN terrorist threats. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence position to oversee the intelligence community and prohibits the acquisition or possession of RDDs. Section 6905 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act prohibits the acquisition or possession of Radiological Dispersal Devices (RDDs). The National Counterterrorism Center and the National Counter Proliferation Center were established to analyze terrorism and proliferation-related intelligence. The FBI is the lead agency for counterterrorism intelligence within the United States. Efforts are being made by the United States, international organizations, and foreign governments to secure sources worldwide to prevent RDD attacks. The IAEA, a U.N. organization, plays a role in nuclear energy and peaceful applications. The IAEA, a U.N. organization, is responsible for nuclear energy, nuclear science, nonproliferation, safety, and security. It leads global efforts to secure radioactive sources and provides training to help countries control sealed sources. The organization maintains an International Catalogue of Sealed Radioactive Sources and Devices to ensure safe handling. The G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction was established in 2006 by 13 governments to prevent terrorists from acquiring CBRN weapons. The partnership aims to raise up to $20 billion over ten years for projects supporting these principles, including improving detection capabilities and securing radioactive materials. The GTRI programs aim to secure and remove high-risk nuclear and radiological materials globally. The Off-site Source Recovery Project has removed 985 sources from 15 nations. The Second Line of Defense program helps foreign governments detect illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. The NRC assists other nations in implementing safety and security measures for radioactive sources. The NRC conducts workshops on physical protection requirements and U.S. regulatory framework. The EXBS program enhances border security and controls strategic exports in 46 countries. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism program counters terrorist CBRN attacks. The U.S. Strategic Command coordinates global counter-CBRN efforts with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Other nations participate in global efforts to combat nuclear terrorism. Other nations are taking steps to control their radioactive material and secure it, such as Canada funding the removal of Russian radioisotopic thermoelectric generators. Pakistan is implementing a National Nuclear Security Action Plan with the IAEA, while Poland's Radioactive Waste Management Plant has upgraded security in over 70 institutions. The Korean Institute for Nuclear Safety has developed a Radiation program. The Korean Institute for Nuclear Safety has developed a Radiation Safety Information System to trace radioactive sources and track misplaced or stolen industrial radiography sources in real time. Despite efforts to secure radioactive sources, vulnerabilities persist. The IAEA's Illicit Trafficking Database has data on the vulnerability of nuclear and other radioactive sources, with reported incidents involving unauthorized possession, attempts to sell or smuggle nuclear material, and unauthorized activities without apparent relation to criminal activity. The U.S. Department of State reported incidents involving radiological and nuclear materials outside legitimate control, with some occurring in the U.S. The IAEA noted a persistent problem with illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials, including thefts and unauthorized activities. The ITDB data for 1995-2008 showed vulnerabilities in security systems, with thefts, losses, and unauthorized possession reported. The U.S. Department of State reported incidents involving radiological and nuclear materials outside legitimate control, with some occurring in the U.S. The IAEA noted a persistent problem with illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials. The 724 incidents of unauthorized activities mainly involved radioactive sources, indicating failures in control systems. A response plan for RDD attacks includes key authorities like the Stafford Act and Homeland Security Act. The Security Presidential Directive 5 designates the Secretary of Homeland Security as the main official for domestic incident management. The National Response Framework outlines principles for a unified national response to disasters, with the Nuclear/Radiological Incident Annex detailing response policies and agency responsibilities. DHS would lead in deliberate attacks according to the Framework. The National Response Framework designates DHS as the lead agency for deliberate attacks involving nuclear/radiological facilities or materials. FEMA issued guidance for response to RDDs and INDs in 2008. Some states and localities have response plans, but overall public health systems are poorly prepared for radiation emergencies. Concerns about national preparedness have been raised. Despite planning for hurricanes, the response to Hurricane Katrina was inadequate. The Deepwater Horizon disaster serves as an example of poor disaster response. The response to Hurricane Katrina was poor, despite the federal government's contingency plan. FEMA divides response into early, intermediate, and late phases, with resources shifting accordingly. State and local first responders focus on minimizing deaths and injuries in the early phase, while federal resources are utilized in the intermediate phase for higher-level care and recovery efforts. Late-phase activities include reducing radiation hazards through decontamination. The federal government may address hazards by decontaminating streets and buildings, replacing structures that cannot be decontaminated, or restricting access to certain areas. President Obama established the White House Long-Term Disaster Recovery Working Group in 2009 to develop a strategy for recovery from major disasters. Research on decontamination methods for radioactive materials like cesium has been conducted. The Idaho National Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory are researching decontamination methods for radioactive materials like cesium. They are exploring the use of lasers and a \"supergel\" to safely capture and dispose of radioactive elements in porous structures. The EPA's National Homeland Security Research Center also conducts decontamination research. In the event of an RDD attack, the United States would need to identify the attacker and the source of the material through forensics for retaliation. Nuclear forensics involves analyzing weapon material to determine its origin and manufacturing processes. This helps identify the technical sophistication of the attackers and any nations that may have provided support. The United States is developing a consolidated library to support this effort. The United States is developing a consolidated library and archive of nuclear material for nuclear forensics. This effort aims to identify the source of material and the perpetrator of an attack to support deterrence and retaliation if needed. Radiological forensics can determine the age of a sample and gather insights from various sources like license information and sales records. The Department of Homeland Security is funding research at Argonne and Idaho National Laboratories to gather data on sealed sources for forensics purposes. Radiological and nuclear forensics differ in the number of radionuclides produced, with RDD materials having fewer clues. RDD radionuclides have longer half-lives, making sample collection less time-urgent compared to a nuclear explosion. Nuclear forensics could support retaliation based on the country of origin of the material, while RDD material could be produced in one country and distributed through multiple others. The main producers of key radionuclides are Argentina, Canada, several European countries, and Russia. Tracing material to the producer would not provide a basis for retaliation if terrorists obtained it through theft or illicit purchase. The priority of countering radiological vs. other forms of terrorism is debated due to the lack of successful RDD attacks, the lower potential casualties compared to other weapons, and the overlap in planning and resources for responding to RDD attacks and other disasters. Funds allocated for responding to RDD attacks may also benefit other disasters, making it challenging to determine the appropriate balance. Securing domestic radiological sources is argued to be more effective in preventing RDD attacks, despite the high costs involved. However, securing sources overseas with international assistance could also be beneficial. Securing sources overseas may offer a higher benefit-cost ratio as many sources abroad are less secure than U.S. sources. Expenditures to counter RDD threats overseas could also help safeguard U.S. facilities in other nations and prevent economic disruption from RDD attacks. A distributed network of sensors is being developed to detect radioactive material, which could be mounted on various devices like cell phones. Developing a detector network and deploying it in major metropolitan areas is a consideration. The main cost of an RDD attack would be decontamination, which depends on the material, surfaces affected, and required level. Prompt availability of information and proper equipment are crucial. Future R&D could focus on decontamination techniques and cost comparison with demolition. The urgency to dispose of radioactive waste, especially after an RDD attack, raises questions about handling and transporting contaminated materials. Decontamination and demolition of buildings generate rubble that needs proper disposal planning to avoid post-attack chaos. The GTRI Domestic Materials Protection Program assists facilities in enhancing security measures for buildings with high-priority radioactive material in the United States. Upgrades are ongoing with a goal to be completed by 2025. Congress may consider expanding, maintaining, eliminating, or making the program mandatory to strengthen radiological forensics capability. Congress could establish a panel to examine the unique aspects and requirements of radiological forensics and support the buildout of archives of samples relevant to RDDs."
