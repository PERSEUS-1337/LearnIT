    "content": "The Act titled \"Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999\" imposes restrictions on transfers or discharges of nursing facility residents who voluntarily withdraw from the Medicaid program. The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 restricts transfers or discharges of nursing facility residents who voluntarily withdraw from the Medicaid program. The Act amends the Social Security Act to ensure that residents cannot be transferred or discharged if a nursing facility voluntarily withdraws from participation but continues to provide services. The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 prohibits transferring or discharging residents from a nursing facility that voluntarily withdraws from Medicaid. The Act ensures that residents who were in the facility before the withdrawal date are still covered until discharge, and new residents must be notified orally and in writing about the change. The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 requires nursing facilities to provide oral and written notice to new residents about important information upon admission, including obtaining a signed acknowledgment of receipt. This does not affect any participation agreement requirements for nursing facilities. The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 mandates nursing facilities to give advance notice to the State or Secretary before terminating an agreement. Information for new residents includes the facility's non-participation in the program and the ability to transfer or discharge residents unable to pay charges. The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 requires nursing facilities to provide advance notice before terminating an agreement. Even if a resident becomes eligible for medical assistance, the facility's participation agreement continues after voluntary withdrawal for receiving payments. The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 mandates nursing facilities to give advance notice before terminating an agreement. Participation agreements continue after voluntary withdrawal for receiving payments, maintaining compliance with requirements, and applying survey authority. No application of these rules to new residents. The amendment in subsection (a) applies to voluntary withdrawals from participation after the enactment of the Act."
