    "content": "The \"meeting competition\" defense is an affirmative defense allowed to refute Robinson-Patman illegality of price differentials. It has two levels: primary line competition and secondary line competition. The defendant must prove that the lower price was to meet a competitor's price or enable the buyer to compete. Price differentials must be \"cost justified\" to be defended successfully. The 1938 Nonprofit Institutions Act created an exemption for certain institutions to receive price breaks on purchases for their own use. Supreme Court opinions in the 1970s and 1980s clarified the scope of this exemption, involving challenges to a pharmaceutical supplier selling products at lower prices to hospitals than retail pharmacists. The 1976 case of Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Association, Inc. clarified the \"for their own use\" provision in the Nonprofit Institutions Act. The Court ruled that purchases made by nonprofit hospitals are only exempt from price discrimination prohibitions if they are for the hospital's needs, such as dispensing to inpatients, outpatients, emergency room use, and staff physicians. The Court emphasized that the hospital should not have a blank check for purchases. The Court in Abbott Laboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Association, Inc. clarified the limits of the Robinson-Patman exemption for nonprofit hospitals, excluding refills for former patients and purchases for a physician's private practice unconnected to the hospital. In Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Ass 'n., Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, the Court further defined the exception for government purchases, specifically focusing on state (nonprofit hospital) purchases. Jefferson County emphasized that government (nonprofit hospital) purchases for retail competition must adhere to Robinson-Patman Act's prohibitions on discriminatory pricing. The Court ruled that University of Alabama Hospital's purchases of pharmaceuticals for non-patient use, such as retail sales, must not give unfair price advantages over competitors. In De Modena v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., health maintenance organizations were considered \"eligible institutions\" under the Nonprofit Institutions Act. The court relied on precedent to expand the definition of charitable institutions to include health plans, citing the decrease in the number of poor individuals needing free medical services as a reason for the broader interpretation. In recent years, there has been a less restrictive interpretation of the term \"charitable\" for non-profit organizations promoting health. Courts have recognized health maintenance organizations like HPs as charitable institutions for tax purposes. The court in De Modena v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. expanded the definition of charitable institutions to include health plans, emphasizing the provision of a wide range of health-care services to members. The Robinson-Patman Act, enacted to prevent discrimination in pricing, has been viewed skeptically by the Department of Justice since 1936. The Act's enforcement is handled by the Federal Trade Commission, with concerns raised about its adverse effects on the economy. Some argue that the Act benefits small businesses and promotes fair competition. The Robinson-Patman Act, aimed at preventing pricing discrimination and promoting fair competition, has faced skepticism since 1936. In the mid-1970s, the 94th Congress considered amending or repealing the Act but no legislation was introduced at that time or thereafter."
