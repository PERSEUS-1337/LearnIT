    "content": "This report discusses potential oversight issues for Congress regarding the Navy's FFG(X) program to procure 20 guided-missile frigates. The Navy's FY2020 budget requests $1,281.2 million for the first FFG(X). Congress's decisions on the program could impact Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The report focuses on the FFG(X) program and mentions the related Navy shipbuilding program, the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. The Navy's surface combatants are divided into large surface combatants (LSCs) and small surface combatants (SSCs). SSCs, including frigates, LCSs, mine warfare ships, and patrol craft, are smaller, less capable, and less expensive than LSCs. The Navy aims to achieve a fleet of 355 ships, including 52 SSCs, with 32 LCSs and 20 FFG(X)s. Patrol craft, although SSCs, do not count towards the SSC force-level goal. The Navy's small surface combatants (SSCs) include frigates, LCSs, and mine warfare ships. The SSC force is planned to grow to 52 ships by FY2034, peak at 62 ships in FY2040, and then decline to 50 ships by FY2049. Frigates are designed for lower-threat areas and have fewer weapons compared to cruisers and destroyers. The Navy's frigates are equipped with fewer weapons and less engineering redundancy than cruisers and destroyers. The most recent class of frigates was the Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG-7) class, with 51 ships procured between FY1973 and FY1984. These ships were decommissioned between 1994 and 2015 and some were transferred to allied navies. The Navy plans to procure 20 FFG(X) guided-missile frigates to meet its 52-ship SSC force-level goal. The Navy's 355-ship force-level goal is based on a Force Structure Analysis conducted in 2016, with a new analysis scheduled for completion by the end of 2019. The Navy's new Force Structure Analysis (FSA) is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. It may lead to a shift towards a new surface force architecture with a larger proportion of small surface combatants, as depicted in a Navy briefing slide. This potential new architecture could include a planned force mix with twice as many small surface combatants as large surface combatants, along with a new third tier of numerous unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The Navy plans to procure the first FFG(X) in FY2020, followed by 18 more at a rate of two per year until FY2030. The ship is designed to be a small surface combatant capable of various warfare operations, with increased AAW and EMW capability compared to previous concepts. Delivery of the first FFG(X) is scheduled for July 2026. The FFG(X) is designed to have enhanced survivability and area-defense AAW capabilities, operating in both blue water and littoral areas. It will be larger, more heavily armed, and more expensive than the LCS or FF concepts. The Navy plans to procure the first FFG(X) in FY2020, followed by 18 more by FY2030, with delivery scheduled for July 2026. The Navy plans to operate FFG(X)s with dual crews to maximize time at sea. The follow-on ships in the program aim for an average unit procurement cost of $800 million to $950 million each. The Navy estimates the cost can be closer to $800 million. In comparison, the average unit procurement cost of LCSs in FY2019 was $523.7 million, and for DDG-51 class destroyers in FY2020, it is $1,821.0 million. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,281.2 million. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests $1,281.2 million for the procurement of the first FFG(X), with subsequent ships estimated to cost roughly $900 million each. The total procurement cost of 20 FFG(X)s is estimated at $20,470.1 million. The Navy plans to procure 20 FFG(X) ships at an estimated cost of $20,470.1 million, with each ship costing around $1,023.5 million on average. To expedite the process, the Navy will use a parent-design approach, modifying an existing ship design instead of creating a new one from scratch. This approach helps reduce design time, cost, and technical risks. The Navy's FFG(X) program will use a parent-design approach to modify existing ship designs, reducing cost, schedule, and technical risks. The program aims to utilize systems and technologies already in use in other programs to further minimize costs. The procurement plan involves building two ships per year with a single builder, following U.S. law to construct the ships in a U.S. shipyard, even if based on a foreign design. Collaboration between a U.S. builder and a foreign developer may be necessary for using a foreign design. The Navy's FFG(X) program aims to award all 20 ships to a single winner among five competing yards, but the possibility of splitting the award between two or three yards was discussed during a Senate hearing on Navy readiness. The Navy's FFG(X) program aims to award all 20 ships to a single winner among five competing yards. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer discusses the need to balance the flow of new ships into the fleet to avoid maintenance spikes. The Navy plans to use fixed-price block buy contracts to reduce procurement costs. The Navy's FFG(X) program aims to award 20 ships to a single winner among five competing yards. Industry teams are proposing to build their FFG(X) designs at various shipyards, including Austal USA, Fincantieri/Marinette Marine, General Dynamics/Bath Iron Works, and Huntington Ingalls Industries/Ingalls Shipbuilding. One industry team decided not to submit a bid for the program. The Navy awarded five FFG(X) conceptual design contracts to industry teams, with the winner of the Detailed Design and Construction (DD&C) contract to be announced in July 2020. Congress is tasked with deciding on the Navy's FY2020 funding request for the program and assessing the appropriateness of the proposed work. The Navy awarded five FFG(X) conceptual design contracts to industry teams, with the winner of the Detailed Design and Construction (DD&C) contract to be announced in July 2020. Congress is tasked with deciding on the Navy's FY2020 funding request for the program and assessing the appropriateness of the proposed work. Congress is also concerned about whether the Navy has appropriately defined the cost, capabilities, and growth margin of the FFG(X), including the balance between desired capabilities and estimated procurement cost to avoid cost growth in the program. The Navy's FFG(X) program faces a risk of cost growth. Key aim of design contracts is to inform capability-cost tradeoffs. Concerns include the number of VLS missile tubes, with the FFG(X) planned to have 32 Mark 41 VLS tubes. Supporters argue for equipping it with 48 tubes due to cost considerations compared to DDG-51 destroyer. Supporters of equipping the FFG(X) with 48 VLS tubes argue that it would be more suitable in the context of increasing naval capabilities of potential adversaries like China. They believe the slight increase in procurement cost would be justified. On the other hand, proponents of limiting the FFG(X) to 32 VLS tubes argue that this number already accounts for improving adversary capabilities and that the ship is also equipped with a separate 21-cell Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) launcher. Increasing the number of VLS tubes from 32 to 48 on the FFG(X) would raise procurement costs. Congress may question the estimated cost increase and whether the Navy has allowed for sufficient growth margin in the ship's design. The FFG(X) design includes a 5% growth margin for upgrades and changes during its service life. The Navy also wants additional margin for future directed energy or electronic attack systems. Supporters argue that a larger margin could increase costs, while skeptics suggest a larger margin may be necessary. Increasing the FFG(X) design's growth margin from 5% to 10% could make it larger and more expensive to procure. Skeptics argue that a larger margin would provide a better hedge against potential adversaries like China. Congress may question the estimated increase in unit procurement cost and the use of a parent-design approach for the program. The FFG(X) program may start around FY2024, with the possibility of extending LCS procurement until 2023. Using a parent-design approach can reduce design time, cost, and risks. Alternatively, considering existing frigate designs like the UK's Type 26 could be cost-effective and beneficial for the U.S. ship design industry. Using a developed-but-not-yet-built design for the FFG(X) program could reduce design time and cost, but may not lower technical, schedule, and cost risks as much as an already-built design. The Navy argues that using existing systems and technologies minimizes risks, but skeptics point out that lead ships inherently pose risks as prototypes. The FFG(X) program for Navy shipbuilding has faced cost overruns, as reported by CBO and GAO. The program is currently in the conceptual design phase, with plans to award a lead ship construction contract in September 2020. The Navy aims to select a design and shipbuilder through open competition for a more lethal and survivable small surface combatant. Conceptual design contracts were awarded in February 2018 based on existing ship designs. The FFG(X) program received approval to tailor its acquisition documentation in November 2018, allowing development to start in February 2020. This included waivers for certain requirements and approval to tailor reviews for system specifications validation. The program office had no comments on the assessment provided. The issue for Congress is whether to procure additional LCSs in FY2020 as a hedge against potential delays in the FFG(X) program. Supporters argue that lead ships often face schedule delays, and procuring more LCSs could mitigate risks. Skeptics believe the Navy does not need more LCSs and funding them could impact other programs. Congress also considers the industrial-base impacts of shifting procurement from LCSs to FFG(X)s. The Navy plans to shift procurement from LCSs to FFG(X)s starting in FY2020, impacting workloads and employment levels at LCS shipyards. If an LCS design is chosen for FFG(X) construction, workloads at the other LCS shipyard would decline over time. If no LCS design is chosen, industrial-base impacts will be felt. The FFG(X) competition aims to build ships at shipyards other than the LCS shipyards, potentially leading to a decline in employment levels at LCS shipyards and their suppliers. The Navy's plan is to build FFG(X)s at a single shipyard, but alternatives include building them at two or three shipyards, including the LCS shipyards. Another option is to shift Navy shipbuilding work at LCS yards to produce sections of larger Navy ships if they do not win the FFG(X) competition. The option of shifting Navy shipbuilding work at LCS yards to produce sections of larger Navy ships, such as DDG-51 destroyers or amphibious ships, for final assembly at other shipyards could help maintain workloads and employment levels. This concept was previously examined in a 2011 RAND report and may aid in achieving the Navy's 355-ship force-level objective sooner. Additionally, the FFG(X) program's potential impact on supplier firms is a concern for some supporters of U.S. supplier firms. Some supporters of U.S. supplier firms are concerned that the FFG(X) program does not have strong enough provisions for requiring U.S.-made components, especially since some industry teams are using European frigate designs. The American Shipbuilding Suppliers Association argues that the Navy historically selected U.S. manufactured components for its major surface combatants but has not imposed such requirements for the FFG(X) program. The Navy's FFG(X) acquisition plan considers foreign designs and components, potentially leading to critical HM&E components not being manufactured in the US. While the requirements for combat systems are clear, specific major HM&E components like propulsion systems are not identified in the draft RFP. The draft RFP for the Navy's FFG(X) acquisition plan does not prioritize sourcing critical ship components within the US, leading to potential cost and logistics issues in the long term. Lowest acquisition cost is likely to drive the award, disadvantaging US component suppliers. The US Navy's acquisition approach favors foreign designs and component suppliers, many of which are state-owned and receive subsidies. This creates an uneven playing field for American manufacturers, making it difficult for them to compete on cost. Foreign companies have a significant advantage due to their existing infrastructure and lower non-recurring engineering costs. The potential loss of the FFG(X) opportunity to US suppliers would have severe consequences for the US shipbuilding supplier base, increasing costs on other Navy platforms. Maintaining a robust domestic manufacturing capability is crucial for surge capacity during major military operations, as seen with the difficulty of reconstituting a closed production line on the DDG-51 destroyer restart. The difficulty of restarting destroyer production due to the closure of a critical component manufacturer's production line led the government to fund the manufacturer directly. Foreign-made components are already used in US Navy ships, and requiring modifications for US-made components could increase costs or acquisition risks for the FFG(X) program. Current U.S. law (10 U.S.C. 2534) mandates that certain components of U.S. Navy ships must be made by a manufacturer in the national technology and industrial base. This includes items like air circuit breakers, welded shipboard anchor and mooring chains, vessel propellers, gyrocompasses, electronic navigation chart systems, steering controls, pumps, propulsion and machinery control systems, and totally enclosed lifeboats. The law (10 U.S.C. 2534) requires certain components of U.S. Navy ships to be made by manufacturers in the national technology and industrial base. This includes items like vessel propellers, with the manufacturer needing to meet specific requirements and have all castings poured and finished in the United States. The law does not apply to spare or repair parts for components produced outside the U.S. The law (10 U.S.C. 2534) requires certain components of U.S. Navy ships, like vessel propellers, to be manufactured in the national technology and industrial base. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to waive the limitation if it would cause unreasonable costs or delays, not jeopardize U.S. producers, or impede cooperative programs with foreign countries. The limitation on procurement of defense items can be waived by the Secretary of Defense under certain conditions, such as when items are not available from the national technology and industrial base, or when only one source exists for the item. Other conditions include when the procurement amount is below the simplified acquisition threshold and when simplified purchase procedures are used. The Secretary of Defense can waive the limitation on procurement of defense items under specific conditions, including when items are unavailable from the national technology and industrial base or when only one source exists. The waiver must be for a particular item listed in subsection (a) and a specific foreign country. Management and oversight techniques should be used to achieve the objective without burdening the Government or contractor. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to waive limitations on defense item procurement under certain conditions, such as unavailability from the national technology and industrial base or when only one source exists. The waiver must be specific to an item listed in subsection (a) and a particular foreign country. Delegation of waiver authority is limited to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. The Secretary must notify congressional defense committees at least 15 days before implementing any waiver, which is valid for up to one year. The annual DOD appropriations act includes a proviso regarding the construction of naval vessels in the United States, specifying that major components should not be built in foreign facilities. The interpretation of \"major components\" is open to debate. Congress is also considering the use of U.S.-made components for Navy ships and the construction of FFG(X) ships at one or multiple shipyards. Building FFG(X) ships at two or three shipyards, including potentially the LCS shipyards, could increase production to four or more ships per year. This approach could accelerate the Navy's small surface combatant force-level goal, promote competition to control prices and ensure quality, and complicate adversary defense planning. Building FFG(X) ships at multiple shipyards could increase production to four or more ships per year, accelerating the Navy's small surface combatant force-level goal. However, this approach may complicate adversary defense planning and increase procurement funding requirements, potentially impacting other Navy or DOD programs. It could also lead to higher operation and support costs for the Navy. The Navy's potential shift to a new fleet architecture, with a larger proportion of small surface combatants, could impact the required numbers of FFG(X) ships. This change may influence the annual procurement rate and the number of shipyards involved in building the ships. The Navy's plans for a different future could significantly alter how the fleet operates. The Navy is considering a shift to a new fleet architecture with more small surface combatants, which could affect the required numbers of FFG(X) ships. This change may impact procurement rates and involve different shipyards. The future fleet operation could be significantly altered. The Navy is considering a shift to a new fleet architecture with more small surface combatants, potentially replacing destroyers with frigates and Large Surface Combatants. This change aims to create a healthier mix of small and large surface combatants in the fleet. The Navy is considering a shift to a new fleet architecture with more small surface combatants, potentially replacing destroyers with frigates and Large Surface Combatants. The new Fleet Structure Assessment (FSA) may shed light on the balance between small and large surface combatants. Congressional action on Navy's FY2020 funding request for the LCS program is summarized in Table 3. Appendices include Navy briefing slides from July 25, 2017, FFG(X) Industry Day Event and information on competing industry teams for the FFG(X) program. The Navy is considering a shift to a new fleet architecture with more small surface combatants, potentially replacing destroyers with frigates and Large Surface Combatants. A February 16, 2018, press report outlined the five industry teams competing for the FFG(X) program, including Austal USA pitching an upgunned variant of the Independence-class LCS. The upgunned variant of the Independence-class LCS is being offered as a foreign military sales option and a solution for the Navy's upgunned small surface combatant and frigate programs. Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Wisconsin is offering the 6,700-ton Italian FREMM design for the FFG(X) program, featuring a 16-cell VLS and space for deck-launched anti-ship missiles. The Italian FREMM design, offered by Fincantieri Marinette Marine for the FFG(X) program, features a 16-cell VLS and space for deck-launched anti-ship missiles. General Dynamics Bath Iron Works and Huntington Ingalls Industries Shipyard are also involved in the competition, with Bath Iron Works having a partnership with Navantia for the F100 frigates. Huntington Ingalls Industries did not present a model or rendering for their design. Lockheed Martin Shipyard in Marinette, Wisconsin, has secured a foreign military sale for its FFG(X) bid, which is similar to its offering for the Royal Saudi Navy's multi-mission surface combatant. The design includes an eight-cell Mk-41 vertical launch system and a 4D air search radar. Lockheed has proposed various hull variants for the project. Lockheed Martin has decided not to submit a bid for the Navy's FFG(X) frigate competition, despite their successful partnership on the Freedom-variant Littoral Combat Ship. This decision was announced on May 23, 2019, by one of the five industry teams interested in the program. Lockheed's frigate design offers an affordable and low-risk solution to meet the Navy's fleet goals. Lockheed Martin decided not to bid for the Navy's FFG(X) frigate competition, focusing on developing the frigate combat system and other systems instead of submitting their Freedom-class LCS design. They cited their existing technologies like the COMBATSS 21 combat management system, Mk-41 vertical launch system, anti-submarine warfare capabilities, electronic warfare, and platform integration as reasons for their decision. Lockheed Martin decided not to bid for the Navy's FFG(X) frigate competition, citing concerns that their Freedom-class design would be stretched too far to accommodate all required capabilities. Despite not leading a frigate team, the company will still be heavily involved with the project, providing the COMBATSS-21 Combat Management System and vertical launch system."
