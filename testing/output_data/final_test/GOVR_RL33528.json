    "content": "Technological advancement in U.S. industry has been supported by congressional initiatives over the past 30 years. This includes direct measures like the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and indirect measures such as tax policies and intellectual property rights protection. Congressional legislation favors indirect strategies over direct federal funding for private sector technology commercialization initiatives. Technological advancement in the U.S. industry is crucial for economic growth and competitiveness in the global market. Commercializing inventions leads to economic benefits through new products, services, and processes, driving up to half of the U.S. economy's growth. Congressional initiatives support technology development through measures like the Advanced Technology Program and tax policies, emphasizing indirect strategies over direct federal funding for private sector initiatives. Technological advances drive economic growth by creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital. Technology improves productivity, product quality, and expands service offerings globally. It also influences international trade patterns by affecting industrial sector advantages. New technologies can offset capital and labor cost disadvantages for firms, independent of macroeconomic shifts. The United States primarily relies on the private sector for commercial technology development, with limited federal government involvement in areas deemed necessary for the national good. Federal funding supports research and development to meet mission requirements and address research needs not being pursued by industry. Federal support for basic research is crucial as it forms the basis for new innovations, with returns often long-term and not immediately marketable. Past government efforts focused on a linear model of innovation, but this concept is now considered outdated. The rate of return to society from research investments exceeds benefits captured by individual firms. Innovations can occur without the need for basic or applied research, often resulting in incremental improvements to existing products or processes. The distinction between basic research and commercialization is shrinking in certain fields like biotechnology. The key factor is the commercialization of technology, where economic benefits are realized. While the US excels in basic research, foreign firms are often better at turning scientific efforts into commercially viable products, leading to competition in the global marketplace. The US faces competition in the global marketplace from foreign industries using research conducted in the US. Congressional interest has grown in speeding up development and commercialization in the private sector. There is a lack of consensus on the need for a clear policy to facilitate technological advancement. Past programs to aid technology demonstration and commercialization have been ad hoc and uncoordinated. Despite the importance of technology to the economy, technology-related considerations have not always been integrated into economic decisions. Attempts have been made to centralize governmental activity in technology matters, such as creating a Technology Administration within the Department of Commerce. However, this office was abolished in FY2007, leading to technological issues and responsibilities being shared among various departments and agencies. This diffused focus has sometimes resulted in actions that do not account for the impact of policies in one area on other parts of the process. Several times, Congress has examined the idea of an industrial policy to develop a coordinated approach on economic growth and industrial competitiveness. Advocates argue that such an effort could reduce uncertainty in the private sector and encourage long-term planning for R&D and resource allocation. A technology policy could lead to greater consistency in government actions. The development of a technology policy is a contentious issue due to resistance towards national planning and government intervention in the marketplace. Critics fear adverse effects on the market system and view it as government interference in picking winners and losers. Measures to create a better investment environment for industry innovation are advocated instead. The debate over government intervention in technology policy ranges from laissez-faire to targeted incentives for high-tech industries. Some suggest federal support for strategic industries, while others argue against government interference, citing a lack of expertise in business decisions. The appropriate role for government in technology policy is to encourage innovation and keep market decision-making within the business community. The relationship between government and industry can affect innovation, with increasing cooperation between the two sectors blurring traditional distinctions. The boundaries between public and private sector roles are becoming less clear, especially with the growing internationalization of the U.S. economy. Other countries are challenging the technological superiority once held by the United States through government-industry cooperation. The Clinton Administration proposed a national commitment to technological advancement in 1993. The Clinton Administration proposed a detailed strategy for technological advancement as part of a national economic policy, focusing on industrial competitiveness and development of new products and services by the private sector. This policy, supported by congressional legislation, aimed to increase federal coordination and government spending for technological development. The Clinton Administration proposed a strategy for technological advancement to enhance industrial competitiveness. In contrast, recent policies under the Bush Administration focused on indirect strategies like tax incentives and intellectual property protection to promote technology advancement. Former President Bush announced the \"American Competitiveness Initiative\" to double federal funding for basic research over the next 10 years. President Obama aimed to double the budget of key science agencies over 10 years, with a goal of increasing national investment in R&D to over 3% of the GDP. The timeframe for doubling slipped to 11 years in FY2011, and was not specified in the FY2012 budget. The government's role in technology development policy is a topic of debate, but its actions impact the private sector and innovation. Legislative initiatives show a shift towards facilitating technological advancement to meet national needs and promote economic growth. Congressional efforts aim to encourage industry R&D spending and assist small businesses. Federal efforts aim to encourage industry R&D spending, assist small high-tech businesses, promote joint research activities, foster cooperation between industry and universities, facilitate technology transfer, and provide incentives for quality improvements. These initiatives focus on removing barriers to technology development in the private sector and increasing private sector R&D activities. Congress created a temporary tax credit for research spending increases to foster private sector research. The 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act provided a 25% tax credit for firms' qualified research costs above average expenditures. This included in-house expenses, corporate grants for basic research, and payments for contract research. The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has been extended multiple times with changes to rates and qualified expenses. The credit expired in 2011. The Small Business Development Act established Small Business Innovation Research programs to increase small business participation in federal R&D agencies. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program aims to increase small companies' participation in federally funded research and development by allocating a percentage of each agency's R&D budget. Companies must secure private sector support for commercialization. The program has been extended multiple times and was reauthorized through September 30, 2017. A pilot program, the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), was created in 1992 to encourage collaboration between firms, universities, and federal labs for commercializing basic research results. The STTR program is also funded by a set-aside and has been reauthorized several times, currently scheduled to sunset on September 30, 2017. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) was created by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and provided seed funding for technology development. It was replaced by the Technology Innovation Program in 2007, with 824 projects funded totaling $1.6 billion in federal dollars matched by $1.5 billion in private sector financing. The new program was created by P.L. 110-69. The Technology Innovation Program (TIP) was created to promote high-risk R&D for economic benefit. Unlike the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), TIP limited awards to small and medium-sized businesses. Joint ventures in TIP could involve one small or medium-sized firm and a university. The Advanced Technology Program (ATP) allowed companies to receive up to $2 million for three years without cost sharing, while the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) limited awards to small and medium-sized businesses with a 50% cost sharing requirement. Joint venture funding under ATP had no limits, while TIP limited it to $9 million for five years. The Advisory Board for ATP included industry and government representatives. In January 2009, the Technology Innovation Program awarded nine projects for developing advanced sensing technologies to monitor infrastructure health. $42.5 million in federal funds was matched by $45.7 million in private sector support. In December 2009, twenty more projects were awarded with $71.0 million in NIST financing and $145.7 million from other sources. Thirteen projects focused on monitoring civil infrastructure, while four focused on advanced repair. In December 2010, nine additional projects in various areas received awards of more than $22 million, with federal funding expected to be matched by approximately $24 million in private sector support. No new TIP awards were made in FY2011, and the $44.8 million appropriated for the program in P.L. 112-10 was used for ongoing projects. No FY2012 funds were appropriated for TIP, focusing on promoting cooperative efforts between academia and industry for technology commercialization. The commercialization of technology involves basic research conducted in universities or federal laboratories, while the business community focuses on manufacturing products or services. Universities excel at basic research due to their educational mission. Post-World War II, the federal government became the primary funder of university research, leading to a disconnect between academia and industry. Legislation has been enacted to promote cooperation between universities and industries in technology development to enhance innovation and competitiveness. For example, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 provided a tax credit for company payments to universities for basic research, while the Tax Reform Act of 1986 allowed larger tax deductions for charitable contributions of equipment used in scientific research at academic institutions. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the credit for university basic research to 20% of corporate expenditures over a fixed research floor. It also provided a charitable deduction for donations of new equipment by manufacturers to higher education institutions for research in physical or biological sciences. The research and experimentation tax credit expired in 2011. In 2011, the \"Bayh-Dole Act\" was amended to promote collaboration between academia and businesses by granting patent ownership to contractors receiving federal research funds. This incentivizes private sector development and commercialization of R&D, with small businesses, universities, and not-for-profit institutions eligible for patent ownership. The government retains certain rights to the patent, and contractors must commercialize within an agreed-upon timeframe. This initiative aims to increase university licensing to industry for financial returns. The CREATE Act, P.L. 108 - 453, amended patent laws to promote cooperative research among universities, government, and the private sector. It allows joint research agreements without precluding patentability. Cooperative research reduces risks and costs, encouraging industrial involvement in research. The National Cooperative Research Act (P.L. 98-462) encourages collaborative research efforts across expertise boundaries, supporting the development of resources, facilities, knowledge, and skills. It clarifies antitrust laws, applying a \"rule of reason\" standard and eliminating treble damage awards for violations if prior disclosure is made. Changes in attorney fee awards allow defendants to collect fees in certain circumstances. The National Cooperative Research Act encourages collaborative research efforts and clarifies antitrust laws. Attorney fee awards may be offset if litigation is conducted frivolously or in bad faith. Provisions apply to joint manufacturing ventures with facilities in the US. The National Cooperative Research Act encourages collaborative research efforts and clarifies antitrust laws for joint manufacturing ventures with facilities in the US. Legislation in the late 1970s aimed to transfer technology from federal laboratories to the private sector for commercialization, leveraging their science and technology resources. The commercialization level of federally funded R&D results remained low despite the resources of federal laboratories. Only about 10% of federally owned patents were utilized due to various reasons, including market application limitations and industry unfamiliarity with the technologies. Efforts have been made to increase industry awareness of federal R&D resources, such as the creation of the Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer in 1972. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 was passed by Congress to emphasize the commercialization of government technology and ensure the full use of federal investment in research and development. This law created a system within the federal government to identify and disseminate technology activities. The Federal Technology Transfer Act, established under the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act, encourages collaboration between industry, universities, and federal laboratories to promote the commercialization of federally funded research. It also allows government-owned laboratories to enter into cooperative R&D agreements. The Department of Defense FY1990 Authorization Act extends authority for government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories to enter into cooperative R&D agreements with universities and the private sector. Companies can retain title to inventions from research under these agreements, with the federal government having a royalty-free license. The Technology Transfer Improvements and Advancement Act clarifies intellectual property rights under CRADAs, and the Federal Laboratory Consortium assists in technology transfer coordination. Certain agencies are mandated to create cash awards and royalty sharing programs for federal scientists to promote the use of federal R&D results. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991 mandates a cash awards program and royalty sharing activity for federal scientists, engineers, and technicians to promote commercialization of federally developed technology. Amendments to the Patent and Trademark law aim to improve technology transfer from federal laboratories to the private sector, especially those operated by contractors. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1991 mandates a cash awards program and royalty sharing activity for federal scientists, engineers, and technicians to promote commercialization of federally developed technology. Amendments to the Patent and Trademark law aim to improve technology transfer from federal laboratories to the private sector, especially those operated by contractors. The contractor at government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories (GOCOs) can make decisions on granting licenses for subject inventions, with royalties permitted to go back to the laboratory contractor for additional R&D, awards to inventors, or education. Private companies of any size can obtain exclusive licenses for the life of the patent under P.L. 98-620. The Technology Transfer Commercialization Act, under P.L. 106-404, altered practices concerning patents held by the government to make it easier for federal agencies to license inventions. This change allows large corporations to use exclusive licenses for the full 20-year life of the patent, encouraging technology transfer from federal laboratories or universities to private sector entities. GOCOs operated by universities or nonprofit institutions can retain title to inventions made in the laboratory, while those operated by large companies are not included in this provision. The Technology Innovation Act and the Bayh-Dole Act aim to reduce time delays in obtaining exclusive licenses by shortening the notification period to 15 days. Government retains certain rights, and licenses for existing inventions can be included in CRADAs. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act established regional centers to help small manufacturing companies utilize government-developed technologies. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) was created in 1994 to support small manufacturing companies in utilizing government-developed technologies. It involves large centers and smaller affiliated organizations, operating in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. NIST has funded approximately 400 regional offices since 1989, with additional support from the Department of Defense's Technology Reinvestment Project. NIST took over support for 20 programs in FY1996 and funded the remaining efforts in FY1997. The American COMPETES Act authorized a new program for partnerships between industry and educational/research institutions to develop manufacturing processes. In October 2010, NIST awarded $9.1 million for projects to enhance U.S. manufacturers' productivity and competitiveness. The NIST supports programs critical to U.S. manufacturing, focusing on applying existing technology to small and medium-sized firms. Laws have facilitated technological innovation through direct and indirect measures, with indirect approaches emphasizing market superiority in technology investment decisions. Dependency on agency discretion is discouraged in favor of market mechanisms for technology choices. Advocates argue that reliance on agency discretion for technology preferences can be influenced by political pressures. Proponents of direct government assistance believe indirect methods are wasteful and can compromise public policy goals. Direct approaches prioritize allocating resources to technologies with industry support. Participants in debates have not consistently favored one approach over the other. In recent congresses, legislators have focused on reducing funding for specific government programs that support technological advancement. The termination of the Advanced Technology Program and the Technology Innovation Program reflects concerns over the government's role in developing commercial technologies. Despite budget cuts, support for ongoing activities continues, prompting a debate on the future of federal funding for technological advancement in the private sector."
