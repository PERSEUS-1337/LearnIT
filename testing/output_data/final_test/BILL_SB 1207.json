This collateral can include loans made under specific chapters and their principal and interest payments, subject to government code regulations. The commission can sell loans to various authorities to raise funds for making loans to eligible institutions. They can also enter into necessary agreements for the sale of loans or borrowing money, as required by the authorities issuing bonds. The commission can pledge loans or loan payments as collateral to secure bond repayments. They may employ financial consultants and other service providers as needed for these activities. The chapter provides an alternative method for implementing authorized measures, including borrowing authority for eligible institutions or local jurisdictions. Section 25421 of the Public Resources Code will be in effect until January 1, 2028, unless extended by a later statute. All loans outstanding as of January 1, 2028, shall continue to be repaid semiannually until paid in full.
