    "content": "The pursuit of reform of the U.S. Postal Service began in the 104th Congress with the introduction of the Postal Reform Act of 1996. The movement culminated in the 109th Congress with the enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act in 2006. Financial challenges, declining first class mail use, and rising costs were key factors driving the need for reform. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 was deemed outdated by various stakeholders, including the USPS, government agencies, and labor unions. Critics highlighted issues with the rate-setting process and political restrictions hindering modernization efforts. The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 played a role in initiating reform by addressing pension over-funding. The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 shifted $27 billion in pension costs from the U.S. Treasury to the USPS. It required reductions in pension outlays to lower USPS debt and fund an escrow account, but the funds were not dedicated to any specific use. The PAEA made over 150 changes to federal law, including defining \"postal service\" as the delivery of letters, printed matter, or packages. The PAEA made significant changes to federal law, including defining \"postal service\" as the delivery of letters, printed matter, or packages. It also altered the budget submission process for the USPS's Office of Inspector General and the Postal Rate Commission, now renamed the Postal Regulatory Commission. Both agencies must now submit their budget requests to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, paid from the Postal Service Fund. The PAEA made changes to federal law regarding the USPS budget submission process, including the Office of Inspector General and the Postal Rate Commission. It relieved the USPS of $27 billion in military pension obligations, abolished an escrow account, and established a Retiree Health Benefits Fund. The PAEA established a retiree health benefits fund funded by $27 billion annually from FY2007 to FY2016. It also replaced the Postal Rate Commission with the Postal Regulatory Commission, giving it subpoena power and broader regulatory scope over USPS activities. The law separates USPS products into \"market-dominant\" and \"competitive\" classes. The PAEA established a retiree health benefits fund and replaced the Postal Rate Commission with the Postal Regulatory Commission. USPS products are divided into market-dominant and competitive classes. Market-dominant products include first-class mail, periodicals, and standard mail, while competitive products include priority mail and expedited mail. Critics argue that USPS uses revenue from market-dominant products to subsidize competitive products. USPS can only raise rates for market-dominant products by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The USPS has a rate-setting process for market-dominant and competitive products. Market-dominant products can only have price increases tied to the CPI-U, while competitive products are based on market factors. The previous rate-setting system involved a request to the Postal Rate Commission, a quasi-judicial process with hearings and recommendations. The PAEA replaced the previous lengthy rate-setting process with a more efficient one that takes less than two months. It also clarified the authority of the Secretary of State in setting international postal policy and introduced new qualifications and term lengths for USPS governors. The PAEA introduced new qualifications and term lengths for USPS governors, emphasizing experience in public service, law, or accounting, and managing large organizations. It also increased USPS transparency by requiring detailed financial reporting similar to private firms under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Additionally, the GAO was tasked with assessing future business model options for the USPS. The GAO assessed future business model options for the USPS, delivering its report by January 20, 2011. Disagreements arise over interpreting statutes, like the PAEA, due to complexity and length. Congress can mitigate negative effects through active oversight of USPS and PRC. The Administration of President Barack Obama's concerns regarding the implementation of the PAEA are unclear. President George W. Bush issued a signing statement addressing sections of the PAEA related to the separation of powers, including allowing complaints to be lodged with the PRC and limiting the Department of Justice's representation of the Postal Service. The signing statement limits the Department of Justice's representation of the Postal Service in legal cases, emphasizing the President's constitutional authority over the executive branch. Section 405 of the statute assigns responsibility for international postal services to the Secretary of State, with limitations on treaty conclusions and coordination requirements with other agencies. The signing statement emphasizes the President's constitutional authority over the executive branch in carrying out responsibilities related to international postal services. It interprets certain sections of the statute in a manner consistent with the President's authority in foreign affairs and appointments. The signing statement interprets certain sections of the statute in a manner consistent with the President's authority in foreign affairs and appointments, including the appointment of an inspector general and the USPS's mail inspection policies. The signing statement interprets provisions of the statute to align with the President's authority in foreign affairs and appointments, emphasizing the need for physical searches authorized by law for intelligence collection. It also requires the Postal Regulatory Commission to provide budget requests and reports to Congress. The statement defends the executive branch's authority to submit legislative recommendations to Congress in line with the President's constitutional powers. The signing statement defends executive branch authorities against potential legislative encroachments. Congress should assess these claims and inquire if the current Administration shares these views. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act replaced the Postal Rate Commission with the more powerful Postal Regulatory Commission, which has completed various tasks to achieve the Act's objectives. The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) has conducted annual determinations of the USPS's compliance with the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA), issued opinions on USPS proposals, and prescribed the content of annual reports. Congress has held hearings on the USPS's implementation of the PAEA and the role of the PRC. The USPS faced financial difficulties, losing $25.4 billion between FY2007 and FY2011, making it challenging to meet RHBF payments. Congress may want to review the PRC's actions, expenditures, and engage with its commissioners and employees to understand its development. The USPS has faced financial difficulties in making its RHBF payments as scheduled by the PAEA. Congress reduced the FY2009 payment amount and delayed the FY2011 payment. The USPS was unable to make the FY2011 payment and cannot make the FY2012 payment. Both the PRC and USPS Office of Inspector General suggest that the PAEA payment schedule is too aggressive. Congress may need to reassess the payment schedule. Congress may need to reassess the PAEA's payment schedule for the USPS due to financial difficulties in meeting obligations. There is confusion regarding consequences if payments are missed, with a suggestion to consider automatic rollover of shortfalls. Additionally, Section 302 of the PAEA addresses the surplus of USPS non-retail facilities, highlighting the need for streamlining and potential consolidation. The Postal Service is urged by Congress to streamline its distribution network, consolidate sorting facilities, and reduce costs. Section 302(c)(1) of the PAEA requires the USPS to produce a facilities plan for rationalization decisions, including providing public notice and information to affected communities. The USPS is required by the PAEA to produce a facilities plan for rationalization decisions, provide public notice, and input for affected communities. Section 302(c)(5) prohibits closing or consolidating processing facilities without public input procedures. The USPS's plan lacks public input processes for all types of facilities, only addressing area mail processing closures. The USPS is criticized for closing non-retail facilities without following required public notification and input processes as mandated by Section 302 of the PAEA. Congress may need to assess the discrepancy between the law and USPS practices, and the PRC's authority to enforce it. Section 102(c)(2) allows USPS to continue nonpostal services pre-2006, while Section 102(c)(3) requires PRC review of each nonpostal service offered. The PAEA's Section 102 mandated the PRC to review nonpostal services offered by the USPS to determine their continuation based on public need and private sector capability. Any nonpostal service not continued would terminate, and the PRC had to designate pricing and regulation for authorized nonpostal services. The PAEA aimed to direct the USPS to focus on postal services and limit new nonpostal services, but this objective has been questioned since its enactment. Since the enactment of the PAEA, the USPS has sought ways to increase postal product and services revenues. They proposed a \"summer sale\" and started selling Hallmark greeting cards at retail postal facilities. The USPS wants greater authority to sell new nonpostal services, as stated by then Postmaster General John Potter. The Postal Service is seeking new lines of business to support its retail and delivery network, including selling nonpostal products at its facilities. This requires new legislation from Congress. The USPS argues that its current business model is unsustainable and needs additional revenue sources. The USPS's business model is considered \"broken\" and in need of changes due to shifts in communication and delivery markets. Postmaster General Potter acknowledged the need for reform and expressed gratitude for efforts to preserve affordable, universal postal services. Despite positive pricing and product changes, the business model remains unsustainable. The USPS's business model is considered \"broken\" due to declining mail volumes and the inability to cover operating costs. The chief financial officer stated that the current model is unsustainable and needs to adapt to changes in communication and delivery markets. The USPS's business model is deemed unviable due to declining mail volumes and revenue. The USPS seeks additional revenues through new nonpostal services. Congress should investigate the fundamental assumptions about postal economics and its impact on USPS operations."
