The Act \"Veterans and Survivors Employment and Training Act of 2007\" expands education programs eligible for accelerated payment of educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill by including approved programs leading to employment in high technology occupations or sectors of the economy with projected job growth. The Act expands education programs eligible for accelerated payment under the Montgomery GI Bill to include programs in high technology sectors or emerging businesses requiring new skills for workers. This includes education pursued at tribally controlled colleges or universities. The Assistance Act of 1978 is amended to allow accelerated payment of basic educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill for programs in high technology sectors or emerging businesses. This includes education at tribally controlled colleges or universities. SEC. 3. Accelerated payment of survivors' and dependents' educational assistance for certain programs of education. Section 3532A allows for accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance for eligible individuals enrolled in approved high technology education programs. Approved education programs under Section 3532A must lead to employment in a growing sector of the economy or in businesses impacted by technology and innovation. Tuition and fees must be reasonable when divided by the program's duration. The accelerated payment of educational assistance for eligible individuals is determined by the lesser of 60 percent of the program's charges or the remaining educational assistance allowance. \"Established charges\" refer to the actual costs of the education program. The established charges for a program of education are determined based on the tuition and fees for the term, quarter, or semester for individuals enrolled in the program. If the program is not offered on a term basis, charges for the entire program are considered. An eligible person electing accelerated payment of educational assistance must certify the established charges for the education program to the Secretary. The payment should be made by the last day of the following month after the educational institution certifies the person's enrollment and charges. The entitlement to basic assistance is contingent on these payments. The accelerated payment of educational assistance under this section charges the person's entitlement based on the amount divided by the monthly rate of educational assistance allowance. If the monthly rate increases during the program, the entitlement chargeable is prorated accordingly. The Secretary determines entitlement chargeable by prorating the initial and increased rates for periods covered. No accelerated payment if advance payment received for the same enrollment period. Program of education includes tribally controlled colleges. Regulations will be prescribed to implement this section. The regulations for accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance under this section will include requirements, conditions, methods for request, issuance, delivery, certification of receipt, use, and recovery of overpayment. The regulations may incorporate elements from section 3014A. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in chapter 35. Accelerated payment of educational assistance allowance under section 3532A includes requirements, methods for request, issuance, delivery, and recovery of overpayment."
