    "content": "Several issues related to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal and state lands are addressed in various bills in the 113th Congress, focusing on the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014 (S. 2363). Hunting and conservation have been linked since the early federal wildlife legislation, with controversy existing about what activities are allowed on federal lands. The act aims to balance opening more lands for these activities with considerations for game management, public safety, and resource management. The Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014 (S. 2363) pending in the Senate covers various issues related to hunting, trapping, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal lands. Section 101 of the bill addresses changes to the duck stamp program, allowing for the sale of duck stamps through the Internet as part of a pilot program. S. 2363 would permanently authorize the electronic issuance of duck stamps, allowing states to apply for authority to issue them online. The bill also exempts lead shot, ammunition, and fishing sinkers from regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The provision seeks legislative certainty for a denied citizen petition to regulate lead in ammunition and fishing sinkers by the EPA. The EPA denied the petition in 2010 and 2012, leading to lawsuits and appeals. The provisions in S. 2363 would prevent federal regulation of lead shot under TSCA but not through other statutory authorities. Section 103 of S. 2363, the Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act, aims to increase the federal share of funds allocated under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act for projects involving public target ranges for firearms or archery. This provision would allow states to use more federal funds for land acquisition, construction, and expansion of these ranges, potentially increasing the federal share from 75% to 90%. Lead shot has been banned for hunting migratory waterfowl in the US since 1991 under other statutory authorities, making the impact of this provision uncertain. The bill aims to increase the federal share from 75% to 90% for projects involving public target ranges for firearms or archery under the Pittman-Robertson program. States may use federal funds for land acquisition, construction, and expansion of these ranges, with the state needing to pay no more than 10% of the project cost. The bill defines a public target range as a location identified by a government agency, open to the public, may be supervised, and accommodates archery or rifle. S. 2363 (Section 104) would exempt Alaska Natives who are subsistence users from purchasing the duck stamp required for waterfowl hunting. Import of polar bear trophies legally taken in Canada was allowed before the listing of polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. The Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a campaign to alert hunters about the potential impact of the ESA listing on trophy imports. S. 2363 (Section 105) would amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act to allow hunters with polar bear trophies legally hunted in Canada to import them to the United States, even if the polar bears are listed as a depleted species. FWS supports importation for hunters who applied for permits before the ESA listing, while others oppose it, fearing it may encourage hunting of species facing imminent listing. The Humane Society of the United States opposes allowing polar bear imports, stating it would undermine conservation efforts and set a dangerous precedent. A federal court upheld the ban on permits for polar bear imports after the species was listed as threatened. Controversy surrounds the hunting of migratory game birds over baited fields, with debates on what constitutes baiting and how long hunters should wait after harvesting before hunting. Section 106 of S. 2363 addresses the baiting prohibition for hunting over crops, defining a bait area as one with salt, grain, or feed to attract game birds, or manipulated cropland. It excludes areas with normal agricultural practices, unmanipulated crops, or flooded crops. The definition of normal agricultural practice is a key feature of this section. Section 106 of S. 2363 defines normal agricultural practices, including consulting the state office of the Cooperative Extension System and the state game department. It also requires an annual report on any changes to these practices. Section 107 addresses hunting, trapping, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal land, implementing an \"open until closed\" management policy. Section 107 of S. 2363 implements an \"open until closed\" management policy for federal lands, outlining criteria for closure determinations and reporting requirements to Congress. It focuses on potential impacts on lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, excluding National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service lands. The definition of federal public land is broad, encompassing any land or water owned and managed by a Federal agency for conservation purposes. The definition of federal public land in Section 107 of S. 2363 is broad, encompassing any land or water owned and managed by a Federal agency for conservation purposes. This definition excludes lands held in trust for Indian tribes, National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service lands. The bill could potentially include lands under other agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation, Department of Defense, and Department of Energy. The Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and Department of Commerce, along with other federal agencies, have natural resource conservation as a purpose. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also includes departments like Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, and the Interior for establishing rights of way on federal lands. Executive orders direct all agencies with land to preserve the environment, indicating a purpose of conservation of natural resources. The scope of federal lands could be contained by referring to specific management agencies rather than describing lands, as seen in other legislation like the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA). The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (FLREA) defines federal land management agencies as specific entities like the National Park Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, or Forest Service. The act also defines hunting as the pursuit, shooting, capture, collection, trapping, or killing of wildlife, including trapping. Trapping is allowed under certain circumstances on federal lands but is less common than traditional hunting. The use of traps, particularly leghold traps, has been controversial. The term \"recreational hunting\" is mentioned multiple times in the definition, indicating a focus on recreational activities. The bill does not distinguish between hunting and recreational hunting, with provisions mentioning fishing, hunting, and trapping without clear distinctions. The definition of recreational fishing includes activities for sport or pleasure involving the lawful catching of fish. The term \"recreational shooting\" is also defined in the bill. Section 107(a) defines recreational shooting as any form of sport, training, competition, or pastime involving the discharge of firearms or use of a bow and arrow. The activities are intended to be included and encouraged on federal public lands. Controversy may arise over shooting ranges on certain lands affected by the promotion of shooting ranges. Section 107(b) of S. 2363 directs federal land management agencies to support hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting opportunities in accordance with state and federal laws. While agencies must facilitate these activities, there is no requirement to prioritize them over other land uses. The bill directs federal land agencies to support hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting opportunities, with a provision giving preference to these activities on Federal public land. There is a complexity in the bill regarding balancing the promotion of these activities with existing management structures and policies. The section specifically applies to BLM and FS, allowing agency heads to lease lands for shooting ranges and designate areas for recreational shooting. Section 107(b)(4)(C) of the bill directs federal land agencies to address recreational shooting, with a provision for consulting advisory councils. It also allows skilled volunteers to assist in wildlife management on federal lands where hunting is prohibited by law. The bill S. 2363 allows skilled volunteers to assist in wildlife management on federal lands where hunting is prohibited by law. It also establishes processes for closing lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting based on certain criteria that may not have been used in developing land plans by federal land ownerships. The bill introduces definitions that could impact existing plans that have not considered these activities as defined. The bill S. 2363 introduces criteria for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting, impacting existing plans that have not considered these activities as defined. Section 107(b)(1) directs agencies to facilitate access to Federal public lands while allowing closures for national security, public safety, or resource conservation reasons. The bill S. 2363 introduces criteria for closing federal lands to hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting based on new criteria, requiring agencies to evaluate activities based on subjective phrases. Section 107(b)(4) applies only to BLM and Forest Service lands. Section 107(b)(4) applies only to BLM and Forest Service lands, directing that they remain open to recreational fishing, hunting, and recreational shooting unless the managing agency decides to close the land. This differs from Section 107(b)(1) which focuses on facilitating access to federal lands for these activities. The specific criteria in Section 107(b)(4) may supersede the application of Section 107(b)(1) to BLM or the Forest Service, providing additional closure criteria or a choice for managers. Under Section 107(b)(4), the head of the agency may close or limit lands for hunting, fishing, or shooting based on various criteria such as resource conservation, public safety, and national security. This allows BLM and the Forest Service to make closure decisions without solely relying on scientific evidence and public input as required by Section 107(b)(1). The criteria for BLM and Forest Service management decisions under this bill add to existing federal land management laws like FLPMA and NFMA. Section 107(b)(6) requires a process for closing or restricting access to federal public land for fishing or hunting on 1280 or more contiguous acres. Unlike other provisions, it does not cover recreational shooting and excludes closures on BLM and Forest Service lands. Closures on BLM and Forest Service lands must follow specific procedures, including coordination with state fish and wildlife agencies and notifying congressional committees. Short-term closures are not exempted, and aggregate effects of multiple closures on areas smaller than 1,280 acres must be considered as a single withdrawal or change. Section 107(b)(6) requires reporting and publication of closures across agencies, with no geographical link necessary. Emergency closures can be made for public safety, conservation, or national security, but the duration is not defined. Coordination among federal land agencies for managing these closures is lacking. The decisions on land closures for hunting, fishing, and shooting will be included in agency planning documents as required by Section 107(b)(3) of S. 2363. While federal lands like BLM, FWS, and FS are open to hunting and fishing, recreational shooting is less common. It is uncertain if all affected lands will have planning documents similar to FS and BLM. Section 107 does not set deadlines for implementing these practices, leaving uncertainty about immediate changes to planning documents. It is unclear if all planning documents must be changed immediately or if management changes could be incorporated when the document is next revised. Section 107 may require immediate revision of land use plans where practices were not compatible, or some portions of the bill may not go into effect until the agency's plan is up for revision. The lands may be open upon the law's enactment regardless of the current plan, especially for BLM and Forest Service lands. It is uncertain what parts of S. 2363 would trigger a plan revision, such as the definition of hunting. The bill S. 2363 requires federal land management agencies to notify Congress of restrictions on hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting. Agencies would need to revise land management plans to allow trapping, incurring costs and undergoing public review processes. The bill also mandates biennial reports on closures of federal land for these activities, with additional reporting required for closures affecting 1,280 acres or more. The bill S. 2363 requires federal land management agencies to notify Congress of closures affecting 1,280 acres or more. It is unclear if the reporting requirements in Section 107 replace or supplement those in FLPMA. Section 107(b)(4) includes a waiver of liability for shooting ranges on BLM and Forest Service lands. The liability limitation may not apply to other recreational shooting activities. The liability limitation in S. 2363 does not apply to other recreational shooting activities. The bill ensures that federal land management does not interfere with state laws regarding fish and wildlife management. Coordination with state agencies is required for various provisions, such as land closures and animal culling. The bill does not authorize federal fees for fishing, hunting, or trapping on federal lands, but agencies may still impose recreation fees under the FLREA for activities like shooting ranges. Land management agencies may need to revise permit requirements due to Section 107 mandates. Section 108 of S. 2363 aims to reduce fees and improve access to federal land and waterways for commercial film crews. The bill specifies that crews of up to five people can obtain a $200 permit for one year for filming in open public use areas. Access may be denied if resources may be damaged, public use disrupted, health or safety risks posed, or if filming involves models or props not part of the natural or cultural resources of the land. The bill aims to improve access to federal land for recreational purposes by directing the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to prepare priority lists for land acquisition projects. The agencies are required to allocate funds for acquiring lands, rights of way, or other interests to enhance access for hunting, fishing, and other recreational activities. The bill directs the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to prepare priority lists for land acquisition projects to improve access for recreational activities. LWCF funds are allocated to agencies like BLM, FWS, NPS, and FS, but the division of funds among agencies is not specified. Section 107(b)(1) may encourage agencies to acquire property for access to federal lands. Section 202 of S. 2363 amends FLTFA to focus on acquiring property adjoining protected sites. Section 202 of S. 2363 amends FLTFA by extending the expiration of the act and eliminating the expiration of the authorization of the FLTFA fund. The current law prevents revenue going to the fund from sales of the lands listed under the Santini-Burton Act. Section 202 of S. 2363 extends the FLTFA act, allowing revenue from land sales to go to the fund. Lands listed under certain acts will not have to share their sales revenue with the FLTFA fund. Section 203 of S. 2363 reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation Act through FY2019, while Section 204 amends the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act to modify selection criteria for its Board of Directors and clarify its authority to receive funds for resource conservation. The Foundation may receive funds from federal departments for wildlife conservation and management, with the ability to collect fees. Federal agencies can waive competitive processes for grants in emergencies or to reduce costs. Gifts to the Foundation do not require further appropriation."
