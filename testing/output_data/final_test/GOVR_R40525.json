It has evolved into a transnational issue, involving various criminal syndicates from around the world. Despite receiving less media attention compared to terrorism, organized crime continues to engage in illicit activities. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey reconvened the Organized Crime Council in 2008 to address these evolving threats. Organized crime in the United States poses a threat to the economy, national security, and other interests. The Organized Crime Council has indicated that these criminal organizations engage in a wide range of illegal activities, including penetrating strategic sectors of the economy, providing support to terrorists and foreign entities, smuggling people and contraband goods, exploiting financial systems, using cyberspace for attacks, manipulating securities exchanges, corrupting public officials, and using violence for power. The impact of organized crime extends beyond traditional activities, affecting the economy and national security. Congress needs to assess if new tools are needed to combat evolving threats. Additionally, the adequacy of federal resources allocated to organized crime should be considered, as resources have shifted towards counterterrorism post-9/11, leading to a decrease in law enforcement resources for organized crime cases. The report discusses the resources allocated to combat organized crime by Congress, including trends in federal efforts, impact on the US, prominent crime groups, and potential nexus with terrorism. The report discusses the attributes of organized crime, including structure, membership, violence, illegal enterprises, and corruption, as a framework for policy considerations. Modern organized crime groups differ from traditional ones like the Italian Mafia in terms of hierarchy. Organized crime groups, unlike traditional ones such as the Italian Mafia, have a rigid hierarchy and restrict membership based on various factors. Violence and corruption are integral aspects, with a focus on making money through illegal enterprises and infiltrating legitimate businesses. These groups may also attempt to corrupt public officials to avoid investigation or prosecution. The primary goal is profit, distinguishing them from ideology-driven terrorist groups. There is no current statutory definition of organized crime. The Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 defined organized crime as the unlawful activities of a highly organized association involved in illegal goods and services. This definition was repealed in 1979, leaving the US without a statutory definition of organized crime. Organized crime in the United States is defined under Title IX of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) as an \"enterprise\" engaging in a \"pattern of racketeering activity.\" RICO lists predicate offenses for racketeering, but does not distinguish criminal from legal enterprises. The history of organized crime in the US dates back to before the 20th century, with a peak during Prohibition. Law enforcement has traditionally targeted these criminal networks. In the 20th century, U.S. law enforcement targeted traditional organized crime networks such as the Italian Mafia, Russian Mafia, Japanese Yakuza, and Chinese Tongs involved in illegal activities like gambling, loan sharking, narcotics trafficking, extortion, prostitution, bootlegging, fraud, racketeering, theft, murder, and money laundering. Efforts to investigate and control organized crime included Senate hearings led by Senator Kefauver and Senator McClellan, as well as conferences at Oyster Bay in 1965 and 1966. The 1967 Task Force on Organized Crime reported a rise in organized crime in America, with an increase in indictments and convictions from 1961 to 1966. Despite the rise in numbers, the proportion of convictions of individuals from organized crime groups actually declined during this period. Law enforcement measures to combat organized crime had not been successful, with the responsibility primarily falling on state and local agencies. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 increased the federal government's role in combating organized crime by providing grant money to state law enforcement agencies. It addressed the use of wire and oral communications by organized criminals. The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 strengthened federal law enforcement's ability to combat criminal organizations by granting electronic wiretapping authority to intercept communications of suspected criminals, particularly those involved in illegal activities like narcotics distribution. The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-452) enhanced federal efforts to combat criminal organizations by establishing Special Grand Juries to investigate organized crime, granting immunity to witnesses in exchange for testimony, and creating the Witness Security Program (WITSEC) for protecting and relocating witnesses and their families. Additionally, it led to the creation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) allows for the prosecution of individuals involved in criminal enterprises through racketeering activities. It has been a key tool in organized crime prosecutions and led to legislation on asset forfeiture and money laundering to combat organized crime's financial structures. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 expanded upon RICO provisions for asset forfeiture, specifying that proceeds from racketeering activities were subject to forfeiture. The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 improved the federal government's ability to prosecute organized crime cases by revising rules for civil forfeiture proceedings. Money laundering was established as a federal criminal offense in the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986. The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 established money laundering as a federal criminal offense, with penalties and procedures for forfeiting illicit funds. The Department of Justice and FBI rely on RICO, money laundering, and asset forfeiture statutes for investigating organized crime. After 9/11, focus shifted to counterterrorism, but there is now renewed attention to fighting traditional crime, including organized crime. The Organized Crime Council met in 2008 for the first time in 15 years. The Organized Crime Council met in April 2008 for the first time since 1993, focusing on the transnational nature of organized crime. Federal agencies have played a larger role in combating organized crime since the 1960s, with a shift towards transnational operations following the Cold War and globalization. The federal government, through various agencies, is actively involved in combating organized crime both domestically and internationally. The Department of Justice, led by the U.S. Attorney General's Organized Crime Council, coordinates efforts with agencies like the FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE, Secret Service, IRS, and others to address the threats posed by organized crime groups. The FBI is the primary agency involved in combating organized crime, with the Transnational Criminal Enterprise Section responsible for investigating various criminal enterprises. The Organized Crime Section is divided into units focusing on Italian organized crime, Eurasian/Middle Eastern organized crime, and Asian and African criminal enterprises. The FBI uses the Enterprise Theory of Investigation (ETI) as a key analytical tool to identify criminal organizations and their activities. The FBI utilizes the Enterprise Theory of Investigation (ETI) to identify criminal organizations and their financial assets for possible forfeiture. This technique complements the RICO statutes in dismantling criminal organizations and targeting money laundering. FBI field offices collaborate with state, local, and federal agencies in organized crime task forces to combat various criminal syndicates. The FBI's Minneapolis field division leads an Organized Crime Task Force that collaborates with other agencies to target criminal organizations. In New York, specific task forces focus on La Cosa Nostra families. Various agencies work together to combat organized crime, such as the FBI partnering with the Department of Labor and other authorities when investigating labor racketeering. The Department of Justice has Strike Force Units dedicated to prosecuting organized crime cases. The Department of Justice's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section has Strike Force Units in 21 federal districts with a significant organized crime presence, focusing on large RICO cases. The U.S. Attorney General oversees criminal investigations, including those related to organized crime. The United States ratified the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime in 2005. The United States ratified the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocols on trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. The Convention allows for greater international law enforcement cooperation to combat organized crime threats, including support for the UN Office of Drugs and Crime. The UNODC supports UN member countries in implementing the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime to combat international organized crime. The U.S. National Central Bureau of INTERPOL coordinates with international partners on organized crime cases, and the FBI participates in international working groups to combat organized crime. Federal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and Italy collaborate through the Italian American Working Group. The Italian American Working Group, established in 1984, addresses issues such as organized crime, drug trafficking, money laundering, cybercrime, and extradition between the United States and Italy. The Pantheon Project enhances law enforcement cooperation by placing FBI agents at the Italian National Police headquarters and Italian officers at the FBI. The FBI also collaborates with international working groups to combat Russian organized crime, including the Eurasian Organized Crime Working Group and the Central European Working Group. Additionally, a joint FBI/Hungarian National Police task force in Budapest was created in 2000 to counter the threat of Russian organized crime. The FBI has requested additional funding for the international task force created in 2000 to counter Russian organized crime. The FBI, along with other law enforcement agencies, has provided INTERPOL with information on Eurasian organized crime for Project Millennium. Despite the increasing threats posed by organized crime, federal resources dedicated to this issue have actually decreased since 2001. Following the 9/11 attacks, federal law enforcement priorities shifted towards counterterrorism activities over traditional crime fighting. The FBI reorganized to prioritize counterterrorism and counterintelligence, while maintaining a consistent number of field agents for organized crime matters. Despite the increasing threats from organized crime, federal resources dedicated to this issue have decreased since 2001. The FBI's allocation of agents for organized crime did not align with actual utilization, with a 35% decrease in agents utilized from FY2000 to FY2004. Questions arise regarding the allocation and utilization rates post-9/11 attacks and FBI reorganization, suggesting a potential decrease in the threat posed by organized crime in 2004 compared to 2000. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey reconvened the Organized Crime Council in 2008 after 15 years, stating that organized crime remains a significant threat. FBI's decrease in agent utilization for organized crime may be due to prioritizing counterterrorism over other issues. The FBI has shifted resources away from traditional crime squads like organized crime to prioritize counterterrorism. This shift, coupled with a lack of manpower and funding, has led to a decrease in agent utilization for organized crime matters. FBI Director Robert Muller acknowledges the need to restore criminal programs to appropriate resource levels. Between FY2005 and FY2009, the FBI saw a decrease in the number of agents utilized for organized crime matters, dropping from 525 agents in FY2005 to 443 agents in FY2009. The data for agent utilization during this period cannot be directly compared to previous years due to differences in classification, including the inclusion of transnational organized crime matters. The specific allocation of agents for organized crime in FY2005-FY2009 is unknown, as allocation data were only available for overall criminal enterprise casework. In FY2000, the FBI had 682 field agents investigating organized crime, initiating 433 investigations. By FY2004, the number of agents decreased to 433, with 263 investigations opened. The decrease in cases does not necessarily indicate a decrease in the organized crime threat, as the number of agents investigating also decreased proportionally. The decrease in the number of federal agents investigating organized crime cases may not accurately reflect a decrease in organized crime activity. This could lead to an increased workload for each agent if the organized crime threat remains sustained. The Department of Justice oversees federal organized crime prosecutions through the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section (OCRS). There has not been a consistent increase or decrease in the number of organized crime cases filed with the USAOs from FY1999 through FY2010. Several factors could influence the number of cases referred for prosecution. The trends in organized crime prosecutions may not accurately reflect the actual activities of organized crime groups. Prosecutions are influenced by Administration priorities and only represent a small subset of crimes committed. It is unclear if current resources and tools are effective in combating today's transnational organized crime threats in the United States. Organized crime in the United States has become increasingly transnational due to factors like economic globalization and improved technology. The National Intelligence Council predicts that criminal networks will gain more power by 2025, potentially taking over some countries. The FBI provides information on prominent organized crime groups in the US and their activities, threatening various domestic industries. The FBI investigates organized crime groups in the United States, including La Cosa Nostra, Eurasian/Middle Eastern organized crime, and Asian criminal organizations. The Organized Crime and Racketeering Section at the DOJ analyzes organized crime threats in terms of principal threat areas rather than individual groups. Despite the popular association with the Italian Mafia, organized crime in the US encompasses various criminal organizations. Russian organized crime groups, along with other Eurasian crime groups, are considered the top organized crime threat to the United States by the FBI. These groups emerged in the late 1970s and expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. They operate with a less traditional hierarchical structure compared to the Italian Cosa Nostra, forming networks based on specific crime skills needed. Russian organized crime groups in the United States are involved in various criminal activities such as extortion, abduction, human smuggling, drug trafficking, and white-collar crimes like money laundering and fraud. The FBI focuses on fraud cases involving Russian organized crime, spanning industries like healthcare, precious metals, credit cards, insurance, securities, and investment. These groups operate in major cities like New York, New Jersey, Boston, and Miami, relying on tactics like RICO and money laundering. The FBI and local police departments in major cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Miami have set up task forces to combat Russian organized crime syndicates. International working groups, such as the Eurasian Organized Crime Working Group, are also involved in dismantling these criminal organizations. The FBI is actively involved in international efforts to combat organized crime, including task forces in Budapest and Bucharest. Asian organized crime groups have been present in the US since the early 1900s, with an increase in activity since the 1990s. Research shows that there are multiple crime syndicates rather than one unified group. Asian organized crime groups consist of various syndicates, including Chinese triads, Japanese Yakuza, tongs, and Asian street gangs like Big Circle and Fuk Ching. They profit from drug and human trafficking, as well as other criminal activities such as money laundering, counterfeiting, and fraud. These groups are willing to cooperate across ethnic and racial lines for profit, similar to Russian organized crime groups. They are active in cities like Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, Newark, Philadelphia, and Portland. Areas with high prevalence of Asian organized crime in the US include Chicago, Honolulu, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York, Newark, Philadelphia, Portland, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC. Law enforcement uses RICO, money laundering, and asset forfeiture laws to prosecute these syndicates. Efforts are made to combat Asian organized crime through domestic and international working groups, such as the Interagency Working Group on Alien Smuggling and the FBI/National Police Agency of Japan Working Group. The La Cosa Nostra (LCN) is the most prominent Italian organized crime group in the United States, involved in illegal activities like gambling, drug trafficking, and money laundering. Operating mainly in the New York metropolitan area, the LCN poses a threat to American society. With five principal crime families, the LCN has been active since the 1920s and is still a concern today. Congressional and law enforcement efforts have historically targeted the Mafia's illegal activities. Efforts to control organized crime focused on combating the Mafia (LCN) through laws like the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act and the 1970 Organized Crime Control Act. Civil RICO lawsuits have helped remove the LCN from industries like gaming and unions. Despite these measures, the LCN remains a significant threat. The FBI also identifies Balkan organized crime, particularly Albanian groups, as major threats. Albanian organized crime groups, part of Balkan organized crime, are identified by the FBI as formidable and expanding. They have evolved from close-knit families to include outsiders with specific criminal expertise. Active in various US cities, they engage in illegal activities such as gambling, drug trafficking, and money laundering. An emerging trend is increased cooperation with other organized crime groups. The FBI has noted an expansion of Balkan organized crime, with the LCN partnering with Albanian groups in New York. Other organized crime threats include Middle Eastern enterprises involved in theft and fraud, and Nigerian syndicates in heroin trafficking and money laundering. These groups often target their own communities initially. The Italian-American mafia in the 1920s victimized their own community in Little Italy before expanding their illegal activities to other neighborhoods in New York. The U.S. Department of Justice Organized Crime Council has identified eight strategic threats posed by international organized crime groups. The U.S. Department of Justice Organized Crime Council has identified strategic threats posed by international organized crime groups, including penetration of strategic sectors, support to terrorists, smuggling of contraband, financial system exploitation, cyber targeting, securities manipulation, corruption of public officials, and use of violence for power. Former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey outlined strategic goals in combating these threats. The U.S. Department of Justice Organized Crime Council aims to target the largest organized crime threats, dismantle criminal organizations, and provide law enforcement with updated legislation to combat international organized crime. This includes expanding laws and regulations to investigate and prosecute organized criminals affecting American society from outside U.S. borders. Organized crime poses significant threats to the United States, impacting the economy through illegal activities like tax evasion and money laundering. These activities weaken financial markets and result in a loss of tax revenue for the government. Money laundering involves various methods to turn illegal funds into \"clean money,\" becoming increasingly complex and hard to detect with the rise of the Internet and globalization. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) identifies banks, check cashers, money transmitters, businesses, and casinos as common routes for money laundering. Techniques like wire transfers, shell companies, and currency smuggling are used to conceal illicit funds. The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 made money laundering a federal crime to combat organized criminals disguising their profits. The scope of the money laundering statute has been recently scrutinized. The money laundering statute has been recently examined and amended to clarify the definition of \"proceeds.\" The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the definition to include gross receipts of illegal activities, potentially aiding in investigating and prosecuting organized crime across international borders. Recently enacted legislation has not addressed predicate offenses related to the trafficking of contraband cigarettes by criminal syndicates, posing a significant threat to American society and the economy. Cigarette smuggling leads to lost tax revenue, forcing businesses to raise taxes on consumers, especially concerning during the current economic recession. This illicit activity results in the illegal redistribution of revenues that could fund government programs. Congress has debated revising the Jenkins Act to combat organized crime involvement in cigarette trafficking. Organized crime groups are increasingly involved in counterfeit and pirated goods, targeting industries like music, movies, clothing, luxury goods, and tobacco. The federal government has taken steps to combat intellectual property crimes, including creating an Intellectual Property Task Force in 2004. The Office of the United States Trade Representative is working on an Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) with other countries to combat piracy and counterfeiting by organized crime groups. Asian organized crime groups in Los Angeles and New Jersey are involved in producing fake currency, which can lead to financial losses and damage the value of the U.S. dollar. Some experts suggest expanding organized crime and money laundering statutes to include large-scale piracy and counterfeiting tied to other criminal activities to counter the involvement of organized crime in piracy and counterfeiting. Concerns have been raised about the potential nexus between organized crime and terrorism, with the principal distinction being motivation - money for organized crime and ideology for terrorism. The National Intelligence Council expects the relationship between terrorists and organized criminals to remain primarily a matter of business until 2020. The relationship between terrorists and organized criminals is primarily a business arrangement, with terrorists seeking goods and services from criminals when needed. Organized crime groups are unlikely to form long-term alliances with terrorists due to their focus on profit. Both groups are motivated by money, with terrorists sometimes obtaining funding from criminal acts. Terrorist organizations and organized crime groups may both benefit monetarily from piracy, a high-profit, low-risk activity. While there is currently less evidence of terrorist involvement in piracy, the possibility of short-term business alliances between criminals and terrorists is a concern for citizens and policymakers. The FBI is watchful for any potential nexus between organized crime groups and terrorists, as criminals may be inclined to work with terrorists for sufficient funds. Organized crime groups may be inclined to work with terrorists if offered sufficient funds. There are reported instances of international criminals conspiring to support terrorist organizations, such as Viktor Bout selling weapons to FARC. While there are no direct instances of organized crime groups working with terrorists, there are cases of \"narco-terrorism\" where terrorism is funded through drug trafficking proceeds. Examples include the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Hizbollah, and Al-Qaida. The GAO reports U.S. officials are concerned about the links between terrorist organizations and organized crime, including drug trafficking. Policymakers may question the nexus between domestic organized crime and terrorism and what measures will combat both effectively. Congress may need to consider if current tools like RICO, money laundering, and asset forfeiture statutes are still effective against today's evolving organized crime. The FBI is facing challenges in combating organized crime due to a decrease in resources, as evidenced by a decline in the number of agents used for investigations. Congress is considering expanding statutes like RICO, money laundering, and asset forfeiture to better equip federal law enforcement in fighting organized crime. FBI Director Robert Muller testified to the need for restoring resources to the FBI's criminal programs, including organized crime, by potentially increasing overall funding to federal law enforcement agencies. This could align organized crime agent utilization with agent allocation without taking resources away from higher priority areas. One policy option is to provide directed funding for organized crime matters to ensure resources are utilized effectively. Another option is to consider existing resources for organized crime as sufficient, given budget constraints and the national priority of combating terrorism. Reevaluating funding for organized crime may be warranted if more funding is available or if the link between organized crime and terrorism is stronger. The federal government is already involved in multilateral efforts. The federal government is involved in multilateral efforts to combat organized crime, working with state and local agencies and international allies. Joint task forces have been formed to target various organized crime groups, but potential jurisdictional issues may arise as organized crime expands beyond state and national lines. There is a clear line between state and federal jurisdiction for prosecuting crimes, but agency responsibility for investigating cases may be unclear at times. Jurisdictional issues can arise in investigating cases due to overlapping agency responsibilities, especially in complex cases like organized crime involving multiple agencies like the FBI and DEA. International law enforcement coordination is also crucial, with the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime facilitating cooperation between countries through mutual legal assistance and extradition. The United States enhances its ability to combat international organized crime through provisions requiring extradition for criminal offenses outlined in the Convention. International cooperation and partnerships allow U.S. law enforcement to extend expertise and capabilities to assist overseas agencies in combating organized crime. However, challenges include the increased time required for international investigations. The challenges of international investigations include increased time required, potential for organized crime groups to conduct illegal activities for longer periods, and inconsistent involvement of federal prosecutors. Additionally, Congress has granted the federal government extraterritorial jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute individuals who violate U.S. interests abroad. The extraterritorial jurisdiction granted to the federal government by Congress does not cover all crimes committed by organized crime groups, leading to questions about extending it. The potential nexus between organized crime and terrorism may blur the lines between the two, even if they do not form long-term alliances. The National Security Council suggests that organized criminals and terrorists may ally for certain purposes. Organized criminals and terrorists may ally for business purposes, as they both depend on money. There are potential overlaps between these groups, such as sharing visa providers and drawing on each other's structures for financing operations. Drug trafficking is a profitable activity for both. Drug trafficking, human trafficking, weapons trafficking, endangered species trafficking, art theft, and credit card fraud are some of the profitable illegal activities for organized crime groups and terrorist organizations. Analysts suggest that combating organized crime is crucial in the fight against terrorism, as there may be overlap in their criminal activities and funding sources. Congress should consider this nexus when addressing national security and resource allocation."
