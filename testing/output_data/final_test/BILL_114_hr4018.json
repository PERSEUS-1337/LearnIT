The \"Consumer Protection and Choice Act\" includes requirements for deferred presentment transactions, prohibiting them except as authorized by the new section 128B which regulates deferred presentment providers in states with covered laws. The \"Consumer Protection and Choice Act\" regulates deferred presentment providers in states with covered laws by requiring them to be licensed, undergo background checks, and maintain a database of transactions. The \"Consumer Protection and Choice Act\" mandates deferred presentment providers to verify consumer identification, check transaction history, and report to the state database immediately. The deferred presentment transaction agreement requires consumer information such as name, social security number, address, driver's license number, and transaction amount. The deferred presentment transaction agreement includes consumer information like name, social security number, address, driver's license number, and transaction amount. It also requires details such as the date of the transaction, repayment due date, and any other relevant information determined by the State. Upon repayment or settlement of the transaction, the agreement must include the date and time when the amount owed is satisfied. The deferred presentment transaction agreement must adhere to specific requirements, including limiting interest and fees to 10% of the transaction amount and a $5 processing fee, restricting the transaction duration to 7-31 days, capping the transaction amount at $500, and ensuring consumer information is included. The deferred presentment transaction agreement must adhere to specific requirements, including limiting transaction amount to $500, in writing, allowing consumer to rescind within 24 hours, and including other state-determined information. If a consumer fails to repay by the due date, the provider must follow the law or regulation. If a consumer fails to repay by the contractual repayment date, a deferred presentment provider must offer a 60-day grace period without extra charges. The grace period ends if the consumer doesn't attend a credit counseling appointment within 7 days. The 7-day period starting from the contractual repayment date is crucial for completing a credit counseling course. A deferred presentment transaction meeting the requirements of this section and state law is not considered unfair, deceptive, or abusive. These regulations will be effective 24 months after enactment. The term 'deferment period' is defined for this section. The term 'deferment period' refers to the number of days a deferred presentment provider waits before processing a consumer's payment instrument.

The agreement establishing this transaction is known as a deferred presentment transaction agreement. The term 'other payment instrument' includes drafts, warrants, money orders, traveler's checks, or electronic instruments. The term 'State' refers to individual states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories and possessions. The State deferred presentment transaction database is defined as the database established by the State that issued the consumer's form of identification.
