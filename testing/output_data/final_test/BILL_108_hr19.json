    "content": "The \"Economic Security Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title. Federal-State agreements are addressed in the Act. The \"Economic Security Act of 2003\" allows states to enter agreements with the Secretary of Labor to make payments of regular compensation to individuals according to state law with specified modifications. States can terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. Eligibility for compensation under this title is determined by applying a base period ending at the close of the most recently completed calendar quarter for individuals not eligible for regular compensation under State law due to various reasons such as availability for work or seeking less than full-time work. If an individual seeks less than full-time work or fails to accept full-time work, they may still be eligible for compensation under this title. The amount of regular compensation payable for any week is determined by the State law, with an additional 15 percent or $25, whichever is greater. The nonreduction rule may cease to apply to a State if the Secretary determines that the method governing the computation of regular compensation under the State law needs to change. The computation of regular compensation under State law has been modified to ensure that the average weekly amount of compensation payable is less than what would have been paid under the law before September 11, 2001. These modifications also apply to determining benefits under Federal law based on State compensation. SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO STATES WITH AGREEMENTS UNDER THIS ACT. Payments to states with agreements under this Act include 100 percent of regular compensation for individuals based on specific modifications and comparable provisions in state laws. The law allows for reimbursement of sums to states with agreements under the Act, payable in advance or by reimbursement as determined by the Secretary. The amounts are estimated monthly and adjusted based on previous payments. Estimates can be made using statistical or sampling methods agreed upon by the Secretary and the state agency. The Secretary appropriates $500,000,000 from the Unemployment Trust Fund for states to cover administration costs and provide reemployment services to unemployment claimants. State shares are determined based on factors in the Social Security Act. SEC. 4. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the Unemployment Trust Fund will be used to make payments to States under this Act. The Secretary will certify payments to each State, and the Treasury will make payments accordingly. The Unemployment Trust Fund will transfer funds from the Federal unemployment account to the State account for payments under this Act. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The terms \"compensation\", \"regular compensation\", \"base period\", \"State\", \"State agency\", \"State law\", and \"week\" have specific meanings under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. In the case of a State entering into an agreement under this Act, \"State law\" refers to the State law of that State with modifications, and \"regular compensation\" refers to the compensation determined under its State law. The term \"State law\" has specific meanings under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, except as provided or where context indicates otherwise. SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY. An agreement under this Act applies to unemployment weeks starting after the agreement date and ending before July 1, 2004. Specific rules include exceptions for certain modifications based on claim filing dates. SEC. 7. NO REDUCTION IN UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION DUE TO PENSION ROLLOVERS. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to exclude rollover distributions from being included in gross income for the taxable year. The amendment applies to compensation for weeks of unemployment starting 60 days after the enactment of the Economic Security Act of 2003. The State is not considered to be non-compliant with the Compensation Act of 1970 solely for not meeting requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session following the enactment of the Act. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is seen as a separate regular session of the State legislature."
