    "content": "The rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology presents challenges and opportunities to the energy sector. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use blockchain technology for transactions, leading to increased energy demand for mining activities. Washington state hosted a significant portion of global Bitcoin mining operations in 2018. Cryptocurrency mining can lead to increased energy demand, affecting electricity rates locally. Blockchain technology offers opportunities for energy and financial transactions on a smart grid. The report discusses mining operations, state and utility responses to energy demand from Bitcoin mining, and potential policy options for Congress regarding energy conservation and blockchain technology in the energy sector. Blockchain technology enables secure transactions among parties without trust. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, Alpha Coin, and Papyrus validate transactions in a decentralized network, offering fast and bulk validation outside traditional intermediaries. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, facilitates the exchange of digital assets for goods or services. Blockchain technology utilizes encryption and peer-to-peer networks to secure transactions in an addition-only manner. Transactions are grouped into blocks that are linked to previous blocks, ensuring transparency and tamper resistance. The use of encryption guarantees asset rights, while P2P networks distribute information without a central authority. Bitcoin ownership can be gained through purchasing directly, earning in exchange for goods or services, or mining. Mining involves creating and publishing new blocks in a blockchain. Miners are incentivized to add blocks through monetary, reputational, or stake rewards. Bitcoin adds new blocks through proof-of-work (PoW), presenting miners with difficult computational problems. Bitcoin mining involves solving difficult computational problems through proof-of-work (PoW) to create new blocks in the blockchain. Miners use a nonce to generate a hash value that ensures data integrity. By changing the nonce, miners aim to find a hash value with a specific number of zeros at the beginning. This process is computationally intensive and essential for the security of the blockchain. Miners solve computational problems by testing nonces to find a valid hash for a block in Bitcoin mining. They win the opportunity to post the next block and receive rewards. Once a valid hash is found, it is announced to the community through P2P networking. Other users validate the solution, and once confirmed by the majority, the block is added to the chain. Miners follow strict rules to maintain market structure, with a limited number of Bitcoins to be mined, creating scarcity value. Rewards for published blocks halve every 210,000 blocks, with new blocks published every 10 minutes. The reward for new Bitcoin diminishes every four years as the rewards for published blocks halve every 210,000 blocks. On October 31, 2018, block 548173 rewarded the miner with 12.5 Bitcoins plus approximately 0.2 Bitcoins in transaction fees. Bitcoin is rewarded on a first-come, first-served basis to the miner who solves and publishes the solution first. Miners compete against each other to be the first to resolve the PoW and earn the reward, leading to criticism of the PoW system for the energy expended on \"useless\" calculations. Miners have evolved from using CPUs to ASICs for Bitcoin mining, leading to more efficient operations in larger groups. Bitcoin mining has evolved from individual operations to mining pools, where miners share costs and profits to increase transaction success. ASICs are used in data centers with cheap electricity, but energy consumption and competition between pools remain issues. Mining requires energy for calculations and device operation, with nodes being individual users or pooled resources on the blockchain. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is influenced by factors such as hardware computing power, network hashrate, difficulty, and thermal regulation. Devices with higher hashrates can perform more calculations in less time, leading to varying power requirements. The number of connected devices on the network is unknown, and energy consumption can also be affected by the price of Bitcoin. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is influenced by factors like hardware computing power, network hashrate, and difficulty. The price of Bitcoin can also impact energy intensity. In December 2017, the price surge led to increased mining activity, driving up energy consumption as miners upgraded to more powerful equipment. Technology advancements have improved device efficiency, but the network hashrate continues to rise with Bitcoin's popularity. As of mid-March 2018, the Bitcoin network performs 26 quintillion hashing operations per second. The global Bitcoin network's power requirements have increased in the last five years, with estimates showing a significant energy consumption. Studies have used hashrates and miner hashing efficiencies to determine power consumption, with the largest estimate being nearly 1% of U.S. electricity generating capacity. Other cryptocurrencies have been found to have lower power requirements compared to Bitcoin. Some believe that future growth in Bitcoin may not significantly impact energy consumption and CO2 emissions, as only the most competitive miners with efficient hardware and low electricity costs will persist. Energy demands could decrease as the reward incentive shifts from mining new Bitcoin to earning transaction fees. This could make energy consumption from Bitcoin mining a temporary issue. The increasing network hashrates of cryptocurrencies suggest rising energy consumption and CO2 emissions. A study projected that Bitcoin usage could lead to a significant increase in global CO2 emissions, potentially causing a 2\u00b0C rise in global average temperature within 30 years. The projections on Bitcoin's energy consumption do not consider factors like renewable energy sources or potential price collapses. Calls for reform in the cryptocurrency industry have been made due to the growing energy consumption. Some suggest shifting to alternative protocols like Proof-of-Stake to reduce energy usage. Blockchain technology has the potential to be applied in various sectors, including the energy sector. Different protocols like Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Authority could offer more energy-efficient validation methods. Factors such as scalability, speed of transactions, and ideal mining locations play a role in the adoption of these technologies. Geographic characteristics like proximity to renewable energy sources can impact energy costs. Local and national governments worldwide have varying responses to blockchain technology. Local and national governments worldwide have responded differently to the growth of Bitcoin, with some actively developing cryptocurrency industries, others restricting or regulating cryptocurrencies. China and the United States host the majority of major mining pools, with other countries like Australia, Canada, Georgia, Russia, and Sweden also involved in significant mining activities. China has taken steps to regulate and tax Bitcoin trading, and has even proposed a ban on mining due to its perceived wastefulness and hazards. Regulations may impact China's share of major mining pools in the future. China's share of major mining pools may change substantially in response to regulations and policy actions. The Chinese government has implemented various restrictions on cryptocurrencies, including banning ICOs and shutting down mainland cryptocurrency exchanges. They have also requested local governments to regulate mining companies and facilitate their orderly exit from the Bitcoin mining business. Despite a significant drop in Bitcoin trading with the Chinese yuan, China remained a popular location for mining in 2018. In 2018, China remained a popular location for cryptocurrency mining due to low energy costs. Mining operations seek cheap and reliable electricity, with some utilizing closed industrial facilities in the United States. Geographic locations with favorable electricity rates and policies attract mining operations. In the United States, electricity sales are regulated by federal, state, and local laws. States have jurisdiction over retail electricity transactions, but federal and municipal authorities also play a role. States with affordable electricity rates are seeing an increase in cryptocurrency mining operations, leading to the development of local regulations. Examples include New York and Plattsburgh implementing various measures. In response to the growth in energy demand from cryptocurrency mining activities, New York State and the city of Plattsburgh have implemented policies. New York State approved a bill to create a digital currency task force composed of technology experts, investors, and academics. The task force aims to produce a report in 2020 on energy consumption for mining operations and related policy considerations. New York State also requires a license for cryptocurrency businesses, known as a \"Bitlicense,\" to address anti-money laundering concerns. In 2019, the Bitlicense was implemented in Plattsburgh to regulate crypto mining companies, requiring background checks on employees. Plattsburgh benefits from cheap electricity from NYPA's hydroelectric facility. Despite exceeding electricity demand, the city faced challenges with cryptocurrency mining. In 2017, two cryptocurrency mining businesses operated in Plattsburgh due to cheap electricity. However, during a cold winter in early 2018, electricity rates increased as demand exceeded supply from a hydropower facility. Cryptocurrency mining accounted for 10% of local power demand, leading to higher electricity bills for residents. The costs of purchasing additional power were distributed among all customer classes. In January 2018, cryptocurrency companies in Plattsburgh caused a $10 increase in monthly electricity bills for residents. The city imposed an 18-month moratorium on new mining operations, and the New York Public Service Commission allowed power authorities to issue tariffs on high-density-load customers. Plattsburgh also addressed fire safety and nuisance concerns related to mining through local laws. In December 2017, Coinmint, a crypto mining company, signed a lease to convert a retired Alcoa aluminum plant in Massena, NY into a cryptocurrency mining facility. They requested 15 MW of subsidized power from NYPA for 150 jobs and $700 million in local investment. However, in March 2018, NYPA approved a moratorium on allocating economic development assistance for high-density-load operations. The New York State Public Service Commission approved new electricity rates for Massena in July 2018. The New York State Public Service Commission approved new electricity rates in July 2018 for the Massena Electric Department, allowing high-density load customers like cryptocurrency companies to be eligible for service under an individual agreement. Washington also has affordable hydropower, with the Mid-Columbia Basin generating surplus electricity that is exported to larger markets, keeping local consumer costs low at about $0.025/kWh. Since 2012, the Mid-Columbia Basin has attracted Bitcoin mining companies due to low-priced electricity, leading to a growth in energy demand that has challenged the cost structure of public utility districts. Some districts imposed a moratorium on new mining operations applications to prevent contracts from outpacing their original projections and planning for demand increases. For example, in Douglas County, a new 84-MW substation was expected to serve the area for the next 30 to 50 years under normal population growth. The public utility districts in the Mid-Columbia Basin are facing challenges due to the rapid growth in energy demand from Bitcoin mining companies. The existing infrastructure is unable to keep up with the demand, leading to concerns about the cost of upgrading infrastructure and dealing with \"rogue\" miners who operate without proper permits. PUDs may have to purchase power on the open market to meet the growing demand. Some public utility districts in the Mid-Columbia Basin are struggling with the increased energy demand from Bitcoin mining companies. Concerns include the cost of upgrading infrastructure and dealing with miners operating without permits. Despite potential risks, there are efforts to explore alternative uses for blockchain technology, such as building a \"blockchain innovation campus\" in Douglas County. In 2018, a Bitcoin mining firm declared bankruptcy, owing creditors nearly $7 million, including $310,000 to Douglas County Public Utility District. Cryptocurrency mining is decentralized, impacting profits and location selection. Canada offers affordable hydroelectric power and cold weather climate, reducing cooling costs. In response to excess electricity, Hydro-Quebec offered discounted rates to cryptocurrency miners in January 2018. This led to a high demand for electricity from miners, with around 100 inquiries by February 2018. Hydro-Quebec received several thousand megawatts worth of project proposals, leading them to halt processing requests until guidelines are developed. A study commissioned in May 2018 estimated that cryptocurrency mining could create direct job opportunities ranging from 1.2 jobs per MW to 0.4 jobs per MW. Cryptocurrency mining in Quebec and Georgia has different job creation rates per MW compared to data centers. Hydro-Quebec tripled prices for mining operations temporarily. Quebec towns have placed moratoriums on new mining operations due to energy, size, and noise concerns. Georgia offers low electricity rates for mining operations due to hydropower resources. In 2015, the government of Georgia offered Bitfury a $10 million loan to mine in Georgia, expanding a power plant to provide free electricity. Local miners struggle to compete with Bitfury, lacking similar incentives. Some criticize the government for favoring Bitfury, creating tax-free zones for mining activities. Iran also attracts mining operations with cheap electricity. Iran's cheap electricity, mainly from natural gas, attracts mining operations. The country is the third largest producer of natural gas globally. With electricity subsidies, Iran offers low prices at around $0.006/kWh. Despite U.S. sanctions, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin transactions poses challenges for enforcement. The U.S. Department of the Treasury is tracking digital currency addresses to identify illicit actors, particularly in Iran. The Iranian government is considering new cryptocurrency regulations, restricting non-central bank-backed digital currencies but allowing rial-backed cryptocurrency use and ICOs. The draft regulations in Iran authorize rial-backed cryptocurrency use, ICOs, and mining activities. Some miners may be deterred from relocating to Iran due to potential negative consequences from the United States. The Power Ministry is considering imposing special tariffs on cryptocurrency miners to address the increased energy demand. New rules for the cryptocurrency market in Iran were ratified in August 2019, allowing mining under certain conditions, including approval from the Ministry of Industry and conducting activities outside of provincial centers. Blockchain technology offers various opportunities within the energy sector, including smart contracts, distributed energy resource record keeping, and trading Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) without the need for a centralized entity. In Iran, regulations allow for mining activities outside of provincial centers, with potential tariffs on cryptocurrency miners to address increased energy demand. LLC, a regional transmission organization operating in the Eastern Interconnection electricity grid, plans to test blockchain technology for trading Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). Blockchain technology in the energy sector could disrupt net metering and create a transactional grid for distributed energy resources like rooftop solar. Prototype projects use blockchain for peer-to-peer renewable energy transactions at the local level, including managing virtual power plant operations and enabling non-owners to pay for energy generation in exchange for utility bill reductions. Blockchain technology has the potential to change the way electricity customers and producers interact by unbundling energy services in a distributed energy system. This could lead to more transparency, competition among generators, and flexibility for consumers. However, concerns over distribution control and data storage may arise. The use of blockchain technology in the electricity sector may raise cybersecurity concerns and legal challenges, particularly in the sale of electricity through decentralized platforms. Jurisdiction over such sales depends on whether they are considered retail transactions or sales for resale, as defined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The use of blockchain technology in the electricity sector is being explored by utilities and agencies for resale to consumers. FERC regulates transmission and wholesale sales, while states oversee retail transactions. A survey found that US utilities are in early stages of blockchain adoption, with concerns about industry standards. Federal government actions could improve the situation. The federal government could adopt options to improve energy efficiency in mining operations and curb the energy intensity of blockchain technology. This could include setting minimum energy conservation standards for mining equipment and cooling systems. The Department of Energy administers national energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Department of Energy administers national energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. In 2012, DOE issued a request for information regarding residential and commercial electrical equipment, and in 2014 issued a proposed determination of coverage for computers and battery backup systems. Some suggest voluntary approaches for computer technology, while others emphasize the need for ambitious energy efficiency standards through public-private collaboration. Congress may consider establishing minimum national energy efficiency standards for cryptocurrency mining, focusing on ASIC technology or computer and battery backup systems. DOE published energy conservation standards and test procedures for computer room air conditioners (CRACs) on May 16, 2012. A CRAC is defined as a basic model of commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment used in computer rooms or data processing rooms. DOE established 30 equipment classes for CRAC and set minimum requirements for each class with compliance dates of October 29, 2012, or October 29, 2013. The DOE established compliance dates for 30 equipment classes of computer room air conditioners (CRACs) on May 16, 2012. Compliance dates varied depending on the equipment class, with initial dates set for October 29, 2012, or October 29, 2013. The DOE is required to review test procedures for covered products every seven years and energy efficiency standards every six years. Additionally, the DOE and EPA jointly administer the ENERGY STAR labeling program for energy-efficient products, including standards for various electrical equipment and specifications for servers and network equipment. Congress may consider the need for ENERGY STAR specifications for cryptocurrency mining technology or adopting energy efficiency standards for data centers used by mining companies. Limited information on cryptocurrency mining power usage suggests similarities with data centers in terms of power and cooling needs. Establishing energy efficiency standards for data centers or large computing facilities could improve the energy efficiency of Bitcoin mining. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that data centers consume 2% of total U.S. electricity, with 70 billion kWh used in 2014 and projected to reach 73 billion kWh in 2020. The growth in cloud computing has led to some companies committing to power data centers with renewable energy. The federal government has taken steps to improve its own data center efficiency through initiatives like the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (DCCI) and the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA). The Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (DCCI) was enacted in 2014 to track and manage federal IT investments, reduce wasteful spending, and improve project outcomes. It was replaced by the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) in 2016, which maintains requirements for agencies to consolidate infrastructure, optimize facilities, improve security, achieve cost savings, and transition to more efficient infrastructure. The DCOI also sets energy efficiency goals for data centers, including power usage effectiveness (PUE) targets. The DCOI references Executive Order 13693 for PUE metrics, which has been replaced by E.O. 13834. The new order does not discuss data centers but encourages energy-efficient practices. The DCOI authorization was extended until October 1, 2020. Congress may consider extending federal data center PUE requirements to non-government data centers. For Bitcoin mining facilities, little is known about their operations, including power usage effectiveness. Rules for retail electricity sales are governed by state public utility commissions. Federal law defines an electric utility as any entity selling electric energy, potentially including blockchain energy traders. Congress may need to clarify FERC's role in regulating blockchain technology in the energy sector. Blockchain technology in the energy sector is being regulated, with potential implications for peer-to-peer electricity trading. FERC oversight may still apply to these transactions, raising concerns about grid vulnerabilities and infrastructure capabilities. Issues such as data privacy, technology interoperability, and market structure also need to be addressed. FERC has not provided guidance on blockchain technologies, leading utilities and industry groups to continue with business as usual. The lack of guidance from FERC on blockchain technologies has led industry groups to continue with business as usual. The energy consumption of the Bitcoin network has raised concerns about the sustainability of the proof-of-work algorithm. Alternative algorithms like proof-of-stake and proof-of-authority are discussed as less energy-intensive options. Under proof-of-work, miners solve computational problems to generate authenticators, making the process computationally intensive. Mining in blockchain involves solving computationally intensive problems to find valid nonces and hashes. Miners who successfully solve the problem can post the next block and potentially receive a reward, such as Bitcoin. Once a valid hash is identified, it is announced to the community for validation. Proof-of-stake is an alternative algorithm that depends on the community's stake in the network. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) relies on the community's stake in the currency instead of energy-intensive computations. Forgers validate transactions based on their currency holdings, earning fees for building new blocks. The level of stake determines who can forge a block, incentivizing forgers to validate only valid transactions to avoid losing their stake. This method reduces energy consumption and is causing changes in major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum plans to transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system, known as Serenity, utilizing the Casper algorithm to overcome drawbacks of centralization. The timeline for this upgrade has not been revealed yet. Another method of validating transactions is Proof-of-Authority (PoA), which lacks a formal definition in the blockchain terminology. Proof-of-Authority (PoA) in blockchain varies depending on the platform's purpose. Validators earn reputation by processing transactions, ensuring network equality. In supply chain, PoA enhances scalability and security compared to PoS and PoW. Limitations exist for PoS, PoA, and PoW, with PoA offering energy efficiency but potential control issues. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency is at risk with PoS and PoA being more individualistic compared to PoW, which requires community decision-making. Ethereum's upgrade aims for a more decentralized system, freezing the PoS specification in June 2019 with a formal launch set for January 2020. PoW is vulnerable to attacks, as a malicious actor could rewrite blocks with overwhelming computational resources. A \"51% attack\" on a blockchain involves a malicious actor rewriting the chain with different transactions to control the distribution of resources. This requires significant resources and must be done covertly to avoid detection, highlighting the vulnerability of PoW algorithms."
