    "content": "The Act titled \"Space Exploration Sustainability Act\" includes findings related to space exploration. The Space Exploration Sustainability Act includes findings that a robust space program enhances national security, inspires students in STEM fields, develops advanced technologies, increases technological competitiveness, and promotes global cooperation for scientific advancement and protection from space threats. The Nation's space program should balance national security and civil space, robotic and human exploration, scientific knowledge and public engagement, U.S. Government-led launch capability development, partnerships with commercial and international entities, advancement of the space frontier and commerce within Earth Orbit, and further understanding of the universe and Earth observation. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 emphasizes a balanced national space program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 aims to sustainably expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit, involving international partners and increasing economic activity in space. Additionally, there is a report on cis-lunar space. The Administrator of NASA must submit a strategy to Congress within 120 days to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit through cis-lunar space utilization. The strategy should discuss the benefits of a permanent human presence in cis-lunar space for missions to various destinations and its impact on economic, scientific, and technological advancements. The strategy to expand human presence in cis-lunar space includes international partner collaboration, commercial industry participation, and contributions to missions uniquely enabled by mission architectures utilizing a persistent human presence in cis-lunar space. The strategy for expanding human presence in cis-lunar space includes commercial ventures, opportunities for the International Space Station National Laboratory, and exploration mission architectures. The strategy for expanding human presence in cis-lunar space includes comparing architectures with and without a persistent human presence, focusing on long-term goals and transportation capabilities. Factors considered in the comparison include cost and safety. The strategy for expanding human presence in cis-lunar space includes cost, safety, sustainability, international collaboration, new markets, scientific opportunities, and flexibility. The implementation plan outlines Program Formulation events, Critical Design Reviews, System Integration Reviews, milestones for Systems Assembly, Integration and Test, and schedules for test launches and initial missions. SEC. 5. ASSURANCE OF CORE CAPABILITIES. Section 203 of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to ensure the utilization of ISS, technology development, and transportation systems are balanced and interrelated for the viability of the U.S. space program. The sustainable development of capabilities should not involve reducing resources from one area to support another. SEC. 6. Extension of space launch liability provisions to December 31, 2014. SEC. 7. Amendment to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act regarding extraordinary payments for the International Space Station."
