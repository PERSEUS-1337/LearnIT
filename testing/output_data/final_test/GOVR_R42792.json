    "content": "Foster care is a temporary living arrangement for children who cannot safely remain in their own homes. The primary goal is to reunite children with their parents or find a new permanent home through adoption or legal guardianship. The responsibility for child welfare is primarily a state duty, but Congress provides funding to support foster care and other services. The Title IV-E program provides federal funding to states for foster care and child welfare services. States must meet federal requirements to receive reimbursement for providing foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship. In FY2011, states spent $12.4 billion under the program and received $6.7 billion in federal reimbursement. The program is administered by the Children's Bureau at the federal level. The Title IV-E program is administered by the Children's Bureau at the federal level and by state child welfare agencies at the state level. Roughly two-thirds of the funding supports foster care, with most children receiving adoption assistance previously in foster care. The majority of children who receive Title IV-E adoption assistance were previously in foster care, as were all children who receive Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance. The report discusses why children come to the attention of the child welfare agency, outlines state requirements for federal Title IV-E funds, and focuses on program eligibility criteria and spending for foster care maintenance payments, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Child protection agencies conduct 2 million family investigations annually involving 3 million children to determine abuse or neglect. Neglect is the most common concern, followed by physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. Investigative caseworkers often find children can safely remain at home, regardless of abuse/neglect findings. A national survey of children investigated for abuse/neglect found that 87.1% were living at home, 6.1% in kinship arrangements, and 6.3% in out-of-home placements. Investigative caseworkers identify factors like high stress, low social support, and substance abuse as leading to child abuse/neglect investigations. Risk factors for child abuse/neglect include substance abuse, domestic violence, mental health issues, and caregiver arrest. These factors are more common in families where children are removed from the home after an investigation. There was no significant difference in the presence of domestic violence in families where children were removed versus those where they remained. The Title IV-E program funds foster care maintenance payments to provide financial assistance for children in foster care. The goal is to reunite children with their parents, but agencies face challenges in achieving this. Title IV-E funds are used for case planning and assessing needed services for reunification. Eligibility is required for Title IV-E funding. Title IV-E funding is only for children who meet eligibility criteria. It cannot be used for reunification services or post-reunification support. States can use Title IV-B funding and other federal streams like TANF and SSBG for child welfare programs. Title IV-E funds adoption and kinship guardianship assistance for children in child welfare programs, providing financial support for eligible children after they leave foster care. However, these funds cannot be used for post-adoption or post-guardianship support services. Other federal funding sources like Title IV-B, TANF, and SSBG can be utilized for these purposes. Title IV-E funds adoption and kinship guardianship assistance for children in child welfare programs. TANF and SSBG can also be used for these purposes. Some youth leave foster care due to aging out at 18, rather than returning to their families. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides unique support for these youth. The Title IV-E program allows all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and one tribe to seek federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children. Only one tribe had completed the process for tribal Title IV-E program approval as of early September 2012, but more tribes are working towards this goal. The Title IV-E program allows states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and tribes to seek federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children. HHS anticipates more tribal plans will be approved in the upcoming year. Tribal entities must meet the same program requirements as states to receive direct Title IV-E funding. The program was created in 1980 under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, moving federal funding for foster care from Title IV-A to Title IV-E. Notable amendments include the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. The Title IV-E program, established in 1980, includes foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. Key amendments include the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 and the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, which focused on children's safety, achieving permanency, and well-being in foster care. The Title IV-E program requires states to have a federally approved plan to receive funding for foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. States must also perform administrative tasks to ensure compliance with program requirements. The Title IV-E program requires states to have a federally approved plan to receive funding for foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance. The administrative tasks under the program focus on ensuring the safety, permanence, and well-being of children in foster care. The Title IV-E plan applies to all three program components and states must meet all plan requirements to receive funding. Title IV-E plan requirements define eligible costs for the program, including direct financial assistance to eligible children and program administration. Administrative costs can include activities like developing case plans, visiting children in care, and participating in court proceedings. Title IV-E administrative activities involve court proceedings for a child's removal from home, finding foster or adoptive homes, conducting background checks, and developing program policies. States must report separate spending on program training and Statewide Automated Child Welfare operations. The Title IV-E program covers costs for the development and operation of a Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS). Eligibility for Title IV-E assistance is based on criteria such as a child's age, citizenship, and background check of foster or adoptive parents. The federal government reimburses states for a portion of program costs based on the type of program. The federal government reimburses states for various program costs, including foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance payments, based on the state's unique \"FMAP\" percentage. The FMAP is calculated annually by HHS for each state, ensuring that states with higher per capita income receive lower federal reimbursement rates. For example, if a state has an FMAP of 50%, the federal government reimburses the state 50 cents for every dollar in foster care maintenance payments made on behalf of an eligible child. The federal government reimburses states for various program costs, including foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance payments. States receive federal reimbursement rates for Title IV-E program costs, with administrative costs reimbursed at 50%, SACWIS costs at 50%, and training costs at 75%. Congress temporarily increased the federal share of Title IV-E payments from 2008 to 2011 to provide state fiscal relief during the Great Recession. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act temporarily increased each state's FMAP by 6.2 percentage points from 2008 to 2010. An amendment extended the enhanced FMAP support for six more months, with a phased down level of increase. By August 2012, $968 million had been obligated to states under the Title IV-E program due to the enhanced FMAP. The bulk of Title IV-E funding provided to states is expected to come from the temporary enhanced funding available from October 1, 2008, through June 30, 2011. Federal reimbursement for Title IV-E program costs is authorized on a permanent and open-ended entitlement basis, with no limit on the amount of annual federal funding that must be appropriated. Congress typically appropriates the funding estimated by HHS to reimburse states for eligible Title IV-E program costs. The IV-E program cost estimate submitted by states is based on anticipated spending and federal reimbursement. If the estimate exceeds actual funds needed, the excess lapses back to the federal treasury. Additional funds are provided if the estimate falls short, with no dollar limit on funding to states under Title IV-E. The actual funding a state receives is limited by its program spending. The federal government only partially reimburses states for their spending under the Title IV-E program, which is limited by eligibility criteria and program definitions. Funding is specifically allocated for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children. States cannot include costs for ineligible children in their total Title IV-E expenses. Additionally, funds can be used for program administration. Title IV-E funds are allocated for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children. Funds cannot be used for social services for children or families, child abuse prevention, investigatory activities, or medical and education expenses. Most funds are used for foster care for children meeting federal eligibility criteria. The number of children in foster care has decreased to around 250,000 annually. Foster care is a temporary living arrangement to ensure a child's safety while the state works on finding a permanent home through adoption, legal guardianship, or placement with a relative. The number of children in foster care has decreased from a peak of 567,000 in FY1999 to fewer than 401,000 by FY2011. The decline is due to more children leaving foster care for adoption or guardianship and fewer children entering care. Less than half of children in foster care receive federally supported foster care maintenance payments, with eligibility varying by state. Children not meeting federal criteria must be supported using state or other federal funds. States must use state, local, or other federal dollars to support children who do not meet Title IV-E eligibility criteria. Federal Title IV-E foster care eligibility criteria include judicial approval for removal from parents' homes, ensuring children's safety, and establishing a permanent home through reunification, adoption, or legal guardianship. States can now extend Title IV-E assistance to youth beyond age 18 if reunification or placement in a permanent family is not achieved. Title IV-E foster care assistance can be extended to youth beyond age 18 if reunification or placement in a permanent family is not achieved. This change was made in response to research suggesting better outcomes for youth who remain in foster care after age 18. Eligibility criteria for Title IV-E assistance reflect the legislative history of federal foster care assistance, with assistance only available for children from very low-income, primarily single-parent households. Congress amended the Title IV-E program in 2008 to allow states to provide assistance to eligible youth beyond their 18th birthday, with 16 states approved for this extension as of October 2012. Most states with approval to extend Title IV-E foster care assistance to youth up to age 21 require the youth to be in school, working, engaged in activities to promote employment, or have a documented medical condition. States have the flexibility to choose which criteria make a youth eligible for assistance. Federal funding for foster care, established in 1961, is limited to children from low-income households. Eligibility criteria are linked to income standards from the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, despite the creation of the Title IV-E program in 1980. The AFDC program was repealed in 1996 and replaced with the TANF block grant. In FY2011, states claimed $8.327 billion in Title IV-E foster care expenses, receiving federal reimbursement of $4.340 billion. Maintenance payments accounted for 29% of spending, while general foster care administrative purposes made up 46%. Around 3% of spending supported Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information Systems and training. Overall, in FY2011, states spent $8.327 billion on Title IV-E foster care expenses, with maintenance payments accounting for 29% of spending. Spending on foster care maintenance payments has been declining since FY1999, with a 45% decrease in the number of children receiving payments by FY2011. The number of children in foster care also decreased by more than 29% during the same time period. Total Title IV-E spending for general foster care administrative costs exceeded total Title IV-E spending on foster care maintenance payments as early as FY2000. Foster care administrative spending continued to climb for several years, even as the foster care caseload declined, but since the middle of the last decade it too has trended down. Title IV-E foster claims related to the development and operation of a SACWIS were at their highest level in the late 1990s, soon after Congress authorized this federal support and during the period that enhanced federal support was available for this purpose. Spending for Title IV-E foster care training purposes has not increased, despite broadened authority (enacted in 2008) for states to claim federal Title IV-E support for this purpose. Finally, Title IV-E foster care spending under child welfare demonstration projects, which states were first. Title IV-E foster care spending under child welfare demonstration projects increased significantly in FY2007 and FY2008 due to large projects. In FY2011, most spending in this category was related to projects in Florida and California. Waiver projects must be cost neutral to the federal government, but allow for a broader range of activities and services. Title IV-E spending must be authorized under the state's approved waiver project. Federal support covers 50%\u201383% of foster care maintenance payments based on a state's FMAP. The federal reimbursement formula ensures states with higher incomes receive lower reimbursement. The federal reimbursement formula for Title IV-E spending ensures that states with higher per capita incomes receive lower reimbursement rates, while states with lower per capita incomes receive higher rates. States are required to provide foster care maintenance payments for eligible children, with rates varying based on the child's age, placement setting, and special needs. There is no federal minimum or maximum payment rate, allowing states to set and review rates periodically. In 2008-2009, the average monthly payment for children in non-relative foster family homes was $679. In non-relative foster family homes, payment rates vary based on the child's age, placement setting, and special needs. States provide support for items like clothing and school supplies. Foster caregivers may supplement payments with their own funds. Most caregivers have income above the poverty level. Relative caregivers of children removed from their homes have varying income levels, with non-relative caregivers more likely to have income above the poverty level compared to formal and informal kin caregivers. The federal government typically covers 54-55% of Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, but this share increased to nearly 63% in FY2010 due to enhanced federal support provided by the ARRA. States had obligated an additional $463 million in federal funds as of August 30, 2012. States had obligated $463 million in additional federal support for foster care maintenance payments under the ARRA provision, with most of the funds allocated in FY2009 and FY2010. Children in foster care who are not Title IV-E eligible may not receive Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments, and additional state and local funds are used to cover their costs. States can also use other federal funding streams, such as TANF, to provide assistance to children in foster care who are not eligible for Title IV-E support. TANF assistance can be provided to a child in foster care living with a relative, regardless of the relative's income. States may use TANF for foster care maintenance payments for children in foster care, even if they are not living with a relative. The extent to which TANF funds are used for monthly assistance versus other child welfare services is unclear. Other federal funding streams like SSI and Social Security may also be used for room and board payments. The federal foster care system provides payments such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security benefits for children in foster care. States may also use Medicaid to supplement payments for children with special medical needs. However, the use of Medicaid for child welfare purposes has decreased. States have limited ability to use Title IV-B funds for foster care maintenance payments, and are largely prohibited from using Social Services Block Grant funds for this purpose. The federal foster care coverage rate has increased from 35% in the 1980s to over 54% in the 1990s. The federal foster care coverage rate has grown from 35% in the 1980s to over 54% in the 1990s, but has since declined to around 40% in FY2011. Survey data suggests a higher rate, with estimates ranging from 55% to 68% in different state fiscal years. The discrepancy between administrative and survey data is not easily explained. The federal foster care coverage rate has declined over the past decade, with wide variation by state. The static income test for Title IV-E eligibility is a key factor in determining the share of children receiving support. Both administrative and survey data show this trend, with concerns about data quality and comparability. The eligibility for Title IV-E foster care support is determined by the income criteria of the AFDC program in each state. The median state need standard is $7,740, which was 60% of the federal poverty guideline for a family of three in 1996 but only 41% in 2012. In 37 states, eligibility for federal Title IV-E foster care assistance is limited. The eligibility for federal Title IV-E foster care assistance in 37 states is limited to children from homes with monthly income below 50% of the 2012 federal poverty guideline. The income test, not adjusted for inflation, contributes to the decline in coverage. However, other criteria such as court findings, placement in licensed settings, and citizenship status also affect eligibility. The relationship between a state's AFDC income test and coverage rate is not always straightforward due to multiple eligibility criteria. The relationship between a state's AFDC income test and Title IV-E coverage rate is not always straightforward. Research on reasons for children being ineligible for Title IV-E foster care is limited, but parent's income is a common factor. In 26 states, reasons for children being ineligible for Title IV-E foster care varied widely, with factors such as lack of required judicial determinations, unlicensed facilities, and ineligible placement settings cited. On average, these factors accounted for 10%\u201320% of ineligible cases. Additionally, 17 states reported various \"other\" reasons for ineligibility. In 17 states, various reasons led to ineligible cases for Title IV-E foster care, including factors like child deprivation of parental care, removal from specified relative's home, and exceeding specified resource limits. Other reasons included child's age/school attendance, missing legal requirements, and citizenship issues. Changes in state policy or practice may address declines in federal foster care coverage rates driven by eligibility criteria other than income. The use of relative placements for children in foster care may increase Title IV-E foster care ineligibility in some states due to the recent practice of licensing relatives. States can address this issue by actively seeking to license relatives and waiving non-safety licensing standards. Additionally, states may review procedures to ensure timely judicial determinations for children to be eligible for Title IV-E foster care. The share of children eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments is crucial for federal funding, as it determines the amount of administrative costs that states can assign to the program. Federal support covers 50% of costs for child placement services and program administration under Title IV-E. Cooperation between courts and child welfare agencies is essential for timely determinations of eligibility. Most foster care administrative spending is tied to caseworker time for child protection activities. States can only claim federal support for administrative costs for eligible children under Title IV-E. Administrative spending also supports background checks, eligibility determination, rate setting, licensing, and policy development. In FY2011, over half of state and federal Title IV-E foster care administrative spending ($2.0 billion) was allocated to child-specific case planning and management activities, supporting caseworkers in meeting case review system requirements for assessing child and family needs, developing case plans, participating in court reviews, and assisting youth aging out of foster care. A state child welfare agency can receive federal reimbursement for child-specific activities for eligible children in foster care. This includes support for children living in unlicensed relative homes or temporary ineligible foster care settings. A state child welfare agency can receive federal reimbursement for child-specific activities for eligible children in foster care, including those temporarily living in ineligible settings like locked juvenile detention facilities for up to one month. A significant portion of Title IV-E foster care administrative funds are spent on \"pre-placement\" activities, which are provided on behalf of children at imminent risk of removal from their homes. These activities include making referrals for services, preparing for court proceedings, and finding a suitable home for the child. The child is at \"imminent risk of removal\" from the home, considered a candidate for foster care for up to 6 months. The cost for determining Title IV-E foster care eligibility was $184 million in FY2011. States can seek federal support for all costs related to eligibility determinations, including administrative expenses for operating a Title IV-E foster care program. The Title IV-E foster care program incurs various administrative costs such as licensing requirements, rate setting, background checks, and program policies. These costs can be supported with Title IV-E dollars, with some requiring separate cost allocation processes. There was an apparent increase in administrative costs shown as \"other\" in FY2011, possibly due to changes in reporting data. The new form for Title IV-E foster care program no longer includes an \"other\" administrative costs category. Instead, two new categories were added: \"provider management\" for activities related to foster care children and \"agency management\" for program administration. States reported provider management costs of $298 million in FY2011, accounting for 8% of all Title IV-E foster care administrative costs. In FY2011, states reported provider management costs of $298 million (8% of all Title IV-E foster care administrative costs) and agency management costs of $708 million (18% of all Title IV-E administrative costs). The new reporting form and renaming of spending categories likely impacted how states reported their Title IV-E foster care administrative spending, caution should be taken when comparing data across different years. Despite a decline in caseload, spending on administrative purposes exceeded maintenance payments in FY2000, with administrative spending continuing to rise in the following years. In FY2006, Title IV-E foster care administrative costs comprised 55% of all Title IV-E foster care spending, compared to 35% for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments. The share of Title IV-E foster care spending for administrative purposes has declined since then, but in FY2011, foster care administrative costs under Title IV-E still represented a larger share of program costs (46%) than maintenance payments (29%). Policymakers have been concerned about the growth of Title IV-E foster care administrative claims since the late 1990s. Title IV-E state plan requirements and increased compliance have helped maintain or expand spending on foster care administrative purposes despite a decline in the number of children in foster care. These requirements aim to improve outcomes for children and families, including timely permanency hearings, termination of parental rights when necessary, and thorough background checks for foster and adoptive parents. The 2001 implementation of federal \"conformity reviews\" has added to Title IV-E administrative costs, aiming to determine state compliance with the Title IV-E state plan. These reviews have driven increased costs for case planning, review, pre-placement, and other child welfare system aspects. The implementation of federal \"conformity reviews\" in 2001 has led to increased Title IV-E administrative costs for case planning, review, pre-placement, and provider management. All children in foster care must receive case planning and review services, with states able to supplement funding with other federal programs like Title IV-B, SSBG, and TANF. Some states have utilized Medicaid for case planning activities for non-Title IV-E eligible children. Recent survey data show a decline in state child welfare agency spending of Medicaid funds, particularly for non-Title IV-E eligible children in foster care. Title IV-E training support is available for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship, with a decrease in total program dollars spent for training since FY2000. The federal share of training costs is generally 75%, with most spending related to foster care. All types of Title IV-E training are discussed in the report. Federal reimbursement for training related to Title IV-E eligible children is limited to costs incurred by states for training individuals providing care or services. Training topics must directly relate to Title IV-E activities and can cover administrative tasks or social work practices. Training may also address broader issues like caregiver mental health or substance abuse. Title IV-E funds can be used for training related to caregiver mental health or substance abuse, but not for providing mental health services or conducting child abuse investigations. Long-term training for individuals employed by public child welfare agencies is also supported. The federal reimbursement rate for Title IV-E training claims is now 75% as of FY2013, ending a four-year phase-in period. States can make claims for short-term training for workers at licensed child welfare agencies, prospective relative guardians, and individuals handling child abuse cases in court, as authorized by the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. The federal reimbursement rate for Title IV-E training claims increased to 75% as of FY2013. Most claims continue to be submitted under pre-existing provisions, with a decline in spending over the last decade due to fewer children eligible for assistance. The broadened authority for training support was not fully implemented as of FY2011. The federal Title IV-E training support was not fully implemented as of FY2011, with limited spending by states on training. States have more discretion over training dollars compared to other aspects of Title IV-E. The plan requires states to adequately prepare foster parents with knowledge and skills but is mostly silent on training. Unlike the immediate need for caseworkers, the need to train staff may seem less urgent. Since the enactment of P.L. 110-351, there has been no increase in overall Title IV-E training claims. States can claim federal reimbursement for SACWIS costs related to foster care, adoption assistance, or kinship guardianship. States are not required to have a SACWIS, but choosing to do so allows for federal reimbursement. States can seek federal reimbursement under Title IV-E for costs related to SACWIS, which must comply with HHS regulations and interface with other data collection systems. As of September 2012, 36 states have an operational SACWIS, three are developing one, and 13 states have a non-SACWIS model information system. States can seek federal reimbursement under Title IV-E for costs related to SACWIS, which must comply with HHS regulations. Congress initially approved an enhanced reimbursement rate for SACWIS development costs, but starting from FY1998, federal reimbursement is available at 50%. States operating or developing an approved SACWIS can claim federal reimbursement for system costs without regard to the children served meeting Title IV-E assistance criteria. SACWIS must allow access to case level information across federal programs. States can claim certain system development costs across multiple programs, with most SACWIS costs needing to be allocated to the program they benefit. Since Title IV-E funding was established, states have invested $4.7 billion in SACWIS operation and development costs, with the federal government reimbursing over half of those costs. Table 5 displays Title IV-E SACWIS claims from FY1994\u2013FY2011. Congress provided federal support for assistance to children who cannot be returned home, with specific conditions making adoption without assistance reasonable. The Title IV-E program provides assistance for children with \"special needs\" who are older or part of a sibling group to be adopted together. Efforts are made to place these children without assistance unless it goes against their best interest. The primary objective of the 1980 Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act was to increase the number of children placed in permanent homes, which includes providing adoption assistance. The Title IV-E program requires states to establish Adoption Assistance components, with the number of children receiving assistance increasing over the years. The Adoption and Safe Families Act aimed to expedite permanency planning for children in foster care and promote adoption, including providing Adoption Incentives. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) aimed to expedite permanency planning for children in foster care and promote adoption. It authorized Adoption Incentives to increase adoptions, leading to a significant growth in adoptions with public child welfare agency involvement. The number of adoptions increased from roughly 31,000 in FY1997 to more than 51,000 by FY2000 and has remained at or above 50,000 in most fiscal years through FY2011. Adoptions out of foster care also became quicker, with the average time a child spent in care decreasing from 46 months in FY2000 to 34 months in FY2011. The number of children adopted from foster care increased significantly, leading to growth in Title IV-E adoption assistance recipients. The caseload peaked at 423,200 in FY2010 but declined to 413,800 in FY2011, possibly due to children aging out of the system. Adoption assistance typically ends at age 18. The decline in the number of children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance may be due to children aging out of the system at age 18. Federal eligibility criteria linked to the income test and prior law AFDC program are also factors. Data quality concerns and changes in reporting forms may have contributed to the reported decline in caseload. The reporting form for collecting data on children receiving Title IV-E adoption assistance changed in FY2011. States must meet requirements for reimbursement, including having an approved Title IV-E plan and an adoption assistance agreement with adoptive parents of children with special needs. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act (P.L. 110-351) introduced new federal adoption assistance eligibility rules that no longer link the program to income or resource tests. This allows for federal reimbursement for Title IV-E adoption assistance costs for eligible adoptive parents of special needs children. Federal reimbursement for Title IV-E adoption assistance costs are available for eligible children, reimbursed at the state's FMAP ranging from 50% to 83%. Program administration costs, including non-recurring adoption expenses and training costs, are reimbursed at 50% and 75% respectively. States with an approved Title IV-E plan can submit adoption assistance claims to HHS quarterly for eligible costs incurred. States can submit claims to HHS quarterly for eligible Title IV-E adoption assistance costs, with reimbursement ranging from 50% to 83% of expenses. In FY2011, states received $2.315 billion in federal reimbursement out of $4.009 billion in total claims, representing 57.8%. Administrative spending for Title IV-E adoption assistance is reimbursed at 50%, while ongoing assistance payments are reimbursed at a higher rate, making up a large portion (80%) of program costs. The federal share of Title IV-E adoption assistance funding is typically between 54.0% and 54.5% of the total spending for the program, reaching 60% in FY2009 and FY2010. Administrative spending is lower compared to the foster care program due to limited purposes for federal reimbursement. Most policies and procedures under Title IV-E apply only to children in foster care, not those in adoptive homes. The federal share of Title IV-E adoption assistance funding increased to close to 58% in FY2011 due to temporary enhanced federal support provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. States had obligated over $502 million in federal Title IV-E adoption assistance spending by August 30, 2012, with the majority spent in FY2009 and FY2010. Combined state and federal spending on Title IV-E adoption assistance rose rapidly between FY1997 and FY2002, continued to increase at a slower pace through FY2010, and experienced its first decline in FY2011. This decline coincided with a decrease in the adoption assistance caseload reported by states. The federal share of Title IV-E adoption assistance funding increased to close to 58% in FY2011 due to temporary enhanced federal support. States had obligated over $502 million in federal Title IV-E adoption assistance spending by August 30, 2012. The spending on Title IV-E adoption assistance experienced its first decline in FY2011, coinciding with a decrease in the adoption assistance caseload reported by states. The mid-session review of the FY2013 budget assumed continued annual growth in the adoption assistance caseload, estimating federal outlays for Title IV-E adoption assistance. Eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance requires a child to be determined as a child with \"special needs\" and meet one of four separate federal eligibility pathways. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) removes income or resource-related tests from three of the four federal eligibility pathways for Title IV-E adoption assistance. Eligibility for the assistance requires the child to meet age criteria, be a U.S. citizen or have a certain immigration status, and meet other criteria. An \"applicable child\" must meet specific age and foster care requirements to qualify for the revised eligibility pathway. The Title IV-E adoption assistance pathways have specific criteria for special needs children, including being removed from their home via a voluntary placement agreement or judicial determination. Another pathway involves meeting the requirements of the Supplemental Security Income program. Special needs children may be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance payments based on specific criteria, including medical and disability requirements. They can also qualify if living with a minor parent receiving foster care maintenance payments. Additionally, children previously receiving adoption assistance whose adoptions dissolve may still be eligible. Children whose adoptions dissolve or adoptive parents die may be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance payments. This pathway is also available for special needs children previously eligible for such assistance. States must reinvest savings from federal support into child welfare services. The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act requires states to provide assurance that they will reinvest savings from federal support into post adoption services. States must document how these funds are spent, with a deadline for submission to HHS. Eligibility changes in the Fostering Connections Act are expected to expand adoption assistance eligibility, but some adoptive children may not qualify due to additional federal criteria. Some adoptive children may not be eligible for ongoing Title IV-E adoption assistance payments due to additional federal eligibility criteria, including completion of an adoption assistance agreement, background checks of prospective adoptive parents, and age/citizenship requirements for the child. Children must meet specific criteria to be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance, including being determined to have \"special needs\" by the state and meeting eligibility pathways. Other requirements include age, citizenship status, placement with a qualified adoptive parent, and a finding that the child cannot be returned to their parents. States establish specific conditions or factors that make it unlikely for a child to be adopted without assistance. Once a child is deemed to have special needs and an adoption assistance agreement is in place, it must be honored. Special needs criteria vary by state and typically include factors like age and race. Some states have specific criteria for establishing special needs for adoption, including sibling group size and characteristics. Approximately 40 states allow special needs for any size sibling group, while others have additional requirements for groups of two or three children. Some states have specific criteria for establishing special needs for adoption, including sibling group size and characteristics. Among all states, some require siblings to be placed in the same adoptive home at the same time, while others allow for special needs for siblings placed in the same home but at different times. States may also require additional special needs factors for siblings placed at different times, such as age or existing adoption assistance. Age is commonly used as a special needs condition, with a minimum age requirement ranging from one to 12 years in different states. Some states establish special needs for adoption based on criteria like age, minority group membership, and medical conditions. Age requirements for special needs range from two to three years for certain minority groups, with separate criteria for Caucasian children. Minority group membership is a factor in determining special needs status in almost half of all states. Some states determine special needs for adoption based on a combination of medical conditions and physical, emotional, or behavioral factors. These conditions must be documented by a qualified professional and may need ongoing rehabilitation or treatment. Roughly two-thirds of states also consider \"high risk\" factors, indicating a likelihood of developing medical conditions or disabilities based on prior experiences or characteristics. Some states establish \"special needs\" for adoption based on various factors such as genetic predisposition to mental illness, prenatal exposure to toxins, or history of abuse or neglect. Adoption assistance payments may be contingent on the child showing symptoms of the condition. Additional special needs factors include the length of time the child has been available for adoption, disrupted adoptions, multiple placements, language barriers, emotional ties with foster parents, or documented history of abuse or neglect. The majority of children adopted with public agency involvement are determined to have special needs, with factors such as membership in a sibling group or diagnosed medical conditions being primary reasons. Age is becoming less important in determining special needs status, while membership in a sibling group and other reasons are increasing in significance. Racial/ethnic background is the least commonly used factor for determining special needs. States are required to enter into an adoption assistance agreement with adoptive parents of children with special needs, specifying payments, services, and Medicaid eligibility. Adoption assistance remains in effect regardless of the adoptive parents' state of residence. Adoption assistance agreements are binding for children with special needs requiring medical, mental health, or rehabilitative care. The agreement can only be terminated if the child reaches the age limit, parents are no longer legally responsible, or parents stop providing support. The 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents found that over 90% of children adopted from foster care had adoption assistance agreements with the public child welfare agency, including subsidies and Medicaid. Among those aged 5 or older, 19% used guaranteed mental health care, while 27% used mental health care not included in the agreement. Additionally, 36% used tutoring services. States may provide federally subsidized monthly adoption assistance payments on behalf of eligible children as soon as an agreement is signed and the child has been placed in an adoptive home. The amount of the adoption assistance payment is determined through negotiation with the adoptive parents based on the individual needs of the child and circumstances of the adoptive parents. Payments may be adjusted. The amount of adoption assistance payment is determined through negotiation with adoptive parents based on the child's needs and circumstances. Payments may be adjusted periodically with parental agreement, but cannot exceed what the child would receive in foster care. There are no specific allowable costs for adoption assistance, and parents are free to use the money as they see fit. Payment rates vary by state, with specialized rates for children with extraordinary needs. The 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents found that among children adopted out of foster care, a significant percentage received monthly subsidies ranging from $301 to $750. Two-thirds of these children's parents felt the payment amount met their needs. Not all families of adopted Title IV-E-eligible children with special needs receive ongoing adoption assistance payments. Having an adoption assistance agreement in place before finalizing the adoption allows for payments to be established later if needed, ensuring Medicaid eligibility for the child. State spending on Title IV-E adoption assistance payments from FY1997 to FY2011 is shown in Table 8, covering children meeting eligibility criteria. Some special needs adoptees not meeting all federal criteria may still receive support. Payments for special needs adoptees not meeting all federal criteria must come from non-Title IV-E sources. Data on the total number of adoptees receiving assistance is lacking, but a survey found that the median Title IV-E adoption assistance coverage rate was 76% in 2010. Two-thirds of states reported coverage rates of 71% or higher. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 amended Title IV-E to require states to provide reimbursement for \"non-recurring adoption expenses\" for children with special needs. Adoptive parents must meet state and local laws, not federal eligibility pathways, to receive this assistance. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows for federal reimbursement of non-recurring adoption expenses for children with special needs. States can choose to cover all or part of these costs, with adoptive parents needing to meet state and local laws for eligibility. HHS regulations allow states to seek federal support for up to $2,000 in non-recurring adoption costs per child. Roughly half of states reimburse costs up to $2,000, while others limit reimbursement to smaller amounts. The federal adoption tax credit provides support for non-recurring adoption expenses for families adopting special needs children with public child welfare agency involvement. In FY2000, states reported $37.7 million in non-recurring adoption expenses, with federal reimbursement covering half. The percentage of children adopted with public agency involvement receiving monthly subsidies remained stable at 88-91%, but the share supported by federal Title IV-E dollars decreased from 75% in FY2000 to 66% in FY2011. The data below shows percentages of total adoptions completed with public child welfare agency involvement, including those receiving or not receiving assistance, for children adopted during a given fiscal year. Adoption assistance payments are typically provided to children meeting special needs criteria, and the federal government aims to support nearly all special needs adoptees as of FY2018, with an expected reversal of the decline in assistance rates. The Title IV-E adoption assistance pathway is the most frequently used. In FY2011, new eligibility rules for Title IV-E adoption assistance removed the income standard linked to the prior AFDC program, benefiting children aged 14 and older. This change aims to increase federal eligibility for adoption assistance. The AFDC income criteria are expected to have been applied to the majority of children for whom Title IV-E adoption assistance was determined in FY2010 and FY2011. The median age of children adopted from foster care has remained constant at just above five years for the past five years. The \"applicable child\" eligibility rules may not apply to a majority of children adopted from foster care until at least FY2015. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 authorizes states to make changes to adoption assistance eligibility. The Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to seek federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance payments for children leaving foster care for legal guardianship with relatives. This federal support aims to reduce the overrepresentation of African American children in foster care. States have the option to provide kinship guardianship assistance to eligible children under the Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. As of September 2012, 31 states had submitted plans to seek federal reimbursement for this assistance, with most not yet claiming reimbursement. States have the option to provide kinship guardianship assistance under the Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. States may seek reimbursement for up to two years from the date of incurring expenses, even without an approved Title IV-E plan amendment. As of FY2011, three states had submitted post-demonstration kinship guardianship assistance claims. States had submitted post-demonstration related kinship guardianship assistance claims. Two states have an approved Title IV-E plan for kinship guardianship assistance (Illinois and Michigan), while one state does not (Iowa). Reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance payments is based on the state's FMAP, ranging from 50% to 83%. Administrative costs may be reimbursed at 50%. Administrative claims for kinship guardianship assistance are more limited compared to foster care, as case planning and review requirements no longer apply once a child is no longer in foster care. States are required to provide funds to relative guardians for non-recurring costs of legal guardianship, with federal reimbursement available. States can also seek reimbursement for training related to Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance. Table 12 displays eligible spending and federal reimbursement for states under this program. (Spending for children previously assisted under a Title IV-E subsidized guardianship demonstration project is also included.) The average monthly number of children assisted with Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance is incomplete for FY2011. HHS estimates federal outlays will rise to $81 million for FY2013 and $174 million by FY2017. The Title IV-E agency must describe steps taken for a child permanently leaving foster care with a relative guardian and receiving kinship guardianship assistance. The child's written case plan includes steps taken to determine permanency options, efforts to discuss adoption with relative foster parent, reasons for kinship guardianship, separation of siblings, efforts to discuss with parents, and eligibility for kinship guardianship assistance payment. To be eligible for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments, there must be a kinship guardianship assistance agreement in place between the state agency and the eligible relative guardian. The child must have been eligible for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments while living with the prospective relative guardian and meet certain age and other criteria. The state must determine if kinship guardianship is an appropriate permanency goal for the child. Eligibility for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments is based on the child's previous status. Eligibility for Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance payments is tied to a child's previous eligibility for Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments. The child must have entered foster care through a voluntary placement agreement or a court order, and the family's income must meet certain criteria. The Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance program requires prospective relative guardians to meet foster care eligibility criteria, including background checks and licensing requirements. States must conduct specific background checks, including fingerprint-based checks, before kinship guardianship assistance payments can be received on behalf of an eligible child. The Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance program requires prospective relative guardians to meet foster care eligibility criteria, including background checks and licensing requirements. States may consider a valid background check for foster parents when seeking kinship guardianship, as long as certain conditions are met. Eligibility for assistance payments includes being the foster parent for at least six months, meeting licensing requirements, and not having certain felony convictions. The legal guardian must be a grandparent or relative of the child. The Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance program allows states to define \"relative\" for eligibility, which can include biological or legal ties, tribal kin, extended family, friends, or fictive kin. To qualify for assistance payments, the state must determine that reunification with parents or adoption is not suitable for the child, and that the child has a strong attachment to the grandparent or relative guardian. The Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance program allows states to define \"relative\" for eligibility, which can include biological or legal ties, tribal kin, extended family, friends, or fictive kin. Qualifications for assistance include permanency options for the child, a strong attachment to the prospective relative guardian, and consultation with the child if they are 14 or older. Assistance can continue after age 18 for those with disabilities or if the state extends assistance up to age 21 for students, employed individuals, those in employment-promoting activities, or those medically unable to work. States can amend their Title IV-E plan to provide foster care maintenance assistance to youth after their 18th birthday. This assistance can also be extended to eligible youth in a kinship guardianship arrangement if they entered after age 16. Siblings of eligible children can also receive kinship guardianship assistance if placed with the same relative guardian and deemed appropriate by both the guardian and the Title IV-E agency. HHS allows states to impose additional conditions on receiving Title IV-E kinship guardianship assistance, beyond federal requirements. These conditions must be approved by HHS as part of the state's Title IV-E plan amendment. Examples of additional conditions include requiring a child to have lived with the relative guardian for more than 6 months, setting a minimum age requirement for eligibility, and mandating the guardian to report any changes in the child's situation to the agency. States seeking reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance payments must have a written agreement with the relative guardian of an eligible child. The agreement specifies the amount and manner of payments, adjustments based on circumstances, and additional services available to the child and relative. The kinship guardianship assistance agreement outlines the payments, services, and assistance available to the child and relative guardian. The state covers non-recurring expenses for legal guardianship, with a maximum of $2,000. The agreement remains valid as long as the child meets eligibility criteria and the relative guardian continues to provide support. Payments are capped at the amount the child would receive in foster care. The kinship guardianship agreement outlines payments, services, and assistance for the child and relative guardian. It does not need to address health care coverage, but children eligible for Title IV-E assistance remain eligible for Medicaid. Tribes can receive federal support for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship under the Title IV-E program. The Port Gamble S'Klallam tribe operates a Title IV-E program independently, with other tribes working towards approval. States and tribes can enter agreements to pass through Title IV-E funds for children in tribal custody. States must negotiate with tribes seeking to operate parts of a Title IV-E program. The federal Title IV-E reimbursement rate for children under tribal authority is equal to the tribal FMAP. This Appendix outlines the statutory provisions for tribal receipt of direct federal funding under the Title IV-E program. HHS applies Title IV-E program requirements to tribes with an approved plan, similar to states. Tribes seeking direct funding must meet most Title IV-E provisions, with modifications to the plan requirement. The law modifies Title IV-E plan requirements for tribes, allowing them to define service areas and demonstrate no audit exceptions for 3 years. Licensing of foster homes must be done by tribal authority. Tribal children's eligibility for Title IV-E programs is similar to state-operated programs. The law allows tribes to define service areas and demonstrate no audit exceptions for 3 years under a tribal Title IV-E plan. Tribal licensing standards apply for approving tribal foster family homes and child care institutions. Background checks for prospective foster or adoptive parents under a tribal Title IV-E plan must meet all requirements of the Social Security Act. The Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Act allows tribes to receive federal funding under Title IV-E by meeting specific requirements, including having an approved Title IV-E plan and Child and Family Services Plan. Tribes must also develop processes for federal reimbursement, report data to HHS, and follow unique cost allocation methodologies. Foster care maintenance, adoption assistance, and guardianship assistance payments are reimbursed based on a tribe's unique \"FMAP.\" Tribal FMAP rates for assistance payments are based on per capita income and must not be lower than any state's rate, capped at 83%. Training costs are reimbursed at 75%, while child placement and administrative costs are covered at 50% of eligible spending. Tribes can seek federal funding under Title IV-E with specific requirements. Tribes operating a Title IV-E program must accurately determine eligibility to receive federal support. They need a valid cost allocation methodology for training and administrative claims, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs overseeing tribal cost allocation. Indian Affairs oversees tribal cost allocation for Title IV-E programs. Tribes can use federal funds from specific programs as non-federal dollars for Title IV-E spending. In-kind third party expenditures can also be used for the non-federal share of administrative and training costs. The Tribal Child Welfare Interim Final Rule allows tribes to use in-kind expenditures for non-federal Title IV-E administrative and training costs. Tribes operating a Title IV-E program must collect and report data on children in foster care or adopted under the public child welfare agency. Data must be submitted electronically to the HHS Children's Bureau twice a year. Tribes operating a Title IV-E program must report data on children in foster care or adopted under the public child welfare agency, regardless of eligibility for adoption assistance. Tribes seeking direct Title IV-E funding must have a statewide information system capable of tracking each child in foster care, which may include a Tribal Automated Child Welfare Information System (TACWIS). Approved tribes with a TACWIS planning document can make Title IV-E claims for federal reimbursement related to data collection system development. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) provides federal rules for child custody proceedings. Tribes with approved Title IV-E plans can submit claims for federal reimbursement related to data collection systems. States report child welfare data through NCANDS and NYTD, but tribes operating Title IV-E programs are not required to report via these systems. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) provides federal rules for child custody proceedings, including notice and transfer to tribal courts. The Fostering Connections Act requires HHS to regulate transferring care responsibilities from state to tribal child welfare agencies for Title IV-E eligibility. HHS issued interim regulations on this in 2012. Interim regulations issued in 2012 require states to establish transfer procedures with Indian tribes for Title IV-E eligibility, including determining eligibility at the time of care transfer and providing essential documents for Medicaid. The state must provide documentation related to the child's Title IV-E eligibility, case plan, placement settings, and other federal program eligibility. Tribal entities can receive grants to help prepare and submit a Title IV-E plan, with grants valued at up to $300,000. The tribal grantee must develop and submit a Title IV-E plan to HHS within 24 months of receiving funding. Failure to do so may result in repayment of the grant, unless circumstances beyond the tribe's control are determined. The grant can be used to support the development of necessary components for the Title IV-E program. HHS awarded tribal implementation grants to 12 tribes, tribal organizations, or consortiums for Title IV-E plan development. All tribes are working to finalize their plans as of early September 2012. Technical assistance is also provided by HHS as required by P.L. 110-351. The HHS provides information, advice, and technical assistance to tribes regarding child welfare programs authorized under Title IV-B and Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Funding was awarded to the Tribal Law and Policy Institute for a National Resource Center for Tribes, expected to last up to five years. For more information, visit http://www.NRC4tribes.org.
