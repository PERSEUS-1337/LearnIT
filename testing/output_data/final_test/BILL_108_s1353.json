    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Widows and Orphans Act of 2003\" and introduces a new special immigrant category. The \"Widows and Orphans Act of 2003\" introduces a new special immigrant category under the Immigration and Nationality Act, including provisions for certain children and women at risk of harm. The \"Widows and Orphans Act of 2003\" establishes a special immigrant category for minors under 10 years old who lack parental care, face a credible fear of harm, and need protection. The text chunk describes criteria for admission to the United States for individuals determined to be in their best interests or referred by a designated entity and determined to be a female with a credible fear of harm. The text chunk amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict certain rights for natural parents of aliens with special immigrant status and prohibits aliens from applying for derivative status if their spouse is missing, deceased, or the source of harm. The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the requirement for an alien if they prove their representations about their spouse were genuine. Special immigrant visa holders can apply for derivative status for siblings or children under 10 years old. These visa holders are treated similarly to refugees for certain purposes. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive certain provisions of section 212(a) for aliens seeking admission under subsection (a)(27)(N) for humanitarian reasons, family unity, or public interest. Waivers must be granted on an individual basis after an investigation and reported annually to Congress. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to waive application fees for special immigrant visas for certain aliens. The determination of age for these visas is based on the alien's age at the time of referral to immigration officials. Special immigrant status must be adjudicated within 45 days of referral, and if granted, the alien will be paroled into the United States. The Secretary of Homeland Security can waive application fees for special immigrant visas for certain aliens based on age at referral. Adjudicated aliens may be paroled into the US and allowed to apply for permanent residence within a year. A report to Congress on program progress is required within one year of enactment, including data on placements of females and children at risk. Authorization of Appropriations: The Secretary of Homeland Security can determine any necessary information for this section. Appropriations are authorized for carrying out this section and its amendments."
