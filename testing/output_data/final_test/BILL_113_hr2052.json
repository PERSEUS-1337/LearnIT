    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013\". Congress emphasizes the importance of improving economic growth, creating jobs, and maintaining national security through global engagement. The US is facing increased competition in attracting foreign direct investment, which is crucial for domestic economic prosperity and security. Foreign direct investment from global companies benefits the US economy by providing jobs for millions of Americans, strengthening the industrial base, and supporting the manufacturing sector. Foreign direct investment in the US manufacturing sector contributes significantly to the economy by creating jobs, promoting innovation, generating exports, and supporting local businesses. These companies account for 5.8 percent of the private sector GDP and play a crucial role in the Department of Commerce's initiatives to increase foreign direct investment. The President's initiatives in 2011 aimed to increase foreign direct investment in the United States by establishing the SelectUSA initiative and promoting a National Investment Initiative to attract $1 trillion in foreign investment over five years. Institutions, a fair justice system, and accountable procedures contribute to US global competitiveness. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of attracting foreign direct investment for long-term economic prosperity, global competitiveness, and security. It prioritizes removing barriers to foreign investment, promoting policies to maintain the US as a top global destination for investment, and encouraging open investment policies to foster reciprocity with other countries. The investment policy aims to open new markets for US companies abroad and enhance economic strength, while also considering national security interests and not disadvantaging domestic investors. Efforts to attract foreign direct investment should align with improving the domestic standard of living. SEC. 4. FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT REVIEW.
