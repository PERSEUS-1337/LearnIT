Congress also passed legislation addressing concerns about executive pay. The SEC issued rules in 2006 regarding disclosure of executive compensation, focusing on stock-option grants and programs. Companies were required to include detailed information in their proxy statements, annual reports, and registration statements. The rules mandated tabular and narrative disclosure of stock option practices, including grant date fair value and FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Rule No. 123 (FAS 123R) grant date. On December 22, 2006, the SEC adopted changes to executive compensation disclosure rules to align stock and option awards reporting with FASB Statement No. 123R. This required recognition of equity award costs over the service period. The SEC adopted changes to executive compensation disclosure rules to align stock and option awards reporting with FASB Statement No. 123R. The amendment requires disclosure of the compensation cost of awards over the service period, grant date fair value of equity awards, and description of forfeitures in footnotes. The SEC adopted changes to executive compensation disclosure rules aligning stock and option awards reporting with FASB Statement No. 123R. The Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table now requires disclosure of re-priced or modified options or stock appreciation rights, with incremental fair value disclosed in footnotes. Some investor groups criticize these amendments for potentially obscuring executive pay packages. The chief executive of American Widget receives a $24 million option grant on December 1, with options vesting over four years. He is not eligible for retirement due to his recent tenure. The value of the option is $500,000 in the summary table. In contrast, the chief executive of National Widget receives a $5 million option on the same day, with retirement eligibility. The disparity in option values between the two executives is significant. In the 110th Congress, two laws were enacted regarding executive compensation: P.L. 110-289, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, and P.L. 110-343, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. P.L. 110-289 includes restrictions on compensation for executives of federal home loan banks, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Section 1117 allows the Secretary of the Treasury to consider limitations on executive payments when purchasing obligations from these entities. In the 110th Congress, laws were enacted to restrict executive compensation for federal home loan banks, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency can prohibit and withhold executive compensation for wrongdoing. The Secretary of the Treasury can require financial institutions with troubled assets to meet standards for executive compensation, including limits on incentive-based pay and a prohibition on golden parachutes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 amended laws to set restrictions on executive compensation for companies receiving financial assistance under the Troubled Assets Relief Program. The Secretary of the Treasury must establish standards including limits on incentives for top executives and the recovery of inaccurate bonuses. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 amended laws to restrict executive compensation for TARP recipients, including prohibiting golden parachute payments and certain bonuses. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 amended laws to restrict executive compensation for TARP recipients, including prohibiting golden parachute payments and certain bonuses. The prohibition on compensation applies based on the amount of financial assistance received by a financial institution, ranging from the highest paid person for institutions receiving less than $25 million to the top officers and employees for institutions receiving $500 million or more. Additionally, there is a prohibition on compensation plans that manipulate reported earnings to boost employee compensation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 amended laws to restrict executive compensation for TARP recipients, including prohibiting golden parachute payments and certain bonuses. TARP recipients must establish a Board Compensation Committee made up of independent directors to review employee compensation plans. The committee must meet at least semiannually to discuss and evaluate compensation plans. If a TARP recipient's stock is not registered with the SEC and received $25 million or less of TARP assistance, the recipient's board will perform the committee's duties. The Board Compensation Committee's duties for TARP recipients include overseeing excessive expenses and executive compensation approval through a nonbinding shareholder vote. The Secretary of the Treasury reviews compensation for top executives and employees to ensure consistency with TARP's goals and public interest. The Secretary of the Treasury oversees executive compensation for TARP recipients, ensuring it aligns with program goals. Excessive payments must be reimbursed to the government, and recipients can repay assistance without waiting periods. Tax laws limit executive compensation to prevent excessive payouts like \"golden parachutes.\" The Internal Revenue Code has long had provisions to limit executive compensation, including golden parachute payments. New provisions introduced in the 110th Congress by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) affect entities receiving funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). These provisions differ from earlier ones in the code and also include restrictions outside of the IRC on golden parachute payments. Additionally, subsection 162(m) was introduced in the IRC in 1993, applying only to publicly held corporations. The provision under \u00a7 162(m) limits deductions for employee compensation to $1 million for publicly held corporations, excluding closely held corporations and non-corporate employers. The limit has not been adjusted for inflation and excludes commissions and performance-based compensation from the calculation. Retention pay and severance pay are included in the deductible compensation. The $1 million deduction limit for employee compensation under \u00a7 162(m) applies to covered employees, including CEOs and top earners whose compensation is disclosed to shareholders. For entities receiving TARP funding, the limit is $500,000 for covered executives, which now includes CFOs. Entities receiving TARP funding must adhere to a $500,000 limit for covered executives, which includes CFOs. The determination of covered executives is based on their position during the taxable year under EESA \u00a7 101(a). Once designated as a covered executive, the limitation applies in all subsequent years as long as EESA's authority is in effect. The EESA imposes limits on executive compensation for entities receiving TARP funds, including a $500,000 cap for covered executives. Golden parachute payments are restricted, with a 20% excise tax imposed on excess payments. Recipients are liable for this tax in addition to regular income tax withholdings. Introduced in 1984, IRC \u00a7 280G imposes an excise tax on parachute payments made by corporations, with no requirement for public holding. Parachute payments must be contingent on ownership changes and benefit disqualified individuals like officers or highly compensated individuals. Non-corporate entities not receiving TARP funds are not subject to this tax. A \"disqualified individual\" includes officers, shareholders, or highly compensated individuals providing personal services for a corporation. Parachute payments must be three times the base amount, with any excess not deductible by the corporation. The base amount is typically the employee's average compensation for the five most recent tax years. Subsection 280G(e) extends these provisions to entities receiving TARP funds, regardless of their corporate status. The small business exemption does not apply to TARP recipients when determining excess parachute payments. In 2005, Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), which made changes to business bankruptcies, including limitations on \"key employee retention plans\" (KERPs) as administrative expenses. Chapter 11 reorganizations allow debtors to remain in control. Chapter 11 reorganizations allow debtors to stay in control of their business operations while negotiating with creditors. Trustee is usually not appointed, as it is believed that the debtor's management can lead a successful reorganization. Key Employee Retention Plans (KERPs) were used to provide bonuses to management, but were restricted by BAPCPA due to perceived abuse. Administrative expenses have a high priority in bankruptcy proceedings. Administrative expenses in bankruptcy have a high priority and must be paid before other claims. BAPCPA restricts inducements to insiders, with standards for allowances. Court must find inducements essential for retention based on evidence. The court must find inducements essential for retention based on evidence, with restrictions on allowances for insiders. Inducements to insiders must not exceed certain limits compared to transfers or obligations to nonmanagement employees. Severance payments to insiders may be allowed as administrative expenses in post-BAPCPA bankruptcy if part of a program applicable to all full-time employees. BAPCPA restricts certain payments to insiders, such as severance pay exceeding 10 times the mean for nonmanagement employees. Incentive payments to managers have been allowed, but some have been rejected as retention bonuses. Recent proposals aim to increase disclosure of executive compensation. Several proposals have been made regarding executive compensation, including additional disclosure to shareholders and bills introduced in the 111th Congress. These bills include S. 1074, which applies a say-on-pay rule to all publicly traded companies, and S. 1006, which requires shareholder approval for pay packages larger than 100 times the average annual compensation of a company's employees. The House Committee on Financial Services also circulated a discussion draft of H.R. 3269, the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009, which covers Say-on-Pay, Independent Compensation Committee, Incentive Based Compensation Disclosure, and Compensation Standards for Financial Institutions. The House passed an amended bill on executive compensation disclosures, requiring annual shareholder meetings to include a separate vote on executive compensation. The vote would not be binding and would not override decisions by the board of directors. Proxy materials for acquisitions or mergers must disclose any executive compensation agreements. The House-passed bill on executive compensation disclosures includes requirements for nonbinding shareholder votes on executive compensation and golden parachutes. Institutional investment managers must disclose their votes on these matters. The bill also mandates that every national securities exchange prohibit listing equity securities of issuers without a compensation committee composed of independent members. The committee would have the authority to hire a compensation consultant and independent counsel. The House-passed bill mandates that every national securities exchange must have a compensation committee composed of independent members with the authority to hire a compensation consultant and independent counsel. Federal regulators would issue regulations for financial institutions to disclose incentive-based compensation structures to reduce risks and unreasonable incentives for employees. The federal regulators overseeing covered financial institutions are required to disclose incentive-based compensation structures to reduce risks and unreasonable incentives for employees. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the connection between compensation structures and excessive risk-taking. Bills on executive compensation limits have been introduced in the 111th Congress. Bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to limit executive compensation, including requirements for institutions receiving assistance to meet standards for compensation and governance. Some bills seek to recover bonuses paid to employees, using various methods such as authorizing the Attorney General to recover excessive compensation. H.R. 1664 passed by the House aims to limit unreasonable compensation for companies receiving taxpayer money. H.R. 1594 proposed limiting employee compensation deductions to $500,000 or 25 times the lowest employee salary. Bills introduced after AIG's bonus scandal in 2009 sought to impose high taxes on excessive compensation. In 2009, bills were introduced in the House and Senate to impose high taxes on bonuses paid by entities receiving TARP funds or federal economic assistance. H.R. 1586 proposed a 90% income tax on bonuses over $250,000, while S. 651 suggested a 35% excise tax on \"excessive bonuses.\" In the 109th and 110th Congress, bills were introduced to expand restrictions on retention payments in bankruptcy cases, including performance, incentive, and bonus payments. The proposed modifications aimed to cover payments made within and outside the ordinary course of business. The proposed modifications to \u00a7 503(c) of the Bankruptcy Code extended restrictions on executive compensation in chapter 11 bankruptcies, linking it to compensation paid to other employees and requiring court approval for reasonableness. Bills in the 111th Congress may introduce further limitations on executive compensation. H.R. 1575, discussed in the section on \"Proposals to Impose Limitations on TARP Recipients,\" included language similar to \u00a7 548 of the Bankruptcy Code regarding fraudulent transfers. Table A-1 lists selected provisions in federal law addressing executive compensation broadly, including retention payments and \"golden parachutes\" in bankruptcy, banking, securities, and tax laws. Some provisions outside these areas are also included. The table includes provisions from the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA; P.L. 110-343) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5), with notations for modifications made by ARRA."
