    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preventing Depression in Preadolescent and Adolescent Girls and Women Act of 2002\". The Act, titled \"Preventing Depression in Preadolescent and Adolescent Girls and Women Act of 2002,\" highlights key findings by Congress regarding depression, emphasizing its prevalence among Americans, especially women. Women are more likely to experience depression, with a higher risk of recurrence, particularly during critical life stages like new motherhood. Adolescent girls also report higher rates of depression compared to boys. Childhood and adolescent depression often persist into adulthood, posing risks of morbidity and suicide, although not always. Prospective studies show increased depression risk for women during adolescence, indicating prevention efforts may be beneficial. Suicide is a significant cause of death for young women, often linked to depression. Ethnic minority women have comparable depression rates to white women but face higher risks of unrecognized and inadequately treated depression. Low-income populations are less likely to have their depression recognized and treated. Ethnic minority women, especially Latina and Asian/Pacific Islander females, may have their depression symptoms influenced by culture. Barriers such as lack of knowledge, stigma, and limited resources hinder women from seeking treatment for depression. Treatment interventions alone may not be sufficient. Experts recommend focusing on interventions to prevent the onset of depression in women, considering social, cultural, and economic factors that influence its prevention, development, diagnosis, and treatment. SEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with other federal officials, may award grants to develop interventions for preventing and treating depression in preadolescent and adolescent girls and at-risk women in diverse populations. Grants can be used to create screening measures for mental health problems in community settings. Establish programs to train professionals in community settings to screen for depression and make referrals, educate the target population about depression and treatment options, and develop culturally appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment. Authorization of $10,000,000 for fiscal year. The section authorizes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and necessary funds for fiscal years 2004 through 2006."
