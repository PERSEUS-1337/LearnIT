    "content": "The Act titled \"Investor in Iran Accountability Act of 2005\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The findings by Congress in the Department of State's Patterns of Global Terrorism report for 2003 highlighted Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism. Iran was noted for providing support to terrorist groups like Hizballah, HAMAS, and others, while also having a poor human rights record. Sanctions were imposed on Iran in 1979 in response to the Islamic Revolution and the hostage crisis involving US citizens. The United States prohibits trade and investment activities with Iran by its citizens and companies. However, foreign subsidiaries of US companies can invest in Iran independently. Some US company subsidiaries are investing in Iran's energy sector. Iran is the second largest oil producer in OPEC and holds 10% of the world's oil reserves. According to the Energy Information Administration, Iran heavily relies on oil export revenues, accounting for 80% of total annual export earnings, half of the government's budget, and one-fifth of the GDP. Iran is seeking foreign investment in the energy sector to increase crude oil production. The Department of Justice is investigating potential violations by US companies trading with Iran. The Securities and Exchange Commission has determined that trading or investing with Iran through a subsidiary company that may not be completely independent of the parent company can pose a material risk to investors in the United States and should be properly disclosed. The policy of the United States is to enforce economic sanctions against Iran, make investment information public, and seek international cooperation in enforcing sanctions until Iran stops supporting terrorism. In this Act, \"controlled in fact\" includes holding at least 50 percent of the capital structure of a corporation or legal entity. The term \"energy sector\" refers to activities related to natural gas, oil, petroleum resources, or nuclear power. \"State\" includes the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, and other territories. The term \"United States person\" includes citizens, permanent residents, and entities organized under US laws, regardless of location. It encompasses individuals and organizations in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and other US territories. SEC. 5. PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION ON INVESTMENTS. The Secretary of the Treasury must publish lists of US persons and foreign persons with investments in the energy sector in Iran, including values exceeding $1,000,000 and $100,000 respectively. The Secretary of the Treasury updates lists of investors in the energy sector in Iran, including those with investments valued at over $100,000, investment companies, pension plans, and other relevant investors. The Secretary of the Treasury updates lists of investors in the energy sector in Iran annually, publishing updates in the Federal Register and on the Department of the Treasury's website. The President will negotiate with foreign governments to prevent investments in Iran's energy sector by entities controlled by those countries. Additionally, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 will be extended from 10 to 15 years."
