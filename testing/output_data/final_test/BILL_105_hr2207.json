    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coastal Pollution Reduction Act of 1997\". It pertains to Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. The Coastal Pollution Reduction Act of 1997 focuses on the findings related to the discharge from the Mayaguez treatment works into stressed waters of Mayaguez Bay. It suggests relocating the discharge to unstressed ocean waters to benefit the marine environment. The Act aims to administer the Federal Water Pollution Control Act with flexibility to consider the unique characteristics of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. It also mentions the possibility of a deep ocean outfall off the coastline of Mayaguez receiving a less-than-secondary sewage discharge while maintaining healthy marine life. The Coastal Pollution Reduction Act of 1997 proposes using a deep ocean outfall off the coast of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, to reduce pollution from the treatment works and protect marine life. The owner or operator of the treatment works can apply for a waiver for secondary treatment to use the deep ocean outfall, as per the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow the owner of the Mayaguez treatment works in Puerto Rico to apply for a waiver to construct a deep ocean outfall after conducting a study on the marine environment feasibility. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to allow the owner of the Mayaguez treatment works in Puerto Rico to apply for a waiver to construct a deep ocean outfall at a recommended location within 18 months of the enactment. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act allows the owner of the Mayaguez treatment works in Puerto Rico to apply for a waiver to construct a deep ocean outfall, subject to specific application revision procedures. The applicant must have a binding consent decree with the United States outlining schedules for compliance in case of modification approval or denial. The applicant must commit to contributing $400,000 to the Mayaguez Watershed Initiative as part of the modification approval process. The Administrator will issue a tentative determination within 270 days of a complete application and a final determination within 270 days of the tentative determination. The Administrator is also prohibited from imposing additional conditions. The Administrator may grant a modification for a new deep water ocean outfall only if it meets specific conditions, including using a well-designed diffuser and avoiding discharge to sensitive marine areas. The modification will only be effective if the outfall is operational within 4.5 years of the Administrator's initial determination. The National Estuary Program is amended to include grants for comprehensive conservation and management plans, as well as an authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1992 through 1997 and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 1998."
