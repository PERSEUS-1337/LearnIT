    "content": "President Trump signed the SUPPORT Act into law in response to the increasing opioid overdose deaths in the United States. The Act aims to address overprescribing and abuse of opioids. The SUPPORT Act is a sweeping measure to combat opioid overprescribing and abuse in the US. It includes provisions for law enforcement, public health, and healthcare financing. The act tightens oversight of opioid production, limits coverage of prescription opioids, and expands access to addiction treatment services. It also authorizes programs for education on opioid use and training for providers. The legislation affects direct spending and revenues, with specific changes in the Medicare program. The SUPPORT Act aims to combat opioid overprescribing and abuse in the US through various provisions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Act would increase the on-budget deficit by $1,001 million over 5 years but reduce it by $52 million over 10 years. The Act builds on prior laws addressing the opioid epidemic, excluding budgetary effects from PAYGO scorecards to prevent sequestration. The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act; P.L. 114-255) addressed cures and treatment research, authorized new funding for medical research, amended the FDA drug approval process, and provided additional funding to combat opioid addiction. Specifically, Title B of the Cures Act, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Reform Act, made changes to authorities and programs of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The SUPPORT Act, under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, aims to increase access to community-based services for mental and substance use disorders. It consists of eight titles addressing Medicaid and Medicare provisions, FDA regulations, offsets, and public health provisions. The Congressional Research Service is publishing reports on the law, with this report covering Medicare provisions in Title II and Title VI, along with a Medicare budget offset in Title IV. Medicare is a federal program providing health coverage for individuals aged 65 and older and those with disabilities. It served 60 million people in 2018 through Part A for hospital services, Part B for physician services, Part C for managed care, and Part D for prescription drugs. Medicare covers opioids prescribed by approved providers in various settings. Medicare does not have a specific benefit category for Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment, but it covers certain services like psychiatric care and prescription drugs for alcoholism and opioid abuse. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is a type of SUD defined by diagnostic criteria. A 2018 report found that one in three Part D enrollees received at least one prescription opioid in 2017. In 2017, 458,935 Part D beneficiaries received high amounts of opioids, excluding those with cancer or in hospice care. HHS has implemented measures to reduce opioid prescribing and provide treatment for overuse, including a voluntary opioid monitoring system in Medicare Part D. The system tracks opioid use and offers case management for at-risk enrollees. Additionally, CARA allows Part D plans to limit prescribers and pharmacies. CARA allows Part D plans to implement \"lock-in\" programs for at-risk enrollees starting in 2019 to control drug use. Suggestions to address Medicare opioid overutilization include improving provider and enrollee education, limiting opioid access, and expanding coverage for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD). MAT combines medications with counseling and behavioral therapies and is considered one of the most effective treatments for OUD. The SUPPORT Act expands Medicare coverage for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and strengthens Medicare Part D lock-in programs to prevent opioid fraud and abuse. It also includes provisions for beneficiary education on opioids and access to evidence-based alternatives. Additionally, the law creates a new Medicare bundled payment for MAT. The SUPPORT Act introduces major changes to Medicare, including a new bundled payment for MAT services in OTPs, electronic prescribing of controlled substances in Medicare Part D, and the implementation of lock-in programs for at-risk opioid abuse enrollees. Telehealth services can be provided to Medicare beneficiaries under Parts A and B, with separate payment requirements in certain situations. Part A allows for telehealth services for hospital inpatients without a separate payment under the Medicare hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System. CMS guidance for Part A recognizes telehealth as an alternative to face-to-face encounters for home health services. Part B payments for telehealth services must adhere to restrictions outlined in the Social Security Act. Medicare allows telehealth services for beneficiaries under Parts A and B, with separate payment requirements. The originating site must meet specific conditions, including being in a rural area or participating in a federal telemedicine project. Medicare pays the practitioner at the distant site for the service and a facility fee to the originating site. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 expands telehealth under Medicare by increasing opportunities for ACOs and Medicare shared savings plans to receive telehealth payments, eliminating originating site restrictions for acute stroke evaluation, and allowing MA plans to provide additional telehealth benefits starting in 2020. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 expands telehealth under Medicare by eliminating geographic originating site requirements for treating substance use disorder and co-occurring mental health disorders. It allows Medicare patients with end-stage renal disease on home dialysis to receive monthly clinical assessments via telehealth. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 expands telehealth under Medicare by eliminating geographic originating site requirements for treating substance use disorder and co-occurring mental health disorders. The HHS Secretary has the authority to implement modifications immediately. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plan services. $3 million is to be transferred from the Medicare Part B Trust Fund to support this effort. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 expands Medicare telehealth services for substance use disorder and mental health disorders. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plan services, including screenings for depression, alcohol misuse, and opioid prescriptions. The IPPE now includes a review of opioid prescriptions, risk factors for OUD, pain severity evaluation, non-opioid treatment options, and specialist referrals. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 expands Medicare telehealth services for substance use disorder and mental health disorders. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plan services, including screenings for depression, alcohol misuse, and opioid prescriptions. The IPPE now includes a review of opioid prescriptions, risk factors for OUD, pain severity evaluation, non-opioid treatment options, and specialist referrals. In addition, it adds requirements for \"screening for potential substance use disorders\" and referral for treatment as appropriate for visits on or after January 1, 2020. The provision does not prohibit separate payments for additional substance abuse services on the same day as an IPPE or AWV. Part D prescription drug coverage is provided through drug-only plans or Part C managed care plans. Part D plans must support an electronic prescription program defined by CMS. This program allows the exchange of specific information between prescribers, dispensers, pharmacies, and health plans. E-prescribing for Part D Schedule II-V controlled substances is required to be transmitted electronically by health care practitioners starting January 1, 2021, as per SSA Section 1860D-4(e) amendment. The CMS standards must be followed for e-prescriptions and related communications with Part D plans, with the Secretary defining waiver circumstances. Waivers for electronic prescribing requirements may be granted in certain circumstances, such as when the prescriber and dispenser are the same entity, technological limitations prevent electronic transmission, or there are exceptional circumstances causing hardship. The requirements for electronic prescribing waivers include situations like drugs with risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, prescriptions for hospice care patients not covered under the title, or nursing facility residents eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Part D sponsors and pharmacists do not need to verify prescribers' waivers. The U.S. attorney general must update biometric authentication requirements for controlled substance electronic prescriptions within a year. Section 6062 of the SSA amends Part D e-prescribing systems to allow for processing of formulary prior authorization requirements. This refers to the approval needed from a Part D plan before filling a prescription for a covered drug. By January 1, 2021, the Medicare Part D e-prescribing system must securely transmit prior authorization requests and responses electronically, following technical standards set by the Secretary in consultation with relevant organizations and stakeholders. Since 2013, CMS has implemented a two-part system to address inappropriate opioid use in Part D. Plan sponsors are encouraged to identify potential overutilizers, conduct reviews of prescribing data, and coordinate care with prescribers. The system-wide OMS reviews prescription data to identify enrollees at risk of overutilizing opioids based on dosage and number of prescribers or pharmacies used. CARA allows Part D plans to limit the number of prescribers and pharmacies for enrollees at risk of opioid overutilization. CMS issued rules in April 2018 to integrate lock-in provisions with the OMS and Part D plan review system. Plans can restrict access to frequently abused drugs through pharmacy control and lock-in requirements, and must perform case management for enrollees identified as at risk for opioid abuse. Part D plans can enroll potentially at-risk enrollees in lock-in programs following specific procedures outlined in CARA. Enrollees receive initial and second notices regarding their status, pharmacy and prescriber choices, and their right to a redetermination. Exemptions from lock-in programs include those in long-term or hospice care and those actively treated for cancer pain. Additional exemptions can be set by the Secretary. Section 2004 of CARA requires Part D plans to implement lock-in provisions for at-risk beneficiaries starting in 2022. Section 2006 mandates lock-in requirements for Part D-eligible individuals with a history of opioid-related overdoses by 2021. The Secretary shall identify Part D-eligible individuals with a history of opioid-related overdoses and notify the Part D sponsor of the plan. Section 2007 expedites the appeal process for Part D enrollees at risk of opioid abuse, with cases automatically forwarded to an independent entity if the appeal is denied. Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is often treated with medication-assisted treatment (MAT), combining medication with therapies. Three drugs are FDA-approved for MAT: methadone. The FDA has approved three drugs for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD): methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. Methadone and buprenorphine are scheduled drugs due to abuse potential, while naltrexone is not. Methadone is a Schedule II controlled substance with high abuse potential, buprenorphine is a Schedule III controlled substance with less abuse potential. Practitioners need specific training to treat OUD with buprenorphine, and methadone for OUD treatment is available only through opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Medicare does not explicitly offer an OUD benefit, but many services for OUD treatment are covered under broad Medicare benefit categories. OTP clinics are not recognized for reimbursement under Medicare statutes. Medicare does not cover methadone for MAT as it can only be provided in OTP clinics, which are not recognized for reimbursement. However, Section 2005 amends Medicare law to include coverage for OTP services for OUD treatment, such as FDA-approved MAT drugs, counseling, therapy, and testing, starting from January 1, 2020. The Secretary will pay OTPs 100% of a bundled payment for OUD treatment provided to Medicare beneficiaries during an episode of care. Payment bundles will be based on medication dispensed, services provided, beneficiary characteristics, and other factors deemed appropriate. The Secretary may suspend payments to Medicare providers pending fraud investigations and must consult with relevant authorities to determine credibility of allegations. Section 2008 amends Medicare law to authorize Medicare coverage for OTP services for OUD treatment. Section 2008 amends Medicare Part D law to allow plan sponsors to suspend payments to pharmacies in their networks during fraud investigations. A credible fraud allegation is required for payment suspension, and a fraud hotline call alone is not sufficient. The section applies to Part D plan years starting January 1, 2020. The Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSP) prohibits Medicare from making payments if another insurer has already paid or is expected to pay. Congress initiated the MSP in 1980 to ensure insurers meet their obligations and reduce Medicare costs. Group health plans must provide information on covered individuals who may be Medicare eligible. The Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSP) requires group health plan sponsors to identify situations where the plan is the primary payer for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. This change aims to ensure proper billing to Medicare and is effective from January 1, 2020. Additionally, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act established incentive programs to promote EHR technology adoption in Medicare and Medicaid. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) was established to test innovative healthcare payment and delivery models to improve quality of care and reduce expenditures. Incentive programs were launched in 2011 to encourage the meaningful use of certified EHR technology in acute-care hospitals and nonhospital-based physicians. Behavioral health providers are often not eligible for these programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allocated $10 billion to support CMMI activities from FY2011 through FY2019 and subsequent 10-year periods. CMMI innovation models include various initiatives to improve health care coordination and quality. Section 6001 expands the list of models CMMI may test to include incentive payments for behavioral health providers using certified EHR technology. The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) requires Part D plans to cover a minimum of two drugs in each category used to treat the same medical condition, with exceptions for clinical superiority. Plans must also cover a range of drugs in specific categories like immunosuppressants and antipsychotics. Formulary restrictions such as higher cost sharing and prior approval may be implemented by Part D plans. The Medicare Modernization Act requires Part D plans to cover a minimum of two drugs in each category for the same medical condition, with exceptions for clinical superiority. Plans must also cover a range of drugs in specific categories. Section 6012 mandates a study to determine if Part D enrollees with chronic pain have adequate access to abuse-deterrent opioids, defining them as opioids with features to prevent abuse. The study will consider barriers like cost-sharing tiers and prior authorization requirements. The Medicare Modernization Act requires Part D plans to cover a minimum of two drugs in each category for the same medical condition, with exceptions for clinical superiority. Plans must also cover a range of drugs in specific categories. Section 6012 mandates a study to determine if Part D enrollees with chronic pain have adequate access to abuse-deterrent opioids, considering barriers like cost-sharing tiers and prior authorization requirements. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of abuse-deterrent opioid formulations in preventing opioid abuse or misuse, the impact on the use of other opioids, and potential public health consequences. The Secretary is required to prepare and distribute a public notice each year explaining Medicare benefits, including coverage scope, beneficiary rights, responsibilities, and educational resources. The CMS produces the Medicare & You handbook for Medicare beneficiaries, which includes information on health and drug plans. Beneficiaries can opt for electronic delivery of the handbook. Section 6021 requires the Secretary to provide educational resources in the annual notice starting in 2019. The Secretary declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in October 2017, extending it multiple times in 2018 due to increasing rates of opioid-related deaths and OUD. Factors contributing to the crisis include changes in medical practice, overprescribing of opioids, poor social and economic conditions, and improvements in manufacturing. The Secretary declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in October 2017, extending it multiple times in 2018 due to increasing rates of opioid-related deaths and OUD. Factors contributing to the crisis include changes in medical practice, overprescribing of opioids, poor social and economic conditions, and improvements in manufacturing. The Pain Task Force was established to identify gaps in pain management best practices and develop strategies to combat opioid abuse crisis. Section 6032 directs the Secretary to collaborate with the Pain Task Force to develop an action plan and recommendations on changes to Medicare and Medicaid to prevent opioid addiction and enhance access to MAT, including OTPs, behavioral therapy, and medications for SUD treatment. The Secretary must review payment and coverage policies that may hinder the response to the opioid crisis and convene a public stakeholder meeting for feedback on addressing the crisis through CMS. The Secretary is required to collaborate with the Pain Task Force to develop an action plan addressing the opioid crisis. This plan will be reviewed and recommendations will be made to Congress by June 1, 2020. The plan will include steps for addressing opioid overdoses, evaluating drug price trends, and identifying barriers to opioid addiction treatment. Limited insurance coverage and restrictions on MAT drugs may hinder access to OUD treatment. Some argue that MAT drugs are crucial for treatment, while others suggest tailored approaches based on individual needs. Section 6042 amends SSA Title XVIII to address these issues. Section 6042 amends SSA Title XVIII by adding new Section 1866F, requiring a four-year demonstration project to increase Medicare beneficiary access to OUD treatment services, improve health outcomes, and reduce expenditures starting by January 1, 2020. The Secretary must consult with specialists and beneficiary groups to design the demonstration, with a preference for entities in high OUD prevalence areas. Demonstration participants must establish OUD care teams with specified practitioners. Participants in the demonstration project must establish OUD care teams with specified practitioners, including at least one physician providing primary care or addiction treatment services. Care teams may also include other licensed practitioners for additional support services. To receive payment, participants must offer OUD treatment services through these teams, meet minimum criteria set by the Secretary, and submit data on beneficiaries. Eligible practitioners must be enrolled in Medicare, authorized to prescribe narcotic drugs, and have a DATA 2000 waiver. The Drug Addiction and Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000) waiver allows providers to prescribe controlled substances for OUD treatment. Beneficiaries must be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, have an OUD diagnosis, and meet other criteria to enroll in the demonstration. Up to 20,000 individuals can participate, including dual eligibles. Providers cannot limit access to Medicare services, and beneficiaries do not have to give up Medicare services to receive demonstration services. The Secretary is required to establish a monthly per-applicable-beneficiary care management fee for providers participating in the demonstration. This fee can be used to deliver additional services to beneficiaries, including those not covered by Medicare. Section 6042 also mandates the establishment of a performance-based incentive payment to encourage similar provider payments from other payers. The Secretary is authorized to enter agreements with other payers to align OUD treatment payments and conduct evaluations to assess the demonstration's effectiveness. The demonstration program requires an intermediate evaluation within three years and a final evaluation within six years of implementation. $5 million from the Medicare Part B Trust Fund is allocated for program implementation, while $10 million is designated for OUD care management fees and incentive payments. Medicare Part D plan sponsors process prescription claims and send PDE records to CMS for payment, research, and fraud detection purposes. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) required Part D claims to include valid National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) starting in 2016 to address concerns about provider identification fraud. The HHS OIG monitored MACRA implementation, and Section 6065 amended SSA Section 1860D-4(c)(4) to establish technical thresholds for identifying outlier Part D opioid prescribers based on valid NPIs, excluding claims for hospice or cancer patients. Starting January 1, 2021, the Secretary will notify prescribers identified as opioid outliers annually, comparing their prescribing practices to others in the same specialty. The notifications will include information on opioid prescribing guidelines and may be adjusted in frequency after five years. Persistent outliers may be required to enroll in enhanced oversight programs. Section 6052 authorizes CMS to award grants for educating outlier prescribers on best practices for opioid prescribing and non-opioid pain management therapies, as well as reducing opioid prescriptions. Eligible entities must have experience providing technical assistance to healthcare professionals and include consumer and healthcare provider representatives on their governing bodies. The provision requires eligible entities to have consumer and healthcare provider representatives on their governing bodies. $75 million from the Part B Trust Fund will fund this. Medicare Part C MA plans and Part D drug-only plans must establish compliance programs to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. Medicare Drug Integrity Contractors (MEDICs) will support program integrity activities. CMS, the Secretary, and MEDICs will audit plans to ensure compliance and investigate reports of fraud. Plans may report activities to the Secretary or MEDICs. The Secretary may share fraud information. Section 6063 of the SSA authorizes the Secretary to share fraud information among MA and PDPs, impose penalties for improper conduct, and potentially exclude entities from federal health programs. The Secretary may also suspend Medicare payments pending fraud investigations and is required to establish a secure internet portal within two years for communication purposes. The Secretary is required to establish a secure internet website portal for communication and data sharing with MA plans, PDPs, and MEDICs to address fraud, waste, and abuse activities. The website will also disseminate information on providers and suppliers involved in such activities. Within two years, quarterly reports on fraud, waste, and abuse will be provided to MA plans and PDPs. Section 6063 requires the Secretary to disseminate quarterly reports to MA plans and PDPs on fraud, waste, and abuse schemes and suspicious activity trends reported through the website. Reports must maintain anonymity of submitted information and include administrative actions, opioid overprescribing data, and other relevant information. Referrals to HHS OIG or law enforcement entities are not prohibited. Starting in 2021, MA organizations and PDP sponsors must submit credible evidence of suspected fraud and inappropriate opioid prescribing. Before 2021, the Secretary will establish a process for submitting this information in consultation with stakeholders. The Secretary is required to issue regulations on inappropriate opioid prescribing and suspected fraud reporting. Medicare Part D plans must offer Medication Therapy Management programs for patients with multiple medical conditions. CMS reviews and approves each plan's MTM program annually. Part D sponsors have some flexibility in their program offerings. In the Part D program, sponsors have flexibility in designing Medication Therapy Management (MTM) programs for targeted beneficiaries with chronic diseases and high drug costs. A new provision adds at-risk enrollees for prescription drug abuse to the MTM program. Additionally, a report on pain management payment methods is required by MedPAC. Section 6082 of the SSA amends Medicare payments to ensure no financial incentives for using opioids over non-opioid alternatives in hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings. Monitoring opioid use through Medicare claims data is recommended for improved understanding. Section 6082 of the SSA requires the Secretary to review Medicare payments to prevent financial incentives for using opioids instead of evidence-based non-opioid alternatives in hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings. This includes revising payments through rulemaking and potentially conducting a demonstration to ensure appropriate payment modifications for pain management services. The Secretary is required to review Medicare payments to prevent incentives for using opioids over non-opioid alternatives in hospital and ambulatory surgery centers. Revisions to payments may be made for services starting January 1, 2020, with a possible demonstration beforehand. Focus will be on outpatient services related to pain management. The Health Resources and Services Administration administers a program that awards grants to support outpatient primary care facilities serving low-income individuals. These facilities may receive Medicare designation as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) if they meet certain requirements. FQHCs are paid on a cost-based prospective payment system, providing higher payment rates than other providers. Additionally, Medicare may designate outpatient primary care facilities in rural and medically underserved areas as Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) to address physician shortages in these areas. Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) aim to address physician shortages in rural areas by providing higher payment rates to facilities serving Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Approximately 4,100 RHCs existed in January 2018. A DATA 2000 waiver is required for prescribing controlled substances, with physicians and practitioners needing to complete training and obtain approval from the DEA. Beginning January 1, 2019, Section 6083 allows the Secretary to pay training costs for FQHC and RHC physicians seeking DATA 2000 waivers for OUD treatment services. FQHCs and RHCs must apply to receive payment, with the Secretary determining payment timing and method. Physicians must be employed by or under contract with the applying facility to qualify for waiver payments. An appropriation of $6 million from the U.S. Treasury is available to compensate FQHCs for obtaining DATA 2000 waivers, with an additional $2 million for RHCs. Medicare Part C (MA) offers alternative benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, including supplemental benefits like hearing, dental, or vision coverage, reduced cost sharing, and lower premiums. Special Needs Plans (SNPs) within MA may restrict enrollment based on specific beneficiary characteristics. Under MA, the Secretary pays private health plans a per-person monthly amount to provide Medicare-covered benefits to beneficiaries who enroll in their plans. A plan's payment is determined by comparing its annual bid to a program benchmark. If a plan's bid is less than the benchmark, the plan's payment equals its bid, plus a rebate that must be returned to enrollees in the form of additional benefits, reduced cost sharing, or reduced Part B or Part D premiums. The rebate amount for Medicare Advantage plans is based on quality ratings, ranging from 50% to 70% of the bid-benchmark difference. Plans with bids equal to or above the benchmark do not receive a rebate, and enrollees pay the excess amount. Payments to plans are risk-adjusted based on enrollees' demographics and health history. Section 6084 mandates a report to Congress on the availability of supplemental benefits for substance use disorders in MA plans. The report on the availability of supplemental benefits for substance use disorders in Medicare Advantage plans must include coverage of MATs for opioid use, SUD counseling, challenges in offering these benefits, impact of increased rebates on benefit availability, and ways to improve coverage. Medicare Part B covers outpatient mental health services and visits with various health professionals. Medicare Part B covers outpatient mental health services, including visits with different health professionals like psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers. Section 6085 requires educating beneficiaries about coverage of clinical psychologist services and exploring ways to prevent unnecessary hospitalizations for mental health issues. The comptroller general is to submit a report to Congress on mental and behavioral health services under Medicare, including an examination of services furnished by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and other professionals. The report will also address ways for Medicare beneficiaries to learn about the availability of Medicare payment for clinical psychologist services and how to improve the provision of such information. Additionally, Section 6086 directs the Secretary to conduct a study on best practices, payment, and coverage of pain management services under Medicare Parts A and B, with a report on options for revising Parts A and B payments to be submitted to relevant committees. The Senate Finance Committee will receive a report on revising Medicare payments to providers and suppliers, including coverage for evidence-based non-opioid treatments for pain management. The report will analyze barriers to accessing these treatments and evaluate services for beneficiaries with psychiatric or substance use disorders. The report will assess barriers to accessing non-opioid treatments for pain management, evaluate Medicare coverage expansion, and consider incorporating VA/DOD pain management guidelines. It will also explore options for improving coverage of non-opioid therapies and FDA-approved medical devices for pain treatment. The report will evaluate strategies to improve treatment for beneficiaries with psychiatric or substance use disorders, at risk of suicide, or with comorbidities requiring specialist consultation. It will focus on educating providers about the risks of co-administering opioids with other drugs, managing transitions between inpatient and outpatient care, and expanding outreach for alternative pain management therapies. Additionally, it will analyze the impact of legislative and administrative options on Medicare expenditures and opioid addiction prevention. The Secretary must consult with various stakeholders for a report on Medicare expenditures and opioid addiction prevention. Section 6092 requires guidance for hospitals on pain management and OUD prevention strategies for Medicare beneficiaries by January 1, 2019. The guidance for Medicare Part A on pain management and OUD prevention strategies for beneficiaries will include best practices for practitioner education, tracking opioid prescribing trends, and informing individuals of risks. It will also involve developing a notification template for individuals prescribed opioids, addressing risks, safe storage, and non-opioid alternatives for pain management. Medicare's shift to value-based purchasing relies on quality measures across diseases, care settings, provider types, and measure types. The Medicare program utilizes quality measures for performance improvement and measurement. Congress enacted SSA Sections 1890 and 1890A to support measure development, endorsement, and selection. The Secretary is required to contract with a consensus-based entity (currently NQF) for these activities, including priority setting, measure maintenance, and annual reporting. Additionally, a pre-rulemaking process is established to select Medicare quality measures each December. The NQF's Measure Applications Partnership (MAP) reviews measures for Medicare quality programs and provides recommendations to the Secretary. A technical expert panel is required to review quality measures related to opioids and OUD. The Secretary periodically reviews all measures in Medicare for maintenance or retirement. Section 6093 mandates a panel to review opioid-related quality measures, identify gaps, and recommend measures for Medicare quality programs. The Secretary is required to consider using these measures and prioritize their development and endorsement by NQF until December 31, 2023. After December 31, 2023, the Secretary may prioritize endorsing measures related to opioid use. Section 6094 mandates the convening of a technical expert panel to recommend ways to reduce opioid use in healthcare settings and establish pain management best practices. Within one year of enactment, the Secretary must submit a report to Congress with the panel's recommendations and an action plan for implementing pain management protocols to limit opioid use in perioperative care and at discharge. Additionally, a report on perioperative opioid use, including high-volume surgery Medicare codes, must be submitted to Congress within one year of enactment. Section 6095 requires the Secretary to post HHS guidance on opioid prescribing within 180 days of enactment, along with recommendations for improving data collection on perioperative opioid use. CMS provides Medicare beneficiary education and outreach through various resources, including a website with information on enrollment, costs, coverage, appeals, and Medicare publications. The guidance issued on January 1, 2016, regarding opioid prescribing for Medicare beneficiaries requires Medicare Part D plans to provide clear information on formulary, drug access, cost-sharing, and drug management programs for individuals at risk of prescription drug abuse. The Secretary will periodically update and revise the guidance in consultation with relevant stakeholders. Section 6102 of the SSA requires Part D plans to provide information on pain treatment, risks of opioid use, and coverage of non-pharmacological therapies. Plans can target specific enrollees for this information. Section 6103 mandates MA plans to include safe disposal information for controlled substances in health risk assessments. The new legislation requires MA plans to include information on safe disposal of prescription drugs in health risk assessments starting January 1, 2021. This includes details on drug takeback programs and in-home disposal. Additionally, Part D plan MTM programs must provide enrollees with information on safe drug disposal methods, including approved takeback programs and cost-effective in-home disposal options. The Hospital IQR and VBP Programs require hospitals to submit quality data for payment adjustments. The HCAHPS survey measures patient satisfaction and is used in both programs. New questions on pain communication were added to the survey in 2018. The HCAHPS survey questions on pain management have been debated for their potential impact on opioid prescribing patterns. Hospital Compare is a public website that provides comparative information about Medicare-certified hospitals. Section 6104 amends SSA Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) to restrict HCAHPS surveys conducted after January 1, 2020, in the Medicare Hospital IQR program. Section 6104 restricts HCAHPS surveys in the Medicare Hospital IQR program conducted after January 1, 2020, from including questions about communication on pain between hospital staff and patients unless they address informing patients about opioid risks and non-opioid alternatives. It also prohibits measures based on 2018 or 2019 HCAHPS survey questions on pain communication from being included in Hospital Compare and the Hospital VBP Program. SSA Section 1128G requires drug, device, biological, or medical supply manufacturers to report payments or transfers of value to physicians or teaching hospitals to promote transparency and prevent inappropriate relationships. Reportable transactions include research, gifts, entertainment, consulting fees, grants, meals, or travel, with certain exemptions. The Open Payments program, established by the Secretary, requires manufacturers to report payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) are used in transactions with Medicare but are not included on the Open Payments website. Section 6111 expands the definition of covered recipients to include various healthcare professionals and requires manufacturers to submit information on payments to them. The amendments also end the exclusion of NPIs of covered recipients on the Open Payments website, effective from January 1, 2022. The exclusion of NPIs from the Open Payments website will only apply to information submitted before January 1, 2022."
