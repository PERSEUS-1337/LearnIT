    "content": "The U.S. EPA released regulations in 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, focusing on carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The Clean Power Plan aims to reduce CO2 emissions from power generation by 32% by 2030, aligning with the Obama Administration's climate change policy. The EPA's Clean Power Plan aims to reduce CO2 emissions from power generation in the US by 32% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Each state has specific CO2 emissions targets based on national performance rates. Mandatory compliance begins in 2022, with final targets set for 2030. The plan is intended to protect human health and the environment by reducing emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. The Clean Power Plan aims to reduce CO2 emissions from power generation in the US by 32% by 2030. Implementation implications include electric power system reliability, customer costs, and potential changes to the utility industry structure. Fossil fuel combustion, especially coal, is the largest source of GHG emissions in the US. Coal is the most used fuel and emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of electric power produced. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that GHG emissions are air pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. EPA declared GHGs a threat to public health in 2009. In 2013, EPA proposed new standards for CO2 emissions from new electric power plants burning fossil fuels. The EPA issued guidelines under CAA Section 111(d) for controlling CO2 emissions from existing power plants burning fossil fuels in October 2015. The Clean Power Plan sets emission performance rates for different types of power plants, with states responsible for creating compliance plans to meet EPA's guidelines. EPA's goal is to reduce pollution by implementing the best system of emission reductions (BSER) for existing sources. EPA established CO2 emissions goals for each state based on performance rates, to be achieved by 2030 through an EPA-approved plan. The Clean Power Plan outlines reduction goals using the best system of emissions reduction, based on three building blocks available to affected power plants. The Clean Power Plan outlines reduction goals for CO2 emissions based on three building blocks: improving heat rate at coal-fired steam EGUs, substituting generation from lower-emitting NGCC units, and increasing renewable energy generation. EPA established national performance rates for affected EGUs to reduce emissions rates. The EPA has established performance rates for CO2 emissions reduction, with specific targets for each state based on their power generation mix. States can choose between rate-based or mass-based goals to meet their compliance targets. EPA believes that the reduction targets can be achieved at a reasonable cost by applying the outlined building blocks to power generation portfolios. States have the option to meet CO2 emission reduction goals through an emissions standard plan or a state measures plan. The emissions standard approach requires affected power plants to meet specific performance rates, while the state measures approach allows for a mix of state-enforceable measures to achieve equivalent emission reductions. If the state measures approach is chosen, a contingent backstop of federally enforceable standards will be included. States can also develop their own plans to reduce CO2 emissions. States can develop their own plans to reduce CO2 emissions, including using an integrated resource plan or joining regional emission trading programs. They must include a timeline and reporting process to meet CO2 emission performance rates by 2030. States can choose between rate-based or mass-based trading, or require power plants to meet specific CO2 emission performance rates. EPA encourages investments in renewable electricity projects and energy efficiency in low-income communities through the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) under the state emission reduction plans. States can award allowances and emissions rate credits to providers making early investments in renewable energy. The Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) offers incentives to providers investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency in low-income communities. States can receive matching allowances or ERCs from the EPA for participating in the program. States must include CEIP participation in their initial CPP compliance submission by September 6, 2016, with the final implementation plan due by September 6, 2018. Compliance with EPA-approved plans begins in 2022. EPA can prescribe an implementation plan for states that do not comply. Electric power generation in the United States varies by region due to local resources and fuel availability. EPA's carbon pollution reduction plan allows states flexibility in compliance, with options beyond CO2 emission rates. EPA chose 2012 as the baseline year for emissions reduction calculations. EPA selected 2012 as the baseline year for emissions reduction calculations, benefiting states with a 15% drop in GHG emissions from EGUs between 2005 and 2012. The Clean Power Plan includes measures for coal plant efficiency improvement, increased use of natural gas, and more renewable energy generation. The agency's approach involves three building blocks for emission reduction and national performance rates for power plants. EPA recognizes the potential for power plant efficiency improvements to reduce CO2 emissions. A conservative estimate suggests a 4.3% improvement in the Eastern Interconnection, 2.1% in the Western Interconnection, and 2.3% in the Texas Interconnection. This can be achieved through best practices and equipment upgrades, leading to reduced carbon emissions. The owner/operator of coal-fired steam EGUs may implement heat rate improvement measures to reduce CO2 emissions per MWh. These low-cost options, such as staff training and equipment upgrades, are expected to be adopted by many coal-fired EGUs by 2030. EPA projects that 99 GW of existing coal steam capacity will improve operating efficiency. By 2030, 99 GW of existing coal steam capacity is projected to improve operating efficiency under the rate-based approach. The NSR program aims to prevent air quality degradation from new or modified facilities with harmful emissions. Efficiency improvements to power plants should not trigger NSR requirements unless they result in increased emissions. Compliance with CPP plans may lead to physical or operational changes in affected EGUs. The EPA expects operational changes to potentially increase emissions and trigger NSR for units dispatched more often. There is a concern for \"rebound effects\" from improved heat rates at EGUs, but combining all three building blocks should address this issue by incentivizing efficiency improvements and reducing generation. The EPA aims to improve steam EGUs' efficiency and reduce generation from them by combining building blocks 1, 2, and 3. This will strengthen incentives to decrease CO2 emissions and offset any increase in emissions from increased generation output. Dispatching higher efficiency power plants will result in less carbon pollution. The EPA plans to reduce carbon pollution by dispatching higher efficiency natural gas combined cycle units. Increasing the utilization rate of existing NGCC plants from 2022 to 2029 is seen as a conservative approach to achieve this goal. The existing natural gas pipeline system is deemed capable of supporting the increased NGCC utilization. The EPA considers increasing utilization of existing NGCC capacity as a cost-effective option compared to converting coal power plants to natural gas. They do not prioritize the construction of new NGCC units due to higher costs. Instead, they prefer the construction and operation of zero-emitting renewable electric generating capacity. Reducing power generation from coal-fired EGUs and replacing it with lower- or zero-emitting EGUs is a way to reduce CO2 emissions. The EPA promotes reducing CO2 emissions by replacing coal-fired EGUs with lower- or zero-emitting EGUs, such as renewable energy technologies. Electric utilities are already planning to deploy significant amounts of renewable energy according to their integrated resource plans. EPA quantified potential renewable energy levels in 2030 across three interconnection regions, modeling increased deployment based on historical trends to replace fossil-fired EGU capacity. EPA projects that implementation of the CPP may result in renewable energy making up 28% of total generating capacity by 2030, representing a small increase from the base case projection of 25%. Additionally, increased renewable capacity is expected to represent 20% of projected total electricity generation in 2030, compared to 18% in the base case. EPA projects that renewable energy may make up 17% of total generation by 2030. The agency believes infrastructure improvements, such as new pipelines and natural gas units, can support renewable growth without large-scale electricity storage. The phase-in period allows for necessary infrastructure upgrades to back up renewable generation. Increased coordination between actions in building block 2 and building block 3 for deploying new renewable capacity is crucial. Storage is helpful but not essential for renewable energy deployment due to various grid flexibility sources. Regional coordination and integration options beyond storage are key for renewable energy integration. EPA anticipates minimal issues in connecting increased renewable electricity into the grid. The EPA acknowledges the need for operational and technical upgrades to integrate non-dispatchable renewable energy into the grid. Grid operators have successfully integrated large amounts of renewable energy without compromising reliability through measures like expanded operational flexibility and coordination with regional markets. Historical investment levels can accommodate the potential range of new transmission construction, and existing transmission resources can be repurposed to minimize incremental grid infrastructure needs. The repurposing of existing transmission resources can minimize needs for new infrastructure to deliver renewable energy. Concerns arise over the impact of retiring coal plants on ancillary services, which ensure reliability and support electricity transmission. Services include load regulation, spinning reserve, non-spinning reserve, replacement reserve, and voltage support. Some renewable energy technologies, like new variable RE generators and modern wind turbine power electronics, can provide electrical grid support services such as voltage and reactive power control. Wind plants exceed conventional power plants in maintaining reliability during system disturbances. Xcel Energy utilizes wind plants for fast response to meet system needs for frequency response and dispatchable resources. Utility-scale PV can also incorporate control systems for grid support. Utility-scale PV can contribute to grid reliability and stability by providing ancillary services such as voltage regulation, active power controls, ramp-rate controls, fault ride through, and frequency control. EPA recognizes the potential of renewable energy and nuclear generating capacity to replace carbon-intensive generation. However, in the final Clean Power Plan (CPP), EPA chose not to include nuclear generation. In the final Clean Power Plan (CPP), EPA chose not to include generation from units under construction in the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER) to reduce CO2 emissions from affected EGUs. EPA also decided not to include a BSER component to preserve existing at-risk nuclear generation. The EPA acknowledges that existing generation helps lower CO2 emissions but will not further reduce them below current levels. Other options like demand-side energy efficiency, new or uprated nuclear generation, and renewable energy can help reduce CO2 emissions from affected EGUs. EPA's Clean Power Plan includes measures such as energy efficiency, new nuclear generation, renewable energy, combined heat and power, and transmission improvements for reducing CO2 emissions from affected EGUs. The plan allows emission reductions from new nuclear units to be used for compliance. EPA promotes emissions trading as a cost-effective compliance option, with mass-based state goals designed to facilitate trading. Emissions trading under EPA's Clean Power Plan allows affected EGUs to buy or sell emission products to reduce emissions and create financial incentives. Affected EGUs can overcomply with their own standards and sell emission credits to others, promoting cross-investment in emission reduction opportunities. EPA's Clean Power Plan supports regional CO2 markets for emission reduction opportunities. The plan includes model rules for states to adopt consistent approaches to emissions trading and tracking emissions to ensure valid reduction strategies. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is the nation's first mandatory cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions from power plants. It was established in 2005 and took effect in 2009. Supporters argue that it offers flexibility and certainty in reducing pollution, while critics have raised concerns about certain program features. The EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) aims to reduce CO2 emissions from the electric power sector by promoting natural gas and renewable energy generation over coal-fired power plants. However, concerns remain about the program's potential impact on electric grid reliability. The EPA's Clean Power Plan includes provisions to ensure electric grid reliability, such as a \"safety valve\" for power plants in emergency situations. A 90-day reprieve from CO2 emission limits is allowed only in emergencies, not severe weather events. A formal memorandum of joint understanding with the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is in place to coordinate efforts during state compliance plan development. The memorandum outlines how agencies will cooperate, monitor, implement, share information, and resolve difficulties during state compliance plan development. The aging transmission system may need modernization to handle increased transmission transactions under the EPA proposal, potentially requiring upgraded facilities and new infrastructure. Increased reliance on renewable energy will likely necessitate new transmission lines. The development of new transmission lines for renewable electricity projects may require 3 to 10 years for regulatory approvals. Planning for additional transmission capacity needs to start soon to meet demands in the early 2020s. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) aims to expedite approval processes for new transmission projects, citing public policy requirements as key drivers. Compliance with FERC's Order No. 1000 is intended to streamline permitting across multiple state jurisdictions. The EPA's CPP proposal focuses on coal-fired power plants, with key considerations being plant efficiency, emissions reduction, and transition to renewable energy. Power plants in RTO regions operate in competitive environments where upgrades may not be cost-effective. State implementation plans for the CPP may result in differing requirements within RTO regions. The EPA's CPP proposal may lead to varying requirements for competitive generators in RTO regions. Capacity markets aimed at encouraging new generation have had mixed results. New power plants are likely to be built in traditionally regulated regions using tools like integrated resource planning. The CPP could increase natural gas consumption through shifts in power generator dispatch and the use of more renewable sources. Building Block 3 of the EPA's CPP proposal aims to increase the use of zero-emitting renewable generation sources, potentially leading to higher natural gas consumption for fast-ramping power plants. Concerns arise regarding deliverability and price volatility, as seen during the Polar Vortex events in January 2014. FERC is working to improve coordination between the electricity and natural gas industries to address these issues. The electric utility industry may need more cost-effective natural gas storage facilities to guarantee power generation if greater natural gas use for power generation is expected. The regulatory regime in place will impact the choices available to natural gas generators for gas storage options. The electric utility industry values fuel diversity to avoid price and supply risks. EPA predicts more coal plant retirements, potential premature closures of nuclear plants, and increased reliance on natural gas for renewable energy integration. This shift raises concerns in the power sector. EPA's CPP aims to address these challenges. The EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) aims to address challenges in the power sector by preserving fuel diversity goals. The Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) presents scenarios for CPP compliance, emphasizing the use of demand-side energy efficiency (DSEE) as a major tool. Compliance is expected without the need for exchanging compliance instruments between states. The EPA expects Demand-Side Energy Efficiency (DSEE) to play a significant role in Clean Power Plan (CPP) compliance strategies, leading to a reduction in electricity demand and potential compliance costs. In EPA's scenarios, total power generation decreases by 5% in 2025 and 8% in 2030 due to DSEE, resulting in a reduced need for power generation infrastructure. By 2030, coal-fired power generation could decline by 23% in the rate-based scenario, while non-hydro renewable electric generation increases by 9%. NGCC increases by 18%, non-hydro renewable electric generation by 9% in 2030. Coal-fired generation projected to decline 22% in EPA's RIA, while existing NGCC generation increases 5%. Non-hydro renewables generation increases 8% in 2030. EPA's RIA estimates 29-38 GW of coal-fired units could potentially retire by 2030. Reduction in energy demand from DSEE will slow new natural gas combined cycle generation installation. Only new non-hydro renewable generation expected to grow. EPA's RIA analyzes implications on electricity prices and rates in mass-based and rate-based scenarios. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 defines economic dispatch as operating generation facilities to produce energy at the lowest cost. EPA's Clean Power Plan emphasizes security constrained economic dispatch for reliable and affordable electricity. Dispatch of renewable generation is prioritized in some markets, but economic dispatch is generally the rule. Intermittent renewables may require higher cost natural gas units to firm up power. Power plants in competitive markets operate under an economic dispatch regime. The EPA's Clean Power Plan proposes an environmental dispatch regime for power plant operation, prioritizing cleaner units based on emissions. This could lead to changes in dispatch order in markets, focusing on environmental considerations over cost. The availability of natural gas has lowered wholesale prices recently. The increased availability of natural gas has led to lower wholesale electricity prices. Concerns arise about potential price increases for consumers if there is a shift to an environmental dispatch regime. The EPA's Clean Power Plan allows states and affected entities to choose strategies to reduce CO2 emissions, including emissions trading as a cost-effective compliance option. The EPA's Clean Power Plan facilitates emissions trading as a compliance strategy. The RIA for the CPP assumes top state achievers' DSEE levels as achievable by other states. States can achieve a 1.0 percent annual electricity demand reduction rate starting in 2020. Leading states have either achieved or established requirements to meet this rate. The EPA's Clean Power Plan sets a 0.2 percent annual improvement in electricity demand reduction rate for each state, starting in 2020 until reaching 1.0 percent. Natural gas consumption is expected to decrease by 1% in 2025 and 2030 under the rate-base scenario, and up to 4.5% under the mass-based scenario by 2030. The decline in electricity demand will lead to lower average electricity bills according to EPA's model. The EPA's Clean Power Plan aims to reduce electricity demand, leading to lower average electricity bills by 2030. The plan predicts a 2.7% bill increase in 2020, followed by decreases of 3.8% in 2025 and 7% in 2030 under the rate-based scenario. In comparison, the mass-based scenario forecasts a 2.4% bill increase in 2020 and decreases of 2.7% in 2025 and 7.7% in 2030. These reductions in electricity bills result from changes in retail rates and lower electricity demand. The EPA's Clean Power Plan aims to reduce electricity demand and lower electricity prices by implementing compliance approaches and demand-side energy efficiency programs. Electricity prices are influenced by various factors such as power generation mix, fuel costs, and infrastructure adequacy. EPA projects a 2% increase in national average retail electricity prices in 2025 and a 0.01% increase in 2030. State decisions on DSEE program design will be crucial for achieving cost reductions. The EPA projects increasing costs for its illustrative DSEE scenario, with annualized costs ranging from $2.1 billion to $2.6 billion in 2020, $16.7 billion to $20.6 billion in 2025, and up to $26.3 billion to $32.5 billion in 2030. These costs are expected to be passed on to electric utility customers through electricity rates. EPA acknowledges the challenge for some states in achieving cost-effective DSEE projects to reduce compliance costs under the Clean Power Plan. The EPA recognizes the importance of measuring and verifying demand-side energy efficiency (DSEE) programs to reduce electricity demand. While the EPA includes DSEE in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the Clean Power Plan (CPP), it does not clarify the costs of the Best System of Emissions Reduction (BSER). DSEE is considered outside the fence line actions, and its inclusion in the RIA aims to show how CPP compliance costs can be managed and minimized by states and electric generating units (EGUs). EPA does not analyze the implications of BSER implementation without DSEE implementation. The EPA projects an increase in renewable electricity under the CPP, with renewables estimated to make up 28% of total generation capacity by 2030. The growth in renewable electric capacity has been driven by state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements, which mandate utilities to procure renewable energy. However, expanding renewable energy may pose a challenge in some states if it leads to increased costs for ratepayers. Some state authorities may need to revisit RPS policies to harmonize with state CPP policies. EPA estimates compliance costs for CPP ranging from $1.4 billion to $8.4 billion annually by 2030. Actual costs will be known after state compliance plans are implemented. EPA focuses on cost questions associated with new renewables deployment. The EPA has focused on cost-effective options for complying with the CPP, considering alternatives like carbon capture and storage, coal to natural gas conversion, and coal gasification as too costly. They also looked into co-firing with natural gas and implementing carbon capture and storage, finding them technically feasible and within cost-effective price ranges. The EPA found cost-effective measures for reducing CO2 emissions from power plants, projecting annual health and climate benefits of $34 billion to $54 billion by 2030. The focus is on addressing climate change and protecting human health by reducing emissions. The EPA's Clean Power Plan aims to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants in the U.S. to protect human health and the environment. While the plan is projected to have economic benefits and reduce emissions significantly, its impact on climate change factors like global temperature and sea-level rise is debated. Implementation issues, such as state-specific compliance plans, may complicate interstate coordination. The EPA's Clean Power Plan aims to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants in the U.S. State-specific compliance plans may complicate interstate coordination for reliability purposes. EGU retirements may affect implementation, as coal power plants provide ancillary services to the grid. Additional retirements of coal-fired capacity may be necessary, with renewable energy technologies filling the gap. EPA recognizes the need for appropriate regulatory measures to support this transition. The retirement of coal-fired capacity may impact reserve margins and reliability during extreme weather. Renewable energy technologies can enhance grid resiliency, but performance challenges exist in sub-optimal weather conditions. Planning for more extreme weather events is crucial for future generation needs. EIA estimates 60 GW of coal capacity will retire by 2020, with most retirements by 2016 coinciding with the enforcement of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The retirement of coal-fired capacity may impact grid reliability during extreme weather, with concerns about meeting power demands in future weather extremes. States and electric utilities may struggle to acquire the levels of renewable electricity needed in EPA's projections, as many renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency resource standards are set to expire. State authorities may need to revisit these standards to align with state CPP plans. Several bills have been introduced in Congress addressing the EPA's Clean Power Plan and GHG restrictions from coal-fired power plants. H.R. 3056, the \"Stop the EPA Act of 2015,\" would require congressional approval of major rules issued by the EPA and lower the economic threshold for a rule to be deemed major. H.R. 2637, the \"Coal Country Protection Act,\" would prevent the EPA from regulating CO2 emissions from new sources. The \"Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015\" (H.R. 2042) would prevent the EPA from regulating CO2 emissions from power plants until certain certifications are met, relieve states from adopting state plans, and shield them from federal plans addressing CO2 emissions. The \"Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015\" requires the governor to notify EPA of adverse effects on electricity ratepayers or system reliability. Deadlines for compliance can be extended after judicial review. The bill passed in the House on June 26, 2015. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce advanced H.J.Res. 72, a resolution of disapproval under the CRA, regarding the EPA's CPP. S. 1324, the \"Affordable Reliable Electricity Now Act of 2015,\" would require the EPA to establish separate standards for GHG emissions from coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants. The standards must be achieved by at least 6 units within each category for a continuous 12-month period. The bill S.J.Res. 24 requires EPA to issue state-specific model plans for CO2 emissions reductions from fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units. States can opt out if implementing the plan would negatively impact electricity ratepayers, reliability, or economic growth. Reported by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on October 29, 2015. The EPA's CPP allows states and affected EGUs flexibility in meeting CO2 emissions reductions. States and utilities using integrated resource planning can continue with this approach. Larger utilities have options within the BSER Building Blocks to comply with the regulations. The EPA's CPP allows flexibility for states and utilities to reduce CO2 emissions. Larger utilities can comply with regulations by using measures to reduce CO2 emission rates. EPA's modeling suggests fuel diversity can be maintained while increasing renewable electricity generation. The regulations may lead to the evolution of the U.S. electric power sector. The EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) aims to transition the U.S. electric power sector towards cleaner energy choices by potentially reducing power generation from coal-fired plants and increasing renewable generation. This shift may lead to retirements of aging coal-fired plants, as newer technologies emerge to lower electricity production costs. EPA's compliance obligations are based on increasing renewable generation as the preferred technology choice. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) focuses on increasing renewable generation over fossil-fueled generation, potentially leading to a grid of distributed generation cells. Implementing compliance plans will involve real costs and hard choices for states and electric utilities. Some may face challenges in meeting CPP goals, impacting reliability. The implications for reliability and financial costs of the Clean Power Plan will become clearer as state compliance plans are filed and implementation plans are known."
