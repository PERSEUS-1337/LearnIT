    "content": "Article I, Section 8, clause 7 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to establish post offices and post roads. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the United States Postal Service as an independent entity in the executive branch, allowing it to operate more like a business. Before this act, the Department of the Post Office handled postal services. Congress applied certain statutes to the Postal Service, such as those related to veterans' preference and retirement, but also prohibited postal employees from striking. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) governs private sector employee-management relations, while the Federal Labor-Management Relations Statute regulates relations in most federal departments and agencies. The U.S. Postal Service has broader employee-management authority under Title 39 of the U.S. Code. Postal Service collective bargaining covers compensation, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment, unlike most federal agencies where it is limited to conditions of employment. The phrase \"conditions of employment\" is defined in 5 U.S.C. Section 7103 to exclude certain policies, practices, and matters related to political activities, position classification, and conditions specifically provided for in federal statute. This exclusion precludes collective bargaining over benefits such as FEGLI and FEHBP. Congress indicated in 39 U.S.C. Section 1005(f) that compensation, fringe benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment transitioned from the Postal Office Department to the U.S. Postal Service. The conditions of employment in effect before July 1, 1971, would continue for Postal Service officers and employees as per Title 39. Any changes to fringe benefits must not make the overall benefits less favorable. Collective bargaining agreements can only be terminated as per procedures outlined in Title 39. Collective bargaining agreements under Title 39 require timely notice for termination or modification. If parties cannot resolve disputes, a mediator may be appointed. An arbitration board can be established in certain circumstances, with its decisions being binding. Congress has the authority to prospectively modify the scope or terms of bargaining agreements. Congress has the authority to modify the scope of bargaining or terms of collective bargaining agreements after they expire. This includes bargaining over compensation, fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment. However, enacting a statute to modify these terms before they expire may raise legal questions, such as potential breaches of contract or exceeding constitutional limits. Some sections of Title III \"Postal Service Workforce\" would directly modify provisions of Title 39 of the U.S. Code related to Postal Service collective bargaining agreements and employee-management relations. Section 301(a) of H.R. 2309 would amend compensation requirements for Postal Service officers and employees to be comparable to the private sector. Section 301 of H.R. 2309 aims to align compensation and benefits for Postal Service officers and employees with those in the private sector, ensuring comparability in pay, health benefits, retirement benefits, life insurance benefits, leave, holidays, and more. The President's Commission Report recommended aligning compensation and benefits for Postal Service officers and employees with the private sector, including pay, health benefits, retirement benefits, life insurance benefits, leave, holidays, and stability of employment. H.R. 2309 proposes amendments to ensure comparability in government contributions for life insurance and health insurance benefit programs. The amendment would affect fiscal years after September 30, 2013, but not until after collective bargaining agreements expire for employees. It addresses the premium costs and government agency contributions for Federal Employees Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) program participants. Postal Service employees currently pay nothing for life insurance premiums, unlike other federal employees who pay over 66%. The Postal Service covers 100% of these premiums. The Postal Service covers 100% of life insurance premiums for employees, while bargaining agreements result in the Postal Service paying an average of 79% of health insurance premiums. This is higher than the 72% government contribution rate for most federal employees in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. H.R. 2309 aims to repeal a provision that limits the Postal Service's ability to modify fringe benefits for officers and employees. The provision states that any changes to fringe benefits must not result in a less favorable program than what was in effect before July 1, 1971. The provision in H.R. 2309 aims to allow the Postal Service to modify fringe benefits for officers and employees without needing agreement from collective bargaining representatives. This change could result in less favorable benefits than those in effect before July 1, 1971. Amendments to 39 U.S.C. Section 1206 proposed in H.R. 2309 would impact collective bargaining agreements between the Postal Service and bargaining representatives. The amendments would prohibit provisions that restrict reduction-in-force procedures under Title 5 of the United States Code for agreements ratified after the enactment of the new subsections. Agreements ratified before the enactment date would require renegotiation of any provisions limiting the application of Title 5 reduction-in-force procedures. Additionally, if a post-enactment agreement includes alternative reduction-in-force procedures, the Postal Service may choose to apply them instead of those in Title 5. The Postal Service may apply alternative procedures instead of Title 5 procedures for bargaining unit members. Section 304 prohibits no-layoff clauses in future collective bargaining agreements and requires renegotiation of existing agreements with such clauses. Protection from layoffs has been common in agreements since 1978, covering around 89% of Postal Service union employees as of 2003. The House committee report highlights that Postal Service union employees have unique protections from reduction-in-force procedures compared to other federal workers. The report emphasizes the need for alternative methods for workforce reductions, allowing unions to negotiate rightsizing measures such as retirement. This alternative authority was granted to address the Postal Service's inability to achieve reductions through attrition alone. Section 305 of H.R. 2309 allows postal unions to negotiate alternative reduction-in-force methods like retirement conversion. It proposes changes to labor dispute resolution procedures, including the selection of neutral arbitrators and imposing time limits on mediation and arbitration. The amendment aims to streamline the process and specify factors for arbitration boards to consider. The amendment in Section 305 of H.R. 2309 proposes changes to labor dispute resolution procedures, including the selection of neutral arbitrators. Currently, the Postal Service and the collective bargaining representative of employees each select one board member, with a third member chosen by the two selected members. The proposed amendment would require parties to select an arbitrator from a list. The proposed amendment in Section 305 of H.R. 2309 would change labor dispute resolution procedures by requiring parties to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the Director. This amendment would also make the mediator selected by the Director the third arbitration board member, instead of the parties jointly selecting the third member. The President's Commission Report highlighted the benefits of having the mediator on the arbitration board to maintain progress made during negotiation and mediation phases. The proposed amendment in Section 305 of H.R. 2309 would change labor dispute resolution procedures by requiring parties to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the Director. An arbitration board would be required to give the parties a full and fair hearing within 40 days. Each party would present two offer packages after the hearing, and the board would select one as its tentative award based on certain criteria. The proposed amendment in Section 305 of H.R. 2309 would change labor dispute resolution procedures by requiring parties to select an arbitrator from a list provided by the Director. An arbitration board would be required to give the parties a full and fair hearing within 40 days. The board would select a tentative award based on certain criteria, taking into account the financial condition of the Postal Service. If no agreement on a substitute award is reached within 10 days, the tentative award would stand. The tentative award must become final within 10 days. If no final offer package is submitted after a hearing, the arbitration board must issue a final award within 20 days. The final award or agreement is binding. Costs are shared by the Postal Service and the bargaining representative. Section 1207(d) of Title 39 would be amended to appoint a mediator if no agreement is reached within 90 days. The collective bargaining process includes appointing a mediator if parties fail to reach an agreement within 180 days. An arbitration board of three neutral individuals is created to provide conclusive and binding arbitration. The arbitration award must consider pay comparability with the private sector and the financial condition of the Postal Service. Any agreement reached independently of the arbitration panel must also meet these criteria. The mediation-arbitration process for collective bargaining in the Postal Service is based on recommendations from the 2003 President's Commission. Section 202 of H.R. 2309 establishes the Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority to take over the responsibilities of the Postal Service Board of Governors during a \"control period.\" The Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority would be a receiver-like body of five non-salaried members appointed by the President from recommendations made by congressional leaders. It is based on the successful D.C. Control Board model from the 1990s to address financial mismanagement. The Authority would operate in an advisory capacity during the first control period and fully take over if the Postal Service's annual deficit exceeds $2 billion in subsequent years. The Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, based on the D.C. Control Board model, would be fully in force during a control period. It would direct the Postal Service's powers, including human resource strategies and collective bargaining agreements. The Authority would review proposals from the Postmaster General that have a substantial effect on these areas. The Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority would review proposals from the Postmaster General that impact human resource strategies and collective bargaining agreements. If a proposal is consistent with the financial plan and budget, it would be approved. If significantly inconsistent, the Authority must notify the Postmaster General with recommendations for modification. Failure to notify within a set time would be deemed approval. The Authority would have the power to review and approve all contracts, including labor contracts, during a control period. The Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority would review contracts, including collective bargaining agreements, to ensure consistency with the financial plan and budget. If a contract is deemed inconsistent, the Authority would have the power to revise it. The Authority and its members would not be liable for any claims resulting from actions taken to carry out Title II of H.R. 2309. The Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, established under Title II of H.R. 2309, ensures that rightsizing efforts within the Postal Service result in full pensions and compensation for employees. The Authority can enforce its responsibilities and discipline non-compliant officers or employees. The Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, established under Title II of H.R. 2309, can enforce disciplinary actions, including suspension or removal from office, for noncompliant officers or employees regarding financial stability. The Authority can implement rejected recommendations to ensure full pensions and compensation for Postal Service employees. The Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, established under Title II of H.R. 2309, can enforce disciplinary actions for noncompliant officers or employees regarding financial stability. Section 213(a) of H.R. 2309 authorizes judicial review of Authority orders or decisions within 30 days. The bill allows for Supreme Court review of a D.C. Circuit decision within 10 days. No court order granting relief against the Authority can take effect during pending court actions or appeals. The U.S. Court of Appeals and Supreme Court must expedite matters brought by affected individuals. The Senate passed S. 1789. The Senate passed S. 1789 on April 25, 2012, by a vote of 62 to 37, including Section 106 on arbitration proceedings to resolve labor disputes in the Postal Service. The arbitration board must consider factors like the Postal Service's financial condition when making decisions. The language in this section is similar to that in Section 105 of S. 1789 reported by the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The Senate passed S. 1789 on April 25, 2012, including Section 106 on arbitration proceedings for labor disputes in the Postal Service. The report highlighted the importance of considering the Postal Service's financial condition in arbitration decisions, with some postal union presidents opposing this amendment. The Committee aimed to include a balanced provision in S. 1789, emphasizing that arbitrators should not solely focus on the Postal Service's financial condition. Senate, Section 104, allows the Postal Service to establish its own Health Benefits Program through joint collective bargaining agreements, with no arbitration for disputes. An amendment to prohibit the Postal Service from entering into any collective bargaining agreements was rejected during the consideration of S. 1789. The Postal Service was created as an instrumentality in the executive branch of the federal government in 1970. Changes to collective bargaining were proposed in H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 by Congress. The Postal Service was granted broader authority to bargain collectively over compensation, benefits, and other conditions of employment under the National Labor Relations Act. The Postal Service Reform Act of 2011 would modify provisions regarding collective bargaining and employee-management relations to broaden pay comparability measures between Postal Service officers and private sector employees. The Postal Service Reform Act of 2011 aims to enhance pay comparability between Postal Service officers and private sector employees, reduce agency share for employee benefits, prohibit no-layoff clauses in collective bargaining agreements, and establish a Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority. The Postal Service Reform Act of 2011 establishes a Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority to assume control during default periods, with advisory powers initially and full authority after two years if deficits exceed $2 billion. The Authority can approve human resources and collective bargaining strategies, and the Postmaster General cannot enter contracts without Authority approval. The Postal Service Reform Act of 2011 establishes a Postal Service Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority to assume control during default periods, with advisory powers initially and full authority after two years if deficits exceed $2 billion. The Authority can approve human resources and collective bargaining strategies, and the Postmaster General cannot enter contracts without Authority approval. The Authority could revise a contract, including a collective bargaining agreement, if it is inconsistent with the financial plan and budget for the fiscal year. S. 1789, the 21st Century Post Office Act of 2012, would amend 39 U.S.C. Section 1207(c) to require an arbitration board to consider the financial condition of the Postal Service when issuing a final decision. The Senate rejected an amendment to eliminate Postal Service collective bargaining during floor consideration of S. 1789, with a vote of 23 to 76."
