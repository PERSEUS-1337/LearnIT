    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 4.5 of Division 7 of the Food and Agricultural Code addresses the use of antimicrobial drugs in livestock. Definitions for \"medically important antimicrobial drug\" and \"livestock\" are provided, and the term \"veterinary feed directive\" is defined. Beginning January 1, 2018, a medically important antimicrobial drug can only be administered to livestock with a prescription from a licensed veterinarian. The drug can be used to treat diseases, control infections, for surgery, or as prophylaxis based on the veterinarian's professional judgment. Beginning January 1, 2018, a medically important antimicrobial drug can only be administered to livestock with a prescription from a licensed veterinarian. The drug can be used for treatment, infection control, surgery, or prophylaxis based on professional judgment. Additionally, the administration of these drugs for weight gain or feed efficiency promotion is prohibited, and regular patterns of administration must align with regulations. Retailers can sell these drugs with a prescription or veterinary feed directive from a licensed veterinarian. The department, in consultation with relevant entities, shall develop guidelines for the proper use of antimicrobial drugs for disease treatment, control, and prevention, including alternatives like vaccines and good hygiene practices. Regulations may be implemented to support this section. The department will consult with stakeholders to ensure timely livestock treatment in rural areas with limited veterinary care. Antimicrobial stewardship involves using necessary drugs appropriately and for the shortest duration possible. The Legislature intends for the department to coordinate with federal agencies to implement expanded antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts. This will help understand the links between antimicrobial use in livestock and the development of resistant bacterial infections. The department will gather data on antimicrobial drug sales, resistant bacteria, and livestock practices, coordinating with federal agencies to avoid duplication. Samples will be collected from California's major livestock segments, regions with significant livestock production, and representative segments of the food production chain. The department will work with participants to gather samples and consult stakeholders on monitoring efforts. A report on outreach activities and monitoring results will be submitted to the Legislature by January 1, 2019. This subdivision will be inoperative on January 1, 2023. The department will seek funds and may create regulations to implement this section. They have the authority to request veterinary feed directives to enforce the provisions of this chapter. \"Information provided under this chapter and Section 14902.5 may be kept confidential and only shared with the department or Veterinary Medical Board for enforcing the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act. Data can be shared with federal agencies under the federal Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002.\" A person violating this chapter may face a civil penalty of up to $250 per day. For subsequent violations, the penalty increases to $500 per day, along with mandatory attendance at an educational program on antimicrobial drug use approved by the secretary. Successful completion of the program must be proven within 90 days of the violation. Licensed veterinarians are exempt from certain provisions. Violations of the Veterinary Medicine Practice Act may result in disciplinary actions. Collected funds go to the Department of Food and Agriculture Fund for legislative appropriation. The Legislature adds Section 14407 to the Food and Agricultural Code, limiting public access to meetings and writings for confidentiality and regulatory integrity purposes."
