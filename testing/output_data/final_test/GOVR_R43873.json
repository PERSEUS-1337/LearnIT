    "content": "The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit for low-wage workers, especially those with children, who do not owe taxes. The credit amount is based on factors like income and family size. However, the complex rules of the EITC lead to high error rates in payments, with up to 25.8% issued incorrectly in fiscal year 2017. The 2014 IRS study found that 21.9% to 25.8% of EITC payments, totaling $14.9 billion to $17.6 billion, were issued improperly. Taxpayers often overclaim the EITC and are ineligible for the credit. The IRS faces challenges in ensuring compliance with EITC parameters due to budget constraints. The report compares two measures of EITC noncompliance: improper payments and overclaims. Factors leading to noncompliance include claiming ineligible children, income reporting errors, and filing status errors. The role of paid preparers in noncompliance is also discussed. The report does not provide a detailed overview of the credit. The EITC noncompliance measures, improper payments and overclaims, differ in that improper payments are annual fiscal year amounts erroneously claimed and not recovered by the IRS, while overclaims are the credit claimed incorrectly without considering enforcement activities. Improper payments are smaller than overclaims as they net out recovered amounts, and overclaims are reported less frequently. The IRS estimates that in FY2017, between $14.9 and $17.6 billion in EITC payments were issued improperly, making it a \"high-error program\" compared to other spending programs. Comparisons of improper payments between tax benefits and traditional spending programs may require considering the comparative rates. The federal government incurs administrative expenses to administer tax laws and other programs. These expenses include processing tax returns, auditing, and collecting unpaid taxes. Comparing the costs of administering tax benefits and spending programs is essential to evaluate improper payments. Spending programs may have lower improper payment rates due to high administrative costs for screenings. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has minimal administrative costs compared to other benefit programs, with current administration costs less than 1% of benefits delivered. This is in contrast to non-tax benefit programs where administrative costs for determining eligibility can be as high as 20% of program expenditures. Comparing EITC's improper payments to other spending programs and revenue losses from taxpayer noncompliance with tax code provisions shows that EITC errors are not a major source of revenue loss. The IRS report on the tax gap estimated a gross tax gap of $458 billion annually, with a net tax gap of $406 billion. The majority of the net tax gap, $291 billion, is attributed to individual income tax noncompliance, particularly underreporting of business income and self-employment tax. EITC errors are not a significant contributor to revenue losses compared to other sources of taxpayer noncompliance. In 2015, the IRS found that EITC overclaims make up 6% of individual income tax noncompliance, while underreported business income by individuals accounts for 51.9%. A study on EITC compliance in 2006-2008 revealed that most overclaims were made by ineligible filers, citing reasons such as claiming ineligible children and misreporting income. The 2006-2008 EITC Compliance Study identified common errors in EITC claims, including misreporting income and using incorrect filing status. Overclaims were mainly due to incorrectly claiming a child for the credit. Unenrolled tax preparers were found to be the most common preparers of EITC returns and were prone to errors. Total overclaims during the study period were estimated to be around $14.0 billion. The 2006-2008 EITC Compliance Study estimated overclaims to be between $14.0 billion and $19.3 billion. The IRS examines a small sample of tax returns each year, including EITC claims, to verify compliance with tax laws. In FY2017, over one million tax returns were examined, with 36.0% including an EITC claim. $2.0 billion of additional tax owed came from returns with an EITC claim. The IRS does not disclose how it detects errors or flags questionable returns. The IRS does not disclose how it detects errors or flags questionable tax returns to prevent circumvention. Public documents evaluating IRS error detection procedures provide an overview of ways errors can be detected before issuing refunds. Challenges in detecting and reducing specific errors are analyzed, highlighting prevention of overclaims and limitations in administering the EITC. The IRS can penalize taxpayers who improperly claim the EITC and disallow future claims. If the IRS denies a taxpayer's EITC, they must repay the amount with interest and may face penalties. Tax return preparers who falsely claim the credit may also be penalized. To be a qualifying child for EITC, the child must meet specific requirements. To qualify as a \"qualifying child\" for the EITC, the child must have a specific relationship to the tax filer and share a residence with them for more than half the year in the United States. The child must also meet age requirements, be under 19 (or 24 if a full-time student), or permanently and totally disabled. Failure to meet these requirements can result in an EITC overclaim and significant penalties. The 2006-2008 EITC Compliance Study found that errors in claiming the qualifying child were the largest source of EITC overclaims, accounting for 38% of overclaim dollars. On average, these errors amounted to $2,384 per return. Qualifying children errors were the second most common error, found on 21% of returns with an EITC overclaim. The 2006-2008 EITC Compliance Study revealed that although qualifying children errors were the largest EITC error in dollar terms, the majority of children claimed for the EITC are done so correctly. 87% of children were claimed correctly, with the most common error being the failure to meet the residency requirement. Tax filers may mistakenly claim the EITC if they assume that having a child automatically qualifies them for the credit. Among children claimed in error, 76% were due to the child not meeting the residency requirement. The second most common qualifying child error for the EITC is the failure of the child to meet the relationship test. The IRS may struggle to verify if the child meets the EITC requirements, leading to errors in claiming the credit. The IRS can use the Federal Case Registry of child support orders to check if the child is living with the claimant and deny the credit if the claimant is ineligible. The IRS can use the Federal Case Registry of child support orders to verify if the child meets the EITC requirements during the filing season and deny the credit if the claimant is deemed ineligible. This process stops the refund money before issuance, based on the assumption that the child support payee generally has physical custody of the child. However, the IRS currently does not use this registry during the filing season to deny claims before issuing refunds. The IRS found that the Federal Case Registry (FCR) had a high rate of \"false positives\" in identifying children who did not meet the EITC residency requirement, leading to inaccurate denial of EITC claims. The FCR includes information on children, custodial parents, and non-custodial parents, which can result in misclassifying a child's residency status. The Federal Case Registry (FCR) may incorrectly deny EITC claims if the custodial parent is assumed to be the mother. A change in custody without court notification could lead to the father being eligible to claim the EITC for the child. The Taxpayer Advocate warns against using FCR data alone to deny EITC claims, as it may not accurately reflect the current situation. The IRS has databases to verify EITC residency requirements, including DM-1, Kidlink, and Numident. Currently, the IRS may not cross-reference all EITC returns with these databases during the filing season due to limitations in accurately documenting information. The IRS uses databases like DM-1, Kidlink, and Numident to verify EITC residency requirements. However, during the filing season, these databases may not be cross-referenced with all EITC returns due to limitations in accurately documenting information. The IRS may flag returns for possible audits if there is a high probability of error in claiming a qualifying child for the credit. Refunds that have already been released are harder to recover. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) amount varies based on income, with distinct ranges for different earnings levels. For example, for an unmarried taxpayer with one child in 2018, the EITC gradually increases with earnings up to $10,180, then remains constant at its maximum level before gradually declining. This structure makes it harder to recover refunds that have already been released compared to those denied during filing season. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has specific income thresholds that determine the amount of credit a taxpayer can receive. The EITC increases with earnings up to $10,180, then remains constant at $3,461 until earnings exceed $18,660. After this point, the credit is gradually reduced for every additional dollar earned. The EITC is reduced by 15.98% over the phase-out threshold. Income misreporting is a common error, with overreporting or underreporting affecting the credit amount. Majority of EITC claimants fall within the phase-out range, where underreporting income can result in a larger credit. The 2006-2008 EITC Compliance Study found that income reporting errors were a significant source of EITC overclaims, accounting for 35% of total overclaimed amount. The most common error was incorrectly reporting earned income, primarily from self-employment. On average, these errors resulted in $807 per return in overclaimed credit. The 2006-2008 EITC Compliance Study identified income reporting errors as a major cause of EITC overclaims, with self-employment income misreporting accounting for the majority of overclaimed amount. Most EITC recipients have wage income only, while a minority with self-employment income contribute to the majority of income reporting errors. Comparing income reported on tax filings could help address these errors in EITC administration. Observers suggest that the IRS can compare income reported on tax returns to third-party forms. Self-employed individuals may have incomplete information as their compensation on Form 1099 does not necessarily represent self-employment income. Taxpayers can deduct business expenses from their compensation to determine self-employment income, but the IRS does not receive verification of these expenses. Wage income is directly reported on Form W-2, reducing overclaims due to reporting errors. The IRS faces challenges in detecting wage income reporting errors, with a time gap between processing tax returns and receiving third-party income data. The PATH Act required the IRS to hold refunds until February 15 for EITC claims, coupled with employer reporting requirements. The IRS was required by the PATH Act to delay refunds for EITC claims until February 15 and enforce earlier reporting of W-2s and 1099-MISCs to prevent identity theft and refund fraud. This change started in 2017 and aims to reduce erroneous EITC payments. Taxpayers can claim the EITC under specific filing statuses, and the value varies based on filing status. The EITC may result in a marriage penalty for certain tax filers, where married couples receive a smaller credit than two unmarried individuals. This penalty can lead to a significant difference in the total EITC amount received. The IRS highlights that EITC filing status errors often occur when married couples incorrectly file as unmarried tax filers, leading to significant overclaims of $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion. Using the correct filing status could reduce EITC amounts or make taxpayers ineligible for the credit. The IRS notes that EITC filing status errors, such as married couples incorrectly filing as unmarried, can lead to overclaims of $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion, making taxpayers ineligible for the credit. The IRS does not request third-party documentation for marital status verification during tax filing, relying instead on data from the Social Security Administration to flag questionable returns. The lack of public information on how the IRS detects filing status errors is a concern. The IRS notes that EITC filing status errors can lead to overclaims, making taxpayers ineligible for the credit. Reasons for using paid tax preparers include the belief in larger refunds, faster refunds, language barriers, and reduced audit risk. However, using a paid preparer does not guarantee an accurate return as preparers vary in training and experience. Data from the 2006-2008 EITC Compliance Study show overclaims among different types of paid preparers. Among EITC claimants, those using paid preparers were more likely to use unenrolled agents or national tax preparation companies. Unenrolled preparers had a higher frequency of overclaims compared to attorneys, CPAs, and enrolled agents. IRS volunteer tax preparation services had the lowest frequency of overclaims. EITC returns prepared by unenrolled agents accounted for the highest percentage of overclaim dollars. The IRS estimates that a significant amount of Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) claims prepared by unenrolled agents and national tax preparation firms were overclaimed, ranging from 20% to 40%. Additionally, IRS volunteer services processed EITC claims with 11% to 13% being overclaimed. A 2008 Taxpayer Advocate study identified three groups of taxpayers and tax preparers based on their intentions regarding fraud and liabilities. The dynamic relationship between taxpayers and paid preparers is crucial. Compliant preparers may avoid assisting those seeking to claim the EITC incorrectly, while noncompliant taxpayers may seek out noncompliant preparers. The IRS notes that error rates among preparers may be influenced by selection bias, with more research needed to determine the ability and integrity of unenrolled preparers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found in a 2014 study that most paid tax preparers made mistakes in preparing tax returns, leading to incorrect refund amounts. Errors included incorrect advice on reporting income and eligibility for tax credits, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). In some cases, preparers claimed ineligible dependents or failed to report all income, resulting in overstated refunds. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that paid tax preparers made errors in tax returns, leading to overstated refunds. Errors included underreporting income and claiming ineligible dependents, with refunds ranging from $654 to $3,718. To improve services, paid tax preparers must follow due diligence requirements, including completing Form 8867 and an EITC worksheet. They must also ensure the accuracy of taxpayer information by asking follow-up questions and requesting additional documentation. Paid preparers must follow due diligence requirements, including completing Form 8867 and an EITC worksheet, and ensuring accuracy by asking follow-up questions and requesting documentation. Failure to meet these requirements can result in penalties. Additionally, preparers must obtain a Preparer Taxpayer Identification Number (PTIN) to help the IRS identify errors or overclaims. Some advocates call for more federal regulation of paid preparers. The IRS has implemented new testing and education requirements for certain preparers. The IRS implemented new testing and education requirements for certain preparers, subject to IRS oversight. A Treasury Inspector General Report highlighted the importance of regulating unregulated preparers to reduce EITC improper payments. However, the IRS was prevented from enforcing these requirements due to a court ruling in Loving v. IRS. The IRS now offers a voluntary education and testing program for unregulated preparers, but the Taxpayer Advocate suggests enacting a regulatory regime for all preparers to demonstrate competency through testing and continuing education. In the past, Congress introduced legislation to regulate paid tax preparers, but no new legislation has been introduced in the current Congress. The IRS Commissioner has requested legal authority to regulate unregulated tax preparers. President Trump proposed increased oversight of paid tax preparers to prevent exploitation of the system and vulnerable taxpayers. The recent EITC compliance study identified common errors in claiming the credit, with income misreporting being the most frequent mistake. The study did not specify the proportion of errors due to confusion or intentional fraud. Simplifying eligibility rules and enhancing taxpayer education could help reduce errors, especially for EITC claimants. Increasing enforcement activities and auditing could be the best policy response for errors resulting from fraudulent claims of the EITC. The IRS may lack sufficient information to verify qualifying child eligibility and self-employment income, highlighting a broader issue with administering complex provisions like the EITC. Budgetary constraints may also hinder enforcement activities. The IRS's budget constraints may hinder enforcement activities for the EITC and other child-related tax benefits. Legislative options to improve administration include simplifying tax provisions and eligibility requirements. Congress could consider making the EITC solely based on earnings and simplifying eligibility for all child-related tax benefits. The IRS's administration of the EITC has shifted its role to also being a benefit administrator, with minimal pre-filing eligibility verification leading to potential errors in claiming the credit. This approach differs from other agencies that verify eligibility before benefits are paid out. Improper payments of refundable tax credits may increase with the rise in the number of credits administered by the IRS. Congress may need to reconsider providing social benefits through refundable credits due to high EITC improper payments. The IRS's mission could be expanded to include social benefit administration. Without changes, improper payments of refundable credits could remain a significant issue. The report discusses EITC noncompliance, focusing on improper payments and overclaims. Improper payments are erroneously claimed amounts not recovered by the IRS, while overclaims are incorrectly claimed amounts on tax returns. Overclaims are reported less frequently than improper payments. Studies in 1999 and 2014 examined EITC overclaims. The report discusses EITC noncompliance, focusing on improper payments and overclaims. Improper payments are erroneously claimed amounts not recovered by the IRS, while overclaims are incorrectly claimed amounts on tax returns. An estimated improper payment rate is used to determine the dollar amount of improper payments in a given fiscal year, based on a sample of older tax data. An EITC overclaim is the difference between the amount claimed by the taxpayer and the correct amount. The IRS examines tax returns with EITC overclaims to understand why some filers claim the credit incorrectly. This approach ensures accurate estimates of factors leading to incorrect EITC claims, unlike examining returns with improper payments. Excluding overclaims that were never paid or recovered could result in inaccurate estimates. Before FY2013, the EITC improper payment rate was calculated by subtracting recovered overclaim dollars from total overclaims dollars. The IRS calculates improper payments by adding underpayments to overclaims. Under the new calculation, underpayments and overclaims are combined, with recovered overclaims subtracted. This adjustment has a minimal impact on the improper payment rate. The cost of EITC errors to the Treasury includes overpayments net of any underclaims or offsetting errors. The IRS calculates improper payments by combining underpayments and overclaims, with recovered overclaims subtracted. Underclaims and offsetting errors are also considered, which may or may not result in a loss to the government. For example, if tax filers overclaimed $10 billion of the EITC but $2 billion was never claimed by eligible claimants, the net amount paid in error would be $8 billion. The IRS estimates that 21% of eligible EITC claimants do not claim the credit, resulting in an unknown amount of underclaimed EITC dollars. The improper payment amount of the EITC errors to the Treasury may be overstated or accurate depending on the ratio of underclaims to overclaims. Currently, there are no publicly available estimates of underclaims and offsetting errors."
