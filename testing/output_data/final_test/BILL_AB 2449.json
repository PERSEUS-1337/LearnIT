    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that bail agents, bail permittees, and bail solicitors in California pay different fees for licensing and renewals as defined in the Insurance Code. Section 12978 allows for fee adjustments to ensure sufficient funds for the Department of Insurance's workload. In the past five years, bail complaints received by the department have increased, despite bail products being less than 2 percent of the insurance market. Limited resources hinder a comprehensive bail enforcement program, requiring additional resources for prevention, investigation, and prosecution of illegal bail schemes. Increased outreach and education on bail laws in California are also needed. Legislation is needed to provide resources for the department to address the bail complaint backlog and investigate illegal bail practices. This includes adjusting licensing fees for bail professionals and creating a Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund. Effective bail enforcement benefits both consumers and the bail industry by protecting consumers from predatory tactics and improving customer confidence. The legislation aims to reduce business costs for the bail industry and ensure fair competition. Fees for bail licenses are specified, ranging from $118 to $236 per year. The fees for filing applications and renewals in the bail industry range from $24 to $340 per year, depending on the type of application. The fees for filing applications and renewals in the bail industry range from $6 to $1,132 per year, depending on the type of application. The Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund is created within the Insurance Fund, funded by a fee per bail bond transaction not exceeding $10. The fund is used to regulate entities involved in bail undertakings, with distribution controlled by the commissioner upon legislative appropriation. Seventy percent of funds from the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund are allocated for consumer enforcement and protection related to bail transactions. This includes investigating unlawful conduct by bail licensees, responding to consumer inquiries and complaints, regulating bail bond products, and covering the cost of fiscal audits. The Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund allocates 30% of funds to county and city attorneys for investigating and prosecuting cases of surety insurer and bail abuse involving licensees. The commissioner distributes funds based on specific criteria for likely positive outcomes benefiting consumers in the local jurisdiction. Applicants must outline the proposed use of funds and anticipated outcomes. Each district attorney and city attorney receiving funds must provide a detailed budget, prior case/project list, and final accounting. Interim accountings are required for cases/projects lasting over six months. Each district attorney and city attorney receiving funds must submit a final report to the commissioner on the success of cases or projects, including information on active investigations, arrests, indictments, and convictions. The applications, distribution of funds, and annual reports are public documents. Information on criminal investigations is confidential. The commissioner may conduct a fiscal audit of the programs. If a district attorney or city attorney is unable or unwilling to investigate or prosecute a bail abuse case, the commissioner can stop funding for that case and redistribute the funds. If the Bail Investigation and Prosecution Fund exceeds $8 million by June 30, the commissioner will reduce the assessment for the following year. Surety insurers must pay invoices for the fund, and any remaining balance at the end of the fiscal year will be carried over to the next year. The commissioner may issue guidelines and regulations for implementing provisions related to bail bond transactions. An annual report on the department's website will include information on consumer complaints, investigations, and regulatory cases regarding bail and bail bond transactions. The number of administrative or regulatory enforcement actions related to bail and bail bond transactions is not a crime. Section 1824 of the Insurance Code limits public access to information submitted to the Insurance Commissioner for criminal investigations."
