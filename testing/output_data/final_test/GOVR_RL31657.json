    "content": "In the 110th Congress, there is a renewed push to expand federal mental health parity law. Legislation introduced in the House (H.R. 1424) and Senate (S. 558) have passed in their respective chambers. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that both bills would increase health insurance premiums by 0.4%. President Bush urged Congress to enact legislation providing full parity in health insurance coverage for mental and physical illnesses. Private health insurers historically imposed unfair treatment limitations on mental health benefits, providing less coverage compared to other medical conditions. This included lower annual or lifetime dollar limits, limited treatment options, and increased cost sharing. The New Freedom Commission endorsed mental health parity, calling for federal legislation to ensure equal insurance coverage for mental and physical health care. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) established federal standards for mental health coverage by group health plans, but it does not require full-parity coverage. Plans must have the same dollar limits for mental and physical illnesses, but can still impose restrictions on mental health benefits. Legislation for full-parity coverage was introduced but did not pass. In the 108th and 109th Congress, legislation for full-parity mental health coverage was introduced but did not pass. Patient advocacy groups argue against discrimination in mental health coverage. The 1999 Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health highlighted that mental illnesses are biologically based disorders with effective treatments available. Proponents of mental health parity emphasize the high costs of untreated mental illness, estimated at $85 billion in direct treatment costs in 2001. Employer and health insurance associations oppose mental health parity legislation due to concerns about cost increases, but supporters argue that studies show full parity can be implemented without substantial cost hikes. Twenty-eight states have laws mandating full-parity mental health coverage, while others require certain mental health benefits. Employers with self-insured plans are not bound by state regulations. Persistent limitations on mental health coverage in conventional health plans are explained by economic forces. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations on mental health coverage in fee-for-service health plans and the feasibility of parity under managed care. It reviews state mental health parity legislation and compares Senate and House versions of full-parity legislation. The report concludes with a discussion on key issues in the ongoing congressional debate on mental health parity. The curr_chunk provides a comparison of key provisions in S. 558 and H.R. 1424, along with summaries of state mental health parity laws and mental health parity hearings. It also includes information on patient advocacy groups and professional associations involved in mental health parity. The evolution of the mental health system from state-run institutions to outpatient and community-based care is discussed, highlighting the shift towards a combination of private and public insurance coverage. Private insurance coverage for mental health care no longer includes nonmedical services like accommodation and employment provided by state institutions. Mental health coverage is more restrictive and costly compared to physical illnesses and surgery due to insurers' concerns about high and unpredictable costs. The lack of parity in insurance coverage is also influenced by the difficulty in defining mental disorders and the expensive and often ineffective nature of treatments like long-term psychotherapy and hospital stays. Economic factors, in addition to stigma, contribute to the disparities in insurance coverage for mental illnesses compared to other medical conditions. Studies of indemnity insurance have shown that the moral hazard problem is more significant for mental health care than general medical care, leading insurers to impose higher cost sharing and restrict coverage to avoid adverse selection. Adverse selection in mental health care leads to health plans reducing coverage to avoid enrolling high-risk individuals, despite being inefficient for the overall health insurance system. Competition among indemnity insurance plans contributes to lower levels of coverage for mental health care. The movement for insurers to cover minimum levels of mental health care, known as parity, aims to improve insurance market efficiency by reducing wasteful competition due to adverse selection. Supporters argue that requiring parity establishes a uniform floor of mental health coverage across all plans without significantly increasing costs. Studies show that about 15% of the adult U.S. population, approximately 30 million individuals, are affected by a clinically significant mental disorder in any given year. Effective treatments exist for many psychiatric conditions, with medication and psychotherapy often proving as effective as treatments for physical illnesses. Untreated mental illness impacts the economy, costing employers billions in lost productivity. Health plans often subcontract mental health management to managed behavioral health care organizations, centralizing the delivery and payment of mental health care. Managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs) are changing the delivery and payment of mental health care by influencing treatment decisions through various techniques, including financial incentives. SAMHSA's report explores the design and administration of mental health coverage, emphasizing the necessary components of an adequate mental health benefit package. This includes examining evidence-based benefits, cost-effectiveness, and the impact of benefits administration on effectiveness. Managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs) are reshaping mental health care delivery and payment by utilizing techniques like financial incentives, preventive medicine, treatment protocols, and prior authorization. Cost sharing and coverage limits are less significant under managed care, which aims to control moral hazard through internal rationing methods. The introduction of managed mental health care can reduce spending and increase plan usage, as seen in Pacific Bell's 13% decrease in mental health expenditures in the early 1990s. This reduction was not due to decreased access to care but rather fewer outpatient sessions per patient, reduced likelihood of inpatient admission, and shorter stays. Managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs) have shown to reduce costs and improve care delivery. Massachusetts experienced a 25% decrease in behavioral health care costs for state employees after implementing managed care in 1993. Studies indicate that MBHOs can effectively control costs related to mental health parity. Recent studies show that states with full-parity laws for mental health coverage by managed care plans have seen modest premium increases. Magellan Health Services, the largest MBHO in the nation, reported minimal premium increases of no more than 1% due to state mental health parity legislation. A 2001 workshop discussed the impact of parity on mental health spending, noting a decrease in baseline spending due to changes in clinical practices and managed care growth. Premium costs resulting from parity are typically expressed as a percentage increase. States began addressing mental health coverage inequities in the 1970s by enacting laws requiring health plans to offer specific mental health benefits. However, these laws had limitations, such as not providing catastrophic coverage for severe mental illness and not applying to self-insured employers exempt from state regulation under ERISA. Managed care plans responded to parity laws by tightening controls on mental health services to prevent increased demand and premiums. In 1991, Texas and North Carolina were the first states to enact limited mental health parity legislation, applying only to insurers covering government employees. By 1996, federal parity legislation was enacted, with a total of seven states requiring certain state-regulated health plans to provide full-parity mental health coverage. Currently, 28 states mandate mental health coverage with full parity, with laws varying in the types of health plans covered and mental illnesses included. In 28 states, full parity laws mandate mental health coverage for various health plans, with some laws applying to all conditions listed in the DSM-IV. Some states restrict coverage to specific serious or biologically based mental illnesses. About one-third of states exempt small employers, and 6 states have laws mandating a minimum level of mental health benefits. New Jersey recently passed legislation requiring individual carriers to offer a policy with minimum mandated mental health benefits, including coverage for inpatient and outpatient treatment. The aim is to provide a less expensive alternative for individuals who cannot afford full-parity coverage. Texas has enacted new legislation allowing for the sale of less expensive health insurance policies without state mandates for mental illness treatment. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) requires equivalence in catastrophic coverage and prohibits group plans from imposing more restrictive dollar limits on mental health coverage compared to medical and surgical coverage. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) requires group health plans to provide mental health coverage equivalent to medical and surgical coverage, with restrictions on treatment limitations and cost sharing. Employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt, and those experiencing a 1% increase in claims costs can apply for an exemption. The MHPA applies to private-sector group health plans, including fully insured and self-insured plans, but not to the individual health insurance market. It also applies to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and some state and local government health plans. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) applies to Medicaid managed care plans, State Children's Health Insurance Programs, and private-sector group health plans. A review by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in 1999 found that while 86% of employers reported compliance with the MHPA, many plans still restricted mental health coverage by limiting outpatient visits and hospital days for mental health treatment. Labor Department and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services surveys showed similar results. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) had a limited impact on claims costs for employers, with only 3% reporting cost increases and less than 1% dropping mental health coverage. Many plans countered increased costs by restricting mental health coverage in other ways. The MHPA also spurred the passage of state parity laws, with all states except Wyoming enacting some form of parity legislation since 1996. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) led to the passage of state parity laws that mirrored and strengthened its provisions. The MHPA was extended multiple times by the 107th and 108th Congress, reauthorizing it through December 31, 2003 in federal statutes. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) was extended multiple times by the 108th and 109th Congress, reauthorizing it through December 31, 2007 in federal statutes. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) provisions were extended through 2008 by the 110th Congress, amending ERISA, the PHS Act, and the IRC to apply to a wide range of group health plans and insurers. The extension allows for tax penalties on non-compliant employers. The PHS Act provisions apply to insurers and some public-sector group health plans, with enforcement actions available to various government departments. Tax penalties for violations of federal health mandates are imposed on employers or health plans, with excise taxes payable to the U.S. Treasury at $100 per day of noncompliance. Excise taxes for violations of federal health mandates are imposed on employers or health plans, with penalties payable to the U.S. Treasury. The minimum tax for violations is $2,500, or $15,000 for more than de minimus violations, excluding church plans. Maximum tax for reasonable cause violations is $500,000 or the prior year's group health plan expenses. The Secretary of the Treasury may waive part or all of the tax for excessive payments relative to the failure. No taxes apply if failures are not discovered with reasonable diligence or corrected within specific periods. Governmental plans are exempt from excise taxes. Section 502 of ERISA establishes a civil enforcement scheme for violations of the statute, providing for recovery of benefits due to participants or beneficiaries. Courts have ruled that monetary remedies are not available under ERISA. Enforcement of group health provisions is described in Section 2722 of the PHSA as established by HIPAA. HHS may impose civil money penalties on non-conforming health plans for violations of federal health mandates. The Secretary may impose civil money penalties on non-conforming health insurance plans for information disclosure violations, with penalties of $100 per day per individual. Penalties can be waived if failures are corrected within 30 days, and entities can request an administrative review and appeal. Limited information is available on enforcement actions related to MHPA. The PWBA conducted 1,267 investigations of group health plans in 2000-2001, finding that over one-third were out of compliance with new health laws. This led to the initiation of a program to assist plans in complying with the laws through publications, educational materials, a compliance assistance web page, and workshops. Compliance rates dropped further when notice provisions were included. The HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did not provide information on civil enforcement penalties. President Clinton directed the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to implement full parity for mental health and substance abuse benefits in health plans offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) starting in 2001. The parity requirement covers treatment for all mental illnesses listed in the DSM-IV, resulting in a 1.64% average premium increase according to OPM. The OPM reported a 1.64% premium increase for fee-for-service plans and 0.3% for HMOs due to parity implementation in FEHBP health plans. Mental health coverage is provided in various ways, including through managed behavioral health care organizations or internal provider networks. Mental health parity under FEHBP is required for in-network services only. OPM and the Department of Health and Human Services are evaluating the FEHBP parity initiative over three years. A study comparing FEHB plans with non-FEHBP plans found that implementing parity in mental health and substance abuse benefits, along with care management, had little to no significant impact. The analysis of plan benefits data for seven FEHB plans before and after the introduction of parity showed that mental health and substance abuse services utilization increased due to a general trend, with little adverse impact on access, spending, or quality. The implementation of parity was associated with significant reductions in spending compared to non-FEHB plans. The Mental Health Parity Act of 2007 (S. 558) aimed to require employer-sponsored group health plans to impose the same treatment limitations and financial requirements on mental health coverage as on medical and surgical coverage. The bill was passed by the Senate in September 2007. Additionally, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act (H.R. 1424) was introduced in March 2007 to amend ERISA, the PHS Act, and the IRC. H.R. 1424, approved by House committees and passed in 2008, does not mandate full parity for mental health coverage. It covers all psychiatric conditions listed in the DSM-IV and extends parity to in-network and out-of-network benefits. Small employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt. H.R. 1424, passed in 2008, does not mandate full parity for mental health coverage. It covers psychiatric conditions listed in the DSM-IV and extends parity to in-network and out-of-network benefits. The bill exempts small employers with 50 or fewer employees. The Senate version allows insurance companies to determine which mental illnesses they cover, while the House version requires coverage for all mental illnesses. The Senate version does not address preemption of state mental health parity laws explicitly, unlike the House version. The House version of the parity bill does not preempt state mental health parity laws. Both House and Senate versions include parity for substance abuse treatment services. S. 558 has support from insurance companies and employers. Bills amending Title XXI for equal mental health coverage under SCHIP passed in both chambers. Senators Domenici and Wellstone introduced the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act in 2001. The National Advisory Mental Health Council estimated that full parity similar to S. 543 would raise premium costs by 1.4%. Pricewaterhouse Coopers concluded it would result in a 1% increase in costs. CBO estimated S. 543 would increase premiums for group health plans by 0.9%. The Senate HELP Committee approved a substitute version of S. 543, retaining the full-parity requirement. The Senate added S. 543 as an amendment to the FY2002 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. The House version of the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill (H.R. 3061) did not include parity language. House conferees rejected the Senate amendment on a party-line vote during the conference on H.R. 3061. The conference voted to reauthorize the MHPA through December 31, 2002, and urged swift consideration of legislation to extend and improve mental health parity protections. Hearings on mental health parity were held in March and July 2002. Representative Roukema introduced the Senate bill on March 20, 2002. On July 23, 2002, a hearing was held regarding mental health parity legislation. Representative Roukema introduced Senate parity legislation in the House (H.R. 4066) on March 20, 2002. Representatives Kennedy and Ramstad, along with Senators Domenici and Kennedy, introduced full parity legislation in February 2003. Senator Daschle introduced the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2003 on November 6, 2003. The bill was reintroduced in 2005 by Representatives Kennedy and Ramstad. No further legislative action was taken on these bills. Federal full-parity legislation has strong support from patient advocates and mental health provider organizations, aiming to eliminate discrimination in private health insurance coverage of mental illness. However, employers and the health insurance industry oppose the legislation, citing concerns about increased healthcare costs that they cannot afford in the current economic climate. Employers fear increased costs for health insurance coverage in the current economic climate due to proposed parity legislation. Proponents argue that full parity can actually reduce costs by improving productivity and lowering overall healthcare expenditures. Some large employers, like Delta Airlines, have seen a positive financial impact from implementing parity in mental health benefits. Delta Airlines increased mental health benefits for its employees in 1994, leading to higher use of services, flat costs, decreased spending in other health areas, and reduced absenteeism. Concerns arise over the broad definition of mental illness in proposed legislation, with support for a bill covering only specific mental illnesses. Critics argue for a more limited scope to focus on serious mental illnesses. Critics of H.R. 1424 oppose extending coverage to all mental disorders listed in the DSM-IV, fearing it may lead to frivolous claims. They argue against covering conditions like academic skills disorders and sexual desire disorders, which they deem medically insignificant. Supporters of parity believe opposition stems from stigma and a misconception about the physiological basis of mental illness. They advocate for covering all DSM-IV disorders, comparing it to medical benefits for serious physical diseases like cancer. They argue that this approach is unlikely to result in abuse or increased costs. Advocates of mental health parity argue that covering all DSM-IV disorders is not likely to lead to abuse or inflated costs. H.R. 1424 allows plans to manage mental health benefits through various practices, and the DSM-IV sets a threshold for diagnosis based on clinical significance. They believe that restricting coverage to major mental illnesses is short-sighted, as untreated milder conditions can escalate into more serious disorders. Despite the passage of state parity laws and changes in mental health service delivery, mental health coverage is still not on par with coverage for other medical conditions. A recent analysis of the 2002 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Educational Trust (KFF/HRET) Employer Health Benefits Survey revealed that while 98% of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance had mental health care coverage, 74% were subject to annual outpatient visit limits and 64% to annual inpatient day limits. The proportion of workers with these limits has increased in recent years, with only 22% facing higher cost sharing for mental health benefits. The 2002 KFF/HRET survey data shows that about one-third of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance receive mental health care through carve-outs. There were minimal differences in mental health benefits between carve-outs and integrated health plans, with similar limitations on inpatient days and outpatient visits. Cost sharing for outpatient mental health services was also comparable between the two types of plans. MBHOs focus on utilization controls rather than just cost sharing. The 2002 KFF/HRET survey data suggests that despite MBHOs focusing on supply-side utilization controls, mental health benefits in carve-outs still have special limits and high cost sharing. Researchers attribute this to factors like lack of employer education on cost advantages, minimal risk sharing in contracts, and a cost containment focus. Concerns about adverse selection and the limited impact of state parity laws on self-insured plans also contribute to the persistence of benefit limitations. Overall, establishing mental health parity may be challenging without broader federal parity laws. State parity laws have limited impact as they do not cover self-insured plans exempted by ERISA. Concerns exist that parity in nominal benefits for mental health care may not ensure equal access to high-quality care and financial protection. Many mental health services not covered by private insurance, such as day-hospital care and residential treatment programs, are unaffected by parity legislation. Psychosocial rehabilitation and residential treatment programs are effective components of mental health care. Health plans do not cover supervised housing or employment for patients with chronic mental health conditions. Advocates for parity argue for a broader view of access to quality mental health care, including social-welfare services. Concerns exist about managed behavioral health care potentially leading to across-the-board reductions in treatment without considering clinical circumstances. MBHOs are pressured to contain costs, making it difficult to regulate their internal management processes for rationing treatment. Managed behavioral health organizations (MBHOs) have wide latitude to manage coverage and control access to mental health care to achieve cost-control goals, even under federal and state parity laws. They argue that by lowering costs and offering parity-level benefits, patients have greater access to treatment earlier in their illness, resulting in less suffering and lower costs. Critics argue that MBHOs' managed care tools may widen the gap in treatment access. Studies show that early, effective treatment of mental illness leads to lower medical costs, disability costs, and absenteeism. MBHOs use various techniques to manage mental health care, criticized for separating behavioral health from mainstream health care. The 1996-1998 HCC survey results raise concerns about parity's impact on access to quality mental health care. The HCC survey found that state parity laws did not significantly affect the use of mental health services. Insurance companies responded to parity laws by increasing care management to control costs. Managed care reported more unmet needs in delays or insufficient treatment compared to indemnity insurance, but less often reported no care. The HCC survey found that managed care reported fewer unmet needs compared to indemnity insurance. Vermont's comprehensive parity law impacted access to mental health and substance abuse services, leading to changes in management by major insurers in the state. After Vermont's comprehensive parity law, BCBSVT and Kaiser/CHP changed their management of mental health and substance abuse services. BCBSVT shifted to managed care carve-outs, resulting in decreased likelihood of mental health treatment and outpatient visits. Kaiser/CHP increased partial hospitalization and group therapy while reducing inpatient treatment. Overall, MH/SA spending decreased by 8-18% post-parity, despite lower consumer costs. Parity only benefits those with health insurance, not addressing the 17.5% of the U.S. population without coverage. The curr_chunk discusses various resources related to mental health parity, including patient advocacy organizations and professional associations for healthcare providers and employers. It does not address the issue of the 17.5% of the U.S. population without health insurance. Professional associations related to behavioral healthcare include American Health Insurance Plans, ERISA Industry Committee, and Behavioral Healthcare Association."
