    "content": "The \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" is the short title of this Act. Congress finds that women have entered the workforce in record numbers but still earn significantly lower pay than men for equal work, leading to wage depression for working families and hindering the optimal use of labor resources. These pay disparities have spread through commerce and burdened the free flow of goods. Artificial barriers to wage discrimination based on sex persist, hindering the elimination of such discrimination despite the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Removing these barriers would positively impact the economy. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 aims to address unfair pay disparities in the economy, particularly for working women earning low wages. It promotes stable families by ensuring fair pay for all family members. Increased information and effective remedies are needed for women to enforce their rights to equal pay. Some employers have already taken steps to eliminate wage disparities in the workplace. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 addresses unfair pay disparities in the workplace, aiming to recognize achievements and promote fair pay for all. SEC. 3. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS.

It also encompasses entities conducting education or training programs, as well as joint programs involving a combination of the mentioned entities. Increased resources for enforcement and education.
