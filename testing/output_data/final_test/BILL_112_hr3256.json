The Deport Convicted Foreign Criminals Act of 2011 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to discontinue granting certain visas to nationals of countries that deny or delay accepting aliens. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to submit quarterly reports listing these countries. The report must include data on countries that refused or delayed repatriation of aliens in the 90-day period before submission. Data should be disaggregated by country, detention status, and criminal status. The report must include data on countries that refused or unreasonably delayed repatriation of aliens within 90 days. It should be categorized by country, detention status, and criminal status. The report must include data on countries that refused or unreasonably delayed repatriation of aliens within 90 days. Countries listed must issue travel documents within 60 days of the initial report submission. Beginning on the date of the second report submission, the Secretary of State may not issue visas for noncriminal aliens from countries that do not cooperate in repatriating their citizens within specified timeframes. The Secretary of State may restrict issuing nonimmigrant visas to citizens, nationals, or residents of countries listed under subparagraph (A), with exceptions for ambassadors. After 90 days, additional visa restrictions apply to certain visa categories. After 90 days of restrictions on certain countries, visa restrictions apply to various visa categories including diversity immigrant, nonimmigrant (H, L, P), and employment-based immigrant visas. After 90 days of restrictions on certain countries, visa restrictions apply to various visa categories including nonimmigrant and immigrant visas for citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents of the sanctioned country until a report is submitted and the country is no longer listed. The text chunk discusses the conditions under which visa restrictions may be waived for a country, including the issuance of appropriate travel documents and acceptance of citizens for repatriation. Additionally, it mentions the possibility of a waiver through the enactment of a joint resolution. The Secretary of State may reverse visa restrictions for a country if they accept 50% of the aliens listed in the original report. The waiver can be requested by the President or a designee. The President or a designee may request a waiver from Congress to partially or fully waive subsection restrictions for any country. Congress must act on the waiver request within 20 days. Any visa issued in violation of this provision will be invalid. Section 243 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended by removing subsection (d). SEC. 3.
