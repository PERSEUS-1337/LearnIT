    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act of 2009\" outlines the duties of the General Services Administration and executive agencies. The Act \"Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act of 2009\" amends Section 524 of title 40, United States Code. It outlines the duties of the General Services Administration and executive agencies regarding the development and implementation of agency real property plans, including guidance on identifying excess properties, evaluating costs and benefits of disposing of real property, prioritizing disposal decisions based on agency missions, and disposing of excess properties. The Administrator must submit an annual report detailing executive agency efforts to reduce real property assets, including market value and number of assets at the government-wide and agency levels. The annual report must include the estimated market value, number of surplus real property assets, and maintenance costs for all executive agencies at the government-wide and agency levels, as well as at the constructed asset and facility/installation levels. The Federal Government's real properties include maintenance, repair, utilities, cleaning, roads, and grounds expenses. For leased properties, costs cover lease expenses and any additional costs not included in the lease contract. The report must detail deferred maintenance costs for all executive agencies at various levels. The report on surplus real property facilities must include details such as geographic location, size, disposal method, market value, and other relevant information as deemed appropriate by the Administrator. Congressional committees involved are the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. The Administrator assists executive agencies in identifying and disposing of excess real property. Executive agencies must maintain inventory controls, survey property for excess, report to the Administrator, and handle excess property. Executive agencies are required to develop and implement a real property plan to identify excess properties, categorize all real property, and establish goals to reduce excess real property in their inventory. Executive agencies must reduce excess real property in their inventory by using specific authorities and transferring or reassigning property when no longer needed for its original purpose. Additionally, agencies should obtain excess properties from other federal agencies before acquiring non-essential properties. Executive agencies should obtain excess properties from other federal agencies before acquiring non-Federal property. The General Services Administration and executive agencies have duties related to preparing properties to be reported as excess, with enhanced authorities for this purpose. Section 572(a)(2) of title 40, United States Code is amended to provide the Administrator with additional authority to use funds for identifying and preparing properties to be reported as excess by another agency. The General Services Administration will be reimbursed from the proceeds of the sale of such properties for related costs, with net proceeds dispersed according to section 571 of the title. The authority to obligate funds for preparing properties to be reported as excess does not include the authority to convey such properties through various means. This does not affect subparagraph (D). SEC. 4. ENHANCED AUTHORITIES WITH REGARD TO REVERTED REAL PROPERTY. Enhanced authorities for reverted real property include the ability to pay expenses related to custody and disposal, as well as requirements for selling reverted property at or above fair market value. The Administrator must sell reverted property at or above appraised fair market value for cash, not through lease or other arrangements. If necessary for compliance, the Administrator will take control of the property and sell it accordingly. The Administrator must sell reverted property at or above appraised fair market value for cash, not through lease or other arrangements, as outlined in Section 554 of title 40, United States Code. The Administrator must sell reverted property at or above appraised fair market value for cash, not through exchange, leaseback arrangements, or service agreements. Prior to sale, the Administrator shall make the property available to State and local governments, non-profit institutions, or organizations. SEC. 5. AGENCY RETENTION OF PROCEEDS. The text of section 571 of title 40, United States Code, is amended to specify that net proceeds from the transfer or sale of real property shall be deposited into the agency's real property account for authorized activities. This includes disposal activities and maintenance or repairs necessary for disposal, but not for general agency expenses. The General Services Administration must submit a prospectus for repair or alteration projects subject to specific requirements. This section does not impact other related sections. The GSA is designated as the disposal agency for reverted real property. Net proceeds from the transfer or sale of excess real or personal property under this chapter are to be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, after deducting expenses of the transfer or disposition. The expenses of selling personal property can be paid from the proceeds of the sale, ensuring only the net proceeds are deposited in the Treasury. This applies regardless of whether the proceeds are deposited as miscellaneous receipts or to the credit of an appropriation as authorized by law. SEC. 6. DEMONSTRATION AUTHORITY. Sec. 530 of title 40, United States Code, establishes a demonstration program for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, exempting eligible properties from certain requirements of the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act. Eligible properties must be selected for demolition by a Federal agency and meet specific criteria.
