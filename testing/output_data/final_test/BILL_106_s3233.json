    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act of 2000\". The Senate acknowledges the high rate of suicide among older people in the United States, with individuals 65 and older accounting for 20 percent of all suicide deaths. Mental illness in this age group, including dementia and depression, is expected to become a major public health issue. Major depression is prevalent among older people, affecting between 8 and 20 percent in community studies. Almost 20 percent of individuals aged 55 and older experience specific mental disorders not related to normal aging, including depression, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, and late-life schizophrenia. Substance abuse, especially alcohol and prescription drug abuse, is a rapidly growing health issue among adults 65 and older, with 17 percent suffering from addiction. Aging and disability make older adults more susceptible to the effects of alcohol and drugs. Medicare coverage for addiction treatment of the elderly needs to recognize their vulnerability to alcohol and drugs. Additionally, disabled individuals on Social Security Disability Insurance face inadequate mental health care through Medicare, with up to 40 percent having a mental illness diagnosis and experiencing discrimination in coverage. SEC. 3. Decrease in Medicare beneficiary copayment for outpatient mental health services. Repeals Section 1833(c) of the Social Security Act and amends Section 1866(a)(2)(A). Effective date applies to items and services furnished after enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. Intensive residential services. SEC. 4. Intensive Residential Services. Amends Section 1812(a) to include coverage for intensive residential services for up to 120 days per year. Defines intensive residential services under Section 1861 of the Social Security Act. Intensive residential services include inpatient care provided in various facilities such as detox centers, crisis programs, and treatment homes. Facilities must be legally authorized or certified to provide these services. The text chunk discusses the requirements for intensive residential services, including accreditation by the State and meeting Secretary-imposed standards. It also mentions a reduction in coverage days for inpatient services based on actuarial value. The text chunk amends the Social Security Act to specify the amount of payment for intensive residential services and excludes providers of such services from certain payment provisions. Payment for Intensive Residential Services is specified in the Social Security Act, with providers excluded from certain payment provisions. Payment for intensive residential services under the Social Security Act is determined based on the reasonable cost or customary charges, with exceptions for public providers or those serving low-income patients. The Secretary determines payment for intensive residential services under the Social Security Act based on specific conditions met. SEC. 5. STUDY OF COVERAGE CRITERIA FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED MENTAL ILLNESSES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study to determine if Medicare coverage criteria for therapy services and outpatient mental health care services restrict access for beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease or related mental illnesses. If necessary, new coverage criteria will be established. The Secretary will identify alternative coverage criteria for Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease to ensure access to necessary health care services. A report on the study conducted will be submitted to Congress within one year, along with recommendations for legislative and administrative action. SEC. 6. MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING SERVICES. This section amends the Social Security Act to include mental health counselor services in the definition of medical and other health services. It defines mental health counselor and services provided by them. The term 'mental health counselor' refers to an individual with a master's or doctor's degree in counseling or a related field, who has completed at least 2 years of supervised practice and is licensed or certified by the state. If licensure is not available, the individual must have completed 2 years or 3,000 hours of supervised practice under a qualified provider. The term 'mental health counselor services' refers to services provided by a mental health counselor for diagnosing and treating mental illnesses as authorized by state law. Payment for these services is now included under Section 1833(a)(1) of the Social Security Act. The amounts paid for mental health counselor services shall be 80 percent of the actual charge or 75 percent of the amount paid to a psychologist under clause (L). SEC. 7 amends the Social Security Act to exclude clinical social worker services from Medicare coverage under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system. The effective date of these amendments is retroactive to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997."
