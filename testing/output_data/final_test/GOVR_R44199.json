    "content": "The legal framework for congressional redistricting involves constitutional and federal statutory requirements, as well as case law interpretations. The Elections Clause of the Constitution gives states the authority to prescribe the times, places, and manner of holding congressional elections, with Congress having the power to alter these laws. Apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives is based on the U.S. population count every 10 years, with each state entitled to at least one Representative. A federal statute requires apportionment to occur every 10 years to ensure equality of population among districts. Most states must redraw congressional district boundaries every 10 years to maintain equal population representation. The Supreme Court mandates the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote\" principle for congressional districts. In Wesberry v. Sanders, the Court ruled that each vote in a congressional election should hold equal weight. Reynolds v. Sims extended this principle to state legislative redistricting. In Reynolds v. Sims, the Supreme Court ruled that the one person, one vote standard applies to state legislative redistricting, ensuring equal voting rights. Congressional districts must adhere to the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits discriminatory voting practices based on race, color, or previous servitude. The VRA enforces the Fifteenth Amendment's protection of citizens' voting rights. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits discriminatory voting practices based on race, color, or language minority membership, including congressional redistricting plans that deny or abridge the right to vote. It ensures that electoral processes are equally open to all racial and language minority groups. The Supreme Court has addressed issues in congressional redistricting, including the requirement for population equality among districts, considerations for partisanship, the use of total population or eligible voters for equality, the creation of majority-minority districts under the VRA, limits imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and the authority to draw and implement redistricting plans. The Court has defined ideal mathematical population equality among districts since 1964. The Supreme Court has set standards for population equality in redistricting, with stricter requirements for congressional districts compared to state legislative districts. In cases like Kirkpatrick v. Preisler and Karcher v. Dagett, the Court emphasized the importance of minimizing population deviation to meet the \"as nearly as practicable\" standard and achieve absolute population equality unless necessary for a legitimate state objective. The Supreme Court has established standards for population equality in redistricting, requiring strict adherence to the \"as nearly as practicable\" standard for congressional districts. In cases like Karcher v. Dagett, the Court emphasized the need to justify population deviations among districts with legitimate state objectives. The Court outlined a two-prong test for determining the constitutionality of a redistricting plan, placing the burden on challengers to prove that population differences could have been avoided. The Supreme Court has set standards for population equality in redistricting, requiring adherence to the \"as nearly as practicable\" standard. Challengers must prove that population differences could have been avoided, and if successful, the state must show that deviations were necessary for a legitimate objective. The burden is flexible and depends on factors like population deviations, state interests, plan consistency, and available alternatives. In Tennant, the Court found that certain state policies justified minor population disparities in redistricting. The Supreme Court has upheld a 0.79% maximum population deviation in congressional districts, while state legislative districts can have greater deviations if not motivated by partisanship. In Cox v. Larios, a state legislative redistricting plan with a 9.9% deviation was struck down as a violation of the one-person, one-vote principle. The district court determined that a redistricting plan was intentionally designed for partisan purposes, allowing Democrats to maintain or increase their delegation by manipulating district populations. The Supreme Court is set to clarify the scope of this decision in Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, addressing whether partisan goals can justify deviations from population equality in state legislative districts. The Supreme Court is expected to make a decision by June 2016 in Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, which will address whether partisan goals can justify deviations from population equality in state legislative districts. The lower court in Harris found that population deviations were primarily due to efforts to comply with the Voting Rights Act, with bipartisan support for the changes undermining the challenge based on the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court is expected to decide in Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission if partisan goals can justify population deviations in state legislative districts. The largest district is 4.1% above ideal population, the smallest is 4.7% below, creating an 8.8% deviation. The Court has not settled on who should be counted for equality among districts. Justice Thomas argued for the Court to address this issue in 2001. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of drawing legislative districts based on total population in Evenwel v. Abbott. Justice Ginsburg wrote the opinion upholding this practice, but the Court did not rule on using other measures like eligible voters. Justices Alito and Thomas wrote separate concurrences. The majority opinion in Evenwel relied on constitutional history and Court precedent to support apportioning congressional districts based on total population, not just voters. Alito and Thomas wrote separate concurrences and did not join Ginsburg's opinion. Congress rejected allocation based on voter population when debating the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in Evenwel determined that drawing legislative districts based on total population promotes equitable representation for all residents, including nonvoters like children, in legislative debates and constituent services. Justice Thomas reiterated this stance in a concurrence. Justice Thomas criticized the majority for lacking clarity in the Court's case law on one person, one vote principle. He argued that states have the freedom to draw district lines based on various voter bases. Different ruling could lead to significant consequences like changes in district distribution between urban and rural areas. The Evenwel decision did not require states to draw districts based on eligible voters' population, leaving the possibility for future cases to address this issue. While the ruling mainly impacts state and local redistricting, it could have implications for congressional redistricting as well, particularly regarding the creation of \"majority-minority\" districts. In congressional redistricting, the creation of \"majority-minority\" districts is important to prevent racial vote dilution. The Supreme Court established a three-prong test in Thornburg v. Gingles to prove vote dilution under Section 2, requiring minority groups to show they are large and geographically compact, politically cohesive, and face bloc voting by the white majority. The Supreme Court discussed how minority groups can establish a violation under Section 2 by showing they do not have an equal opportunity to participate in the political process. Factors to consider include the history of discrimination and the extent of voting in elections. Factors to consider in determining a violation under Section 2 include racially polarized voting, discriminatory voting practices, access to candidate slating processes, effects of discrimination on minority groups in education, employment, and health, racial appeals in political campaigns, and representation of minority groups in public office. In Bartlett v. Strickland, the Supreme Court ruled that the first prong of the Gingles three-prong test requires geographical compactness for a minority group to constitute a majority in a district. The Court rejected the argument that Section 2 mandates drawing district lines to allow minority voters to join with others to elect their preferred candidate, even if the minority group is less than 50% of the voting age population in a district. The Gingles test requires minority groups to demonstrate the ability to elect candidates of their choice, which may involve creating majority-minority districts in redistricting plans. Minority voters must constitute over 50% in such districts to avoid racial vote dilution and ensure equal opportunity to elect candidates. In redistricting, minority-majority districts must have over 50% minority voters to ensure equal opportunity to elect candidates. Constitutional limits exist on creating these districts, with the Supreme Court applying strict scrutiny if race is the main factor in drawing district lines. This standard requires a compelling governmental interest and narrow tailoring of the redistricting plan. Such cases are known as \"racial gerrymandering\" claims. The Supreme Court has addressed racial gerrymandering claims, where plaintiffs argue that race was improperly used in drawing district boundaries. To prevail in such claims, the plaintiff must prove that racial considerations were \"dominant and controlling\" in creating the districts. In Easley v. Cromartie (Cromartie II), the Court upheld the constitutionality of North Carolina's 12th Congressional District, rejecting the argument that it was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling in Cromartie II, stating that the attacking party failed to prove that race, rather than politics, was the main factor in drawing district boundaries. In Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, the Court emphasized the need for a district-by-district analysis to determine if race is the predominant factor triggering strict scrutiny in redistricting. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for a district-by-district analysis to determine if race is the predominant factor triggering strict scrutiny in redistricting. The Court clarified that traditional redistricting principles should not be weighed against the use of race to determine predominance. The Alabama Court also addressed the preclearance requirements of Section 5 of the VRA. The Supreme Court clarified that Section 5 of the VRA did not require a specific numerical majority of minority voters in a minority-majority district, but rather the ability for minorities to elect their preferred candidate. The Court vacated a lower court ruling and remanded for reconsideration. Justice Scalia's dissent warned of significant implications for future cases involving voting rights and state election management. Justice Thomas also criticized the Court's decision on voting rights. In a dissent, Justice Thomas criticized the Court's voting rights jurisprudence, calling it a \"fight over the 'best' racial quota.\" Minority voters successfully challenged districts in Alabama under the Equal Protection Clause. The decision interprets Section 5 of the VRA and could impact Congress if drafting a new coverage formula. Another pending case, Wittman v. Personhuballah, will clarify proving race as a predominant factor in redistricting plans. The federal district court ruling invalidated Virginia's Third Congressional District as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, ordering the legislature to draw a new congressional district map. The court found the legislature's predominant purpose was compliance with Section 5 of the VRA, questioning if continued compliance is a compelling state interest. The court ruled that maintaining a specific minority percentage in majority-minority districts is not required. The increase in African-American voters in Virginia's Third Congressional District was deemed unjustified as it did not prevent retrogression. The dissent argued that race was not the main factor in drawing district lines. The Supreme Court is considering a case where race was a key factor in drawing district lines, with intervenor-defendants arguing that challengers must prove race, not politics, caused subordination of traditional redistricting principles. The Supreme Court is also examining whether the appellants lack standing due to not residing in or representing the congressional district in question. Some states have independent commissions for redistricting to address concerns about partisan gerrymandering. Arizona and California have created such commissions through ballot initiatives, taking control of redistricting away from state legislatures. In Arizona, the state legislature challenged the constitutionality of an independent commission for drawing congressional districts. The Supreme Court upheld the commission's constitutionality in Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission in 2015. The Court ruled that the Elections Clause allows a commission, instead of a state legislature, to draw congressional districts, stating that \"all political power flows from the people.\" The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an independent commission for drawing congressional districts in Arizona, stating that the Elections Clause allows for such a commission instead of a state legislature. The Court emphasized that the power flows from the people and that the purpose of the Elections Clause was to prevent political manipulation of electoral rules by state politicians. The term \"legislature\" in the U.S. Constitution was interpreted to have different meanings based on context. The Supreme Court ruled that the term \"legislature\" in the U.S. Constitution has different meanings based on context, including the veto power held by the people through a referendum and the governor's veto power. The Court also found no constitutional barrier to states empowering their people with a legislative function through initiatives, stating that legislating through initiative is in \"full harmony\" with the Constitution's conception that the people are the source of governmental power. The Supreme Court ruled that the Elections Clause should not prevent states from using citizen initiatives as an alternative legislative process for congressional redistricting. Arizona's redistricting process aligns with federal law, allowing states to use their own laws and regulations, including initiatives, to create congressional districts. Congress intended for states to have full authority in this matter. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress intended for states to have full authority in using citizen initiatives for congressional redistricting, as seen in the 1941 law. The Court determined that the term \"legislature\" in the Constitution refers to a representative body making laws, allowing for redistricting by initiative. The case was decided by a 5-4 vote, with the dissent arguing for a strict interpretation of the Elections Clause. Chief Justice Roberts dissent argued that the term \"legislature\" in the Constitution refers to a representative body, not the people as a whole. He contended that the Court's ruling had no basis in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution, clarifying that states can enact election laws through the initiative process. For example, California has an initiative-established independent commission for redistricting. The ruling suggests that state laws regulating congressional elections, like California's independent commission for redistricting, are likely to withstand challenge. Proposed acts like H.R. 75 and H.R. 1347 aim to limit congressional redistricting post-census unless ordered by a court. The John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act (H.R. 1347) would limit states to one congressional redistricting post-census unless ordered by a court. H.R. 934, the Redistricting and Voter Protection Act of 2015, requires states to obtain preclearance for subsequent redistricting plans. H.R. 1346, the Redistricting Transparency Act of 2015, mandates independent commissions for congressional redistricting. The Redistricting Reform Act of 2015 (H.R. 2173) aims to ensure public participation in congressional redistricting plans through a public Internet site and independent commissions. This legislation prohibits states from conducting multiple redistricting processes post-census unless ordered by a court for constitutional compliance or VRA enforcement. The legal framework for congressional redistricting involves constitutional limits, federal law requirements, and state-imposed processes. The Supreme Court has shaped how congressional districts are drawn through rulings on redistricting plans. Recent decisions allow states to create nonpartisan redistricting commissions, potentially changing the nationwide redistricting process. Another decision clarified requirements for maintaining minority voters' ability to elect candidates in new redistricting plans. The Supreme Court has influenced congressional redistricting by allowing nonpartisan commissions and clarifying the need to maintain minority voters' representation. Pending cases could further impact redistricting challenges."
