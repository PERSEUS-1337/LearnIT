    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, P.L. 114-113, signed into law on December 18, 2015, included $8.14 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in FY2016, which was $451.8 million below the President's request. No regular appropriations bills for FY2016 were passed by the House or Senate. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $7.60 billion for EPA in FY2016, with some program activities receiving increases or remaining the same. The House and Senate bills were reported before the budget agreement increased discretionary spending limits. Adherence to the Budget Control Act of 2011 for FY2016 was a topic of debate. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017, leaving funding allocation to the appropriations process. This report provides a timeline of congressional action on EPA FY2016 appropriations, funding background, and an overview of FY2016 funding amounts for each EPA account. It also examines funding levels and issues for selected EPA programs and activities within various accounts. The primary sources of information for this report on FY2016 appropriations include the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, the President's FY2016 budget request, and the FY2015 enacted appropriations. Additional information was obtained from the EPA's FY2016 Congressional Justification and the President's Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2016. The enacted appropriations for prior fiscal years in this report have not been adjusted for inflation to maintain consistency with cited sources. Appropriation issues are complex and not all issues are summarized. The appropriations bills identify funding levels for various programs beyond the scope of this report. Table 1 summarizes proposed and enacted appropriations for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies FY2016 appropriations. House and Senate committees held hearings on the President's FY2016 request for EPA. Title II of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 included $7.42 billion. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a bill on June 18, 2015, which included $7.42 billion for the EPA for FY2016. This amount was $1.17 billion below the President's request and $717.7 million below the FY2015 appropriation. The Administration strongly opposed the bill, and the House debated it from June 25 to July 8, 2015. The Senate Appropriations Committee also reported a bill on June 23, 2015, with $7.60 billion for the EPA. The Senate Appropriations Committee's reported bill, S. 1645 (S.Rept. 114-70), allocated $7.60 billion for EPA in FY2016, which was $994.3 million below the FY2016 request and $542.5 million less than the FY2015 enacted level. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-53), funded EPA and other agencies until December 11, 2015, at FY2015 levels with a 0.2108% across-the-board rescission. EPA did not have any exceptions to this rescission during the CR period. The FY2016 funding for EPA was under the authority and terms of FY2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased discretionary spending limits for FY2016 and FY2017. The new budget authority for FY2016 was $518.49 billion for nonsecurity and $548.09 billion for security categories. Prior to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the House and Senate adopted the FY2016 concurrent budget resolution, which included budgetary levels for FY2017-FY2025. EPA was included within Budget Function 300 for Natural Resources and Environment. Adherence to the discretionary spending limits under the BCA for FY2016 appropriations was a topic of debate among Members. The conference agreement on the budget resolution for FY2016 included language addressing EPA's regulatory activities, particularly focusing on the cost of EPA rules and regulations like controlling carbon emissions from power plants. The agreement also provided deficit-neutral reserve funds for EPA activities such as reforming environmental statutes and regulating carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. The FY2016 budget resolution included provisions on EPA's regulatory activities, focusing on controlling carbon emissions from power plants. The resolution set discretionary spending limits and allocations for defense and nondefense spending. House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported lower allocations for the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittees compared to the President's request. The House Subcommittee had a discretionary allocation of $30.17 billion, while the Senate Subcommittee had $30.01 billion. The EPA, established in 1970, has responsibilities that have grown due to environmental laws. Appropriations support the agency's regulation of air and water quality, pesticides, hazardous wastes, and contamination cleanup. The EPA, established in 1970, receives funding to fulfill statutory responsibilities related to pollution control. Grants make up 45% of the agency's reported net cost of operations. Funding trends have generally increased over time to meet growing responsibilities. The EPA's funding has increased over time to address environmental issues, with annual appropriations representing a small portion of the federal budget. In FY1978, funding was slightly higher than in FY2009, with additional appropriations from legislation such as the Omnibus Appropriations Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The EPA's funding has increased over time to address environmental issues, with annual appropriations representing a small portion of the federal budget. Table A-1 in Appendix A provides a history of enacted appropriations by EPA appropriations account from FY2009 through FY2015. Congress has continued to fund programs and activities administered by EPA even after the authorization of appropriations has expired. Congress has continued to fund EPA programs and activities after authorization has expired, but has also terminated or reduced funding for some. EPA presents staffing levels in its Congressional Justification documents, with the FY2016 budget proposing 15,373 FTEs. The FY2015 enacted level of 15,335 FTEs was the lowest since FY1989. EPA's funding had been requested by the Administration and appropriated from FY1996 to FY2013. From FY1996 to FY2013, EPA's funding was requested and appropriated under eight statutory accounts, with a ninth account added in FY2014. The current EPA appropriations accounts include State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG), Environmental Programs and Management (EPM), Hazardous Substance Superfund (\"Superfund\"), Science and Technology (S&T), Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Trust Fund, Buildings and Facilities (B&F), Office of Inspector General (OIG), Inland Oil Spill Program, and Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Fund. The distribution of funding among these accounts has remained relatively consistent in recent years. The State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account and the Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account historically receive two-thirds of EPA's total allocation. The FY2016 enacted appropriations for EPA under Title II of Division G of P.L. 114-113 are compared to previous funding levels and proposed amounts. Transfers of funds between appropriations accounts and funding levels for specific program areas are also identified. The FY2016 enacted appropriations for EPA maintained funding levels for all nine accounts compared to FY2015, but fell below the requested levels. The appropriations included both decreases and increases for individual programs within each account, with directions provided in the explanatory statement. The President's FY2016 requested funding would have been higher than FY2015 levels. The House and Senate committee-reported bills recommended decreases compared to the FY2016 request for all nine EPA appropriations accounts. The House committee-reported bill would have funded the Superfund and LUST Trust Fund accounts at the FY2015 enacted level but would decrease funding for the remaining accounts. The House committee-reported bill would not have provided funding for the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Fund. The Senate committee-reported bill would have provided an increase in funding for the Superfund account and the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Fund account and would have decreased funding for the other seven EPA appropriations accounts compared to the FY2015 appropriations for these accounts. The administrative provisions in Title II of Division G of P.L. 114-113 include a rescission of $40.0 million from unobligated balances previously appropriated for STAG projects. The FY2016 President's request did not include a rescission, but the FY2015 request proposed a $5.0 million rescission. EPA appropriations from FY2006 to FY2013 included rescissions, while the FY2014 enacted appropriations did not. Much attention during the FY2016 appropriations debate focused on EPA's air quality and climate implementation. The debate on FY2016 appropriations for the EPA focused on air quality regulations, funding for water infrastructure projects, categorical grants for pollution control, and cleanup of Superfund sites. Concerns were raised about funding priorities and regulatory actions. The FY2016 congressional appropriations debate focused on EPA's efforts to control carbon emissions, interpretation of the Clean Water Act, and implementation of federal pollution control statutes. Concerns were raised by Members during hearings and legislation discussions in the 114th Congress. EPA's proposed regulations have sparked debate and led to proposed legislation in previous Congresses. Proposed legislation in the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses has been influenced by concerns that certain agency actions exceeded their authority. Some argue that EPA's actions did not consider the costs and economic impacts of rules, while others believe they are consistent with statutory mandates. There are differing opinions on the pace of rulemaking, with some stating it is slower than a decade ago. Additionally, some groups feel that EPA has not fully implemented its mandated authorities and that regulatory action has been delayed. Recently promulgated and pending actions under the Clean Air Act (CAA) have garnered attention in Congress, particularly regarding EPA controls on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and efforts to reduce conventional pollutant emissions from various industries. The \"Clean Power Plan\" (CPP), aimed at reducing carbon emissions from existing electric generating units, has been a contentious issue during EPA appropriations debates. Additionally, actions under the Clean Water Act (CWA), such as defining the scope of protected waters, have been significant topics of discussion. The Army Corps of Engineers joint rule defining protected waters under the CWA and Safe Drinking Water Act, along with regulations under RCRA, FIFRA, CERCLA, and TSCA, received attention in Congress. Provisions in P.L. 114-113 restricted EPA actions and directed certain actions. The provisions in P.L. 114-113 directed EPA actions regarding the Great Lakes and included restrictions on the use of funds for regulations related to emissions from livestock production and greenhouse gas reporting. The FY2015 appropriations (P.L. 113-235, \u00a7420) and previous fiscal years prohibit the use of funds to implement rules mandating GHG emissions reporting from manure management systems. Section 420 also prohibits funds for regulating lead content in ammunition or fishing tackle under TSCA or any other law. Section 422 extends funding authorization for the Chesapeake Bay Initiative through FY2017, and Section 424 continues the provision on the use of American iron and steel. Section 424 (Use of American Iron and Steel) in the FY2015 appropriations prohibits the use of funds from the drinking water state revolving loan fund for projects unless all iron and steel used are produced in the United States. Section 425 (Notification Requirements) mandates public notice requirements for combined sewer overflow discharge to the Great Lakes. Section 426 addresses issues related to the Great Lakes. Section 426 of the Clean Water Act establishes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative with $300.0 million authorized for FY2016. It includes provisions from P.L. 114-113 that restrict EPA's use of funds for regulatory actions. EPA's regulatory actions were also debated during consideration of the House and Senate budget resolutions. The FY2016 Budget Resolution discussed EPA air quality and climate change activities, focusing on regulations under the Clean Air Act addressing GHGs, ozone, and particulate matter emissions. The agency's response to a 2007 Supreme Court decision regarding GHGs and the Clean Power Plan were key topics during hearings and debates on EPA's appropriations. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) final rule, part of the Administration's climate mitigation agenda, was published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015. The EPA introduced a revised incentive program for states going beyond the CPP, replacing the concept of an EPA-administered \"Clean Power State Incentive Fund.\" P.L. 114-113 included provisions preventing EPA from using funds for specific air quality regulatory activities related to GHG emissions. Section 417 addresses regulations for permits under Title V of the Clean Air Act governing GHG emissions from livestock production. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 did not retain provisions restricting the use of FY2016 funds by EPA for air quality actions. Appropriated funds for EPA's climate change and air quality activities are distributed across multiple program activities and accounts, making it difficult to compare with the President's FY2016 request. Comparisons can be made for certain activities specified by Congress in the appropriations process. The EPA's \"clean air and climate\" activities are the largest air quality program funded within the EPM and S&T accounts. The FY2016 enacted amount for this program area was $389.6 million, which is $72.1 million less than the President's FY2016 request. The proposed amounts in H.R. 2822 and S. 1645 reflect a significant decrease below the requested amount for FY2016. State and Local Air Quality Management grants are the largest air quality activity funded within the STAG account. State and Local Air Quality Management grants are the largest air quality activity funded within the STAG account. The FY2016 enacted appropriation for these grants was $228.2 million, $40.0 million less than the President's request. States use the grants to help operate air pollution control programs, with much of the day-to-day operations carried out by state and local agencies. Additionally, $50.0 million was allocated for the Diesel Emission Reduction Act Grants program in FY2016, $40.0 million more than requested and $20.0 million more than enacted for FY2015. The FY2015 President's budget request did not include funding for DERA grants. In FY2016, $20.0 million was allocated for \"Targeted Airshed Grants\" to reduce air pollution in nonattainment areas, an increase from the previous year. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 had authorized $200.0 million annually for these grants from FY2007 through FY2011. The FY2016 budget request did not include funding for targeted airshed grants, but included funding for state indoor radon grants at the FY2015 level of $8.1 million. The President's FY2016 request proposed eliminating the radon grant program, stating that states had the necessary expertise and funding to continue radon protection efforts without federal support. State Revolving Funds help finance local wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects to comply with the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. Water treatment plants receive Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) capitalization grants to comply with the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The grants are awarded to states based on statutory or administrative formulas. These grants have historically made up a significant portion of EPA funding, ranging from one-fourth to one-third of total appropriations. Funding for CWSRF has been higher than DWSRF since FY2009. In FY2016, the combined total enacted amount for the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds was $2.26 billion, slightly below requested levels but an increase from previous years. The CWSRF received $1.39 billion and the DWSRF received $863.2 million in capitalization grants. The President's budget proposed higher funding for the DWSRF due to increased needs for drinking water infrastructure improvements. The CWSRF faced a significant decrease in funding compared to FY2015 enacted levels. In FY2016, the proposed funding for the DWSRF would have increased by $279.1 million (30.8%) compared to FY2015 enacted levels. Both House and Senate committee-reported bills proposed higher funding for the CWSRF than the DWSRF, but funding for both SRFs was below requested and enacted levels. Congress has grappled with the need for federal financial assistance to help states maintain sufficient capital in their SRFs for water infrastructure needs, which are estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The Water Resources Development Act of 2014 includes the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2013, which authorizes a pilot loan guarantee program to promote private investment in water infrastructure projects. Congress is exploring alternative financing approaches for water infrastructure beyond the State Revolving Fund program. Per the Explanatory Statement accompanying P.L. 114-113, FY2016 funding for WIFIA is provided at the FY2015 level. The House and Senate committees proposed $4.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for EPA's preparations to implement the program. Funding for geographic-specific/ecosystem restoration programs to address environmental and human health risks in identified areas of the United States is included in the EPM appropriations account. The FY2016 appropriations debate focused on funding adequacy for geographic programs in the United States, including the National Estuary Program, Coastal Waterways program, Great Lakes, and Chesapeake Bay. Collaboration among EPA, state/local governments, communities, nonprofits, and citizens is common. Comparison of FY2016 funding levels and amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act were discussed. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act authorized $300.0 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in FY2016. Funding for water quality state and tribal grant programs remained at FY2015 levels, with increased funding for specific grants. EPA appropriations for water infrastructure projects were included in the STAG account for FY2016. In FY2016, funding was allocated for water infrastructure projects in Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico Border region. $20.0 million was provided for wastewater and drinking water facilities in Alaska Native Villages, while $10.0 million was allocated for wastewater infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. EPA's programmatic efforts to protect water quality are primarily funded through sub-account program activities in the S&T and EPM appropriation accounts. The FY2016 funding levels for these activities were generally maintained at or near FY2015 enacted levels, with some exceptions. Additional categorizations of the sub-account activities are presented in EPA's congressional budget justification, but are not explicitly shown in the appropriations tables. The FY2016 funding levels for EPA's water quality protection programs were generally maintained at or near FY2015 enacted levels, with some exceptions. P.L. 114-113 appropriated $1.08 billion for FY2016 to support state and tribal \"categorical grant\" programs, which was $26.7 million above the FY2015 enacted level. The President's FY2016 request proposed a $108.0 million increase for categorical grants. The FY2016 funding levels for EPA's water quality protection programs were generally maintained at or near FY2015 enacted levels. P.L. 114-113 appropriated $1.08 billion for FY2016 to support state and tribal \"categorical grant\" programs, which was $26.7 million above the FY2015 enacted level. These grants support various environmental activities such as monitoring, permitting, standard setting, training, and pollution control. The FY2016 enacted appropriations in P.L. 114-113 provided $21.0 million for a new categorical grant program, \"Multipurpose Grants to States and Tribes,\" aimed at assisting states and tribes with environmental programs. The beach protection program received funding at the FY2015 enacted level of $9.5 million in P.L. 114-113, aligning with the Senate committee-reported bill. The House committee had proposed eliminating grants for beach protection. The FY2016 appropriations adopted the proposal to eliminate beach protection grants but retained funding for radon grants at $8.1 million. EPA administers federal statutes to prevent pollution and address environmental contamination from past pollution or present releases. Thousands of contaminated sites exist across the US, varying in size, complexity, and level of hazard. States handle most site remediation. The federal government focuses on higher risk contaminated sites, with states handling most remediation. The EPA's main environmental remediation programs are Superfund, Underground Storage Tank, and Brownfields. The Superfund program addresses hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants, excluding oil and petroleum products. The EPA coordinates federal response to oil spills inland, with funding administered by the U.S. Coast Guard. The EPA Inland Oil Spill Response account funds emergency preparedness for spills. The Underground Storage Tank program focuses on remediation of petroleum leaks from tanks and leak prevention. The Brownfields program addresses sites contaminated with hazardous substances or petroleum. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account supports assessment and remediation of contaminated sites under EPA's Superfund program. The Superfund account received $1.09 billion for FY2016, the same as FY2015, but $65.1 million below the President's FY2016 request. Funding levels had declined until FY2014, remaining constant at $1.09 billion annually through FY2016. The Superfund account received approximately $1.25 billion annually for over a decade, with $600.0 million in supplemental funds for FY2009. CERCLA authorizes remedial and removal actions at sites, with only NPL-listed sites eligible for Superfund appropriations for remedial actions. Removal actions can be funded regardless of NPL listing. The Superfund program receives funding for cleanup efforts, with concerns raised about the adequacy of funding for remedial projects. Most funding is allocated to NPL-listed sites, leading to debates on funding sufficiency and reinstating Superfund taxes on industry. The President's FY2016 budget proposed reinstating Superfund taxes from 2016 to 2025, subject to reauthorizing legislation. The reauthorization legislation for Superfund taxes has been introduced in Congress since 1995 but not enacted. P.L. 114-113 did not include language to reauthorize Superfund taxes or restrict funding for Superfund financial responsibility requirements. Section 427 of H.R. 2822 would have prohibited EPA from using funds for developing Superfund financial responsibility requirements. The Superfund program requires facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility for hazardous substances by December 11, 1985. EPA administers a Brownfields program for sites not covered by Superfund, providing financial and technical assistance for assessment and remediation. Funding for EPA's Brownfields program includes two categories of grants. The EPA's Brownfields program offers competitive and formula-based grants for assessment, remediation, job training, and technical assistance for eligible sites. Nonprofit organizations may also qualify for grants based on certain criteria. Funding for these grants comes from the STAG account, while program administration costs are covered by the EPM account. In FY2016, $153.3 million was allocated for EPA's brownfields program, with $25.6 million for administrative expenses in the EPM account, $80.0 million for Section 104(k) grants, and $47.7 million for Section 128 grants in the STAG account. This amount is the same as FY2015 but less than the President's request and Senate committee-reported bill. In FY2016, $146.4 million was proposed for EPA, including $91.9 million from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. An additional $11.3 million was allocated for EPA staff and expenses to prevent releases from underground storage tanks. An extra $1.5 million was also included in the funding. The LUST Trust Fund provides federal funds for EPA and states to address petroleum releases from underground storage tanks. Funds are used for oversight, enforcement, emergency response, remediation, and cost recovery actions against responsible parties. The LUST Trust Fund, supported by a motor fuels tax, enforces liability for petroleum releases from underground storage tanks. The EPAct 2005 expanded leak prevention measures and allowed fund use for UST requirements implementation. Congress appropriates funds for responses to releases and leak prevention. The LUST Trust Fund, funded by a motor fuels tax, enforces liability for petroleum leaks from underground storage tanks. The EPAct 2005 expanded leak prevention measures and allowed fund use for UST requirements implementation. Congress appropriates funds for responses to leaks and leak prevention, with a small portion now derived from the General Fund. Transfers to the Highway Trust Fund have reduced funds available for addressing underground storage tank leaks. The LUST Trust Fund, funded by a motor fuels tax, has seen transfers to the Highway Trust Fund totaling $2.4 billion in FY2012, $1.0 billion in FY2014, and $300 million between FY2016 and FY2018. The unappropriated balance of the LUST Trust Fund was $3.33 billion at the beginning of FY2012. The LUST Trust Fund balance was $3.33 billion at the beginning of FY2012. The unappropriated balance was estimated at $450.0 million in FY2016. Annual receipts have exceeded appropriations, leading to a rise in the trust fund balance. P.L. 114-113 allocated $26.8 million for \"National Priorities\" in FY2016, higher than previous proposals. Additionally, $20.0 million was allocated for \"Targeted Airshed Grants\" in the STAG account. The House committee-reported bill proposed an increase in grants for emission reduction activities in non-attainment areas ranked as the top five most polluted areas. The President's FY2016 budget did not include funding for Congressionally directed projects within certain appropriations accounts. $4.1 million of the $26.8 million for \"National Priorities\" in the FY2016 consolidated appropriations was allocated. $4.1 million allocated in FY2016 for \"Research: National Priorities\" within the S&T account for competitive extramural research grants supporting water quality research by not-for-profit organizations partnering with the Agency. An additional $3.0 million directed for EPA's research on oil and gas development in the Appalachian Basin. $7.0 million provided for vehicle and engine emissions compliance activities in the S&T account. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations allocated $12.7 million for environmental protection national priorities, including grants for water quality improvement and safe drinking water assistance. $11.0 million was designated for national level training and technical assistance, while $1.7 million was allocated for private well owners. The Senate Committee proposed $15.0 million for technical assistance, with $13.0 million for national and multi-state levels and $2.0 million for private well owners. Funding for national priorities is not considered earmarks as it is awarded competitively. Earmarks have been excluded from appropriations bills for FY2011 through FY2016. In 2007, the Senate and House adopted separate definitions for earmark transparency requirements. The House refers to it as a \"congressional earmark,\" while the Senate calls it a \"congressionally directed spending item.\" The EPA was established in 1970 to address environmental pollution concerns, with Congress enacting numerous environmental laws and amendments over the following decades. Annual appropriations fund EPA's responsibilities under these laws. The EPA receives funds to carry out its responsibilities under environmental laws, regulating air and water quality, pesticides, waste management, and cleanup. Grants are awarded to assist governments in pollution control. EPA's staff levels have fluctuated over the years, with a request for 15,373 FTEs in FY2016. The EPA requested 15,373 FTEs for FY2016, the lowest since FY1989. GAO reported FTEs increased by 18% from FY1990 to FY1999, with the largest increase occurring from FY1990 to FY1993. EPA's funding was requested and appropriated under eight statutory accounts from FY1996 to FY2013, with a ninth account added in FY2014. The Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest Establishment Act authorized the development of an electronic system to track hazardous waste shipments and a fund to finance it. Funding for EPA was historically appropriated under different account structures before FY1996, making it challenging to compare funding over time. Congressional hearings regarding EPA's FY2016 budget were held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on Appropriations. The House and Senate held hearings on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's budget for FY2016 in February and March 2015. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure also discussed the agency's priorities for the upcoming fiscal year. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's budget for FY2016 was discussed in hearings by the House and Senate in February and March 2015. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure also reviewed the agency's priorities for the upcoming fiscal year. Funding prohibitions proposed in H.R. 2822 and S. 1645 were not retained in P.L. 114-113. Provisions restricting the use of FY2016 funds proposed in House and Senate bills were included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). These provisions aimed to limit EPA activities and funding expenditures across environmental pollution control statutes. Some were part of initial recommendations, while others were added as amendments. Amendments affecting EPA actions were introduced before the suspension of consideration of H.R. 2822 in the House on July 8, 2015. The House and Senate committee-reported bills included prohibitions on EPA activities and funding expenditures, such as restrictions on funding for EPA hydraulic fracturing research and greenhouse gas rules. The reports accompanying the bills outlined directives and restrictions on EPA programs. The report did not include the Administration's requests for funding increases and additional employees related to the Clean Power Plan."
