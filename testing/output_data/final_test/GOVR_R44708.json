    "content": "The commercial space sector has seen significant growth, with privately owned companies now launching and managing rockets and satellites. This shift began in 1982 when the U.S. government started allowing private providers to launch commercial payloads into orbit. Currently, there are 576 U.S.-owned satellites in orbit, with 286 launched for commercial reasons. This change in federal policy was driven by the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984. The Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 encourages private sector space activities and regulates them to ensure compliance with international obligations and protect public safety, property, and national security. The law was amended in 2004 to allow regulatory standards for human space flight to evolve with industry growth. National security agencies emphasize the importance of the commercial space industry for fostering its growth. The commercial space industry has been purposely insulated from certain federal regulations to promote its growth. The Commercial Space Launch Act allows the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations for launch vehicles to protect crew safety. Global spending on space activity in 2015 was around $323 billion, with commercial space products and services contributing nearly 40% of the total. The U.S. government accounted for about 14% of global spending on space. The commercial space industry, including agencies like NASA, accounts for 14% of global spending, with other countries contributing 10%. Commercial payloads are launched into orbit by firms that also design and assemble rockets. Satellites and manned capsules are manufactured by other companies, with ground stations controlled by various entities. The satellite supply chain is global, with a few manufacturers custom-making satellites for users. The satellite supply chain is global, with a limited number of manufacturers custom-making satellites for users. Extensive testing is required to ensure they will operate in space where replacement and repair are not options. Rocket launch deadlines are governed by satellite launch windows, and minimizing satellite mass is crucial to reduce launch costs. The United States is the largest spacecraft manufacturer, followed by the European Union and Russia. The global commercial satellite manufacturing sector had $6 billion in revenues in 2015, with 86 launches carrying 262 spacecraft. Smaller satellites weighing less than 22 pounds have doubled in number, but still make up a small portion of the total satellite mass launched. Satellites generally use similar components like solar panels for electricity generation and propulsion tanks for orbit control. The satellite's thermal control system protects internal components from extreme temperatures in space, using a multilayer thermal blanket and optical solar reflectors. An electronics system manages satellite functions and a communications system handles data transmission. A communications system on a satellite includes a transmitter, receiver, antenna, and amplifier for data transmission. Specialized components vary based on the satellite's mission, such as image sensors for remote sensing satellites. Satellites are placed in different Earth orbits like low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous Earth orbit, and high Earth orbit, depending on their purpose and altitude. Some satellites operate closer to Earth for maintenance and higher-resolution imaging, while others operate farther for better service deployment. The International Space Station (ISS) is in low Earth orbit, taking 90 minutes for a full orbit, while a geosynchronous satellite matches Earth's rotational speed, providing constant coverage for weather monitoring or telecommunications. As of June 2016, there were 1,419 satellites in operation, with the majority in low Earth orbit. The U.S. has the most satellites, with a mix of commercial, military, government, and civil purposes. The commercial launch industry generated $2.6 billion in revenues in 2015 from 86 rocket launches. In 2015, the commercial launch industry generated $2.6 billion in revenues from 86 rocket launches. Of these, 83 launches successfully placed payloads into orbit, with 22 carrying commercial satellites and 64 carrying government payloads. The total costs of global launches for commercial, civil, and military purposes in 2015 were estimated at about $8 billion. Factors spurring the growth of the U.S. launch industry included the NASA commercial cargo program, aggressive pricing by SpaceX and other private providers, and the emerging space tourism and small satellite industries. Traditional spaceports included Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Vandenberg Air Force Base. Spaceports in Florida and California, as well as Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, have been used by the federal government and commercial space providers. The FAA has licensed 10 spaceports in seven states for various launch activities. These spaceports cater to different types of launch vehicles and have common infrastructure needs. The International Space Station (ISS) provides facilities for assembling rockets, storing propellants, cargo, and payloads, as well as workspaces for crews and engineers. It also offers launch services and serves as a national laboratory for NASA and private industry. The ISS has been used to launch small satellites into orbit, with 42 satellites launched in 2015. Since the retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle in 2011, the ISS has been resupplied by other means. Since the retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle in 2011, the International Space Station (ISS) has been resupplied by commercial launches through NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, as well as launches by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Russian Soyuz rockets. Launch vehicles have the primary function of putting a spacecraft into orbit or a suborbital trajectory, with most rocket stages falling away in sequence until the spacecraft reaches its planned orbit. Some commercial providers are developing reusable vehicles. The United Launch Alliance Atlas V is a vehicle used for launching payloads into orbit. It consists of a nose cone fairing to protect the payload, a second-stage rocket with fuel tanks and a rocket engine, propelled by a single RL 10 Centaur engine. The stainless steel fuel tanks are thin and insulated to maximize engine performance. The Centaur second stage of the Atlas V rocket includes flight and guidance computers for autonomous control. Adapters connect the first and second stages, housing vehicle electronics. The first stage has fuel and oxygen tanks, control systems, and rocket engines. The main booster is made of special aluminum and fueled by rocket propellant and liquid oxygen, providing 860,300 lbf of thrust. The RD 180 engine was developed in Russia and is produced by a U.S.-Russian joint venture. Ground systems transmit directions to satellites and receive data, including antenna services for radio frequency transmission. Ground systems for satellite communication include antenna services for RF signal transmission and reception. Data streams are decoded before distribution and analysis. Customized options may include government-owned and commercial assets to maximize communication capability. User terminals, such as handheld mobile devices and rooftop dish antennae, are part of ground facilities. Smaller onboard data storage is needed for satellites in frequent contact with ground stations. Ground systems for satellite communication involve antenna services for RF signal transmission and reception, data accounting, distribution, and processing services. These services are automated and operate 24/7 with minimal human intervention. The need for international standards is increasing to ensure interoperability among systems and service providers in the expanding global space economy. Ground stations and related equipment generate over $100 billion in revenue, providing consumer products like satellite phones, navigation chips, and geolocation equipment. Global commercial space products and services, including geolocation and navigation equipment like GPS receivers, generated $126 billion in revenue in 2015. Major commercial categories include communications systems for relaying signals, satellite television, earth observation for environmental monitoring, and global atmospheric monitoring for meteorological use. Global atmospheric monitoring collects data for meteorological predictions, soil water content for drought and flood forecasts, and provides geolocation services for transportation and safety enhancement. Satellites also serve noncommercial purposes such as national security, detecting missile launches, nuclear explosions, and providing jam-resistant communications. Space launches are risky, with three out of 86 commercial launches in the US failing in 2015. Insurance coverage plays a crucial role in the commercial space industry due to potential losses from rocket failures. In 2015, global space insurance premiums exceeded $700 million, with insured losses surpassing $600 million in 2014. Major insurers like American International Group, Munich Re, and Allianz compete in this market. However, there are limitations to insurance coverage for space-related risks. For instance, in September 2016, a SpaceX rocket exploded on the launchpad in Florida, destroying a satellite it was preparing to launch. The rocket was reportedly uninsured, while the satellite had $300 million in coverage, which may not apply due to the explosion occurring during a prelaunch test. These incidents are reshaping the commercial space industry. Three developments are reshaping the commercial space industry: a shift towards commercial services in government space activities, increased private financing, and a rise in small satellite launches. NASA now contracts out for services, transferring risk to commercial entities and leaving ownership of launch vehicles to them. NASA's procurement approach depends on the program mission, with a fixed price agreed upon for services rather than a cost-plus methodology. NASA has shifted towards commercial services for space activities, with contractors sharing costs and meeting project milestones. Commercial partners like SpaceX and Orbital ATK have developed systems to transport crew and cargo to the ISS. Boeing and SpaceX are working on ISS crew transportation capabilities. SpaceX and Blue Origin are revolutionizing the launch market with reusable rocket boosters. Private financing options, including venture capital and debt financing, have fueled over $13 billion in investments in space-related industries between 2000 and 2015. In 2015 alone, $2.3 billion was invested, a record high for one year. In recent years, there has been a surge in space-related capital investment, reaching a record high of $2.3 billion in one year. Wealthy business owners, corporations, and banks are investing in space ventures, leading to the establishment of new companies. Investors are attracted to the space industry due to the potential drop in launch costs with reusable rockets and the development of new products and services like space tourism and satellite data collection. This has enabled the development of small satellites for Earth imaging and space-based Internet networks. Imaging and establishing space-based Internet networks from LEO is now possible with miniaturized and standardized satellite components. Small satellite constellations, like Planet Labs' 36 satellites, offer closer Earth imaging at lower costs. The demand for data is driving the small satellite market, making space access affordable for researchers, companies, and governments. Startup firms are addressing the small satellite market with hopes of success. Launch costs for small satellites can be as low as a few million dollars per satellite. The small satellite market is being targeted by startup firms like Firefly Space Systems, Rocket Lab, and OneWeb, offering broadband, remote imaging, and communication services. Virgin Galactic is proposing a new launcher attached to a modified 747 jet to reduce costs. NASA is using CubeSats for scientific research and student involvement, launching 42 small satellites to the ISS in 2015. The commercial space industry workforce is declining, while national security workforces remain steady. Employment peaked in 2006 at 267,000 employees and has since decreased. Reasons for the decline include the termination of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011 and challenges in recruiting young talent. Skilled workers reaching retirement age also contribute to the decrease in space industry employment. The Space Foundation has identified six industry sectors that approximate the space industry, with employment dropping by 16% from 2005 to 2015. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data do not fully represent the space industry workforce, as they include both space and nonspace activity. The 2012 space industry report by the U.S. Department of Commerce provides an alternative approach to assessing the size and breadth of the space industry workforce. The 2012 survey by the U.S. Department of Commerce identified 254,179 employees in 611 commercial companies dependent on federal space programs. Additionally, there were 13,897 space-related jobs in the U.S. government, 19,630 in nonprofit organizations, and 60,533 at universities, totaling 348,239 workers dependent on space-related programs. The report also noted a 7% decrease in employment at companies dependent on commercial space programs from 2009 to 2012, with average industry salaries of $111,000, double the average private-sector wage. The average salary in the commercial space industry is $111,000, double the average private-sector wage. Salaries vary within different industry categories. Three key issues affecting the industry's future include regulation by federal agencies, new export control laws, and spectrum allocation for satellite use. Federal agencies like the FAA regulate commercial space activities. The Department of Commerce oversees space industry interests, including licensing commercial imaging satellites for weather forecasting and environmental data collection. It also promotes economic growth in the U.S. commercial space industry and administers export controls for space industry components. NASA provides infrastructure support and encourages private-sector investment, while the Department of Defense utilizes commercial space systems for national security purposes. The Department of Defense uses commercial space systems for national security purposes, providing infrastructure, operations support, and safety oversight for launches. The Defense Technology Security Administration reviews export license applications, while the Department of State manages export and temporary import of defense articles and services. The Federal Communications Commission licenses commercial satellite radio frequencies and determines satellite placement in geostationary orbit. Changes may be needed in the regulatory structure as the commercial space industry expands. Private firms may take on more responsibilities for launching government satellites, space flights for tourists, asteroid and moon mining operations, and Mars exploration and settlement. This could increase commercial demand for FAA processing licenses, permits, and safety reviews. Congress may need to establish legal parameters for passenger safety in space tourism and space traffic management. Liability risk-sharing between launch companies and the U.S. government may need adjustments as the industry grows. Integrating commercial space launches into the air traffic control system is a key concern for FAA. The FAA closes airspace near rocket launch sites due to tracking limitations, causing delays for commercial and military aircraft. Efforts are being made to reduce air space closures through automated alerts. Legislation proposed in Congress aims to change federal oversight of commercial space, including plans for Mars exploration and establishing an Office of Commercial Space Transportation. The Department of Transportation is tasked with establishing an Office of Commercial Space Transportation and an Office of Spaceports, as well as designating a lead government agency for space traffic management. Regulations for spacecraft, ground stations, and unique components fall under the U.S. export control system as dual-use items with potential military applications. Regulatory authority over these products was transferred from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce in the 1990s but returned to DOS in 1998. In the 1990s, regulatory authority over spacecraft and related items was transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Department of State. However, in 1998, after concerns about satellite designs being improperly transferred to China, regulatory authority was returned to the Department of State. This move was criticized by the satellite industry for causing a loss of sales abroad and a decrease in the U.S. share of the global commercial satellite market. In 2013, Congress transferred export control responsibilities for 80% of satellites back to the Department of Commerce, but some commercial items, such as apertures on electro-optical satellites, are still under Department of State control. The satellite industry is concerned about the transfer of certain items from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce, including apertures on electro-optical satellites and integrated propulsion systems. There are also concerns about restrictions in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) affecting space tourism development, such as limitations on launch vehicles and potential export controls on space tourism rockets. Additionally, sharing certain bands for future wireless 5G use could impact satellite transmissions. The satellite industry is worried that sharing frequency bands for future wireless 5G use could affect the reliability and cost-effectiveness of their services. Satellites communicate on specific frequency bands assigned by the ITU, with different bands used for different purposes. The Obama Administration directed the FCC to identify spectrum for expanding Wi-Fi services, leading to the collaboration between FCC and NTIA to identify 500 MHz of spectrum suitable for wireless broadband. The NTIA collaborated in identifying 500 MHz of spectrum for wireless broadband, including sharing frequencies in the 28 GHz band previously used for satellite transmissions. The satellite industry is concerned about potential impacts on their services, emphasizing the importance of satellite technology in providing efficient and cost-effective services. The FCC's ruling in July 2016 aimed to balance wireless services and satellite operations, ensuring diverse users can coexist. Congressional interest in satellite spectrum led to H.R. 4945 directing the FCC to preserve electromagnetic access in the 27.5-28.35 GHz band. The FCC is evaluating a proposal by Ligado Networks to share the 1675-1680 band with NOAA, which has raised concerns about potential interference with GPS signals and critical sectors like emergency response and aviation safety."
