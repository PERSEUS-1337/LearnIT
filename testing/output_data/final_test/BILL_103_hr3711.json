    "content": "The Act titled \"National Center for Excellence in Research and Development Act of 1993\" may be cited as such. The findings section follows. The Congress finds it crucial to maintain the Nevada Test Site for nuclear arsenal readiness and technological research in the 21st century. The Nevada Test Site in the 21st century supports technology development for private-sector industries and military projects, nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship, non-proliferation efforts, and environmental testing for government, industry, and academia. It also facilitates testing of environmental clean-up technologies. The Nevada Test Site supports testing of alternative and renewable energy sources, disarmament activities, non-proliferation experiments, and treaty-compliant experiments for stockpile stewardship purposes due to its size and remoteness. The Nevada Test Site is well-suited for various activities related to restructuring the US military. The purpose of this Act is to ensure operational readiness of the underground nuclear testing facilities at the Nevada Test Site, maintain funding for readiness, establish a National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence for various purposes, and allow private-sector industries to utilize the site for research and development. SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF READINESS CAPABILITY OF NEVADA TEST SITE. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 1995 to maintain operational readiness of underground nuclear testing facilities and infrastructure at Nevada Test Site. Staffing levels to be maintained at levels equal to fiscal year 1992. Adjustments for inflation using Consumer Price Index. The Secretary of Energy will conduct environmental and infrastructure activities at the Nevada Test Site to support new projects and initiatives during fiscal year 1992. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence will be established. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence is established within the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site. Its purpose is to promote disarmament, demilitarization, alternative and renewable energy sources, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, sensor development, and environmentally sensitive technologies, including testing and demonstration activities related to solar and geothermal resources. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Nevada Test Site aims to develop two 100-megawatt solar power plants by 2000 and demonstrate the regional use of natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen as vehicle fuels. It also conducts testing and demonstration activities related to changes in the US military post-Cold War, including demilitarization of rocket motors and disarmament. Additionally, the Center carries out testing and demonstration activities related to nuclear stockpile stewardship. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Nevada Test Site conducts testing and demonstration activities related to the stewardship of the US nuclear stockpile. This includes treaty-compliant experiments, support to the Department of Energy nuclear weapons complex, and programs for developing simulator technologies for nuclear weapons design and effects. Additionally, the Center carries out experiments related to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Nevada Test Site conducts testing and demonstration activities related to environmental technologies, including remediation of toxic chemicals, emergency response training, and testing of various technologies appropriate for the site. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 1995 to the Secretary of Energy to carry out the Act, excluding section 4 provisions."
