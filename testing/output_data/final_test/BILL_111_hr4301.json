    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iranian Digital Empowerment Act\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. The \"Iranian Digital Empowerment Act\" highlights Iran's government interfering with people's access to independent news and information through electronic media. This includes the purchase of a telecommunications company by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and the establishment of a security force to monitor opposition activities online. The government has also restricted internet and telecommunications access, particularly before student demonstrations in December 2009. Iran restricted Internet and telecommunications access to limit dissent after the 2009 elections. The US urged Twitter to delay maintenance to support Iranian communication. The US aims to avoid unintentionally aiding Iran's repressive policies. Current sanctions on Iran have unintentionally restricted Iranians' access to the Internet and messaging services provided by Microsoft and Google. The US government aims to ensure the flow of information through the Internet aligns with its policy interests. The US Congress supports the Iranian people's freedom of speech, press, and assembly, encourages access to information and communication technologies, and promotes bypassing censorship for unfettered Internet access as a civil liberty for all. Authorization of exports of certain software and related services to Iran is granted. The export of software and related services to Iran by United States persons is authorized, with exceptions for government use. This includes software for circumventing online censorship and enabling personal communication for Iranian citizens. The term \"Government of Iran\" includes political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. An agency or instrumentality is defined as a foreign state entity. This section applies to the export of software and related services to Iran after the enactment of this Act."
