    "content": "About 27.5% of state and local government employees in the United States, approximately 6.6 million people, work in positions not covered by Social Security. Congress mandated Social Security coverage for most of these employees in July 1991. Once covered, it is generally permanent, and future employees in these positions must participate. There have been ongoing debates about mandating Social Security coverage for all state and local government employees in the future. This report discusses the potential advantages and disadvantages of mandating Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees. Social Security coverage is currently extended through \"Section 218 Agreements\" between states and the Social Security Administration. Each state designates a State Social Security Administrator to oversee coverage. The State Social Security Administrator is responsible for overseeing coverage of state and local government subdivisions under Section 218 Agreements. Coverage varies by state, with positions, not individuals, being covered. The Administrator serves as a liaison between state and local employers and the SSA, providing information on Social Security and Medicare coverage. If a government position is covered, any employee filling that position is subject to payroll taxes. The State Social Security Administrator oversees coverage of state and local government subdivisions under Section 218 Agreements. Coverage is extended to employee positions in groups known as \"coverage groups,\" not on an individual basis. Various laws and regulations govern how coverage may be extended via employee referendums. Once Social Security coverage is provided, it cannot be terminated, and all future employees in covered positions are required to participate in Social Security. The 1935 Social Security Act did not initially extend coverage to state and local government workers. In 1950, Section 218 was added to the Social Security Act, allowing states to elect coverage for certain state and local government employees. Amendments in 1954 and 1956 expanded coverage options, including divided retirement systems. Until 1983, public employers could opt in and out of the Social Security program. In 1983, legislation prohibited public employees from withdrawing from the Social Security program once they are in it. The Supreme Court rejected California's challenge to this law. In 1984, Congress extended Social Security coverage to many groups, including state and local government employees, Members of Congress, and federal civilian employees hired after January 1, 1984. In 1990, Congress made Social Security coverage mandatory for most state and local government employees without an alternative pension plan. About 27.5% of state and local government employees in the US are not covered by Social Security. About 6.6 million state and local government employees in the US are not covered by Social Security, with coverage rates varying across states. In some states, such as Arizona, New York, and Vermont, over 95% of government employees are covered, while in states like Massachusetts and Ohio, less than 5% are covered. States with less than half of government employees covered include California, Colorado, Louisiana, Nevada, and Texas. The majority of non-covered employees reside in California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio. Almost half of non-covered state and local government employees reside in California, Texas, and Ohio. Recent deficit reduction groups recommend mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired government employees to increase program universality. The Bipartisan Policy Center suggests implementing coverage starting in 2020 and requiring pension plans to share data with SSA until the transition is complete. The implementation of mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees should be delayed until 2020 to allow time for pension system reforms. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform recommended this change to address the poor fiscal condition of state and local governments and the underfunding of public employee pensions. Sharing data with the Social Security Administration is also recommended for state and local pension plans. The commission recommended that state and local pension plans share data with SSA to improve benefits coordination for workers. Issues include the financial status of Social Security, benefit protections, impact on states with separate pension systems, and broader social implications. Projections show a 16% average shortfall in Social Security income over the next 75 years. The trustees project that Social Security expenditures will exceed income starting in 2023, with trust fund assets exhausted by 2036. Benefits can be paid in full until 2036, after which revenues will cover three-fourths of payments. The impact of covering newly hired state and local government employees on the Trust Funds is estimated. Two options are discussed - immediate implementation in 2011 or delayed implementation in 2020. The implementation date for mandatory Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local government employees is projected to have a positive effect on the Social Security Trust Funds. If implemented in 2011, it would close 9% of the system's funding shortfall and extend the trust fund exhaustion date to 2040. If implemented in 2020, it would close 8% of the funding shortfall and extend the exhaustion date to 2039. The greatest positive effect on Social Security's finances would occur during the initial period following implementation. Expanding Social Security coverage to include all state and local government employees hired after December 31, 2011, is projected to increase revenues by about $24 billion over 5 years and $96 billion over 10 years, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office. These revenues would be credited to the Social Security Trust Funds and become available in the Treasury's general fund for other government operations. Expanding Social Security coverage to include all state and local government employees hired after December 31, 2011, is projected to increase revenues by about $24 billion over 5 years and $96 billion over 10 years. The estimates do not include any effect on outlays during the 2012 to 2021 period, as most employees hired during this time would not receive benefits for many years. Beyond the 10-year projection window, additional benefit payments are estimated to be about half the size of the additional revenues. Making Social Security coverage more universal could simplify retirement planning and benefit coordination for workers with careers in both government and other sectors. Mandatory coverage for new hires could prevent gaps in pension or Social Security coverage, leading to better retirement outcomes. Expanding Social Security coverage to include all state and local government employees hired after December 31, 2011, would prevent gaps in pension or Social Security coverage, resulting in better retirement, survivor, and disability insurance protections for workers who move between positions. Mandatory coverage could provide dependents' and survivors' benefits under Social Security that are generally not available under state and local pension plans. For example, spouses or former spouses could receive a benefit equal to 50% of the worker's basic monthly benefit amount. Expanding Social Security coverage to include all state and local government employees hired after December 31, 2011, would provide better retirement, survivor, and disability insurance protections. Social Security offers benefits for spouses and widows equal to a percentage of the worker's basic monthly benefit amount, which most state and local pension plans do not provide. State and local pension plans may only offer modest benefits to young widows and require the deceased worker to have elected a joint-and-survivor annuity option for benefits to be available at retirement age. Mandatory coverage could lead to improved benefit protections, including full cost-of-living adjustments, under Social Security. State and local pension plans typically cap cost-of-living adjustments at 3%, despite offering some inflation protection. Some argue that state and local pension plans are underfunded, leading to potential benefit reductions or contribution increases in the future. Adding a Social Security benefit component to these plans could offer better protection for workers at risk of losing non-covered pensions. However, opponents believe mandatory Social Security coverage may not necessarily improve benefit protections for workers. Mandatory Social Security coverage may not result in better benefit protections for workers, as state and local governments could reduce pension benefits to control costs. Congress could also make changes to Social Security that increase payroll taxes and lower benefits for current workers. State and local government employees are typically higher-wage workers, receiving lower replacement rates under Social Security compared to lower-wage workers. Some argue that mandatory Social Security coverage may not benefit all workers, as certain occupations may have better retirement systems tailored to their needs. For example, public pension plans for fire fighters and police officers offer full benefits at younger ages and with fewer years of service compared to other plans. Social Security benefits start at age 62, with reduced benefits for early claims before full retirement age. Social Security benefits are based on a worker's 35 highest years of earnings in covered employment, with years of no earnings counted as zeros. Some argue that public pension plans for certain workers reflect the demands of their occupations. The International Association of Fire Fighters opposes mandatory Social Security coverage for non-covered public sector employees. The IAFF opposes mandatory Social Security coverage for non-covered public sector employees, citing concerns about undermining existing pension systems that provide superior benefits. Congress could use the Federal Employees' Retirement System as a model to address differences between non-covered pension plans and Social Security for newly hired state and local government employees. The FERS supplement provides additional benefits to certain federal employees who retire before age 62, such as law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers. It is equal to the estimated Social Security benefit earned while employed by the federal government and is paid until age 62. Retirement benefits from state and local pension plans are not as portable as Social Security benefits. Defined benefit plans are based on years of service and final pay, but frequent job changes may prevent workers from becoming vested. Benefit amounts are not indexed for inflation, potentially reducing benefits for workers who leave before retirement. Social Security beneficiaries can continue to build years of service and earnings regardless of when they left covered employment. Two provisions, the windfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset (GPO), affect individuals receiving a non-covered pension. The WEP reduces Social Security retirement benefits for those with fewer than 30 years of coverage. The worker's Social Security retirement benefit is calculated using the windfall benefit formula, resulting in a lower initial monthly benefit. The reduction in the benefit under the WEP is phased out for workers with 21-30 years of Social Security-covered employment, limited to half of the non-covered pension amount. The windfall benefit formula aims to eliminate an unintended advantage for workers with less than a full career in Social Security-covered employment. The Social Security benefit formula is progressive, providing a higher replacement rate for long-term, low-wage workers. The windfall benefit formula aims to remove unintended advantages for workers with less than a full career in Social Security-covered employment. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces a person's Social Security spousal benefit by two-thirds of their non-covered pension amount. The dual entitlement rule affects individuals eligible for both Social Security retired-worker and spousal benefits, with the spousal benefit reduced by 100% of the retired-worker benefit amount. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO) are controversial provisions in Social Security law, with calls for modification or repeal due to perceived unfairness. The Social Security Administration relies on self-reported data to determine benefit reductions under these provisions. The WEP and GPO provisions in Social Security law require individuals receiving non-covered pensions to inform SSA to apply benefit reductions. Proposals have been made to enforce these provisions, with potential savings of $3.4 billion over 10 years. Mandatory Social Security coverage for state and local government employees could eliminate the need for WEP and GPO. The potential elimination of the WEP and GPO provisions in Social Security law could impact state and local government pension plans. Employers may adjust pension benefits for newly hired public employees to accommodate mandatory Social Security coverage. Options for state and local governments include maintaining current pension structures, providing different benefit structures, creating new pension plans, or eliminating pension benefits for new employees. States and local governments may need to adjust pension benefits for new employees to accommodate mandatory Social Security coverage. Options include maintaining current pension structures, offering different benefit structures, or eliminating pension benefits for new hires. Some changes states and localities may consider for pension plans include lowering accrual rates, adjusting benefit formulas, altering early retirement benefits, or implementing defined contribution pensions. In some cases, employers may freeze pension plans, either through a hard freeze where benefits cease accruing, or a soft freeze where current participants continue to accrue benefits. In a soft freeze, a pension plan is closed to new entrants but current participants continue to accrue benefits. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from March 2009 showed that 10% of state and local government workers in a DB pension plan were in a frozen plan, with 99% still accruing benefits. 94% of workers in frozen plans had been frozen for over five years, and 95% were offered a new DB pension plan. None were offered a new DC pension plan. Increased costs may arise from states operating multiple pension plans or benefit structures within one plan. Operating multiple pension plans or benefit structures within a single pension plan could lead to increased costs. States may choose to offer a combination of DB and DC pension benefits, which could take years to implement. The impact on costs to employees and governments depends on the type of pension benefit structure adopted in response to mandatory participation in Social Security. Factors such as Social Security payroll taxes, employer and employee contributions to retirement plans, and potential decreases in pension benefits for new employees could result in lower contributions from employers and possibly employees. The impact of decreased contributions to underfunded pension plans could strain financial resources. Plans without sufficient assets may face funding shortfalls, leading to benefits not being fully funded. Sponsors of such plans would need to make up for these shortfalls eventually. While many government pension plans lack assets to cover all promised benefits, participants are not at immediate risk of not receiving their benefits. Many state and local pension plans may not have enough funds to cover all promised benefits, leading to potential funding shortfalls. Sources to make up for these shortfalls include state or local general revenues, increased employee contributions, and higher returns on investments. However, increasing investment risk could backfire in a market downturn, as pension fund investments may lose value without a safety net like a pension insurance system. State and local pension plans do not have the safety net of a pension insurance system like the PBGC for private-sector plans. In 2007, there were 2,547 state and local pension plans with 18.5 million participants, mostly in local plans. Statewide plans had over 90% of participants, with an average of 8,755 participants per plan. The average number of participants per state and local pension plan was 8,755, with a median of 43 participants. The funding ratio of a pension plan indicates its ability to pay promised benefits, with a ratio of 100% meaning it has enough funds to meet obligations. Funding ratios below 100% suggest future benefit obligations may not be met. Data from 122 public pension plans show their funding ratios, covering approximately 90% of plans in the database. In 2009, among 122 state and local government pension plans, the median funding ratio was 77.5%. Some plans were well-funded, with 11 plans having ratios of 100% or greater. However, nearly one-third of plans had funding ratios below 70%. Mandating Social Security coverage for all public employees could create administrative burdens for governments. Mandating Social Security coverage for all public employees would require extensive negotiations with state and local governments to redesign existing pension systems. The process could take up to four years, as seen when Social Security coverage was mandated for new federal workers in 1983. Additional costs would include communication with employees, actuarial reviews, and the need to administer two systems temporarily. Opponents of mandatory Social Security coverage for all public employees argue about potential legal issues and constitutional challenges. Some believe that the existing system already withholds federal income taxes, minimizing additional administrative costs. The debate also includes discussions on the benefits provided by Social Security, such as disability, dependents', and survivors' benefits, in addition to retirement benefits. Social Security redistributes income from higher-earning workers to lower-earning workers. State and local government workers, who may not participate in Social Security, miss out on the poverty reduction benefits. This places an extra burden on higher-earning workers within the system. An effective Social Security program helps reduce public costs for relief and assistance, leading to lower general taxes. Non-covered workers do not share ongoing costs related to the program's start-up, resulting in legacy costs that are covered by current payroll tax revenues. Non-covered workers do not share in legacy costs of Social Security, leading to increased beneficiaries with mandatory coverage. Supporters argue for mandatory coverage to ensure contributions throughout careers, while opponents maintain against it. Opponents of mandatory Social Security coverage argue that existing benefit reductions already consider workers with alternative pension plans. They believe that states and localities have had the opportunity to decide on Social Security coverage, making mandatory coverage unfair for those not participating. The majority of state and local government employees are already covered by Social Security, but proposals for mandatory coverage for future hires have been debated for years. The potential advantages and disadvantages of mandatory Social Security coverage include long-term financial status, benefit protections, impact on public pension plans, and broader social implications."
