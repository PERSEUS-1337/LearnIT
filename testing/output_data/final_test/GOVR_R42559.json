    "content": "Haiti, located on the western third of the island of Hispaniola, has faced challenges in overcoming its history of authoritarianism, poverty, and underdevelopment since the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986. Despite progress in governance, democratic institutions remain weak, and poverty and economic disparity persist. The United States has shown concern for Haiti's stability and has supported efforts to improve conditions in the country for the past 25 years. In 1986, pressure led dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to flee Haiti, ending his 29-year oppressive rule. Haitians approved a new constitution in 1987 to establish a democratic government. In 1990, Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected president in Haiti's first free and fair elections. However, he was overthrown in a coup in 1991, leading to his exile in the United States. In 1994, Aristide returned to Haiti under U.S. protection and disbanded the army. He was succeeded by Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val in 1996, reelected in 2001, but faced political conflict leading to his government's collapse in 2004. Aristide went into exile again, and an interim government ruled from 2004 to 2006. An interim government ruled Haiti from 2004 to 2006 following Aristide's exile. Charges of corruption, dissolution of parliament, questions of legitimacy, and flawed elections hindered the establishment of a fully functioning government. With support from the United Nations, security conditions improved, police reform began, and elections were held in 2006. Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val started his second term as president, overseeing internal political stability and economic growth until 2007. In 2007, the Pr\u00e9val Administration published its Poverty Reduction Strategy, meeting IMF requirements for debt relief. International donors pledged over $1.5 billion in economic assistance to Haiti. Democratization in Haiti led to government capacity and transparency improvements. Haiti made remarkable progress towards political stability and economic stabilization from 2004 to 2009 with international support. Elected governments enacted reforms in economic governance, conducted democratic elections, and received technical and financial assistance for development plans. Haiti made progress in reducing human rights violations, improving fiscal management, and transparency to qualify for debt relief. Security improved enough for the UN to shift focus from security to development. However, political and climatic challenges continued to threaten Haiti's stability, leading to a food crisis and the removal of the prime minister in 2008. In 2008, Haiti faced political instability after the prime minister was removed. U.N. officials noted that political opponents and armed gangs disrupted protests, hindering the government's ability to function. The country struggled with governance as multiple political parties vied for power, leading to challenges in implementing programs and agreements with foreign donors. The situation worsened after a devastating earthquake in January 2010, which caused significant loss of life, including many government officials, and extensive damage to government infrastructure. After the devastating earthquake in January 2010, Haiti faced political instability with the destruction of key government buildings and records. Michel Martelly, a former entertainer, became president in 2011, marking the first peaceful transfer of power between opposing parties in Haitian history. However, his term has been marked by gridlock between the executive and legislative branches, hindering progress in democratization efforts. Challenges remain with government independence, a weak judicial system, and widespread corruption. Haitian governance capacities were significantly weakened by the earthquake, leading to a lack of independence in government, a weak judicial system, and ongoing issues with corruption and political violence. President Martelly acknowledges the institutional weaknesses and calls for international assistance to strengthen them. Progress in reconstruction and the distribution of over $9 billion in aid is perceived as slow by the Haitian public, fueling frustration with both international donors and the government. The failure to hold overdue elections has sparked unrest and calls for Martelly's resignation. The Haitian constitution limits presidents to two nonconsecutive five-year terms, with no term limits for the legislature. The first round of elections in 2010 saw 19 candidates vying to succeed President Pr\u00e9val. If no candidate receives an absolute majority, a runoff vote is held for presidential and legislative seats. The focus of elections in Haiti tends to be on personalities rather than parties or issues. The Public Policy Intervention Group, supported by international organizations, organized debates for all 19 presidential candidates in Haiti. The first round led to disputes and violence, but after accepting observer recommendations, a second round took place between Mirlande Manigat and Michel Martelly, a popular musician with financial issues. Michel Martelly, a popular musician with financial issues, won the 2011 elections in Haiti with low voter turnout. His inauguration took place on May 14, 2011, for a five-year term. The legislative elections were marred by fraud allegations, leading to violent protests and deaths. The legislature sworn in on April 25, 2011, was incomplete due to challenged results in 19 districts. The final results of the legislative elections in Haiti were challenged, with international observers reporting changes favoring candidates linked to President Pr\u00e9val's coalition. The provisional electoral council endorsed 15 of the 19 original results, allowing those legislators to take their seats. The remaining four disputed seats will be voted on in the next elections. President Martelly, needing to negotiate with the Init\u00e9 coalition that secured a majority in both houses, worked on passing constitutional reforms quickly before his inauguration. Controversy arose over the status of constitutional amendments in Haiti. The amendments were in limbo for about a year due to discrepancies in the wording sent for publication. President Martelly intervened in June 2011 to stop an altered version from being printed. After debate, the original amendments were finally published in June 2012, allowing Haitians with dual citizenship to vote and hold government positions. The Haitian government passed constitutional amendments allowing Haitians with dual citizenship to vote and hold government positions, except for key leadership roles. President Martelly praised the cooperation between branches of government in publishing the corrected amendments, which also included a new process for selecting members of the electoral council. Forming an electoral council in Haiti has been problematic, leading to delays in holding elections. President Martelly fired the previous council members in 2011 but did not form a new council until 2012, causing legislative seats to expire without replacements. This hindered the Senate's ability to conduct business and pass necessary electoral laws. The Init\u00e9 party lost senators and influence in the Senate, while President Martelly's Peasant Response party had no Senate members. Elections were delayed, leading to protests and calls for Martelly's resignation. Concerns were raised over the replacement of mayors with government appointees. In December 2014, Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe resigned under pressure over the government's failure to resolve the electoral impasse in Haiti. President Martelly began ruling by decree as the legislature was dissolved, escalating the political crisis in 2015. In early 2015, President Martelly appointed Evans Paul as his fifth prime minister, but the legislature did not confirm him before dissolving. The Haitian government established a new Provisional Electoral Council to address the ongoing crisis and announced dates for elections in 2015. The new CEP faced challenges due to inexperienced personnel and had to establish internal procedures for the complex races with numerous political parties and candidates. Candidates qualified to run for Senate and Chamber of Deputies seats in Haiti, with Guy Philippe, leader of the 2004 coup, among the Senate candidates. About 70 candidates registered for president, with 170 candidates rejected by the CEP. Former Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe and six other ministers were not cleared to run for president. Senate certification is required for candidates to run, with none of the rejected candidates receiving the necessary \"discharge.\" Former Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe was not cleared to run for president due to alleged irregularities during his time as minister of planning. His exclusion was deemed politically motivated, and a judge ruled that without a functioning parliament, the discharge requirement should be waived. Additionally, First Lady Sophia Martelly was rejected as a Senate candidate for dual citizenship and lack of discharge, despite handling public funds. President Martelly expressed concern that her rejection could discredit the electoral process. The protests and political tensions preceding the elections raised security concerns, exacerbated by the reduction of international troops in Haiti. Despite the government's request to delay the troop drawdown, the United Nations proceeded as scheduled. The Haitian National Police was tasked with election security during the first round of legislative elections on August 9, 2015. The first round of legislative elections on August 9, 2015 was marred by delays, disorder, low turnout, and sporadic violence. The Organization of American States (OAS) found irregularities but deemed the results valid. However, the CEP invalidated the vote in 13% of polling centers due to severe violence and technical issues. Electoral officials disqualified 14 candidates for inciting violence. Some opposition parties and protesters lacked confidence in the CEP during the elections, citing problems and inconsistent decisions. Verite boycotted the October elections after its candidate was barred, but still won some seats. A CEP member resigned in early October due to concerns about processes and the need for inclusive elections. Despite issues, the CEP managed runoff legislative and first-round presidential elections simultaneously with municipal elections on October 25. The October elections in Haiti saw 54 presidential candidates vying for 1,280 municipal administrations. The OAS praised the elections as an improvement, with higher voter turnout at 26%. Jovenel Moise and Jude Celestin advanced to a runoff, with Moise leading with 33% of the vote. Despite initial calm, post-election protests and disputes arose over the vote's validity. Celestin, the government's construction chief under the Pr\u00e9val administration, received 25% of the vote in the presidential elections. Eight candidates known as the G-8 alleged fraud and called for a recount, with Celestin considering not running in the runoff. Maryse Narcysse, who ran for Fanmi Lavalas, filed fraud complaints that were resolved by the CEP. Calls for the cancellation of the elections and the formation of an interim government have been made. Narcisse's lawyer criticized the CEP process, with calls for an independent recount from various groups. A local observation group reported electoral fraud and violence involving political parties, especially the governing party. Some acknowledge irregularities but question the opposition's evidence of orchestrated fraud. Independent observers are concerned about presidential candidates not following formal dispute procedures. A group of presidential candidates in Haiti have refused to use formal dispute procedures and instead demand verification of vote tabulation by an Independent Commission. Allegations of bribery to secure places in runoffs have increased tensions, leading to the postponement of the presidential elections. President Martelly formed a five-member independent commission to investigate the impasse with the opposition, with a one-week deadline for their investigation. The Independent Commission in Haiti has a week to set the scope of its investigation. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon calls for power transfer through elections within the constitutional timeframe. Elections for local administrations were to be held simultaneously with the presidential runoff elections, but it is unclear if they will still be combined. The estimated cost for three rounds of elections in Haiti is $66 million. The cost of conducting three rounds of elections in Haiti is estimated at $66 million. The UNDP manages the \"Basket Fund\" with contributions from various donors, including the Haitian and U.S. governments. Trinidad and Tobago and Mexico have also pledged financial support. Elections in Haiti have historically been contentious due to the transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, leading to political tensions and instability in the short term. However, elected governments have gradually strengthened government capacity and transparency in the long term. The international community is concerned about political polarization and stability in Haiti due to delays in elections. The United Nations has reduced its troops in the country, despite the Haitian government's request for a delay until after elections. The Haitian National Police is responsible for election security. During Martelly's first year in office, Haiti faced challenges as the government struggled to appoint a prime minister, hindering reconstruction efforts. Disputes with the opposition delayed the formation of a government for almost five months. Dr. Garry Conille, a U.N. specialist, became prime minister but resigned after four months due to disagreements with Martelly over post-earthquake contracts. Martelly and former Prime Minister Bellerive were linked to the investigation of $300 million-$500 million in contracts. Authorities in the Dominican Republic are investigating corruption allegations linked to President Martelly, including a $350 million contract awarded to a company owned by Senator Felix Bautista. Bautista allegedly gave over $2.5 million to Martelly before and after the election. After the resignation of the first prime minister, Laurent Lamothe was appointed as the new prime minister in May 2012, with a cabinet that included new posts to address poverty and support farmers. Martelly has denied the corruption charges. Many observers are concerned about President Martelly's ability to fulfill his promises due to his lack of political and management experience. This inexperience has led to gridlock and animosity between his administration and the parliament, with his justice minister resigning after a controversial arrest. International donors, including the United States, have been involved in Haitian politics. International donors, including the United States, have been working with the Haitian government to rebuild infrastructure, support transparency, strengthen public services, professionalize the police force, and reform the judicial system. The government adopted a \"Roadmap for the Rule of Law\" with support from MINUSTAH. President Martelly initiated a housing loan program and appointed advisers for earthquake recovery. President Martelly implemented various initiatives during his tenure, including a housing loan program, free education funded by taxes on phone calls and remittances, and cash credits for mothers keeping children in school. Critics raised concerns about transparency and policy clarity. Additionally, health initiatives were launched, such as a new physiotherapy department and a pilot program providing free health insurance cards to workers. President Martelly implemented various initiatives during his tenure, including a housing loan program, free education funded by taxes on phone calls and remittances, and cash credits for mothers keeping children in school. Critics raised concerns about transparency and policy clarity. Health initiatives were also launched, such as a new physiotherapy department and a pilot program providing free health insurance cards to workers. Martelly named three members to the Supreme Court, including its president, filling a post vacant for six years. This marked the first time in over 25 years that Haiti had all three branches of government in place. The legislature, court, and Martelly agreed on nine new electoral council members for organizing overdue elections in April 2013, facilitated by constitutional amendments creating a high council for judicial branch management and a constitutional court for resolving disputes between branches. In July 2012, then Prime Minister Lamothe visited Washington, DC, meeting with then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton made Haiti a foreign policy priority and committed to building the capacity of the Haitian government and society. Lamothe highlighted progress in collecting revenues, fighting corruption, and addressing education and poverty. U.N. human rights expert Michel Forst acknowledged the progress before Lamothe resigned in March 2013. The U.N. human rights expert, Michel Forst, praised Haiti's efforts in combating corruption but expressed serious concerns about its impact on judicial institutions. Despite some progress, corruption remains widespread at all levels. The Martelly Administration detained or indicted over 90 individuals, including government officials, by the end of 2013. Forst also criticized the politicization of the judiciary and national police under the Martelly Administration. The Martelly Administration faced criticism for appointing judges for political reasons, hindering international efforts to build capacity in Haiti. Human rights expert Forst also condemned arbitrary arrests and threats to journalists. The international community urged an end to the political impasse and addressing high unemployment rates. MINUSTAH highlighted the government's failure to organize elections and tackle unemployment. Throughout President Martelly's term, concerns have been raised about his commitment to democracy in Haiti. With elections two years overdue, there is a risk of Martelly ruling by decree. The failure to hold elections could impact U.S. assistance to Haiti. Despite meetings with U.S. officials, elections are still not scheduled. Despite ongoing pressure from the international community, elections in Haiti remain unscheduled. Concerns about corruption and lack of checks and balances persist, with investigations implicating President Martelly and his associates. In April 2015, a key figure linked to the president's family was released despite facing charges. An indicted head of a kidnapping ring with ties to the president's family was freed from prison after a two-hour trial. Critics argue the judge's quick decision is a setback in the fight against organized crime. The reappearance of divisive leaders, including former dictator Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, has been a destabilizing factor in Haiti. Duvalier faced charges of corruption and human rights violations before his death in 2014. After Jean-Claude Duvalier's death in 2014, investigations into abuses committed during his regime must continue, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to Haiti in 2011, greeted by supporters, but has since kept a low profile. President Pr\u00e9val stated that Aristide should be prepared to face corruption charges upon his return. The investigation into the murder of reporter Jean Dominique involving Aristide associates is discussed. Charges have been brought against Haiti's former dictator and questioning another former head of state. The judicial system is criticized for lack of independence, with interference by the Martelly Administration. Trying Duvalier, his associates, and/or Aristide could strain Haiti's weak judicial system. Both Duvalier and Aristide are polarizing figures known to incite unrest. Aristide's Lavalas party plans to participate in upcoming elections. President Martelly met privately with Aristide in September 2013, as part of a series of meetings with political party leaders. Duvalier opened offices for his former political party before his death, intending to field candidates. MINUSTAH has been in Haiti for 10 years to restore order since Aristide's government collapsed. Aristide fled into exile in 2004 due to armed rebellion and diminished international support. MINUSTAH replaced the international force in 2004 and worked closely with the interim government until elections were held in 2006. President Pr\u00e9val supported the presence of foreign troops in Haiti, despite calls for their removal. Popular protests have demanded MINUSTAH's withdrawal due to allegations of introducing cholera and sexual abuse. President Martelly, while critical of MINUSTAH, advocates extending its term for stability and reconstruction efforts, eventually replacing it with a revived Haitian army. The U.N. Security Council and donors prefer strengthening the Haitian National Police. MINUSTAH's mandate focuses on creating security and stability in Haiti. MINUSTAH's mandate includes creating a secure environment, supporting democratic governance, and promoting human rights in Haiti. The mission has also assisted in emergency responses and combatting gangs and drug trafficking. The current authorization runs until October 15, 2015, with a budget of approximately $500 million. The U.N. has been gradually reducing MINUSTAH's troops. The Security Council passed a resolution in October 2014 to reduce MINUSTAH's military personnel by more than half to a maximum of 2,370 troops. The Group of Friends of Haiti expressed concerns about reducing troops before elections, emphasizing the importance of basing decisions on conditions on the ground. The European Union noted an increase in violent demonstrations despite overall security improvements, highlighting the role of economic disparity in instability. The European Union and the Group of Friends emphasized the impact of economic disparity on Haiti's stability. They highlighted the need to address issues like unemployment, education, and social services to empower women and reinforce security. The Security Council approved a plan to reduce military forces, with the United States supporting the drawdown. Haiti requested a delay in troop reduction due to security concerns surrounding upcoming elections.

Haiti requested a delay in troop reduction due to security concerns surrounding upcoming elections. The number of U.N. police in Haiti has been falling, with efforts to bring it to authorized levels before elections ongoing. MINUSTAH and the U.N. have faced criticism for their response to a cholera outbreak in 2010. An investigation at the request of the Haitian government found strong evidence linking a cholera outbreak in Haiti to contamination of the Artibonite River near a MINUSTAH military camp. The U.N. has been pressured to take responsibility for the outbreak, with calls for proper sewage handling in military camps to prevent future incidents. Over 5,000 cholera victims or their relatives have filed legal claims. Over 5,000 cholera victims or their relatives have filed legal claims against the U.N. for compensation and a nationwide response, including medical treatment and clean water infrastructure. The U.N. refused to compensate victims citing diplomatic immunity. A class action suit was filed in a U.S. federal court seeking establishment of a claims commission and $2.2 billion for eradication efforts. A U.S. federal judge dismissed the suit in January 2015, citing U.N. immunity. The judge dismissed a class action suit against the U.N. due to immunity from treaties. Haitians' mistrust of the U.N. has led to protests and strained relations with MINUSTAH. Charges of sexual abuse by MINUSTAH personnel have fueled anti-MINUSTAH sentiment. The U.N. has a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual abuse. Alleged perpetrators are returned to their home country for punishment. Five MINUSTAH peacekeepers from Uruguay were sent home in 2011 for sexually abusing an 18-year-old man at a U.N. base. In 2011, a Pakistani police unit members were convicted of raping a 14-year-old boy in Haiti. The U.N. recommended barring countries that disregard children's rights from peacekeeping missions and making disciplinary actions public. Investigations should be completed within six months. Haiti, a country with low socioeconomic indicators and acute environmental crisis, is the most fragile among the Inter-American Development Bank's member countries. Plagued by political instability and natural disasters, it is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere with extreme economic disparity. Over half of its 10 million population lives in extreme poverty. Investigations should be completed within six months. Haiti's population of 10 million faces severe poverty, with over half living on less than $1 a day and 80% on $2 or less. In rural areas, 69% live on less than $1 a day. Food insecurity is widespread, with 81% of the national population and 87% of rural population not meeting minimum daily food requirements. Hurricanes in 2012 worsened food security, with 1.5 million people in severe food insecurity and 450,000 at risk of severe malnutrition, including 4,000 children under five. Haiti's per capita real GDP declined by 30% over 40 years. By 2007, the economy showed progress, but reaching the Millennium Development Goal of eradicating poverty by 2015 seemed unlikely. The global economic crisis caused a 10% drop in remittances, totaling $1.65 billion in 2008. Haiti's economy suffered significant losses due to the 2010 earthquake, estimated at $7.8 billion, exceeding the country's GDP. Despite fluctuations, GDP growth rates ranged from -5% in 2010 to 5.6% in 2011, with a projected increase to 4.2% by 2016. However, Haiti's socioeconomic indicators remain low compared to other developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Haiti's GNI per capita has only increased from $410 to $810 since 2000, with a significant income distribution gap. The country has the second-largest income disparity globally, with over 68% of national income going to the wealthiest 20% and less than 1.5% to the poorest 20%. The World Bank states that with such high inequality, economic growth's ability to reduce poverty is minimal. Haiti implemented a minimum wage law in 2009, raising wages to $5.00 per day by October 2012. Despite the wage increase in Haiti from $1.75 to $5.00 per day, income inequality and poverty remain significant issues. The country's agriculture sector faces challenges such as deforestation, degraded watersheds, and limited infrastructure. Hurricane Sandy further exacerbated agricultural losses, requiring an additional $40 million for recovery efforts. Unemployment rates and income inequality continue to hinder overall progress in Haiti. Despite ongoing challenges with unemployment, income inequality, and poverty, Haiti has shown progress in various areas. U.S. Ambassador Pamela White noted that Haitian farmers have seen increased incomes, exports to the U.S. have risen by 41% since 2010, crime rates have decreased, and security has improved. However, the country faced a cholera outbreak in 2010 due to inadequate sanitation facilities at a MINUSTAH camp. Haiti is transitioning towards long-term development despite these setbacks. Haiti experienced a severe cholera outbreak in 2010, leading to the highest number of cases globally. Over 8,600 people have died, with 712,330 cases recorded. Despite a decrease in new cases, the epidemic persists, especially during the rainy season. President Martelly initiated a vaccination program in 2012, inoculating only about 1% of the population. Partners in Health and GHESKIO implemented a successful cholera vaccination program in Haiti, leading to the Ministry of Health conducting targeted immunization campaigns in other areas. The vaccination is 60% to 85% effective and costs $3.70 per patient for the two-dose treatment. However, there is no funding available for the government's plan to vaccinate 300,000 people in 2015. Other preventive measures include building latrines and distributing hygiene products. Treatment involves oral rehydration salts, antibiotics, and IV. The United States has spent over $95 million on preventive measures for cholera in Haiti, including setting up treatment centers and oral rehydration posts. Cholera is expected to persist until nationwide water and sanitation systems are developed, which could cost $800 million to $1.1 billion. The strain of cholera in Haiti is changing as survivors develop immunity, indicating the disease may become endemic. Total cases and deaths started to decline in 2012. The international response to the cholera epidemic in Haiti has been criticized for being inadequate, with a decrease in the number of actors engaged in cholera responses and donors. The U.N. expressed concern about the reduction in cholera treatment centers and the country's ability to respond to the disease. Efforts to raise funds for a 10-year cholera eradication plan fell short, with only 40% of the needed amount raised for the first two years. Efforts to raise funds for a 10-year cholera eradication plan in Haiti have fallen short, with only 40% of the needed amount raised for the first two years. The senior U.N. coordinator warned that at the current rate of funding, it would take over 40 years to provide basic health, water, and sanitation systems to Haitians. With better funding, cholera could be eliminated from Haiti in about a decade. After the earthquake, the Haitian government established a framework for reconstruction in the 10-year recovery plan, Action Plan for the Reconstruction and National Development of Haiti, focusing on territorial, economic, social, and institutional rebuilding. This includes creating economic growth centers, modernizing agriculture, promoting manufacturing and tourism, and rebuilding education and health systems. Institutional rebuilding in Haiti post-earthquake includes making government institutions operational, strengthening governmental authority, decentralizing basic services, creating a social safety net, and incorporating environmental factors in reconstruction activities. Analysts stress the importance of involving the Haitian government and civil society in development strategies for sustainability. Job creation and development efforts should also target rural areas to reduce urban migration and dependence on foreign aid. The Haitian government and international donors emphasize the need for long-term commitment to development in Haiti, targeting poverty reduction and addressing income disparity. Improved accountability of donor assistance is crucial to enhance aid effectiveness and reduce corruption. Recent progress has been made in reducing corruption and increasing transparency in Haiti. Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and improving fiscal management, qualifying for debt relief in 2009. The U.S. Agency for International Development has helped establish an online system for transparency in monitoring donor pledges and spending. The challenge is to address Haiti's developmental needs while boosting public confidence and pursuing long-term development plans. The Haitian government criticizes slow dispersal of funds by international donors, hindering reconstruction efforts due to political instability and lack of capacity. Donors prefer aid through NGOs, citing concerns about Haitian government's ability to implement programs. Donors are concerned about Haitian capacity and corruption. Lack of coordination and delayed elections may lead to loss of international support. Failure to hold legislative elections could impact U.S. assistance. Haiti's government and opposition struggle to reach consensus, leading to gridlock. The United States and other donors are urging all sides in Haiti to reach an agreement and move forward on elections, which are three years overdue and not likely to happen until mid-2015. The Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission (IHRC), co-chaired by the Government of Haiti and former President Bill Clinton, expired in October 2011 without establishing the Haitian Development Authority. There have been criticisms of the IHRC's effectiveness in approving and distributing aid. The Haitian government's limited capacity was further hindered by the earthquake, leading to concerns about their ability to handle aid distribution. Despite the failure to extend the IHRC, the 12 largest international donors continued to coordinate with the government. In November 2012, the Haitian government presented a plan for foreign aid coordination called CAED, headed by the Prime Minister and Minister of Planning. The CAED, a foreign aid coordination plan in Haiti, includes international and national committees, working groups for development priorities, and seeks donor funds. Political gridlock hinders coordination, but Haiti has potential to become a middle-income country. Haiti has the potential to become a middle-income country in about 30 years with good economic growth, but political polarization and donor fatigue are hindering progress. Without a national consensus on development priorities, reconstruction efforts will continue to be stalled, threatening stability and security. In the aftermath of the earthquake, Haiti must recover from significant losses and capitalize on previous advancements in security and judicial reform. Despite progress in areas such as macroeconomic management and voter registration, challenges like widespread poverty and susceptibility to natural disasters persist. The government has also improved access to clean water and other essential services. The U.N. secretary-general commissioned a report in 2009 recommending a strategy for Haiti's economic security post-earthquake. Economist Paul Collier, author of The Bottom Billion, expressed optimism for Haiti's economic development due to its peaceful region and competent leadership. The U.N. report recommended modest actions to build economic security in Haiti post-earthquake, focusing on creating jobs, providing basic services, enhancing food security, and environmental sustainability. Analysts highlight the importance of 1.5 million Haitians abroad for remittances, skills, and political support. The efforts of Haitian Americans and others lobbying on Haiti's behalf led to advantageous access to the U.S. market for apparel through the HOPE II Act. Critics worry about exploitation of cheap labor and the impact on the agricultural economy. U.S. and Canadian companies have reported potential mineral wealth in Haiti, raising concerns about environmental contamination and health risks. Haiti lacks government infrastructure to regulate mining, with the last gold mining occurring in the 1500s. The Pr\u00e9val government negotiated a deal with a company offering high returns. Prime Minister Lamothe is drafting mining legislation to establish royalties and safeguards. Haiti is a top foreign policy priority for the Obama Administration in the Latin America and Caribbean region. In its FY2016 budget request, the Administration highlighted Haiti's progress in improving the business climate, attracting investments, creating jobs, supporting judicial sector reforms, and strengthening the health system. Despite positive developments, weak public institutions, conflicts between branches of government, lack of accountability, and limited state capacity continue to hinder progress. U.S. assistance programs are focusing on country leadership. The Administration emphasizes country leadership and ownership in U.S. assistance programs for Haiti to promote sustainability. Key laws need to be enacted to improve the investment climate, combat corruption, and address migration and poverty. The U.S. and international community support free and fair elections in Haiti for improved governance and stability. The Obama Administration's FY2016 assistance request for Haiti is $242 million, a $33 million decrease from FY2015. U.S. aid focuses on infrastructure, energy, governance, health, food security, and economic programs, including the Feed the Future initiative to reduce hunger and increase farmers' incomes. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113) outlines conditions for US assistance to Haiti, including requirements for free and fair elections, strengthening the rule of law, combating corruption, and increasing government revenues. After various domestic crises, Haitians sought Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States to avoid deportation. The return of deportees was argued to contribute to instability and strain Haiti's services, as the country relies on remittances from the US. TPS was granted to Haitians after the 2010 earthquake, with yearly extensions by DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano. After the 2010 earthquake, Haitians were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States. The policy of intercepting Haitian migrants at sea and returning them to Haiti continues. Over 100,000 Haitians are waiting to join family members in the US, some for up to 12 years, due to annual visa caps. The Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program was introduced in 2015 to expedite eligible families' reunification, but only a small portion of approved Haitians will benefit. DHS warns against illegal entry into the US. Haitians in the United States can only participate in the reunification program if they are living in Haiti. Sponsoring family members must wait for an invitation from the National Visa Center to apply. Congress has shown bipartisan support for Haiti, passing bills and providing trade preferences. Efforts are being made to ensure free and fair elections in Haiti, with some Senate seats expiring in 2012. Elections for Haitian Senate seats and other posts are long overdue, with concerns raised by Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee about the impact on U.S. assistance. Other congressional concerns include post-earthquake reconstruction, government transparency, human rights, security issues, and a court ruling in the Dominican Republic affecting Haitians. The end of the registration period in June 2015 raises concerns about mass deportations to Haiti due to a law in the Dominican Republic that could strip citizenship from 200,000 Dominicans, mostly of Haitian descent. The Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 2013 directs the Secretary of State to report on post-earthquake recovery efforts in Haiti. The House Appropriations Committee is concerned about the lack of progress in Haiti and expects regular updates on the situation. In the aftermath of the earthquake, Congress appropriated $2.9 billion for aid to Haiti in the 2010 supplemental appropriations bill. Concerns have been raised about the pace and effectiveness of U.S. aid to Haiti, with only a portion of the pledged funds disbursed. The Department of State and USAID are directed to review and prioritize programs for Haiti's continued high level of need. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that only a portion of the $6.4 billion pledged for Haiti earthquake reconstruction had been disbursed by the end of 2012. USAID had disbursed 56% of the funds allocated in the FY2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act, with GAO criticizing the State Department for incomplete and untimely reports to Congress. The State Department submitted four reports to the Senate Committee on Appropriations, lacking requested information. The GAO released a report on Haiti Reconstruction, stating that USAID had mixed results and needed to improve sustainability planning. USAID reduced planned outcomes for key activities due to staffing issues and unrealistic plans, leading to delays. The mission has increased staffing and extended reconstruction time. The mission in Haiti has increased staffing and extended its reconstruction time frame for another three years, to 2018. GAO concluded that sustainability planning could be improved at both the mission- and agency-wide levels. USAID and the State Department report that 100% of the $1.3 billion allotted for humanitarian relief assistance, and 71% of the $2.3 billion allotted for recovery, reconstruction, and development assistance had been distributed as of March 31, 2015. The Administration has disbursed 80% of funding available for Haiti's recovery efforts. While progress has been made, challenges remain, including concerns about the pace and methods of the recovery process for displaced persons. Many have been forcibly evicted or live under threat of eviction, with the U.N. expressing concern about human rights violations. The Caracol Industrial Park in Haiti's northern region was developed as part of U.S. aid efforts to stimulate the economy and create jobs outside of Port-au-Prince. Estimates suggest there are 480,000 internally displaced persons in Haiti, with some living in tent shelters and others with host families or in internal settlements. As of October 2012, the Caracol park had only employed about 1,000 Haitians out of the projected 20,000 permanent jobs. The Caracol Industrial Park in Haiti, developed as part of U.S. aid efforts, had 1,000 Haitians employed in 2012, which increased to 6,200 jobs by April 2015. Controversy arose due to lack of inquiry into labor violations by the company chosen to anchor the park. Environmentalists were shocked by the park's proximity to Caracol Bay, designated as Haiti's first marine protected area. Consultants did not conduct an environmental analysis before recommending the site, which was later found to pose a high environmental risk. The Caracol Industrial Park in Haiti, developed with U.S. aid, faced criticism for its impact on air quality and displacement of farmers. The government defended the park, stating corrective actions were taken by the manufacturer and environmental protection measures were in place. Farmers were compensated and a training program was initiated for new job opportunities. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported mixed results for U.S. funding at Caracol, including $170 million for a power plant and port at the Industrial Park. USAID completed the power plant's first phase with less funding than allocated, but the port construction is two years behind schedule with a cost gap of $117 million to $189 million. It is uncertain if Haiti can find a private company to fund the rest of the port costs. Labor practices in Haitian factories have been criticized in recent reports. Two recent reports criticized labor practices in Haitian factories, alleging underpayment of workers and unsafe conditions. Congress has supported efforts to improve transparency and accountability in Haiti's government spending. Despite not meeting minimum standards of fiscal transparency, Haiti received a waiver on aid restrictions due to national interest concerns. The justification for assistance in Haiti highlighted progress in government transparency, but also noted shortcomings such as lack of natural resource revenue identification and inadequate oversight of public enterprises. Congress has advocated for human rights in Haiti. The U.S. Department of State's Human Rights report from 2013 highlighted serious human rights issues in Haiti, including weak democratic governance, lack of rule of law, judicial system vulnerability to political influence, severe corruption in government branches, arbitrary killings, excessive use of force, poor prison conditions, prolonged pretrial detention, and an inefficient judiciary. The 2013 U.S. Department of State's Human Rights report highlighted serious human rights issues in Haiti, including weak democratic governance, lack of rule of law, judicial system vulnerability to political influence, severe corruption, arbitrary killings, excessive use of force, poor prison conditions, prolonged pretrial detention, and inefficient judiciary. Other issues in Haiti included rape, violence against women, child abuse, social marginalization of minority communities, and human trafficking. Allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by members of MINUSTAH were also reported. Violence and crime within camps for internally displaced persons remained a problem, along with torture, overcrowding, and poor sanitation in prisons. Mob violence and vigilante retribution were also prevalent. The U.N. Independent Expert on the Situation of Human Rights in Haiti, Michel Forst, expressed deep concern about the state of human rights in Haiti, citing widespread violence, impunity, and political interference in the judiciary. He criticized the appointment of magistrates for political reasons and highlighted the Minister of Justice's questionable actions. Michel Forst, the U.N. Independent Expert on Human Rights in Haiti, criticized political interference in the judiciary, citing the appointment of a judge to release a presidential adviser in preventive detention. He highlighted threats against journalists, illegal arrests, and the poor conditions in Haitian prisons. Forst praised efforts to strengthen the police but noted ongoing issues, including a case of torture leading to death in a police station. The human rights specialist praised positive developments in Haiti, including the role of the Office of Citizen Protection and civil society organizations advocating for women's rights and food security. He also commended the appointment of a Minister for Human Rights. Additionally, an aide to the Prime Minister was killed in a drive-by shooting, sparking controversy over a court ruling in the Dominican Republic that could deny citizenship to some individuals. The controversy in the Dominican Republic over citizenship denial to 200,000 Dominican-born people, mostly of Haitian descent, stems from a ruling by the Constitutional Court applying retroactive citizenship exclusion laws. The Constitutional Court decision in the Dominican Republic stripped a woman of Haitian descent of her citizenship and denied it to her children. The court ordered an audit of birth records to identify similar cases since 1929, stating they would no longer qualify for citizenship. Dominican authorities argue that affected individuals will not be stateless as they can qualify as Haitian citizens or be given a path to Dominican citizenship. The Dominican Republic's court ruling has caused tensions with Haiti as it could render thousands of Dominicans of Haitian descent stateless and deport them. Haiti lacks resources to handle such an influx of deportees. The Haitian government recalled its ambassador in response to the ruling, and relations were further strained when the Dominican Republic repatriated over 200 Haitians. The Martelly Administration faced criticism for not strongly opposing a court decision affecting Haitians in a border town. Haitian and Dominican officials held talks in January 2014, with the Dominican government refusing to negotiate the decision. Haiti recognized Dominican sovereignty on migration policy, while the Dominican government promised to protect the rights of people of Haitian descent. Concerns were raised about the treatment of Haitian migrant workers in the Dominican Republic, including labor law violations in the sugar sector. Haiti and the Dominican Republic discussed issues such as labor violations, child labor, and immigration in February 2014. The Dominican government agreed to create a new visa for workers, while Haiti committed to expedite passport issuance for its citizens in the Dominican Republic. Dominican President Danilo Medina implemented a special naturalization process for undocumented foreigners and their children. The Dominican government implemented a special naturalization process for undocumented foreigners and their children born in the country. However, international organizations and human rights groups have criticized the decision, citing concerns about potential violations of human rights obligations. CARICOM condemned the discriminatory ruling by the Dominican Republic, citing a 2005 judgment by the Inter-American Court on Human Rights. The Obama Administration expressed deep concern about the ruling's impact on people of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic. Some Members of Congress fear the ruling could lead to statelessness for hundreds of thousands of individuals. In response, the Dominican Congress passed a bill in May 2014. In May 2014, the Dominican Congress passed a bill proposed by President Medina to grant citizenship to Dominican-born children of immigrants. The law created different categories based on birth certificate status, allowing those with irregular certificates to be legalized as citizens. Critics argue the law still discriminates against those without documents. The Dominican Republic withdrew from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on November 14, 2014. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that the Dominican Republic discriminates against Dominicans of Haitian descent and ordered the government to invalidate a ruling of the Constitutional Court. The Dominican government criticized the findings as biased. Concerns were raised about potential deportations to Haiti after the Dominican Republic ended its immigrant regularization process. The UNHCR urged the government to prevent the deportation of individuals who were stripped of their nationality in 2013, warning of a possible refugee crisis. The UNHCR offered to work with Dominican authorities to find a solution for Haitian citizens, amidst conflicting signals from the government. Legal proceedings against former leaders have tested Haiti's judicial system. Duvalier, former leader of Haiti, faced charges of human rights violations upon his return from exile in 2011. In 2013, a court ruled he could be charged with crimes against humanity, such as political torture and murder, for which there is no statute of limitations. The return of Jean-Claude Duvalier to Haiti in 2011 led to charges of human rights violations, with a court ruling in 2013 that he could be charged with crimes against humanity. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights offered assistance in prosecuting crimes committed during Duvalier's rule, emphasizing the importance of pursuing legal avenues to deliver a message of accountability to the people of Haiti. Jean-Claude Duvalier's return to Haiti in 2011 led to charges of human rights violations, with a court ruling in 2013 that he could be charged with crimes against humanity. Despite initially failing to appear in court, Duvalier eventually did so under threat of arrest. He denied responsibility for murders and political imprisonment during his rule, stating that such actions occur in all countries. The Martelly government re-issued his diplomatic passport in 2012, allowing him to remain in the country and attend official ceremonies. After Duvalier's death, legal proceedings against his associates were deemed essential by the U.N. Human Rights Office. Former President Aristide faces charges for alleged abuse of children in his care. A court is deciding whether to dismiss or pursue formal charges. Aristide also testified in an investigation into the murder of journalist Jean Dominique in 2000. Thousands of supporters followed him through the capital. In 2000, former President Aristide testified in the murder case of journalist Jean Dominique. Dominique was a possible presidential candidate at the time of his death. His widow, Michele Montas, implicated high-level members of the Lavalas Family party in the crime. A Haitian appellate judge recommended charging nine individuals for their roles in Dominique's murder, with a former Lavalas senator identified as the mastermind. Several suspects and witnesses have been killed or disappeared over the years. The former Lavalas senator was identified as the mastermind behind the murder, with others from Aristide's party involved. The Court of Appeals will decide on the judge's report. An arrest warrant was issued for Aristide in 2014 for corruption and drug charges. Aristide was placed under house arrest, sparking protests. Some claim the judge is biased towards President Martelly. Aristide's house arrest may hinder opposition participation in elections due to concerns of persecution. President Martelly's potential impact on the judicial system and his statements regarding pardoning former leaders, including Duvalier, have raised concerns. Despite initial remarks about pardoning Duvalier for national reconciliation, there have been retractions and denials of pursuing a pardon. The UN's Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights suggested the creation of a truth commission to address these issues. The UN expert on human rights in Haiti praised the appearance of former president Jean-Claude Duvalier before the courts as a victory for the rule of law. Concerns have been raised about violence against women in Haiti, with discrimination against women being a longstanding issue. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights highlighted the widespread nature of sexual discrimination in Haitian society, leading to regular acts of violence and abuse against women. Gender-based violence against women and girls in Haiti, including domestic abuse, rape, and murder, is common and under-reported. The issue was exacerbated after the earthquake, with women in tent camps being especially vulnerable. The Haitian government's enforcement of protections for women is weak, but the Martelly Administration has increased the budget for the Ministry for Women's Affairs and Rights. The FY2012 budget for the Ministry of Women's Affairs and Rights in Haiti increased by 828.2% to US$40.76 million. Congress has supported U.N. missions and efforts to improve security conditions in Haiti. President Martelly controversially proposed recreating the Haitian army, which was disbanded in 1995 due to human rights violations and coups. Martelly's plan to recreate a Haitian army was deemed unrealistic, leading to the proposal of a new security force of 3,000-5,000 members. Ecuador trained 41 Haitian military recruits in 2013 for engineering projects, with plans for potential weapon-carrying in the future. The Haitian government is considering allowing recruits to carry handguns in three to four years, either by paying for the weapons themselves or with government financing. This move is seen as a token gesture to fulfill Martelly's campaign promise to reinstate the army. Former army members and potential soldiers have protested in favor of reestablishing the army, leading to the occupation of old military bases in 2012. The government eventually closed the bases and arrested pro-army protesters after a violent march in May 2012. The Haitian government is considering reinstating the army, but Parliament has not approved it yet. The majority coalition believes the country cannot afford an army and should focus on developing the police force instead. The United States and other donors support police reform for better citizen security. Some suggest creating civilian corps for disaster response. The UN Security Council is concerned about the slow progress in strengthening the police force and the potential rise of pro-army sentiments. The pace of recruitment, vetting, and training for the Haitian National Police has been unsatisfactory due to funding shortfalls and administrative difficulties. The slower-than-expected development of the police force risks fueling support for the creation of a national army. MINUSTAH aimed to train 15,000 police officers by 2016, but currently, there are about 11,900 officers, including 1,022 women. Haiti serves as a transit point for drug trafficking from South America to the United States and Canada. Haiti is a transit point for drug trafficking from South America to the United States, Canada, Europe, and other Caribbean countries. Weak institutions, poorly protected borders, and widespread corruption make Haiti attractive to drug traffickers. The Haitian government is committed to combating narcotics trafficking, with plans to strengthen the Haitian National Police and expand the counternarcotics unit. The Obama Administration collaborated with other donors to update the development plan for the Haitian Coast Guard and coordinate international efforts. Despite widespread corruption, the government does not support drug distribution or money laundering. The State Department reports that the Haitian National Police Inspectorate General is fully staffed at the leadership level for the first time in its history. However, low pay and poverty make lower-level officials susceptible to bribery. Haitian law enforcement faces challenges in investigating allegations against legislators due to constitutional immunity. Resource shortages, lack of expertise, and political will hinder anti-corruption efforts. Since 2008, Congress has provided counternarcotics funds for Haiti through initiatives like the Merida Initiative and the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). The Merida aid package aimed to combat drug trafficking and organized crime, with a main focus on Mexico. CBSI, launched in 2010, aims to reduce illicit trafficking and promote security in the region. U.S. counternarcotics programs in Haiti support the Haitian National Police by enhancing their professionalism and capability. Political will and resource shortages are obstacles to anti-corruption efforts in Haiti. The U.S. has provided support to the Haitian police, including training, renovation of facilities, and joint enforcement operations. Congress passed the HOPE Act in 2006 to provide trade preferences for Haitian apparel imports. Despite progress, drug enforcement actions in Haiti remain low. The HOPE Act, passed in 2006, provides trade preferences for Haitian apparel imports. The act requires ongoing Haitian compliance with certain conditions, including progress towards a market-based economy, rule of law, and protection of worker rights. In 2008, the second HOPE Act expanded tariff preferences through 2018 in response to a food crisis and calls for increased U.S. investment in Haiti. The HOPE II Act extended tariff preferences for Haitian apparel imports through 2018, simplified rules, expanded fabric eligibility, and allowed apparel to be shipped from both Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It also mandated monitoring of labor conditions and created a Labor Ombudsman. The HELP Act further expanded and extended trade preferences through September 2020, aiming to encourage foreign investment and job creation, although some argue it may displace farmers due to industrial park development on arable land. In October 2013, reports criticized labor practices in Haitian factories for underpayment and unsafe conditions. The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend duty treatment for Haiti. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, linked assistance to Haiti with free and fair elections and governance improvements. The Assessing Progress in Haiti Act measures recovery and development efforts post-earthquake, coordinates a strategy for economic growth and democratic institutions, and sets benchmarks for progress. Signed into law on January 17, 2014. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act conditions aid to Haiti, requiring specific steps for assistance and benchmarks for recovery efforts. It also prohibits aid to Haiti until certain conditions, such as holding free and fair elections and combating corruption, are met. The Save America Comprehensive Immigration Act of 2015 includes provisions for adjustments of status for certain Haitian nationals. The Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 extends preferential duty treatment for Haiti. Introduced in March 2015, passed by the House in April, and by the Senate in May. H.R. 1891, the AGOA Extension and Enhancement Act of 2015, extends trade programs for Haiti and other countries. Introduced in April 2015. H.Res. 25 recognizes the anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti, honoring those who lost their lives. S. 503, the Haitian Partnership Renewal Act, extends duty-free entry for apparel articles assembled in Haiti. S. 1009, the AGOA Extension and Enhancement Act of 2015, extends trade programs for Haiti and other countries. S. 1009 AGOA Extension and Enhancement Act of 2015 extends trade programs for Haiti, including the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the preferential duty treatment program. S. 1267 Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 extends duty-free entry for apparel articles assembled in Haiti and the special duty-free rules for Haiti."
