    "content": "Electricity is considered a commodity, bought and sold in markets with unique characteristics. It must be available upon demand, rarely stored, and consumed immediately. The power industry has evolved to ensure availability and reliability. Electricity prices vary by region in the US based on supply, demand, fuel costs, technology, infrastructure, and weather trends. Regulators aim to ensure reliable electric power for economic activity. The Energy Policy Acts of 1992 and 2005 introduced new regulations for the electricity industry, emphasizing transparency in wholesale markets and prohibiting market manipulation. Regulatory bodies aim to ensure low-cost electricity provision while promoting fair competition and protecting consumers. EPACT05 prohibits energy market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of electric energy or transmission services subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. Competitive electricity markets offer various products and services to facilitate power sales and transmission, including risk management services. The California energy crisis of 2000-2001 revealed the susceptibility of electricity markets to manipulation. Enron was found liable for engaging in market manipulation schemes, leading to disgorgement of $1.6 billion in unjust profits. FERC investigated energy market manipulation in FY2015, resulting in settlements totaling $26.25 million in civil penalties and disgorgement of $1 million in unjust profits. Staff focused on fraud and conduct threatening market transparency. Enforcement efforts have included reporting requirements and provisions to enhance compliance programs. Staff is seeking to recover over half a billion dollars in civil penalties and disgorgement through litigation. Questions for Congress revolve around the adequacy of current laws in preventing energy market manipulation and the need for more regulatory oversight in wholesale electricity markets administered by Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The power generation industry initially focused on serving industrial manufacturers with steam-driven power plants. As demand for electricity grew, privately owned electric utility companies emerged, providing power, transmission, and distribution services to whole towns and cities. State regulation of electric utilities also began in the early days. In the early days, companies were granted exclusive service territories to serve all electricity customers. As of 2007, 15% were served by public power systems, 13% by rural electric cooperatives, and 68% by investor-owned electric utilities. Power marketers served the remaining 4%. Investor-owned electric utilities own 40% of power generation capacity, while public power entities and electric cooperatives own 10% and 4% respectively. They sell power directly to retail customers. Electric utilities operate under a traditional model with rates set by state regulatory bodies based on cost-of-service. Utilities have a natural monopoly in their service territory and are overseen by public service commissions. PUCs review and authorize rates, new power plant costs, and utility construction projects. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has authority over wholesale power transactions, interstate transmission siting, utility mergers, and more under the Federal Power Act (FPA). FERC ensures electric power rates are reasonable and oversees wholesale power transactions. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) allows qualifying facilities to generate power. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) authorized non-governmental entities to generate and sell electric power at the utility's avoided cost. The Energy Policy Act (EPACT) gave FERC authority to grant access to the transmission system for Electric Wholesale Generators, allowing them to sell power in wholesale markets. Some states adopted competition to lower electricity rates, leading to the deregulation of the power industry and the ability for entities other than utilities to build power plants and generate electricity. EPACT opened wholesale electricity markets to competition by allowing buyers to purchase electricity from any generator, requiring transmission line owners to transport power at reasonable rates. FERC Order 888 in 1996 mandated open access to the transmission grid for all users. FERC Order 888 mandated open, non-discriminatory access to transmission systems for wholesale competition. Order 889 established rules for the Open Access Same-time Information System (OASIS) to ensure fair access to transmission capacity. Regulators aim to prevent market power abuse by generators. In the early 20th century, electric utility companies realized the benefits of interconnecting and sharing generation resources through \"power pools.\" These pools allowed utilities to exchange or transfer power in wholesale or retail transactions. Loose power pools are voluntary associations that negotiate generation sales primarily on a bi-lateral basis. Tight power pools involve true pooling of generating and transmission assets, with known costs for each resource and centralized transmission dispatch. The Pennsylvania-New Jersey Interconnect was the first U.S. power pool in 1927, transitioning to an independent transmission organization in 1997. The Pennsylvania-New Jersey Interconnect was the first U.S. power pool in 1927, transitioning to an independent transmission organization in 1997. FERC approved the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland (PJM) pool as the first independent system operator (ISO) in 1997, marking a move towards deregulation in various industries in the United States. Federal policy has emphasized competition in wholesale power markets since the passage of EPACT, reaffirmed with EPACT05, although competition at the state level is not federally mandated. In states with high electricity costs, the belief in competitive power generation led to the restructuring of electric utilities, requiring them to divest power plant ownership. Power generation became a competitive, deregulated function, while transmission and distribution remained regulated. Independent system operators (ISOs) were formed to promote competition in wholesale electric power transactions. Order 2000 was issued by FERC to advance the formation of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in response to engineering and economic inefficiencies in the industry. These inefficiencies arise from the independent decision-making of transmission providers within an interconnected grid, leading to operational challenges and hindering competitive procurement of wholesale power. The formation of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) was driven by FERC's aim to enhance efficiency in wholesale energy markets and reduce end-use prices for consumers. RTOs were required to have independence from market participants, operational authority over transmission facilities, and exclusive control over short-term reliability. Order 2000 also encouraged utilities to transfer control of their transmission systems to RTOs. In RTO regions, power generators compete to sell electricity in wholesale markets facilitated by RTOs. Liquidity is crucial for efficient market functioning as wholesale electricity is bought and sold multiple times before consumption by retail customers. The market for electricity is controlled by RTOs and LSEs, with wholesale prices varying by locality. RTOs serve two-thirds of US consumers and balance power supply and demand through SCED. Operating reserves are maintained for contingencies. The process of scheduling power plants to operate to serve a specific increment of load is called dispatch, designed to meet goals of reliability and economy as demand for power rises and falls. Different types of generating capacity are dispatched to serve electricity demand, with base load, peaking, and intermediate load plants playing different roles. RTOs monitor system loads every few minutes for dispatch purposes, allowing plants to adjust output to meet demand in a load-following mode. Power reserves are also maintained by RTOs. RTOs maintain power reserves to handle unexpected situations and high demand, comparing costs of power plants to serve system demand efficiently. Offers to sell energy are matched against bids from loads, with the goal of meeting demand at the lowest cost. In a competitive market, prices for electricity should reflect supply and demand forces. FERC authorizes sellers to charge market-based rates if they demonstrate lack of market power. Market Monitors observe RTOs to ensure efficient system operation. Market Monitors oversee RTOs to ensure competitive electricity pricing. FERC outlines their duties to evaluate market rules and tariffs, recommend changes for customer benefits, and assess economic signals to market participants. RTOs price wholesale electricity based on nodes in the system. The locational marginal price (LMP) of electricity is determined at nodes in the system, where power is transferred between buses affecting network flows and costs. LMP includes energy cost, congestion charge, and transmission losses. Generators receive LMP at their bus bar, while buyers are charged at the local load bus bar. Constraints on transmission lines impact LMP. Transmission line congestion occurs when there is insufficient capacity for preferred electricity schedules. LMP is set by the highest cost unit in constrained areas. RTOs use supply and demand curves to clear the market at specified nodes. The RTOs use supply and demand curves to clear the market at specified nodes, determining market-clearing prices. Settlement involves determining payments for energy, capacity, and ancillary services. Power plant dispatch involves committing generation to meet demand and dispatching additional capacity. In deregulated electricity markets, Load Serving Entities (LSEs) must procure capacity to meet reserve requirements. LSEs can self-supply, procure from wholesale markets, or enter bilateral contracts with generators. \"Day-ahead\" markets in RTO operations allow for evaluation of demand bids and supplier offers, enabling buying and selling of power a day before consumption. This ensures power plants are ready to meet the next day's demand. In RTO operations, Day-ahead markets involve financially binding commitments for generators to meet the next day's demand. Wind resources may participate with zero or negative bids based on meteorological data. \"Day 1\" markets handle real-time contingencies during operation. In RTO operations, Day-ahead markets involve commitments for generators to meet demand the next day. Spot markets run in real-time to address contingencies like outages or high demand. Intermittent resources can participate in spot markets, with forward contracts used to minimize risk. Ancillary Service markets are operated to maintain reliability on transmission systems. Ancillary Service markets operated by RTOs provide essential services for maintaining transmission system reliability. These services include scheduling, system control, reactive supply, regulation, energy imbalance, and reserve services. Capacity markets are utilized by RTOs to ensure system reliability by reserving and making available generation capacity to meet high loads or reliability requirements. Capacity payments cover the marginal costs of operation for capacity providing reliability services. Capacity payments in Forward Capacity markets are used by RTOs to ensure adequate capacity for future load demand and system reserve needs. New capacity is incentivized through higher prices in competitive auctions held in advance. Demand-side resources can participate in these auctions to provide reliable power at the lowest cost. Wholesale electricity prices are determined by the lowest marginal cost of electricity available, which varies based on Locational Marginal Prices (LMP). The cost of fuel and efficiency of power plants play a role in the production cost. RTOs use a \"Uniform Clearing Price\" auction to dispatch generators starting from the lowest-priced bids to meet consumer demand. The RTO uses a \"Uniform Clearing Price\" auction to determine wholesale electricity prices, where all selected generators receive the market-clearing price based on the last unit needed to meet demand. This system encourages generators to reduce operating costs to have their bids accepted, with lower cost generators likely to recover more costs than higher cost generators. Electricity prices in RTO markets must be attractive for generators to sell locally, with settlement processes ensuring fair pricing and invoicing for buyers. Concerns have been raised about the competitiveness of auction processes. Some observers question the competitiveness of auction processes, suggesting that clearance pricing drives prices up. Power suppliers may manipulate bids to maximize prices. When a generator's bid is accepted, it commits to providing power, but if not required to operate as committed, they may receive compensation. FERC defines Demand Response as changes in electric usage. FERC issued Order 745 in March 2011 to support the role of demand response in organized energy markets and remove barriers to its use. Demand response allows end-users to reduce electricity usage in response to high prices or reliability concerns, incentivizing lower consumption during peak times. Order 745, issued by FERC in March 2011, supports demand response in energy markets by removing barriers and ensuring fair compensation for resources. The U.S. Court of Appeals initially vacated Order 745 in May 2014, but it was later upheld by the Supreme Court in January 2016. Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) are contracts that provide compensation for transmission charges due to grid congestion. Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) provide compensation for transmission charges arising from grid congestion, allowing transmission owners or LSEs protection against congestion-driven price increases in Day-ahead markets. FTRs are unidirectional contracts defined in megawatts from a point of receipt to a point of delivery on the New England grid. Holders receive a share of congestion charges when there is congestion between the specified points. FTRs are financial entitlements to Day-Ahead Locational Marginal Price Congestion Component differences and do not guarantee physical power delivery. Market Participants can submit bids for FTRs. Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) are financial entitlements acquired through auctions for hedging or speculative purposes in electricity markets. They do not guarantee physical power delivery and can be traded separately from transmission service. Virtual trading allows participants to hedge or speculate on Locational Marginal Price (LMP) differences between Day-ahead and Real-Time energy markets. Virtual transactions in the electricity market involve bids and offers without physical backing, allowing participants to arbitrage price differences between the Day-ahead and Real-Time energy markets. These transactions can either make or lose money depending on market conditions. Virtual transactions in the electricity market, also known as convergence bidding, aim to align day-ahead and real-time prices to mitigate market power and improve efficiency. These transactions involve financial impacts on markets, paying or receiving the difference between prices multiplied by cleared capacity at the LMP node. While no physical delivery occurs, virtual transactions affect RTO operations and market participants transacting at LMPs. Virtual transactions in the electricity market, also known as convergence bidding, aim to align day-ahead and real-time prices to mitigate market power and improve efficiency. These transactions involve financial impacts on markets, paying or receiving the difference between prices multiplied by cleared capacity at the LMP node. Virtual transactions are monitored for potential speculation and market manipulation, with regulations becoming more complex over time to address operational issues and regional differences. Market issues can be categorized into manipulation by participants or structural issues within RTO markets. Capacity markets in RTOs are debated due to structural issues and controversies in design. Some RTOs use capacity markets to pay power generators for reserved capacity, but not all agree with this approach. Brownouts and blackouts have still occurred in areas with capacity markets, leading to criticism. Other RTOs like California and Texas question the additional costs of implementing formal capacity markets. Capacity markets in RTOs aim to ensure power availability and cover outages. Real-Time markets address unanticipated demand, while Forward Capacity markets provide certainty for future capacity needs. Price signals indicate the need for new capacity. Forward Capacity markets were introduced to incentivize new participants to invest in building new power plants in high demand areas, but there is debate on their effectiveness as high load pockets persist in some regions. Incorporating new generation into these markets has been a challenge, with the concept of \"Cost of New Entry\" (CONE) used to estimate the cost of building and connecting a reference power plant. The Cost of New Entry (CONE) represents the estimated cost of building and connecting a reference power plant to the grid in a specific location. It serves as a benchmark for peaking power plants to recover fixed costs in the marketplace. CONE is used to determine when new generation is needed based on market reliability needs and can impact the competitiveness of existing generating plants. Concerns have been raised in RTO markets about new entrants submitting low bids that could undermine market competitiveness under capacity market rules. CONE values and MOPR are used to screen for potential market power abuse. PJM states like New Jersey and Maryland incentivized new generation capacity construction, with only states having authority to order new power plant construction. Proposed gas-fired plants were subsidized by states, potentially allowing them to bid below MOPR, leading PJM to adjust market rules. FERC allowed PJM's exemption for state initiatives to bid below MOPR, but insisted that PJM must assess bid competitiveness before appealing to FERC. FERC rejected state proposals for self-supply facilities to bid into PJM's capacity auctions, citing potential impacts on wholesale prices. The Commission clarified that it regulates wholesale prices in the capacity market, not state sovereignty. Load serving entities can freely contract with any generator for power supply, but the MOPR determines the price at which generators can bid into the capacity market. Maryland's efforts to incentivize new generation were found to violate FERC's jurisdiction over wholesale rates by the Virginia U.S. Court of Appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the Appeals Court decision. Disputes can arise in the market settlement process in RTO markets, with processes in place to establish market participants' creditworthiness. Settlement processes in RTO markets generally involve ensuring bid competitiveness before appealing to FERC. The settlement processes in RTO markets involve financial settlements for transmission and ancillary services based on FERC-approved tariffs. Charges collected are distributed to transmission owners and ancillary service providers. Market settlements process generation transactions for market participants within an RTO-managed market operations footprint. The RTO-managed market operations involve multiple settlement processes for assigning financial charges and credits to participants. Timely and accurate accounting enhances market efficiency, reducing risks for participants. Competitive electricity markets offer various wholesale products and services for power sale and transmission. The Western energy crisis highlighted vulnerabilities in electricity markets to manipulation for financial gain. The EPACT05 granted FERC new authority to prevent manipulation in natural gas and electricity markets. EPACT05 increased civil penalties for market manipulation to $1 million per day per violation, aiming to prevent fraud and maintain market transparency in energy markets under FERC jurisdiction. The FERC's Anti-Manipulation Rule covers broad categories of manipulative trading techniques in securities and commodities markets, including wash trading and inflating trading volumes. Traders may combine elements of various schemes to manipulate markets. The practice of marking the close involves executing transactions near the end of trading to influence the closing price. Manipulative schemes include spreading false information to manipulate asset prices, such as the pump and dump scheme. False reporting and wash trading are also common manipulative practices in markets. Wash trading involves offsetting trades at the same price and volume to inflate trading volumes. Withholding supply from the market is a form of commodities manipulation, like market corner manipulation where physical supply is stockpiled to force short positions to buy back at inflated prices. EPACT05 required FERC to establish a memorandum of understanding with CFTC for information sharing. The CFTC and FERC signed memoranda of understanding in 2014 to address regulatory jurisdiction issues and coordinate on market surveillance and investigations into potential market manipulation. The MOUs aim to minimize duplicative information requests and ensure proper coordination between the agencies. The CFTC and FERC signed memoranda of understanding in 2014 to address regulatory jurisdiction issues and coordinate on market surveillance and investigations. Companies in wholesale electricity markets hedge transactions to manage business risks, using physical or financial transactions like OTC swaps or options. Derivatives are used to manage business risk, with values linked to underlying variables like weather conditions or fuel prices. LSEs may use derivatives to manage electricity costs by hedging against volatile spot market prices. The Dodd-Frank Act was passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to reforms aimed at strengthening the U.S. financial sector. The Dodd-Frank Act brought reforms to the financial sector, including new regulations for hedge funds and OTC derivatives markets. The CFTC was given exclusive jurisdiction over swap transactions, with the SEC overseeing security-based swaps. Energy swaps were included in the definition of swaps, subjecting them to new clearing and reporting requirements. Exceptions were made for wholesale electricity producers and buyers who primarily use derivatives to hedge business risks. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced new regulations for hedge funds and OTC derivatives markets, with the CFTC having jurisdiction over swap transactions. Exceptions were made for energy swaps used by wholesale electricity producers to hedge business risks. The end-user exemption allows non-financial entities to hedge commercial risks without clearing requirements. Requests for exemption from regulatory and reporting requirements have been made to the CFTC by entities in the electric power sector. Rule 180.1 of the Dodd-Frank Act addresses fraud issues in connection with swaps and commodity sales, requiring specific intent or recklessness for a violation. Market manipulation prohibition is covered in Rule 180.2, with the CFTC maintaining a four-part test for violations. The Rule emphasizes the need for specific intent, not recklessness, for a market manipulation violation. The CFTC aims to apply Rule 180.1 extensively to combat cross-market manipulation. The CFTC intends to apply Rule 180.1 extensively to combat cross-market manipulation and coordinate enforcement efforts with other authorities. In 2015, the CFTC proposed new rules for position limits on derivatives to constrain speculators' positions, with exemptions for commercial hedgers. The CFTC is proposing position limits to prevent excessive speculation and manipulation in commodity markets, ensuring market liquidity for hedgers and protecting price discovery. Chairman Gensler and Commissioner Wetjen support the limits for market protection and transparency. The CFTC is proposing position limits to prevent market manipulation in the derivatives market, specifically targeting Enron for market manipulation during the Western energy crisis. Enron's use of derivatives allowed it to control a significant amount of energy generation without disclosing it, leading to accusations of flouting regulations. The CFTC's proposed position limits aim to prevent market manipulation, particularly in response to Enron's actions during the Western energy crisis. Enron's use of derivatives gave it market power to manipulate energy markets, leading to price distortions and disruptions. The CFTC expects the rules to deter manipulative behavior and protect price discovery, aiming to prevent entities from gaining market power to influence prices. Enron's manipulation of natural gas prices at the Henry Hub impacted electricity prices in California. FERC's investigations revealed Enron's disregard for market rules to manipulate prices for its own gain. The CFTC's position limits may not prevent such illegal behaviors entirely but could limit their effects if followed. FERC focuses on anti-competitive conduct threatening market transparency to maintain confidence in the market. FERC's Division of Investigations conducts investigations of potential violations that threaten market transparency and confidence in energy markets. Investigations may start from various sources, and if significant violations are found, staff reports to the Commission for appropriate sanctions. If a settlement cannot be reached, the Commission may initiate a public show cause proceeding. In cases where a settlement cannot be reached, the Commission may issue an order to show cause (OSC) for the subject to explain why no violation occurred and why penalties are not warranted. Most investigations by FERC are either closed without action or settled, with recent cases resulting in significant civil penalties and disgorgements. Notable settlements involved Constellation Energy Commodities Group and JP Morgan Ventures Energy Corporation, while a complaint against BP America is still pending. In FY2015, FERC litigated five matters in United States District Courts to enforce penalty assessments. On May 1, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Assessing Civil Penalties against Maxim Power Corporation and employee Kyle Mitton for violating the Anti-Manipulation Rule by charging inflated payments from ISO-NE. The Commission found that Maxim had also made false and misleading statements in its communications. The Commission assessed civil penalties against Maxim Power Corporation and employee Kyle Mitton for violating the Anti-Manipulation Rule by making false statements to ISO-NE. Enforcement staff filed a petition in court to enforce the penalties, while Powhatan Energy Fund, LLC, and others were found to have engaged in fraudulent trades in the PJM market. The Commission assessed civil penalties against Powhatan, Chen, HEEP, and CU for fraudulent round-trip trades in the PJM market. Penalties totaled $30.8 million and disgorgement of unjust profits was ordered. Enforcement actions are ongoing as respondents filed a motion to dismiss the petition. The Commission issued an Order Assessing Civil Penalties against City Power Marketing, LLC and its owner for fraudulent trades in the PJM market, resulting in $14 million in penalties for the company and $1 million for the owner. Additionally, disgorgement of $1,278,358 in unjust profits was ordered. On July 16, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Assessing Civil Penalties against Barclays Bank, PLC and its traders for violating the Anti-Manipulation Rule. Penalties of $435 million were imposed on Barclays and $18 million on the traders, with Barclays ordered to disgorge $34.9 million in unjust profits. Enforcement staff filed a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce the Commission's Order, with a pending motion to dismiss filed by the respondents on November 2, 2015. On October 9, 2013, Enforcement staff filed a petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California to enforce a civil penalty assessment against named traders and Barclays. The court issued a scheduling order on October 2, 2015, indicating it will review FERC's Order and consider whether supplementation of the record is needed for the penalty assessment. The disgorgement calculation was bifurcated from the review of liability and civil penalty assessment. Paper and Tissue LLC, Competitive Energy Services, LLC, and Richard Silkman were found to have violated the Commission's Anti-Manipulation Rule by fraudulently inflating energy load baselines. Civil penalties were imposed, with fines of $5 million for Lincoln, $7.5 million for CES, and $1.25 million for Silkman. Additionally, disgorgement of $379,016 from Lincoln and $166,841 from CES, plus interest, was ordered. Enforcement staff filed petitions in court to enforce these penalty assessments, with motions to dismiss still pending. FERC's allegations in ongoing cases resemble Enron's market schemes during the Western energy crisis, involving fabricated transactions to manipulate market outcomes. One instance in the New England power market saw Energy Capital Partners acquire Brayton Point power plant for $650 million, then close it, causing a significant rise in Forward Capacity market prices. This move could cost New England electricity consumers an estimated $2.6 billion more per year. ISO-NE has proposed actions in response. ISO-NE has proposed Forward Capacity market retirement reforms to prevent market manipulation by requiring suppliers to submit a retirement price for existing resources. This aims to eliminate the potential for capacity suppliers to exercise market power through physical or economic withholding. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 authorized federal agencies to prevent energy market manipulation and impose civil fines. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was given new authority to prevent manipulation and levy fines of up to $1 million per day per violation. Agencies were required to share information and clarify their roles in preventing manipulation, but questions remain about their enforcement roles. In a case of alleged market manipulation, FERC attempted to fine a natural gas trader at Amaranth $30 million for trades on NYMEX in 2007. CFTC had already taken civil action. FERC argued that manipulation on NYMEX influenced natural gas prices under its jurisdiction, but CFTC rejected this reasoning. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of CFTC in March 2013. The CFTC's position was unanimously favored over FERC's involvement in a market manipulation case involving Amaranth and Barclays. Amaranth settled with the CFTC for $7.5 million in 2009. The CFTC exempted certain RTO transactions from Dodd-Frank regulations, including FTRs, energy transactions, Forward Capacity transactions, and reserve or regulation transactions in RTO markets. RTO markets offer various products and services to reduce risks from volatile prices, including derivatives and hedges. The addition of financial instruments aims to increase liquidity, allowing traders to liquidate positions without affecting prices. This liquidity attracts entrants to electricity markets and helps smaller LSEs find counterparties. The drive to increase liquidity has also led to the introduction of financial instruments like FTRs and virtual trades, encouraging speculation in the electricity markets. Electric utilities and LSEs emphasize the importance of hedging in this market. Dodd-Frank addresses market manipulation in electricity markets, focusing on intent or recklessness triggering rules violations. FERC aims to prevent anti-competitive conduct threatening market transparency broadly, leading to a lack of clarity on manipulation definitions. Efficient RTO markets were expected to send price signals reflecting scarcity. Forward Capacity markets were proposed in 2007 to supplement price signals in a competitive market. Despite high capacity prices, some states and LSEs argue that new generation is not being built due to price volatility and uncertainty. Investors and builders are skeptical about the effectiveness of forward capacity markets in incentivizing new plant construction. Congress may need to evaluate the success of these markets in delivering customer benefits. The RTO electricity markets are evolving towards a more financial nature, with physical and financial transactions becoming increasingly linked. Examples include FTRs, virtual trading, and the \"Up to Congestion\" transaction. This convergence aims to boost market liquidity and provide price certainty for customers. The evolving RTO electricity markets are moving towards a more financial nature, with physical and financial transactions becoming increasingly linked. Concerns for Congress include the potential for market manipulation with the increasing convergence of financial and physical transactions. The electricity market rules and tariffs are evolving to encourage liquidity and speculation, potentially without benefits to customers. The retirement of coal-fired power plants may impact RTO markets, leading to more natural gas-fired plants and changing prices. Market manipulation is a concern, with questions raised about standardized rules to reduce opportunities for manipulation. The Amaranth case raised concerns about oversight of cross-market manipulation in electricity markets tied to natural gas prices. FERC enforcement proceedings alleged manipulation by companies trading at a loss in one market to gain in another. Congress may need to clarify jurisdictional issues as the US electricity generation shifts towards natural gas dependence. The trend suggests that opportunities for cross-market manipulation may increase. The effectiveness of the MOU between FERC and CFTC in addressing jurisdictional issues is questioned."
