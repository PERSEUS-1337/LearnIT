    "content": "Most financial assistance programs for low-income families focus on increasing income or subsidizing goods and services. However, education and training programs aim to build human capital. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) have been introduced to help low-income families build financial capital. IDAs operate like retirement 401(k) plans, with contributions matched by the program. Withdrawals are restricted and can be used for education, home purchase, or starting a business. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are designed to help low-income families build financial capital by providing matching funds for contributions. Withdrawals can be used for education, home purchase, or starting a business. IDA programs are funded by federal grants such as the Assets for Independence Act and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. These programs also offer financial literacy education and supportive services to participants. The Assets for Independence (AFI) program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, is funded at $19 million for FY2014. AFI grantees must raise nonfederal funds to operate IDAs, with federal grants capped at $1 million. Eligible organizations for AFI grants include nonprofits, government entities, credit unions, and community development financial institutions. Faith-based organizations can also operate IDA programs. The Assets for Independence (AFI) program, funded at $19 million for FY2014, allows faith-based organizations to operate IDA programs. State programs funded at $1 million or higher before the AFI Act enactment are \"grandfathered\" and exempt from AFI rules. Pennsylvania and Indiana received AFI funds. Participation in AFI IDA programs is limited to those eligible for TANF assistance or with income below 200% of the poverty line and a net worth under $10,000. IDAs can benefit the participant, spouse, and dependents, targeting low-income families for government aid eligibility. The Assets for Independence (AFI) Act allows low-income families to participate in IDA programs without affecting their eligibility for federal assistance. Participants contribute cash or checks, with earnings matched at a minimum $1 for each $1 contributed. Matching funds come from federal and nonfederal sources, with a minimum of 50% from nonfederal sources. Maximum federal matching amounts are $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for households. Funds can be used for post-secondary education expenses or purchasing a home. The Assets for Independence (AFI) Act allows low-income families to participate in IDA programs with matched contributions. Funds can be used for purchasing a home, starting a business, medical expenses, preventing eviction, and necessary living expenses. Financial literacy education is also provided through IDA programs. The AFI Act requires IDA programs to provide financial literacy education to participants using up to 15% of funds for administration and evaluation. Organizations must submit annual progress reports to HHS, which then reports to Congress. TANF is a federal grant for aiding needy families with flexible fund usage. TANF funds can be used for IDA programs, with specific rules and authority provided by the TANF law. IDA programs allow individuals eligible for TANF assistance to make contributions from earned income, which are then matched through a nonprofit organization. The AFI Act rules state that contributions to IDA programs must be matched through a nonprofit organization or government, with no limits on matching rates or amounts. Withdrawals can be made for educational expenses, home purchase, or starting a business. IDAs do not affect financial eligibility for federal aid. TANF IDA programs are limited to those eligible for TANF assistance, with no emergency withdrawals allowed. States have flexibility in designing IDA programs under TANF authority. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) can be established for various purposes beyond educational expenses, home purchase, or starting a business, such as purchasing a car."
