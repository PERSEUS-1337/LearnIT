    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10912 of the Water Code defines terms related to projects, including residential developments with over 500 units, shopping centers employing over 1,000 persons, commercial office buildings with over 1,000 employees, hotels with over 500 rooms, and industrial plants with specific criteria. A project approved after October 8, 2011, that requires no more than 75 acre-feet of water annually is not considered a project. This includes mixed-use projects and those demanding water equivalent to or more than a 500 dwelling unit project. If a public water system has fewer than 5,000 service connections, a \"project\" refers to any proposed development that would increase the system's service connections by 10% or more. A public water system is defined as a system with 3,000 or more service connections, including all facilities used in connection with the system. Section 10912 of the Water Code defines \"project\" as a proposed development with specific criteria, such as residential developments with over 500 units or shopping centers employing more than 1,000 people. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2018, unless extended by a later statute. Proposed projects that fall under the definition of a \"project\" according to Section 10912 of the Water Code include commercial office buildings with over 1,000 employees or more than 250,000 square feet, hotels with over 500 rooms, industrial plants with over 1,000 employees or occupying more than 40 acres of land, mixed-use projects, and projects requiring water equivalent to a 500 dwelling unit project. If a public water system has fewer than 5,000 service connections, a \"project\" refers to any proposed development that would increase the system's service connections by 10% or more, including residential, business, commercial, hotel, motel, or industrial projects. A public water system is defined as a system with 3,000 or more service connections, including all facilities used primarily for water distribution to the public for human consumption. Any collection or pretreatment storage facility not under the operator's control used in connection with the system, and any person treating water for public consumption. This section becomes effective on January 1, 2018. If costs are mandated by the state, reimbursement will be made to local agencies. This act is an urgency statute for public peace, health, or safety. To meet renewable energy goals, this act must take effect immediately to promote photovoltaic and wind generation facilities."
