    "content": "The Energy Critical Elements Renewal Act of 2011 includes provisions for an energy critical elements program, a Policy Coordination Committee, and a rare earth materials loan guarantee program. It also amends the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980. The Energy Critical Elements Renewal Act of 2011 defines key terms such as \"appropriate Congressional committees,\" \"Center,\" \"Department,\" and \"energy critical element.\" The term \"rare earth materials\" includes various chemical elements like Scandium, Yttrium, Lanthanum, Cerium, Praseodymium, Neodymium, and others in different forms. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. ENERGY CRITICAL ELEMENTS PROGRAM. The Department has established a program for research, development, and application to ensure a secure supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic needs. Activities include characterizing stocks, exploring and recovering elements, and improving extraction and recycling methods. The Department's program focuses on ensuring a secure supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic needs. This includes improving understanding, testing alternative materials, and engineering applications that use recycled or alternative elements. The Secretary is tasked with supporting new processes and technologies to enhance efficiency. The Secretary is focused on improving processes and technologies in the energy critical elements industry. The program encourages collaborations and international partnerships for research and development. The Secretary will establish a Research and Development Information Center to collect, disseminate, and archive information on energy critical elements. The Center will serve as a repository for scientific data, assist scientists in utilizing the data, and incorporate other relevant information on energy critical elements. The Secretary will establish a Research and Development Information Center to collect, disseminate, and archive information on energy critical elements. The Center will provide advice on the research program and host annual conferences for information sharing and collaboration. The Secretary will prepare and submit a biennial plan to Congress outlining research activities and contributions to innovative energy technologies for efficient provision of critical elements to the economy. The Secretary will submit a biennial plan to Congress detailing research activities for efficient provision of energy critical elements to the domestic economy, including technical criteria for evaluating loan guarantee applications, status of supported projects, promotion of broad participation, and actions taken based on assessments or recommendations. After 4 years of operation, the Secretary will contract the National Academy of Sciences to assess the program, including the Center's operations. The assessment will involve consultation with industry, higher education institutions, national laboratories, and other relevant entities. The National Academy of Sciences will assess the program and make recommendations on whether it should continue with improvements or be terminated, with lessons learned. The assessment will be available to Congress and the public. Authorization of appropriations includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2012, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2013, and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2014. For fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016, $15,000,000 each is authorized. Additionally, $700,000 is authorized for the Secretary to enter into a contract, and the funds remain available until expended. SEC. 102. SUPPLY OF ENERGY CRITICAL ELEMENTS. The President, through the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will coordinate federal agencies to ensure a stable supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic well-being. This includes identifying these elements, establishing early warning systems for supply issues, and coordinating federal programs related to research and development in this area. The President will coordinate federal agencies to ensure a stable supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic well-being. This includes promoting private enterprise in developing a domestic energy critical elements supply chain, encouraging recycling of energy critical elements, and assessing the availability of technically trained personnel for research and production. The President will coordinate federal agencies to ensure a stable supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic well-being, focusing on attracting and maintaining high-quality professionals for this purpose. The report will be submitted to Congress on activities and findings related to this effort. SEC. 1706. TEMPORARY PROGRAM FOR RARE EARTH MATERIALS REVITALIZATION. The Secretary is authorized to make guarantees for new technologies in rare earth materials separation, preparation, and application for national security and industrial purposes. This is part of the Energy Critical Elements Renewal Act of 2011. The Energy Critical Elements Renewal Act of 2011 authorizes the Secretary to provide loan guarantees for rare earth materials applications in various sectors, including optical systems, electronics, and catalysis. The Secretary aims to expedite approval processes while safeguarding taxpayer interests and collaborate with the private sector to establish a complete rare earth materials production capability in the U.S. within 5 years. The authority to issue guarantees under this act will expire on September 30, 2019. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a new item after section 1705. Title II of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduces a temporary program for rare earth materials revitalization under section 1706. Additionally, amendments are made to the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 under section 201. Amendments are made to the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 under the Energy Critical Elements Renewal Act of 2011, including changes to the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. Amendments are made to the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 under the Energy Critical Elements Renewal Act of 2011, including changes to the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. The amendments involve redesignating paragraphs, assessing the supply of materials for national security and economic well-being, and revising policy statements in the Act. Amendments to the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 include changes to the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. Section 4 of the Act is amended to implement policies set forth in section 3. The National Critical Materials Act of 1984, Title II of Public Law 98-373, is repealed."
