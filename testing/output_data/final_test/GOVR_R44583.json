    "content": "The National Weather Service (NWS) has statutory authority for weather forecasting and issuing storm warnings. It provides forecasts and warnings for the United States and its territories. The 114th Congress aims to improve forecasts and warnings for severe weather events. NWS is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and restructured its organization in 2014. Tables in the report summarize funding for NWS programs generating forecasts and warnings. The report includes a summary of NWS funding and operations, with a focus on weather forecasts and warnings for the protection of life and property. NWS received significant funding in the FY2016 budget for NOAA, with a high priority on short-term weather prediction and warning. The NWS weather forecast offices in the United States underwent restructuring in FY2015, dividing LW&F activities among five subprograms. This restructuring made it challenging to compare funding for LW&F activities before FY2015 with forecast and warning activities after FY2014. NOAA cited reports recommending realignment and restructuring, emphasizing NWS's commitment to providing weather, climate, and hydrological forecast guidance and decision support services to the public. The NWS strives to meet society's weather and hydrological forecast needs. Table 2 displays NWS funding from FY2014 to the proposed FY2017 budget, showing a slight decrease in NWS funding as a percentage of total NOAA funding. The FY2017 proposed budget for NWS is nearly $5 million less than FY2016, while total proposed spending for NOAA in FY2017 is slightly higher than FY2016. Both the House and Senate appropriations committees have reported bills to fund NOAA, including NWS, for FY2017. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress may influence NWS operations in FY2017 and beyond. Legislation focuses on various topics, including increasing Doppler radar stations and improving resilience to extreme weather events. Congressional interest is shown in components and programs within NOAA that contribute to NWS's mission. Several bills in the 114th Congress may impact NWS operations, focusing on areas such as Doppler radar stations and weather satellite programs. Congressional interest is evident in NOAA components and programs that support NWS's mission. The budget for satellite acquisitions remains a significant part of NOAA's annual spending, with Congress likely to introduce legislation to improve NWS operations for better forecasts and warnings in the United States."
