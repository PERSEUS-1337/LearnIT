    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ozone and Particulate Matter Research Act of 1997\". Congress acknowledges the progress made in reducing ozone and particulate matter pollution since the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Act will continue to drive further reductions over the next 5 years. The Clean Air Act aims to reduce ozone and particulate matter pollution. Additional research is recommended to determine health effects of fine particles. Atmospheric data on fine particle levels in the US are currently inadequate. The Clean Air Act aims to reduce ozone and particulate matter pollution, with additional research recommended to determine health effects of fine particles. Current atmospheric data on fine particle levels in the United States are insufficient for understanding health impacts or designating areas under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act aims to reduce ozone and particulate matter pollution, with a focus on fine particles. Additional research is recommended to determine the health effects of fine particles, as current atmospheric data in the United States are insufficient for understanding health impacts or designating areas under the Act. The Clean Air Act aims to reduce ozone and particulate matter pollution, with a focus on fine particles. An independent panel of scientists will establish research priorities for the health effects of particulate matter, considering sizes, characteristics, and health effects of exposure to fine particulate matter at different levels. The Administrator will report the panel's recommendations to Congress by February 1, 1998. The Clean Air Act establishes the Particulate Matter Interagency Committee to evaluate health effects of fine particulate matter, determine dose-response relationships, and assess long-term health impacts of exposure to particulate matter and other pollutants. The Interagency Committee aims to identify biological mechanisms related to life shortening, acute mortality, and morbidity associated with fine particulate matter. The Interagency Committee, established by the Clean Air Act, is tasked with coordinating research on human health effects of particulate matter. It consists of 8 members appointed by different federal agencies and is responsible for developing a program to advance research priorities and monitoring its progress. The Interagency Committee, established by the Clean Air Act, consists of 8 members appointed by various federal agencies including Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Committee elects a chairperson from its members. The Interagency Committee, established by the Clean Air Act, consists of 8 members appointed by various federal agencies. The chairperson ensures duties are carried out and members provide staff. The Administrator requests reports from the National Academy of Sciences on research activities and covers expenses incurred. SEC. 4. SCIENCE REVIEW.\n\nThe Administrator will conduct a review of air quality criteria and standards for ozone and particulate matter under the Clean Air Act. They will determine whether to retain, revise, or promulgate new criteria and standards.\n\nSEC. 5. PARTICULATE MONITORING PROGRAM. SEC. 5. PARTICULATE MONITORING PROGRAM. The Administrator may require State implementation plans to include ambient air quality monitoring for fine particulate matter. Grants will be provided to States for carrying out the monitoring. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on the health effects of allergens on asthmatics in urban areas. $75,000,000 is authorized for sections 1-6, and $25,000,000 for section 7 for fiscal years 1998 through 2002."
