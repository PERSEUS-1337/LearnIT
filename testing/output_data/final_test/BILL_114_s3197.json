    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Quiet Communities Act of 2016\". Congress acknowledges that millions of Americans suffer from hearing loss, with a significant portion attributed to noise exposure. This exposure to noise from various sources like aircraft and traffic can lead to sleep disturbances, health issues, and work disruptions. Chronic noise exposure is also linked to cardiovascular problems, learning deficits in children, stress, and a reduced quality of life. Excessive noise can lead to decreased worker productivity and has significant costs to society. The Environmental Protection Agency established an Office of Noise Abatement and Control under various acts to set noise emission standards, enforce product labeling requirements, develop low emission products, coordinate federal noise reduction programs, and assist state and local entities. Funding for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control was terminated in 1982, leading to dormant noise abatement programs in the United States due to lack of funding for enforcement of regulations and restrictions on state and local governments in regulating noise sources. Noise pollution is expected to worsen with population growth and increased air and vehicular traffic. The Administrator needs to take action to combat this issue for the health and welfare of the people in the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term ``Administrator'' refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the term ``Office'' refers to the Office of Noise Abatement and Control. SEC. 4. REESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE. The Administrator will reestablish the Office within the Environmental Protection Agency to promote State and local noise control programs, conduct national noise research, and assess noise environmental impacts. The Administrator will reestablish the Office within the Environmental Protection Agency to promote State and local noise control programs, conduct national noise research, and assess noise environmental impacts. Additionally, abatement actions will be taken around major transportation facilities, educational materials will be developed and disseminated about the effects of noise, training programs will be established to support noise control programs, and regional technical assistance centers will be set up to assist State and local noise control programs. The Office within the Environmental Protection Agency will assist State and local noise control programs, assess the effectiveness of the Noise Control Act of 1972, and carry out other activities as determined by the Administrator. Preferred approaches include emphasizing noise abatement through local and State activities, market incentives, and coordination with other public and private agencies. Additionally, a study will be conducted on airport noise by independent scientists with expertise in noise measurements, effects, and abatement techniques. The study will examine noise measurement methodologies, health impacts of noise, and effectiveness of noise abatement programs at airports. A report with recommendations to mitigate aircraft noise impact on communities near airports will be submitted to Congress within 24 months. Funding for the study on noise impacts at airports will come from funds allocated to the Office under section 6. SEC. 5 amends the Noise Control Act to include training programs on noise abatement equipment and implementing noise abatement plans. SEC. 6 authorizes $21,000,000 for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 to carry out the Act."
