    "content": "The EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced a final rule in 2015 defining waters protected under the Clean Water Act, revising regulations in place for over 25 years. This was in response to Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 that narrowed the regulatory scope of the CWA. In 2011, guidance was proposed to clarify CWA jurisdiction in light of the Court's rulings. The 2015 rule replaced existing guidance on Clean Water Act jurisdiction, addressing categories of waters that are jurisdictional, not jurisdictional, or require case-specific analysis. The 2011 proposed guidance, which was controversial, aimed to assert jurisdiction categorically for some waters but was not finalized due to opposition from property owners, developers, and the agriculture sector. The 2011 proposed guidance aimed to clarify CWA-regulated waters, with some concerns about potential costs to states and localities. Environmental groups welcomed the guidance but some wanted stronger protections. Supporters and critics urged agencies to replace the non-binding guidance with regulations defining \"waters of the United States.\" Legislative proposals in Congress aimed to block implementation of the 2011 guidance. Proposals to bar EPA and the Corps from implementing the 2011 proposed guidance or developing regulations based on it were introduced but not enacted. Criticism of the proposed rule in March 2014 focused on potential job losses and damage to economic growth. Supporters defended the agencies' efforts to protect U.S. waters and reduce frustration from unclear jurisdiction. The revised rule, effective August 28, 2015, faced legal challenges in multiple federal courts. The Clean Water Act (CWA) protects \"navigable waters,\" including the waters of the United States. Jurisdiction under the CWA is not limited to traditional navigable waters and extends to waters subject to regulatory requirements such as standards, discharge limitations, and permits. Legal challenges were filed in federal courts regarding the 2015 final rule, which compared existing regulatory language with the proposed rule. The Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates \"navigable waters\" in the United States, including standards, discharge limitations, permits, and enforcement. Non-jurisdictional waters are not subject to these federal requirements. The act's definition of \"navigable waters\" applies to various provisions such as discharge prohibitions, permit requirements, water quality standards, oil spill prevention, and enforcement. EPA and the Corps define \"waters of the United States\" in regulations. The EPA and the Corps have revised the definition of \"waters of the United States\" in regulations to align with legal rulings and scientific understanding of interconnected water systems. The new Clean Water Rule clarifies the regulatory status of isolated surface waters in the landscape. The EPA and the Corps developed the Clean Water Rule to clarify the regulatory status of isolated surface waters. They relied on a synthesis of scientific reports to understand the connections between small streams, rivers, wetlands, and larger water bodies. The purpose was to summarize the factors influencing these connections and how they affect downstream waters. The report was reviewed by EPA's Science Advisory Board. The EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) completed a review in October 2014, providing independent scientific advice on the agency's Clean Water Rule. Critics suggested deferring the rule until a final scientific review was complete. EPA issued a final scientific assessment report in January 2015, emphasizing the connectivity of streams and wetlands in terms of water flow and biotic fluxes. The EPA and Corps acknowledge that science cannot always provide clear guidelines for interpreting and implementing policy regarding water, material, and biotic fluxes to downstream waters. The agencies must use scientific, policy, and legal judgment to determine the jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act based on the gradient of connection to traditional navigable waters. Their decision-making process also relies on technical expertise and practical experience gained over 40 years of implementing the CWA. The goal is to establish clearer, more consistent, and easily implementable standards. The final rule announced on May 27, 2015, retains much of the structure of the agencies' existing definition of \"waters of the United States.\" It identifies categories of waters that are and are not jurisdictional, as well as categories that require a case-specific evaluation. Six categories of waters would be jurisdictional by rule without additional analysis. The final rule announced on May 27, 2015, retains much of the structure of the agencies' existing definition of \"waters of the United States.\" Six categories of waters would be jurisdictional by rule without additional analysis, including traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, territorial seas, tributaries meeting the new definition, impoundments, and adjacent waters. The final rule, announced on May 27, 2015, establishes jurisdictional waters based on a significant nexus to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, or territorial seas. This revised definition sets limits on what is considered \"adjacent\" for the first time. The concept of significant nexus is crucial for determining Clean Water Act jurisdiction, as courts require a measure of the connection's significance for downstream water quality. Justice Kennedy emphasized in the 2006 Rapanos case that a mere hydrologic connection may not always establish the necessary nexus with navigable waters. EPA and the Corps consider significant nexus based on law, science, and the context of the case. The final rule, announced in 2015, establishes jurisdictional waters based on a significant nexus to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, or territorial seas. Functions like sediment trapping and flood water retention can demonstrate significant nexus. A water is considered jurisdictional if it is adjacent to a jurisdictional water and meets the definition of \"neighboring\" within specific boundaries. The final rule, announced in 2015, establishes jurisdictional waters based on a significant nexus to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, or territorial seas. Waters within specific boundaries are considered \"neighboring\" if located within certain distances of jurisdictional waters. Tributaries must have a bed, bank, and ordinary high water mark to be categorically jurisdictional under the rule. The final rule, established in 2015, defines jurisdictional waters based on a significant nexus to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, or territorial seas. Tributaries must have a bed, bank, and ordinary high water mark to be categorically jurisdictional. Waters beyond these categories may be jurisdictional based on a significant nexus to downstream waters. Existing regulations include a non-exclusive list of \"other waters\" such as intrastate lakes, mudflats, prairie potholes, and playa lakes. The EPA and the Corps recognize limitations on the scope of jurisdictional waters under the Clean Water Act due to Supreme Court decisions. Controversy surrounds the determination of whether \"other waters\" are jurisdictional, either by rule or on a case-by-case basis. Justice Kennedy concluded in the Rapanos case that wetlands have a significant nexus to jurisdictional waters if they significantly affect the integrity of other covered waters. The new rule replaces previous guidance on determining jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. It excludes intrastate, non-navigable waterbodies unless approved by Corps and EPA Headquarters. \"Other waters\" require a case-by-case evaluation for CWA jurisdiction, with uncertainty on how they can be aggregated for a significant nexus determination. In the proposed rule, \"other waters,\" including wetlands adjacent to jurisdictional waters, were categorically jurisdictional. Non-adjacent \"other waters\" and wetlands would still need a case-by-case significant nexus evaluation. The rule allowed broader aggregation of \"other waters,\" potentially leading to more being deemed jurisdictional. Some in the regulated community wanted specific metrics for establishing significant nexus, but the agencies declined, citing the need for flexibility due to varying conditions and functions of different waters. The agencies sought input on determining jurisdictional \"other waters\" and whether certain types like prairie potholes should be automatically considered jurisdictional without case-by-case analysis. The final rule no longer mentions \"other waters\" but defines additional waters that will be considered \"water of the United States\" if they have a significant nexus. The final rule defines additional waters as \"water of the United States\" if they have a significant nexus to a jurisdictional water. Five subcategories of waters previously considered \"other waters\" are now subject to case-specific evaluation for jurisdiction. The final rule expands the definition of \"water of the United States\" to include additional waters with a significant nexus to jurisdictional waters. Waters within five subcategories are now subject to case-specific evaluation for jurisdiction based on a significant nexus to downstream waters. This approach aligns with Justice Kennedy's opinion and allows for a more nuanced analysis to determine jurisdictional status. The final rule expands the definition of \"water of the United States\" to include additional waters with a significant nexus to jurisdictional waters, requiring a case-specific evaluation. This includes waters within the 100-year floodplain and within 4,000 feet of a jurisdictional water, with a focus on waters between 1,500 and 4,000 feet of the OHWM. The final rule clarifies requirements for determining CWA jurisdiction, providing specific categories for significant nexus evaluation. Certain waters are categorically jurisdictional or excluded, such as waste treatment systems. The final rule clarifies requirements for determining CWA jurisdiction, providing specific categories for significant nexus evaluation. Certain waters are categorically jurisdictional or excluded, such as waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and features excluded by long-standing practice and guidance. Groundwater and stormwater control features in dry land are also excluded. The final rule clarifies requirements for determining CWA jurisdiction, providing specific categories for significant nexus evaluation. It includes various types of stormwater systems, retention basins, and ditches, addressing controversies around the treatment of ditches. The final rule clarifies requirements for determining CWA jurisdiction, focusing on significant nexus evaluation for various stormwater systems, retention basins, and ditches. The treatment of ditches was a major controversy in the proposed rule, with the final rule defining which ditches are protected under the CWA. The final rule maintains existing exemptions for farming, ranching, and silviculture activities. The final rule clarifies CWA jurisdiction by defining terms and addressing stakeholder concerns about definitions. Some terms were clarified or omitted based on public comments to ensure consistency with law and science. The final rule clarifies CWA jurisdiction by defining terms and addressing stakeholder concerns about definitions. Some terms were clarified or omitted based on public comments to ensure consistency with law and science. Definitions for certain terms were either clarified, modified, carried forward from previous regulations, or omitted to avoid confusion or narrow geographic application. In the final rule, the agencies reference the \"100-year floodplain\" to address concerns about vague terms. They decided to use this term because FEMA and NRCS have mapped these areas extensively in the United States. The use of \"riparian area\" was deemed unnecessary and waters in a riparian area are generally within the 100-year floodplain. The agencies clarified that their intent in the Clean Water Rule was to clarify jurisdiction, not expand it, despite acknowledging that the rule would increase the categorical assertion of CWA. The agencies acknowledge that the rule would increase the categorical assertion of CWA jurisdiction compared to current practices. This is due to declaring some waters categorically jurisdictional and changing the regulatory definition of \"waters of the United States.\" The rule aims to provide less ambiguity about CWA application and does not protect new types of waters historically. The new rule aims to expand the categorical assertion of CWA jurisdiction by declaring certain waters jurisdictional and revising the definition of \"waters of the United States.\" It does not protect new types of waters historically but seeks to provide more clarity and certainty in delineating CWA jurisdiction. The final rule aims to provide more clarity and certainty in delineating CWA jurisdiction, resulting in a slight increase in waters under protection but also a reduction compared to existing regulations. The rule is expected to lead to higher costs for regulated entities and governments due to additional permit application expenses. The final rule on CWA jurisdiction aims to provide clarity and certainty, resulting in increased costs for regulated entities and governments. The rule includes additional requirements for oil storage facilities and CAFOs, with estimated annual costs of $1 million for administration. Indirect costs are projected to range from $158 million to $465 million per year, with the Section 404 program facing the greatest impact. The revised assertion of CWA jurisdiction is expected to have a significant impact on various stakeholders, including landowners, development companies, and state/local governments. The proposed rule aims to protect waters and wetlands, providing benefits such as habitat preservation, recreational opportunities, and flood protection. It is estimated that the final rule could result in benefits totaling $339 million. The final rule estimates benefits ranging from $339 million to $572 million per year, with uncertainties and limitations due to data gaps. The analysis does not quantify all costs and benefits definitively but concludes that benefits would exceed costs. The agriculture sector is concerned about potential impacts on operations, particularly regarding a new \"waters of the United States\" rule. The final rule does not modify existing exemptions for \"normal farming and ranching\" practices or certain agricultural discharges. Concerns were raised about the exclusion of some ditches, but the rule clarifies that certain conservation practices are exempt under the Clean Water Act. The interpretive rule by the Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) identifies 56 practices exempt from Section 404 permit requirements under the CWA Section 404(f)(1)(A) exclusion for \"normal farming and ranching\" activities. These practices, such as stream crossings and wetland restoration, do not require a determination if they involve a \"water of the United States.\" This rule aims to clarify which conservation activities qualify for exemptions, providing certainty for producers who follow NRCS technical standards. The interpretive rule by NRCS clarifies exempt agricultural practices from CWA permitting. Despite initial confusion, the rule outlines 56 qualifying practices and a process for review. Public comments were critical, questioning NRCS's role in technical assistance for 404 permitting. The interpretive rule by NRCS faced criticism from agriculture stakeholder groups, environmental groups, and some state environmental agencies. Agriculture groups argued it was procedurally flawed and would impact farmers, while environmental groups and some state agencies believed it would exempt non-farming activities from permitting. Some activities exempt from permitting under the 2014 interpretive rule were criticized for their harmful impacts on water quality. EPA and Corps officials acknowledged the rule did not achieve its intended benefits and were considering alternatives. Congress directed EPA and the Corps to withdraw the rule in the FY2015 omnibus appropriations act. On January 29, 2015, the agencies signed a memorandum withdrawing the interpretive rule. The EPA and USDA signed a memorandum withdrawing the interpretive rule on January 29, 2015. Local governments, including the National Association of Counties, criticized the proposed \"waters of the United States\" rule, particularly concerning the impact on ditches and public infrastructure ownership. No further actions have been announced. The National Association of Counties (NACo) raised concerns about the proposed \"waters of the United States\" rule potentially increasing federal jurisdiction over county-owned ditches. While EPA and Corps officials believed that excluding most ditches would decrease federal jurisdiction, the issue remained controversial. Modifications were made in the final rule to address these concerns. The final rule's exclusions are expected to cover roadside, transportation, and agricultural ditches. The EPA Administrator mentioned in a 2014 congressional hearing that finalizing a rule typically takes about a year, with complex rules often taking longer. This rule defining \"waters of the United States\" was finalized 14 months after. The final rule defining \"waters of the United States\" was completed 14 months after it was proposed. Legal challenges are expected to delay implementation for years. New regulations may address current questions but may not satisfy all interests. The rulemaking process must prioritize sound science over politics to protect wetlands effectively. Congressional interest in the rule has been strong since its proposal in 2014. Congressional critics have urged the withdrawal of the proposed Clean Water Rule or the proposal of a supplemental rule for further public comments. EPA and Corps officials argue that maintaining the status quo would result in time-consuming case-specific evaluations by 38 Corps districts. The final Clean Water Rule aims to clarify rules for jurisdictional determinations, addressing criticisms from industry and agriculture groups. Legal challenges have been filed in federal courts to test the rule's compliance with the Supreme Court's rulings. The final Clean Water Rule faces legal challenges in federal courts regarding its compliance with the Supreme Court's rulings. Petitions for review have been filed in both district and appellate courts, with the Sixth Circuit placing a nationwide stay on the rule. The Sixth Circuit ruled it had jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule, focusing on the interpretation of the appellate judicial review provision of the CWA. Ultimately, the court agreed with the federal government. The Sixth Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling, agreed with the federal government that challenges to the Clean Water Rule should be heard exclusively in circuit courts. Legal complexities remain with ongoing district court cases in other circuits and pending decisions in the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits. The Sixth Circuit ruled that challenges to the Clean Water Rule should be heard in circuit courts. The EPA released a report in 2015 summarizing the connectivity of streams and wetlands to larger water bodies. The draft report by EPA's Office of Research and Development focused on small non-tidal streams, wetlands, and open waters. It found that all tributary streams are connected to downstream rivers, and wetlands play a crucial role in the integrity of downstream waters by transporting water-borne materials. The EPA draft report focused on small non-tidal streams, wetlands, and open waters, examining their connectivity and impact on downstream water quality. The report was reviewed by the Science Advisory Board to assess its scientific basis for clarifying CWA jurisdiction. The Science Advisory Board reviewed the EPA draft report on the connectivity of streams and wetlands to downstream waters. The ad hoc panel of scientists supported EPA's conclusions on the influence of various types of streams on downstream waters and the connection of tributary streams to downstream waters. The panel found the synthesis document to be thorough and technically accurate. The ad hoc panel supported EPA's conclusions on the connectivity of streams and wetlands to downstream waters, emphasizing that connectivity is a gradient with four dimensions. They disagreed with EPA's binary approach to connectivity and highlighted the importance of variations in frequency, duration, predictability, and magnitude of connections. The ad hoc panel disagreed with EPA's conclusion on the difficulty of generalizing the connectivity and downstream effects of non-floodplain waters and wetlands. They suggested framing the discussion on connectivity gradients and quantifying connections to identify research gaps. The panel quantified the degree of connection between waters and wetlands, emphasizing the importance of frequency and duration. Non-floodplain wetlands vary in connectivity and impact on downstream waters, requiring a case-by-case assessment. Most wetlands show some level of connection to downstream waters, but disconnected wetlands may need individual consideration. The EPA faces the challenge of describing these connections effectively. The EPA faced the challenge of describing the hierarchy of decisions and tools needed for case-by-case analysis regarding the connection between streams, wetlands, and downstream waters. The SAB reviewed the ad hoc panel's report, requested minor revisions, and endorsed the SAB recommendation in the final report released in January 2015. The EPA's final report on connectivity of streams and wetlands to downstream waters recognizes variation in connections, functions, and jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. The SAB also reviewed the scientific basis of the proposed \"Waters of the U.S.\" rule. The SAB reviewed the scientific basis of the proposed \"waters of the United States\" rule, with members of the ad hoc panel providing input on the adequacy of the scientific and technical basis. They found general agreement that tributaries, adjacent waters, and wetlands are appropriately jurisdictional under the proposed rule, but highlighted the need for clarification and better definition of key terms. The SAB reviewed the proposed \"waters of the United States\" rule, emphasizing the importance of clarifying and defining key terms like \"adjacent\" and \"tributary.\" Suggestions were made to broaden the definition of \"tributary\" to include a bed, bank, and in some cases an ordinary high water mark. The rule should also consider chemical, biological, and hydrological connections in determining significant nexus, as highlighted in the panel's report. The SAB reviewed the proposed \"waters of the United States\" rule, emphasizing the importance of clarifying key terms like \"adjacent\" and \"tributary.\" Some panel members questioned the exclusion of federal jurisdiction over groundwater and the unclear distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional ditches in the proposed rule. The SAB's recommendations were partially reflected in the 2015 final rule. The SAB urged EPA to reconsider the definition of tributaries in the final rule, disagreeing with certain categorical exclusions and emphasizing the importance of scientific evidence for determining waters of the United States. The SAB disagreed with categorical exclusions in the proposed rule, stating that science does not support excluding certain waters from jurisdiction under the final rule."
