    "content": "The \"Environmental Justice Act of 1992\" is the short title of this legislation, which aims to establish purposes and policies related to environmental justice. The Environmental Justice Act of 1992 aims to collect data on environmental health effects, identify areas with high toxic chemical loadings, assess health impacts in those areas, involve residents in the decision-making process, and require actions to reduce adverse health impacts. The Environmental Justice Act of 1992 aims to address significant adverse impacts on human health in areas with high toxic chemical loadings and ensure equitable distribution of health impacts associated with environmental pollution in the United States. The Environmental Justice Act of 1992 focuses on identifying environmental high impact areas and defining key terms. The Environmental Justice Act of 1992 defines key terms including Administrator, Environmental High Impact Areas (EHIA), Secretary, and toxic chemicals. The Environmental Justice Act of 1992 defines key terms including Administrator, Environmental High Impact Areas (EHIA), Secretary, and toxic chemicals. Liability Act of 1980; hazardous waste listed under Solid Waste Disposal Act; pollutants with air and water quality standards under Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act; materials registered under Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; substances subject to reporting obligations under Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. Toxic chemical facilities include all facilities subject to permit, inspection, or registration requirements under various environmental laws. The curr_chunk mentions various environmental laws such as the Waste Disposal Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard, as well as facilities subject to reporting obligations under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. SEC. 102. IDENTIFICATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HIGH IMPACT AREAS. The Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, in consultation with other agencies, will determine Environmental High Impact Areas within 6 months of enactment. A list of counties or geographic units with the highest total weight of toxic chemicals will be published within 12 months, designating the top 100 as Environmental High Impact Areas. The Administrator will compile a list of Environmental High Impact Areas by calculating the total weight of toxic chemicals in each county, adjusting for toxicity levels, assessing exposures and toxicity, and utilizing data from environmental regulatory authorities. Within 6 months of this Act's enactment, the Administrator, in consultation with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, will publish methods for calculating the total weight of toxic chemicals in various materials for public comment. The Administrator will revise and republish a list of toxic chemicals every 5 years using data compiled for that period. TITLE II--ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES\n\nSEC. 201. MANDATORY INSPECTIONS.\n\nFacilities with high potential for toxic chemical release must undergo compliance inspections every 2 years by the Administrator and Assistant Secretary of OSHA.\n\nTITLE III--COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION\n\nSEC. 301. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. The Secretary may provide grants to individuals or groups affected by toxic chemical releases in EHIA for public participation and technical assistance, not exceeding $50,000 per recipient. Recipients must contribute 20% of the grant cost. The Secretary may provide grants up to $50,000 for public participation and technical assistance in EHIA. Recipients must contribute 20% of the grant cost unless they demonstrate financial need. Grants are limited to one per EHIA but can be renewed for public participation. SEC. 302 of the Act establishes a system of fees or assessments on toxic chemical facilities in EHIAs to fund the community grant program. The fees will consider volume adjustments. Within 24 months of the Act's enactment, the Secretary will issue a report on the health impacts in EHIAs compared to other counties, focusing on cancer, birth deformities, infant mortality, and respiratory diseases. The report will be coordinated by the Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry and will isolate the impacts of environmental pollution. The Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry will isolate the impacts of environmental pollution, rank relative risks of toxic chemicals, evaluate necessary reductions in toxic chemical releases, and assess impacts of uncontrolled releases in high population density areas. Additionally, in communities with adverse health impacts, the agency will issue a report on the findings. The Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry will provide information on toxic chemical releases and their potential health effects to affected communities and tribal governments in Environmental High Impact Areas. SEC. 402. LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE. The President must propose legislation to address significant adverse impacts of environmental pollution on human health in EHIAs, including expanding EPCRA, addressing regulatory loopholes, and implementing measures like taxes or restrictions on toxic chemical releasing activities. The Administrator must report on changes and recommendations to EPA regulations within 2 years, including goals and reasons for each change. The President must propose legislation within 3 years to address conflicting statutory mandates or lack of authority identified in the health impact study. Legislation is proposed to address conflicting statutory mandates or lack of authority identified in the report to Congress. SEC. 403. MORATORIUM. If the report finds adverse impacts of pollution on human health in EHIA, there will be a moratorium on new toxic chemical facilities in that area unless certain conditions are met. The moratorium will continue until the Administrator determines otherwise. Upon petition, the Administrator determines that health-based levels at the EHIA have been reached."
