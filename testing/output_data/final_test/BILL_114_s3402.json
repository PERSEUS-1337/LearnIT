    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Online Booking Scams Act of 2016\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 includes findings and the sense of Congress. The Internet is a significant platform for commerce in the US, with online hotel reservations and travel services being easily accessible. Consumers need clarity on the businesses they engage with online. Misuse of brand identity by third-party sellers is harmful. Online travel agency platforms offer valuable tools for comparative shopping. The misuse of brand identity by third-party sellers has led to financial harm and loss of personal information for consumers booking hotel rooms online. Congress acknowledges the benefits of online travel agency platforms for consumers and emphasizes the importance of clear and accurate information for fair competition among sellers on the Internet. The Federal Trade Commission is urged to revise regulations accordingly. The Federal Trade Commission is urged to revise its website to simplify the process for consumers and businesses to report deceptive practices related to online hotel reservations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include \"affiliation contract\" for online hotel reservation services, \"Commission\" referring to the Federal Trade Commission, \"exhibition organizer or meeting planner\" responsible for event planning, and \"official housing bureau\" designated for exhibitions. The curr_chunk defines terms related to hotel reservation services, including \"bureau,\" \"party directly affiliated,\" and \"third party online hotel reservation seller.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the roles and relationships in the hotel reservation industry. The curr_chunk explains the role of the planner or official housing bureau for events held at the hotel. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR THIRD PARTY ONLINE HOTEL RESERVATION SELLERS. It is illegal for third-party online hotel reservation sellers to charge consumers' financial accounts without clearly disclosing all transaction terms, including goods/services description and cost. The seller must continuously inform the consumer of their third-party status. Third-party online hotel reservation sellers must prominently disclose their brand identity throughout the transaction process, both online and over the phone, to avoid deceptive practices. Enforcement of this requirement falls under the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Federal Trade Commission Act enforces rules against unfair or deceptive practices, with penalties and privileges similar to those in the Act. The Federal Trade Commission Act allows the Commission to create rules for enforcement. States can also enforce the Act if residents are affected by violations. The attorney general of a State can bring a civil action on behalf of residents in federal court to obtain relief for violations. Before taking action, the attorney general must notify the Federal Trade Commission. The attorney general of a State must provide notification to the Federal Trade Commission before filing a civil action, including a copy of the complaint. If immediate action is necessary, the attorney general should notify the Commission upon initiating the civil action. The Commission also has the option to intervene in civil actions brought by state attorneys general. The attorney general of a State can file a civil action against a person and has investigatory powers. The State can coordinate with the Federal Trade Commission. If the Federal Trade Commission takes action against a violation, the State attorney general must coordinate before filing a civil action. The venue for such actions can be a US district court or another competent court. In civil actions brought by state officials, process can be served in any district where the defendant is an inhabitant or can be found. Other state officials authorized by the state can also bring civil actions under the same requirements as attorneys general. Savings provision allows state officials to pursue legal actions for violations of state laws in state courts."
