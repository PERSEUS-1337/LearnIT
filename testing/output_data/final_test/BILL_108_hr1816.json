Subsection (h) of section 1360 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to require the Director to notify communities of any changes to flood insurance map panels and provide a process for appealing such changes. Notification must be sent to the chief executive officer of each affected community by registered mail, along with a copy of the revised maps and information on how to appeal. Additionally, changes must be published in the Federal Register. The Federal Register must publish changes to flood insurance map panels, including details on affected communities, how to obtain copies of revisions, and the appeal process to the Director. Communities have 30 days to appeal changes by submitting a written objection to the Director. The Director must respond to community appeals regarding changes to flood insurance map panels within 30 days by denying the objection, revising the changes, or granting additional time for evidence collection. The community's right to appeal is separate from any other appeal opportunities.

Section 1360 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 is amended to allow property owners to be reimbursed for expenses incurred when requesting to remove their property from base flood elevations.
