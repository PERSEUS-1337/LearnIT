Raoul Wallenberg, born in Europe in 1912 to Swedish parents, graduated from the University of Michigan in 1935. He felt at home in Ann Arbor and struggled to leave America. Wallenberg later became a businessman and Swedish diplomat. In 1936, he worked at the Holland Bank in Haifa, Palestine, where he met Jewish refugees. Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat born in Europe in 1912, was deeply affected by the stories of young Jews fleeing Nazi persecution in Germany. He confided in actress Viveca Lindfors about the horrific plight of Jews under Nazi rule. In January 1944, the War Refugee Board was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to aid civilians victimized by the Nazis in Europe. Wallenberg, recruited by Iver Olsen, was tasked with protecting Jews and Nazi victims in Hungary, a top priority for the Board. Raoul Wallenberg, recruited by Iver Olsen, was sent to Budapest, Hungary as a Swedish diplomat to save lives using creative means. He created the Schutzpass, a new Swedish passport, to grant immunity from death camps, saving 20,000 Jewish lives. Wallenberg also acted swiftly to save thousands of Jewish women from a Nazi plot. Agnes Adachi and her colleagues worked tirelessly through the night to create 2,000 Schutzpasses, saving lives. Wallenberg used US funds to buy buildings for shelters, schools, and soup kitchens for 8,000 children. Tommy Lapid, a young boy in a safe house, witnessed Wallenberg's aid during a Hungarian Fascist threat. During the war's end, Hungarian Fascists took able-bodied women, but Wallenberg's intervention saved them. Despite Eichmann's plans to exterminate 70,000 Jews in Budapest, Wallenberg remained vigilant and protective. During the war's end, Hungarian Fascists planned to exterminate 70,000 Jews in a guarded ghetto in Budapest. Raoul Wallenberg intervened by sending a defected official to warn the general in charge, threatening him with prosecution as a war criminal. This led to the abandonment of the massacre, marking Wallenberg's last big victory. Overall, Wallenberg is credited with saving an estimated 100,000 Jews in Hungary in a 6-month period under the War Refugee Board. Raoul Wallenberg's heroism during the Holocaust saved around 100,000 Jews in Hungary, many of whom later immigrated to the United States. His actions directly impacted influential individuals like Congressman Tom Lantos and Rabbi Yoizef Friedlander, who continued the Liska Hassidic dynasty in the US. Raoul Wallenberg's heroism saved around 100,000 Jews in Hungary, many of whom later immigrated to the United States. His actions make him a strong candidate for a Congressional Gold Medal to celebrate his achievements and humanitarian accomplishments. The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to Raoul Wallenberg's next of kin in recognition of his heroic actions during the Holocaust. The Secretary of the Treasury will strike the medal with suitable emblems and inscriptions. Duplicate medals will also be made. The Secretary may strike duplicate bronze medals of the gold medal and sell them to cover costs. The medals are considered national medals and numismatic items. Proceeds from sales can be used as authorized. SEC. 6. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE. Authorization to charge the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund for medal costs. Sale proceeds of duplicate bronze medals deposited in the Fund."
