Congress acknowledges the availability of technologies to enhance public alerts and warnings, aiming for greater security, rapid dissemination, improved notification abilities, and geographically targeted delivery through various communication modes. Testing diverse communication methods is deemed necessary to effectively alert the public and modernize alert systems. The Federal Government needs to modernize its ability to provide timely warnings to residents of the United States. A national network is required for reliable dissemination of emergency alerts by authorized entities at all levels of government. SEC. 526 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 calls for the modernization of the National Integrated Public Alert and Warning System. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 requires the Secretary to modernize and implement the national integrated public alert and warning system. This includes establishing common protocols, standards, and procedures, as well as the capability to adapt information dissemination based on location and risks. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 mandates the modernization and implementation of a national integrated public alert and warning system. This system must include the capability to alert individuals with disabilities and access needs, conduct training and tests, and provide ongoing training for stakeholders involved in message transmission. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 requires the establishment of a national public alert and warning system that utilizes the National Terrorism Advisory System. The system must conduct regular nationwide tests, incorporate diverse modes of information dissemination, and collaborate with various stakeholders for effective alert and warning capabilities. The national public alert and warning system must disseminate homeland security information to the public efficiently, incorporate future technologies, be resilient against terrorism, promote partnerships for coordination, provide accessible alerts to all affected populations, improve alert reception in remote areas, and ensure protection mechanisms. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2013 establishes an Advisory Committee to ensure the protection of individual privacy and modernize the public alert and warning system. The committee includes members such as the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Advisory Committee established by the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2013 includes members appointed by the Secretary, such as representatives of State and local governments, the Federal Communications Commission Chairman, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Administrator, the Department of Commerce Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, the Department of Homeland Security Under Secretary for Science and Technology, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency Director of the Office of Disability Integration and Coordination. The Advisory Committee for the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2013 includes representatives from various entities such as emergency management agencies, response providers, communication providers, federally recognized Indian tribes, national Indian organizations, and individuals with technical expertise in communications services. The curr_chunk lists various entities involved in the provision of communications services, including vendors, developers, manufacturers, service bureaus, broadcasting, cellular, cable, and satellite industries, as well as organizations representing individuals with disabilities and the elderly. The Advisory Committee for the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2013 includes representatives from various stakeholders, national organizations, and educational institutions. The Secretary serves as the Chairperson, and the initial meeting must occur within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Advisory Committee for the Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2013 meets annually, with open meetings that are noticed at least 14 days in advance. The Committee may adopt rules and consult with nonmembers to consider new technology. The Advisory Committee considers new technology from various sources for the public alert and warning system, and develops recommendations for its improvement, including common protocols and standards. The Advisory Committee evaluates the public alert and warning system, identifies accomplishments and deficiencies, and makes recommendations for increasing participation and improving the system's capabilities. The public alert and warning system should be capable of alerting individuals with disabilities, limited English proficiency, and incorporate multiple communication technologies. It should also adapt to future technologies and encourage proper use by State and local governments through training programs. The public alert and warning system aims to reach the largest affected population, including tourists, enhance community partnerships, involve underserved communities, and provide redundant alert mechanisms where possible. The Advisory Committee will submit annual reports to the Secretary regarding recommendations, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the Advisory Committee. Additionally, a report must be submitted one year after the fully functional establishment of the public alert and warning system. The Secretary must submit a report every six months to the Committees on Homeland Security regarding the functionality and performance of the integrated public alert and warning system, including findings from the Advisory Committee report, system accomplishments and deficiencies, recommendations for improvements, and information on disseminating homeland security information. Authorization of appropriations is also included.
