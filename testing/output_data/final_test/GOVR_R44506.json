    "content": "The Dodd-Frank Act was passed after the financial crisis, addressing various aspects of the financial system. Housing finance reform, particularly concerning Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, remains unresolved. Congress has debated reform extensively, with some legislation enacted. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has enacted legislation for housing finance reform, focusing on credit risk, mortgage-backed securities issuance, and MBS structure. Congress has raised concerns about potential duopolistic tendencies in the system. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs reported on Act S. 1484, which would codify and alter FHFA's actions. The report explains the GSEs' conservatorship and their role in the housing finance system, highlighting their special privileges and responsibilities. The GSEs do not originate mortgages but purchase conforming mortgages through their credit guarantee businesses. The GSEs purchase conforming mortgages and pool them into MBS, guaranteeing timely payment to investors. They transfer credit risk to compensate for their guarantee and profit from the difference in borrowing rates for mortgage-related assets in their portfolio investment business. In September 2008, the GSEs entered conservatorship with FHFA due to financial losses and concerns about their ability to support the housing finance system. FHFA has the powers of management, board, and shareholders to restore confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and mitigate systemic risk. Treasury agreed to provide financial support to the GSEs under this arrangement. Since entering conservatorship in 2008, the GSEs have received $187.4 billion in assistance to avoid liquidation and paid over $240 billion in dividends to Treasury. All profits currently go to taxpayers, with risks also borne by them. FHFA is taking steps to reform the housing finance system as conservator, fulfilling legal requirements and laying the foundation for a new system. FHFA, as conservator, is implementing reforms to strengthen the housing finance system. The reforms involve credit risk transfers with private investors and the use of a Common Securitization Platform for securitizing mortgages. This will replace the current system where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac absorb credit risk and issue separate MBS. After the housing bubble burst, private capital retreated from the market due to high delinquency rates and losses. The government increased its exposure to credit risk to ensure mortgage credit continued to flow, playing a more significant role in the mortgage market post-2008 through GSEs, FHA, and VA. Private capital decreased, with private-label securitizations nearly disappearing. The GSEs increased their support to the market, leading to higher exposure to credit risk. Credit risk is a focus of risk-sharing transactions, along with interest rate risk. GSEs retain credit risk but transfer interest rate risk to investors. This shift in risk is significant due to the amount of credit risk GSEs are exposed to. The Treasury's financial agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have shifted credit risk to taxpayers. Risk-sharing transactions aim to attract private capital and reduce taxpayers' exposure. Private entities absorb some credit risk in exchange for compensation, lessening taxpayers' risk but also reducing potential dividends to the Treasury. The GSEs previously shared credit risk through borrower requirements like down payments or mortgage insurance. FHFA is working to increase risk-sharing methods for mortgages acquired by the GSEs, targeting the transfer of credit risk on 90% of newly acquired single-family mortgages. This initiative aims to reduce taxpayers' exposure to large losses by involving private entities in absorbing credit risk in exchange for compensation. Since 2013, risk sharing has grown in importance for the GSEs, with $75.9 billion in transactions in 2013, $344.8 billion in 2014, and $417.1 billion in 2015. The GSEs transfer some credit risk in these deals, excluding catastrophic risk but including expected and unexpected credit risks. The GSEs transfer credit risk in deals, excluding catastrophic risk but including expected and unexpected credit risks. In 2015, $16.8 billion of risk was transferred out of $417.1 billion unpaid principal balance. Historical losses show a 3.47% loss rate for mortgages purchased in 2007. Approximately half of the mortgages purchased by the GSEs are included in risk-sharing deals, with 4% of the credit risk being sold. Debt issuance is the most common method used, accounting for 83% of all credit risk transfers. Investors earn higher returns if the mortgages perform well under this model. The GSEs transfer credit risk to investors through debt issuance deals like Structured Agency Credit Risk (STACR) for Freddie Mac and Connect Avenue Securities (CAS) for Fannie Mae. Investors receive payments based on the performance of the reference pool, ultimately getting a return of their principal less any covered credit losses. Different tranches of debt are issued for each deal, varying in the amount and type of risk transferred. The GSEs transfer credit risk to investors through debt issuance deals like STACR for Freddie Mac and CAS for Fannie Mae. Different tranches of debt are issued for each deal, varying in the amount and type of risk transferred. FHFA aims to transition from debt issuance to credit-linked notes (CLNs) for STACR and CAS products. The GSEs transfer credit risk to investors through debt issuance deals like STACR for Freddie Mac and CAS for Fannie Mae. FHFA aims to transition to credit-linked notes (CLNs) to reduce counterparty risk for investors. CLNs are issued through a trust, reducing the risk of the GSE failing to make payments. However, there may be downsides such as unresolved tax issues. Mac transfers credit risk to reinsurance companies on a pool of mortgages. Reinsurance companies offer insurance to other insurance companies, diversifying their exposures. Freddie Mac's insurance transactions are called ACIS, while Fannie Mae's are CIRT. These insurance transfers can be combined with other risk-sharing transactions, such as Freddie Mac's STACR deals. Freddie Mac transfers credit risk through STACR deals and retains some risk. They further transfer remaining risk through ACIS deals to reinsurance companies. Mortgage insurance is another method of risk transfer for mortgages with less than a 20% down payment. Mortgage insurers absorb losses if the borrower defaults. The GSEs require mortgage insurers to absorb losses based on down payment amount. Deeper mortgage insurance would reduce GSEs' risk exposure by having insurers cover more losses upfront. FHFA plans to explore deeper mortgage insurance transactions. The GSEs may charge reduced guarantee fees for mortgages with deeper mortgage insurance, allowing insurers to absorb more risk upfront. Front-end lender risk sharing involves lenders retaining some credit risk, resulting in reduced guarantee fees to the GSE. In a front-end lender risk-sharing transaction, J.P. Morgan Chase warehoused loans and sold them to Fannie Mae in a senior-subordinate securitization deal. This structure guarantees repayment to investors in senior tranches but exposes junior investors to credit risk. Freddie Mac also uses a similar structure in their Whole Loan Securities (WLS) transactions. Freddie Mac issues senior-subordinate securitizations called Whole Loan Securities (WLS) for risk-sharing. Congress is interested in transaction types affecting housing finance and reducing taxpayers' risk exposure. Section 706 of S. 1484 would codify existing risk-sharing practices at the GSEs and require further risk-sharing transactions. The GSEs are required to engage in risk-sharing transactions, including front-end and back-end methods, to reduce risk exposure. Different types of risk-sharing involve transferring the first-loss position and sharing risk with private entities. Annual reports to Congress on these transactions are mandated by FHFA. The GSEs engage in front-end and back-end risk-sharing transactions to reduce risk exposure. Front-end risk sharing transfers credit risk before mortgages are in the portfolio, while back-end risk sharing exposes the GSEs to credit risk while warehousing mortgages. Loss position in a risk-sharing deal refers to the order in which an investor is exposed to losses. Investors in back-end transactions share risk on a pool of mortgages that the GSE already owns. The first-loss position in a risk-sharing deal involves investors bearing losses from defaults on mortgages before others. S. 1484 would require GSEs to sell this position to private investors for more front-end risk sharing. Borrowers must have 20% down payment or approved credit enhancement. FHFA will analyze front-end credit risk transfer transactions. Front-end risk sharing involves GSEs selling part of the first-loss position to reduce their exposure to risk and transfer it at the best price. Policymakers also consider how risk-sharing methods impact consumers' access to credit. Front-end risk sharing in mortgage lending may lead to credit overlays, where private entities impose stricter qualification standards than GSEs, potentially raising prices for consumers or limiting access to credit. Private entities could set more stringent standards out of fear of having to repurchase mortgages that do not meet GSEs' criteria. GSEs could address concerns about front-end risk sharing by requiring private entities to meet affordable housing requirements or setting clear repurchase standards. Front-end risk sharing can incentivize lenders to offer lower rates, expanding credit access. Back-end risk sharing may impact credit availability if investors demand higher returns. Risk-sharing methods may react differently over a credit cycle, leading to price fluctuations. Some analysts argue that risk-sharing transactions relying on capital markets may be more volatile than mortgage insurers or lenders due to the sensitivity of asset managers, hedge funds, and other investors to risk tolerance. Capital market investors are concerned about individual deals and do not have the same fixed costs as mortgage insurers and lenders. Mortgage insurers are seen as being in the long-term business of taking mortgage credit risk, leading to less pricing fluctuation in response to market conditions. The GSE Debt Issuance method involves prefunding with upfront payments held in a trust to compensate for losses on the reference pool, providing high likelihood of GSEs being compensated. Other risk-sharing methods like insurance and Front-End Lender Risk-Sharing expose GSEs to counterparty risk if the insurance company or lender lacks resources to repay. The GSEs take steps to minimize counterparty risk by requiring counterparties to meet creditworthiness standards and post collateral. FHFA aims to expand the investor base for risk-sharing transactions in 2016 to reduce volatility. Broadening the investor base includes banks, hedge funds, insurers, and other companies. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) identified issues limiting investors' involvement in GSEs' debt issuance transactions. REITs are discouraged due to not meeting requirements, and banks are deterred by higher capital requirements. Modifying regulations could expand the investor base. The Common Securitization Platform (CSP) is a technology platform being created by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to perform the back-office functions of securitization. The CSP, developed to replace antiquated systems, is a multi-year project expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2016. Common Securitization Solutions (CSS), jointly owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is creating the CSP. Each GSE appointed two members to CSS's board of managers. Common Securitization Solutions (CSS), jointly owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is developing the Common Securitization Platform (CSP). The GSEs have invested $146 million in CSS, and CSS relies on them for certain office functions. The CSP will assist the GSEs in acquiring mortgages from lenders and issuing Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). The CSP, developed by CSS and jointly owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will be used by the GSEs to issue and administer MBS. The CSP will handle core functionalities of securitization, while the GSEs will acquire mortgages and work with CSS to issue MBS. GSEs, not CSS, will guarantee MBS and set loss mitigation practices. The CSP will produce disclosures for investors at issuance and provide monthly updates on MBS and underlying mortgages. The CSP, developed by CSS and jointly owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, will be used by the GSEs to securitize mortgages. Some functions will be performed by CSS and the CSP instead of solely by the GSEs. Congress is interested in the CSP's development for housing finance reform. FHFA is structuring the CSP for use by other private entities to issue MBS. Some in Congress are concerned about the compatibility of the CSP with their preferred housing finance reform. Sections 704 and 705 of S. 1484 address issues related to the relationship between the GSEs and the CSP. Section 704 requires FHFA to establish the Secondary Market Advisory Committee, while Section 705 mandates FHFA to submit an annual report to Congress on the CSP's development. The CSP's development and legal framework for non-GSEs to securitize through it will be reported to Congress. A plan to transition the CSP to a private entity will be developed. FHFA will oversee CSS, ensuring safety and soundness, and transfer necessary funds and assets from the GSEs to CSS. The CSP will be transferred from joint ownership of the GSEs to a private, nonprofit entity within 5 years, with the GSEs being repaid for transferred property within 10 years. Concerns exist about the CSP's compatibility with future housing finance reform, but FHFA aims for it to benefit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The CSP will be transferred from joint ownership of the GSEs to a private, nonprofit entity within 5 years, with the GSEs being repaid for transferred property within 10 years. Concerns exist about the CSP's compatibility with future housing finance reform, but FHFA aims for it to benefit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The testimony notes that FHFA is requiring the CSP to leverage systems, software, and standards used in the private sector to ensure adaptability for other market actors. Some are concerned about CSS, owned by the GSEs, having the incentive to make the CSP compatible with non-GSE companies, potentially affecting market share. S. 1484 would establish a Secondary Market Advisory Committee to address concerns about broader CSP accessibility. The Secondary Market Advisory Committee would ensure private-sector input for the GSEs. S. 1484 aims to reconstitute the CSS board with unaffiliated members. FHFA has taken steps to address concerns, including establishing the Single Security and CSP Industry Advisory Group. Some argue for an open access CSP, while others believe additional steps from S. 1484 are necessary. Some argue for open access to the CSP to encourage private companies in the mortgage market. However, simply granting access to the technology may not revive the private-label securities market, which has significantly declined since 2005. The lack of a clear legal framework is a major issue in the PLS market's near disappearance. FHFA proposed in 2012 to establish a contractual and disclosure framework (CDF) to address legal uncertainty in the private-label securities (PLS) market. However, the CDF was later dropped due to deficiencies more relevant to PLS securitization. Treasury also announced efforts in 2014 to develop market practices and standards for a sustainable PLS housing finance channel. The American Securitization Forum (ASF) and Structured Finance Industry Group (SFIG) have been leading efforts to address issues in the PLS market, but results have not materialized yet. S. 1484 aims to authorize CSS to develop standards for non-GSE companies to securitize mortgages through the CSP and issue MBS. This includes developing the CDF that FHFA previously excluded from reform efforts, in an effort to restart the PLS market and increase private capital. Ownership of the CSP under GSEs is seen as necessary to prevent disruptions in the mortgage market. There are differing opinions on whether the CSP should be owned by a non-GSE entity in the future, with some advocating for a transition now. S. 1484 addresses standards for non-GSE companies to securitize mortgages through the CSP. The CSP should be sold by the GSEs but not spun off at this time. S. 1484 would transfer the CSP to a private entity within 5 years and repay the GSEs within 10 years. The Single Security initiative aims to create a unified MBS market through the CSP, aligning features of Fannie and Freddie MBS to enhance liquidity. FHFA argues that the Single Security would enhance MBS market liquidity and eliminate Freddie Mac's competitive subsidy. Fannie and Freddie MBS are traded in the TBA market, where specific mortgages are unknown until settlement. Fungibility allows any MBS pool meeting criteria to be delivered, ensuring MBS are interchangeable. The fungibility of MBS in the TBA market is crucial, with differences in liquidity between Fannie and Freddie MBS leading to Freddie MBS trading at a discount. Fannie's MBS are more liquid, trading at nine times the volume of Freddie's, despite Freddie's lower production volume. This difference in liquidity influences the pricing and trading of the two MBS products. The liquidity disparity between Fannie and Freddie MBS leads to Freddie MBS trading at a discount. To stay competitive, Freddie offers lower guarantee fees, resulting in a subsidy and lower revenues. This subsidy, estimated at $100-600 million annually, transfers taxpayer money to lenders. FHFA suggests that a Single Security could address liquidity and subsidy issues by creating a deeper, more liquid market. The Single Security aims to eliminate the subsidy Freddie provides to lenders by aligning practices with Fannie and creating a more liquid market. Price differentiation may occur if differences in how the GSEs administer MBS result in investors not treating them as fungible. FHFA has directed the GSEs to align policies and disclosures to ensure pricing of MBS is similar. Each GSE will purchase conforming mortgages and issue MBS through the CSP. The Single Security can be traded on the TBA market. The Single Security can be traded on the TBA market and is linked to the development of the CSP. FHFA plans to allow existing Freddie MBS to be exchanged for a comparable Single Security, while Fannie MBS are expected to be viewed as fungible with the Single Security. Release 2 of the CSP, planned for 2018, will enable both GSEs to issue Single Securities. S. 1484 does not directly address the Single Security but may impact it through its relationship with the CSP. Policymakers may need to consider additional topics related to the Single Security, such as promoting liquidity in the GSE MBS market. A liquid secondary market can benefit various stakeholders in the housing finance system by lowering interest rates for borrowers and reducing uncertainty for MBS sellers in the TBA market. The Single Security aims to enhance liquidity in the TBA market, benefiting various stakeholders. However, concerns exist regarding the alignment of policies between GSEs, which could hinder its success. \"Greater harmonization of GSEs' policies is crucial for the success of the Single Security initiative. Failure to align factors could lead to market fragmentation. FHFA's balance in addressing this issue is uncertain. Policy alignment may impact innovation and competition, limiting a GSE's ability to introduce new lending programs.\" The FHFA may limit innovative activities to prevent differentiation between GSEs. Concerns about competition arise with the move to a Single Security. Existing pricing differences between Fannie and Freddie could impact borrower costs. The Single Security aims to put GSEs on equal footing and encourage competition in the housing finance system reform. Future housing finance reform may incorporate the Single Security, but concerns exist about a potential \"double transition\" for market participants. The success of the Single Security could rely on the GSEs' guarantees and market confidence in them. If reform does not incorporate the Single Security, there could be increased risk of disruption in the housing market. The liquidity of the Single Security could be affected if the guarantee of the GSEs is questioned. FHFA is reforming the housing finance system, facing limitations on how much it can reform without legislative action. Treasury holds a significant ownership stake in Fannie and Freddie as compensation for support provided. Congress has considered proposals to jumpstart GSE reform. Some argue for Treasury to sell its stake in GSEs and allow them to exit conservatorship through \"recapitalize and release\" plan. This would enable GSEs to rebuild capital and return to private control. Arguments for and against this plan are debated in Congress. Many in Congress oppose Treasury selling its stake in GSEs and returning to the old system, fearing a reversion to pre-crisis problems. Legislation prohibits the sale of Treasury's shares in GSEs until January 1, 2018, unless new laws allow it. Congress is urged to determine the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Treasury is restricted from selling its shares in GSEs until legislation is enacted. FHFA has not indicated a near-term exit from conservatorship for the GSEs, which may not be feasible without Treasury divesting its ownership. Legislation similar to the 2016 law prohibits the sale or transfer of preferred shares. Some see the GSEs' guarantee fees as a potential revenue source to offset federal spending or tax cuts. Guarantee fees are charges for assuming credit risk on MBS. In 2011, guarantee fees were increased to partially offset costs of a bill. Since then, guarantee fees have been considered as offsets for various types of spending. The GSEs' guarantee fees have been considered as a potential revenue source to offset federal spending or tax cuts. Congress has debated using guarantee fees as offsets for different types of spending, with some arguing that it may hinder GSE reform efforts. Efforts have been made to prohibit the use of guarantee fees as offsets, such as in the budget resolution of FY2016. Section 702 of S. 1484 also includes a provision to prohibit the use of guarantee fees as offsets. Section 702 of S. 1484 prohibits the use of guarantee fees as an offset unless part of legislation instructing Treasury to sell its senior preferred stock or reform the secondary mortgage market."
