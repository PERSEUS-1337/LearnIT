    "content": "Since 2002, Canada has been the top agricultural export market for the United States, followed by Mexico until 2010 when China took over as the second-largest market. In FY2018, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $143 billion, with Canada and Mexico accounting for about 27% of that. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico play a significant role in stimulating the U.S. economy, creating jobs, and are a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Trump Administration announced an agreement with Canada and Mexico for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to possibly replace NAFTA. NAFTA, in force since January 1, 1994, consisted of three separate bilateral agreements between Canada and the United States, Mexico and the United States, and Canada and Mexico. The Canada-U.S. Trade Agreement (CUSTA) provisions from 1989 continued under NAFTA, focusing on tariff elimination and agricultural market integration. Agricultural provisions from CUSTA remained in force under NAFTA, with tariffs phased out for most agricultural products. Under NAFTA, tariffs were phased out for most agricultural products, but certain exemptions were made for products like dairy, poultry, and eggs. Canada's agricultural sector was liberalized under NAFTA, except for dairy, poultry, and egg products which are protected by supply management policies and high tariffs. Quotas for these products were redefined as tariff-rate quotas to comply with international agreements. Under NAFTA, agricultural trade restrictions between the United States and Mexico were eliminated, with tariffs and quotas on products like corn, dry edible beans, nonfat dry milk, sugar, cucumbers, orange juice, and sprouting broccoli being removed by 2008. Mexico also eliminated all tariffs and quotas on agricultural imports from the United States, improving market access. NAFTA improved market access between the United States and Mexico by eliminating agricultural trade restrictions. It set standards on policies and regulations, including rules of origin, intellectual property rights, foreign investment, and dispute resolution. The agreement's sanitary and phytosanitary provisions harmonized regulations and facilitated agricultural trade. USMCA aims to build upon NAFTA to enhance fair trade and expand American agricultural exports. USMCA needs ratification from Congress, Canada, and Mexico to enter into force. President Trump has considered withdrawing from NAFTA. Delays in USMCA approval could affect Canada's decision due to upcoming elections. USMCA aims to improve agricultural trade by reducing barriers and expanding TRQs. The USMCA agreement with Canada would expand TRQs for U.S. agricultural products. Other changes include harmonizing trade in agricultural biotechnology products and applying the same standards to imports. All food and agricultural products with zero tariffs under NAFTA would remain tariff-free under USMCA. Agricultural products exempted from tariff elimination would be phased out for market liberalization. Canada's supply management regime includes TRQs on dairy and poultry imports. Under NAFTA and WTO commitments, Canada has TRQs for dairy and poultry imports. The NAFTA TRQ for chicken meat is higher than the WTO TRQ. Canada's chicken meat NAFTA TRQ was 90,100 metric tons in 2018 and is estimated to be 95,000 metric tons in 2019. Both poultry and dairy TRQs under NAFTA are global, while WTO dairy TRQs have specific country allocations. Canada's TRQs for dairy and poultry imports have specific country allocations under NAFTA and WTO commitments. The USMCA agreement includes new TRQs for U.S. exporters of dairy products, separate from Canada's existing WTO commitments. These additional TRQs only apply to the United States, while TRQs for chicken meat and eggs are replaced with U.S.-specific commitments. The USMCA also introduces a minimum access commitment for turkey and broiler hatching eggs and chicks, which applies to imports from all origins. The USMCA agreement expands TRQs for U.S. exports, while maintaining steep tariffs for over-quota exports under Canada's WTO commitment. The United States will improve access to Canadian dairy products, sugar, peanuts, and cotton. Tariffs on cotton and peanut imports from Canada to the U.S. will be phased out over five years. Mexico has already eliminated tariffs and quotas on U.S. agricultural imports under NAFTA, with no further changes proposed under USMCA. Under USMCA, Canada agreed to reduce barriers to U.S. dairy exports by changing its milk pricing system, including eliminating Class 7 milk price and setting prices based on U.S. nonfat dry milk price. Both countries will notify each other of any new milk class prices introduced. Under USMCA, Canada would maintain its dairy supply management system but increase TRQs for U.S. exports of various dairy products. The agreement includes transparency provisions for TRQ implementation, allowing exporters to monitor quota utilization. The new TRQs proposed by Canada under USMCA would expand access for U.S. dairy products into Canada. USMCA would open additional market opportunities for U.S. dairy exports to Canada by increasing TRQs and allowing more access for U.S. commercial dairy processors. Canada agreed to cap its global exports of skim milk powder and milk protein concentrates under the agreement. Canada has proposed to replace its NAFTA commitments for poultry and eggs with new TRQs under USMCA. The duty-free quota for chicken meat would start at 47,000 metric tons and expand to 57,000 metric tons in year six, increasing by 1% per year for the next 10 years. The United States would also have access to Canada's WTO chicken quota of 39,844 metric tons. Canada's TRQ for U.S. eggs would reach 10 million dozen by year six, increasing by 1% per year for the next 10 years. TRQs for turkey and broiler hatching eggs and chicks would be based on Canadian production. Under USMCA, TRQs for turkey and broiler-hatching eggs and chicks are based on Canada's production or WTO commitment volume. Provisions aim to expand market access for U.S. agricultural producers, including equal treatment for U.S. wheat exports to Canada. The USMCA agreement includes provisions for U.S. wheat exporters to benefit from equivalency with Canadian wheat varieties, but the process can be lengthy. Additionally, a specific textile and apparel chapter in the agreement may support U.S. cotton production. The agreement also ensures equal treatment for the distribution of spirits, wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages from USMCA countries. The USMCA agreement establishes new rules for listing requirements and cost markups of alcoholic beverages imported from USMCA countries. It includes provisions for greater transparency and regulatory alignment in SPS rules, a mechanism for technical consultations, and procedural safeguards for geographical indications. The USMCA agreement includes provisions for protecting geographical indications (GIs) for food products, transparency requirements for new GIs, and a process for determining common food names. Mexico confirmed a list of 33 cheese terms as common names for U.S. cheese producers. Certain U.S., Canadian, and Mexican spirits would be protected as distinctive products under USMCA. Under the proposed USMCA agreement, certain U.S., Canadian, and Mexican spirits like Bourbon Whiskey, Tennessee Whiskey, Canadian Whiskey, Tequila, and Mezcal must originate in their respective countries. Additional protections are in place for American Rye Whiskey, Charanda, Sotol, and Bacanora. The agreement also includes provisions for protecting proprietary food formulas and regulating trade in products created using agricultural biotechnology. The USMCA provisions for biotechnology cover crops produced with all methods, including gene editing. It establishes a Working Group for Cooperation on Agricultural Biotechnology to facilitate information exchange. The agreement outlines procedures to improve transparency in approving agricultural biotech products and handling shipments with unapproved products. However, it does not address all changes sought by U.S. agricultural groups, such as trade remedy laws for seasonal produce imports. The USMCA does not address nontariff barriers for U.S. fresh potatoes in Mexico and Canada, including Canada's Standard Container Law. It also does not address the removal of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports imposed by Canada and Mexico in response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs. Some U.S. agriculture stakeholders are concerned about the potential negative impact of these tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico. In recent years, the U.S. and Canada have seen a significant increase in agricultural trade, with both countries jointly accounting for about 40% of U.S. agricultural exports. The value of total U.S. agricultural product exports to Canada and Mexico has risen over the years, peaking at $41 billion in FY2014. Factors contributing to lower exports since then include drought-related livestock production declines, increased Canadian production, and competition from other markets. Since mid-2018, U.S. exports have been impacted by retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico have grown significantly since NAFTA, reaching $48 billion in FY2018. However, USDA projects a decline in total U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico to $41.2 billion for FY2019, while imports from these countries are projected at $49.6 billion. In FY2018, U.S. agricultural exports to Canada totaled over $20 billion, accounting for 14% of total U.S. agriculture exports. Consumer-ready food products saw the greatest increase, making up almost 80% of U.S. agricultural exports to Canada. Canada also accounted for 24% of total U.S. consumer-ready food product exports to all destinations in FY2018. In FY2018, Canada was a significant market for U.S. agricultural exports, accounting for a large portion of fresh vegetable, nonalcoholic beverage, snack food, fresh fruit, live animal, and wine and beer exports. Canada also saw an increase in imports of U.S. corn, soybeans, rice, pulses, and wheat after NAFTA. Total U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico grew substantially after NAFTA, reaching $18.8 billion in FY2018, with grains and meats being the largest exports. In FY2018, U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico totaled over $18 billion, accounting for 13% of all U.S. agricultural exports. Mexico is a major market for various products including dairy, prepared food, fruit, tree nuts, sugars, sweeteners, wine, beer, and distillers dry grains. Consumer-ready products make up a significant portion of exports to Mexico. Additionally, Mexico is a key market for bulk agricultural commodities, meat, and dairy products, with significant percentages of U.S. corn, dairy, pork, poultry, wheat, and soybean exports going to Mexico. In FY2018, U.S. agricultural imports from Canada and Mexico have increased in value. Major U.S. imports from Canada include snack foods, meats, and processed fruit and vegetable products. U.S. imports from Mexico mostly consist of fresh fruit and vegetables, alcoholic beverages, snack foods, and processed fruit and vegetable products. Live animal trade patterns have been affected by North American market dynamics and hog cycle dynamics in recent years. NAFTA has facilitated trade in North America by reducing tariffs and other barriers, leading to increased U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico. Studies show that NAFTA expanded trade in commodities with significant tariff reductions. The Farm Foundation study examines the economic benefits of USMCA compared to NAFTA, considering retaliatory tariffs and a potential U.S. withdrawal. The study's methodology assumes a three to five-year impact period for each trade policy scenario. The study focuses on the long-term impacts of proposed changes under USMCA for U.S. agricultural exports to Canada. It estimates a net increase of $450 million in annual U.S. agricultural exports to Canada under USMCA compared to NAFTA, with increases in dairy and meat exports partially offset by a decline in other agricultural products. The study projects that U.S. agricultural export losses from retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada and Mexico would offset gains from USMCA ratification. If the U.S. withdraws from NAFTA without USMCA, tariffs on exports to Canada and Mexico would increase, leading to a $12 billion decline in agricultural exports to these markets. The potential impact of USMCA on U.S. agricultural exports is a net loss of $9.4 billion, representing a 24% decline compared to FY2018. Various commodity groups anticipate market access gains, with the National Turkey Federation expecting a 29% increase in turkey exports to Canada. A coalition of agricultural stakeholders supports USMCA, citing expanded market access opportunities. Leading agriculture commodity groups endorse the agreement, while the U.S. wheat industry acknowledges challenges but highlights tariff-free access under USMCA. The USMCA retains tariff-free access to imported U.S. wheat for long-time flour milling customers in Mexico. The American Farm Bureau Federation is satisfied with the agreement, while other farm sector stakeholders express concerns about fair trade benefits for family farmers. Critics question the incremental benefits of USMCA over NAFTA for U.S. agriculture, noting limited quota increases as the main market access gain. The USMCA provides limited quota increases for market access. Farm production costs may rise due to domestic content provisions and new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. President Trump hailed the agreement as the most modern and balanced trade deal in U.S. history. Secretary Perdue praised the deal for improving access to Mexican and Canadian markets and eliminating Canada's unfair milk pricing schemes. The USMCA eliminates Canada's unfair milk pricing schemes, opens more access for U.S. dairy, and addresses supply management. It also benefits U.S. poultry and egg producers and addresses discriminatory wheat grading. The agreement needs approval from Congress and ratification from Mexico and Canada. President Trump notified Congress of his intent to sign the agreement, and changes to U.S. laws were submitted to comply with the USMCA. The USMCA agreement needs approval from Congress, but uncertainties remain due to unresolved tariff disputes. Senator Chuck Grassley called for lifting tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico before implementing the USMCA. Before implementing the USMCA agreement, Congress is considering legislation to address tariff issues. Speaker Pelosi is pushing for stronger enforcement language in the agreement, particularly regarding labor and environmental provisions. Delays in congressional action could impact Canada's approval of the USMCA due to upcoming elections in October 2019."
