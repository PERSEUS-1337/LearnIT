    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act of 2006\" provides appropriate remedies for immigration litigation. The \"Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act of 2006\" limits class actions in civil cases related to immigration laws and sets requirements for prospective relief against the Government. Relief must be minimal and least intrusive. The court order granting prospective relief must be the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation and minimize adverse impacts on national security, border security, immigration administration, and public safety. It should also include a specific expiration date allowing for the minimum practical time needed to remedy the violation, with a written explanation of how the relief meets these requirements. The court order for preliminary injunctive relief expires 90 days after entry unless all legal requirements are met and the order is made final. The court must promptly rule on any government motion affecting prospective relief. The government can request to terminate an order for prospective relief in an immigration-related civil action. Such a motion automatically stays the relief order for 15 days after filing until the court makes a final decision on the motion. The court can enter a final order ruling on a motion before the first day of the stay period. Motions pending for up to 45 days before the enactment of the Act will be treated as if filed on the enactment date. The enactment of the Act allows for an automatic stay of motions pending for more than 45 days, starting 10 days after enactment and ending when the court enters a final order. The court may postpone the effective date of an automatic stay for good cause, but not for more than 15 days. When a higher court remands a decision to a lower court, the order granting relief is automatically stayed until the lower court decides on the motion. Orders blocking automatic stays may not be postponed and are immediately appealable. Requirements for denying a motion apply similarly to granting relief. Rules for prospective relief affecting expedited removal are outlined. Rules for prospective relief affecting expedited removal state that no court has jurisdiction to grant or continue an order interfering with section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Upon the Government's motion, the court determines continuing jurisdiction in civil actions. In civil actions involving prospective relief, the court must determine jurisdiction and vacate any order not within its jurisdiction. Orders granting relief to remedy constitutional rights violations before the enactment of the Act are exempt. Consent decrees in immigration law enforcement civil actions are also addressed. In civil actions involving immigration law enforcement, courts must comply with specific requirements when entering consent decrees. Private settlement agreements are allowed if they do not meet these requirements. Courts are required to expedite the disposition of civil cases. In civil actions involving immigration law enforcement, courts must comply with specific requirements when entering consent decrees. Consent decrees are relief entered by a court based on the parties' consent or acquiescence, excluding private settlements. Good cause excludes reasons related to discovery or court calendar congestion. Government refers to the US, federal departments, agencies, agents, or officials acting within official duties. Permanent relief is issued in connection with a final court decision. Private settlement agreement refers to an agreement among parties not subject to judicial enforcement, except for reinstating civil proceedings. Prospective relief includes temporary, preliminary, or permanent relief excluding compensatory monetary damages. The Act includes a severability clause stating that if any provision is found unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. The effective date applies to all court orders granting prospective relief."
