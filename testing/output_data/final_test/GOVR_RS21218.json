    "content": "The Army has been working on enhancing its self-propelled 155mm artillery capabilities since the late 1970s. Efforts have focused on the XM2001 Crusader program, which is now controversial due to the Army's transformation to a lighter, more mobile force. The program is still in research and development, with a prototype howitzer delivered. The Crusader program has moved into the \"system development and demonstration\" phase, with a prototype howitzer demonstrating firing capabilities. Approximately $2 billion has been spent on the program through FY2002, with a total estimated cost of at least $11 billion. There has been controversy over the program's fit with the Army's transformation goals, with some suggesting its termination to free up funds for more advanced systems. Supporters argue that a redesigned, lighter Crusader could still be valuable for both expeditionary and traditional heavy units. The controversy over the Crusader program intensified when Secretary Rumsfeld recommended terminating it without reviewing alternatives, leading to opposition within the Department of the Army. Supporters of the Crusader program gained House Committee on Armed Services' support, directing no changes until completion of Milestone B Analysis of Alternatives by March 1, 2003. Major subcontractors for the Crusader are located in California, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Virginia. The House Appropriations Committee reluctantly agreed to terminate the Crusader artillery program but added $173 million to incorporate Crusader technologies into a Future Combat System artillery successor by 2008. The Senate Armed Services Committee sought similar provisions in their FY2003 DOD authorization legislation. The SASC invited the Secretary of Defense and the Chief of Staff, U.S. Army to testify about the Crusader program. Congress is actively involved in deciding its fate, weighing factors like DOD and Army arguments, industrial base implications, affordability, and security interests. Congress has forced reversals in the past. Advocates for canceling the Crusader program argue that it was designed for a different strategic context and that investing in transformational systems is more important. They suggest alternatives that align with the Army's transformation to a more mobile force. The Army was banned from spending more money on the Crusader program, with a review ordered to determine which technologies to carry forward into the Future Combat System. Funds allocated for the Crusader could be redirected to new long-range fire support technology programs. The weight and timing of the Crusader are considered key disadvantages compared to other systems. The Crusader, weighing about 40 tons, is designed to fight alongside the 70-ton Abrams tank and is set to be deployed in 2008. Secretary Rumsfeld emphasized that it was not meant for precision fires, favoring transformational investments in that area. The cancellation of the Crusader aligns with President Bush's vision of skipping a generation in weapons deployments. The President's senior advisors would recommend vetoing any bill with restrictions on canceling the program. Artillerymen believe the howitzer will remain important on the battlefield. The Excaliber round requires a 155 mm howitzer to fire, with Crusader supporters touting its advantages in battlefield networking. Crusader supporters highlight its successful live-firing tests, on-schedule progress, and improved deployability. The Crusader's increased rate of fire and improved deployability make it equivalent to deploying 6 M-109A5/6 Paladins. The Army believes Crusaders will remain in service until at least 2032, providing excellent fire support to the Interim Force. Substituting advanced rocket systems would require heavier payloads compared to the Crusader's capabilities. The Crusader is seen as providing invaluable fire support to the Army's Interim Force and Legacy Force of Abrams tanks, especially in major combat scenarios against enemies with Soviet-style artillery. General Shenseki highlighted the Crusader's ability to deliver massed suppressive fires cost-effectively, which precision weapons lack. Supporters argue that the program should not be terminated until alternatives for long-range fire support are thoroughly reviewed, as most proposed alternatives lack armored protection for crews and are still in the research and development stage. The Army's commitment to transformation is evident in the cancellation of many programs to fund the Future Combat Systems (FCS). The Crusader program received strong support from Army leadership, indicating its importance to current war-fighting doctrine. The FCS technology for long-range fire support is still in R&D, raising doubts about its timely fulfillment of requirements. The Department of Defense conducted an investigation resulting in the resignation of a mid-level appointee. Congressional hearings were held with key officials discussing defense technology integration. The text chunk provides various sources discussing the Army's budget allocation and challenges with weapon systems development, including the Crusader program. The sources mention Senate rejection of the Crusader amendment, bans on Crusader development spending, and potential veto threats over the defense bill related to the Crusader program. Additionally, the Army is exploring options beyond howitzers in its weapon systems planning. The text chunk discusses the Army's budget allocation and challenges with weapon systems development, including the cancellation of 18 programs. Examples of canceled programs include Armored Combat Earthmover, Follow-on TOW ATGM, M113 A3, Wolverine Assault Bridge, and the Armored Security Vehicle."
