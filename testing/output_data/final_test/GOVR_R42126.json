Experts are watching to see if Kim will be named to other key positions like Chairman of the National Defense Commission. In the aftermath of Kim Jong-il's death, North Korea criticized South Korea for its response, leading to strained inter-Korean relations. South Korea offered sympathy but did not send official condolences, leading to North Korea declaring a lack of expectations for future relations with South Korea. North Korea has taken a confrontational stance towards the United States, emphasizing the demand for U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea and criticizing the U.S. for politicizing food aid negotiations. Regional diplomacy is evident with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia visiting Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Kurt Campbell visited Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo from January 3-7, emphasizing the U.S. position on North Korea's actions. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's visit to Beijing resulted in a joint commitment to peace on the Korean peninsula and support for the Six-Party Talks. Both the U.S. and South Korea have expressed a desire for stability in North Korea following Kim Jong-il's death. Both governments have expressed a desire for stability in North Korea following Kim Jong-il's death. The potential threats of instability in North Korea include concerns over nuclear materials, military aggression, and the possibility of a power vacuum drawing in military forces from the US, South Korea, and China. Analysts expect the ruling elite to maintain unity around Kim Jong-un in the short term. The North Korean regime is expected to maintain unity until April 2012 for the 100th anniversary of Kim Il-Sung's birth. Tensions may rise among power centers after Kim Jong-il's death. Kim Jong-un, in his late 20s, has weak ties to the Korean People's Army. Kim Jong-un's authority over the Korean People's Army is crucial, with speculation that his domestic weakness could prompt North Korea to launch a small-scale military provocation in 2012. The country faces complex challenges, including chronic food shortages and increased exposure to the outside world. More North Koreans are exposed to the outside world, with some owning cell phones and accessing foreign media. The police state is corruptible, and access to foreign exchange is a new path to power. Kim Jong-un, the \"Great Successor,\" lacks experience managing various interests among the elite. Despite challenges, forces are likely to hold the regime together in the short run. Kim Jong-un's chances of consolidating power are greater now than in 2008 due to preparations made for his succession, including eliminating opponents and securing key appointments. His aunt and uncle, Kim Kyong-hui and Jang Song Taek, are key supporters, with Jang expected to act as a regent. Kim Jong-il had begun to decentralize power before his death. Before his death, Kim Jong-il had started to decentralize power in North Korea, possibly leading to a collective leadership centered around Kim Jong-un or the Workers' Party of Korea. The upcoming memorial service for Kim Jong-il will provide insight into elite politics in the country. The North Korean state's powers remain significant, as shown by the smooth transition after Kim Jong-il's passing. The North Korean state's power was evident in the smooth handling of Kim Jong-il's death, with a delayed announcement and secretive operations. The regime's ability to maintain control during the transition indicates the strength of the state apparatus inherited by the new leadership. The regime may continue Kim Jong-il's softer approach, including food aid and nuclear agreements with the United States. The elite in North Korea have a strong interest in maintaining the status quo to protect their wealth and privilege. Kim Jong-un's reign depends on his regime's ability to provide money and gifts to the elite families, with China being a key player in providing outside funds. Since 2008, China has become North Korea's main economic partner. China has become North Korea's main economic partner, accounting for most of its trade and foreign direct investment. Beijing has increased diplomatic support for North Korea, especially after Kim Jong-il's death. The United States aims to limit North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and improve the lives of its people. Kim Jong-il's death has implications for North Korea policy, with differing views on engagement or a harder-line approach. The United States and South Korea have options to engage the new North Korean leadership to deter attacks and improve relations. The year 2011 saw a North Korean \"charm offensive\" when they refrained from provocative actions. In 2011, North Korea engaged in a \"charm offensive\" seeking food donations and economic projects with China and Russia. The country's new leadership is expected to continue this path to slow nuclear weapon and missile development, with the possibility of successful international negotiations empowering moderate forces within North Korea. Some analysts see Kim Jong-un as a symbol of generational change in North Korea, with a younger, more cosmopolitan group potentially influencing economic reforms and reducing weapons programs. However, most doubt the likelihood of this optimistic scenario, as North Korea is unlikely to completely dismantle its nuclear weapons and missile capabilities. Maintaining a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program is crucial for North Korea's survival and poses a threat. Some suggest promoting regime change as the best way to neutralize this threat, with options including psychological operations and unconventional attacks. However, these options carry a high risk of triggering warfare. The high risk of triggering warfare makes aggressive options unpalatable. Calls for halting initiatives benefiting North Korea, increasing interdiction efforts, and applying economic, diplomatic, and military pressure are common. Targeting North Korean entities obtaining hard currency is a key pressure point. China's potential influence is a weakness of this approach. China's potential influence is a weakness of the aggressive pressure approach on North Korea. A dramatic shift in Beijing's policy may be unlikely due to concerns over U.S. intentions with North Korea. \"Subversive engagement\" is seen as a less antagonistic pressure option involving the United States and South Korea. The United States and South Korea are considering \"subversive engagement\" tactics to delegitimize the Kim regime in North Korea. This approach involves increasing exposure to the outside world through joint economic ventures, radio broadcasts, digital media, and exchange programs. While these options can be combined with other strategies, they may take years to show results and could inadvertently support the regime. The Obama Administration and South Korea have been using a mix of engagement and pressure, known as \"strategic patience,\" since 2009. The approach of \"strategic patience\" utilized by the Obama Administration and South Korea since 2009 focuses on keeping the door open to Six-Party Talks over North Korea's nuclear program, insisting on North-South Korean talks on denuclearization, attempting to alter China's strategic assessment of North Korea, and responding to Pyongyang's provocations with sanctions and military exercises. It is a policy of containing North Korea's proliferation activities rather than rolling back its nuclear program. The Obama and Lee governments' diplomacy with North Korea in late 2011 aims to be more proactive in engagement, motivated by reducing North Korea's incentives for provocative behavior. North Korea's softened negotiating position allows for this shift, as they continue to develop their uranium enrichment program and solidify support from China. The Obama Administration is monitoring North Korea's softened negotiating position following Kim Jong-il's death. There is a possibility of resuming bilateral talks and testing the new leadership's intentions through proposed agreements. North Korea had agreed to a freeze on its uranium enrichment plant and international monitoring at the Yongbyon nuclear site. North Korea agreed to a nuclear and missile testing moratorium in exchange for possible large-scale food aid from the Obama Administration. The amount discussed was 240,000 metric tonnes over two years, with increased monitoring by international aid officials. Discussions on aid monitoring occurred shortly after Kim Jong-il's death, indicating potential ongoing cooperation between the two countries. The House passed a measure in 2011 to prohibit using U.S. food aid program for North Korea. Kim Jong-il's death emphasized the need for discussing North Korean contingencies among major powers. South Korea started planning for contingencies after the conservative Lee government took office in 2008. Trilateral discussions with Japanese officials have also occurred, while China has resisted U.S. and South Korean attempts. China has resisted discussing North Korea contingency plans with the US and South Korea, even for issues like natural disasters or nuclear accidents. It is uncertain if Kim Jong-il's death will change this. Commentators urge the US and South Korea to increase efforts to engage China in dialogue. Possible opportunities for high-level talks include a meeting between Japanese PM Noda and Chinese leaders in December, Chinese VP Xi Jinping's visit to Washington in January 2012, and his expected rise to China's top leadership. In January, South Korean President Lee will travel to China to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, a trip arranged after Kim Jong-il's death. Xi is expected to be chosen as China's top leader in the coming year. Several reports on North Korea and U.S. relations are available for reference. The passing of National Defense Commission Chairman Kim Jong Il in December 2011 led to various reports on North Korea and U.S. relations, including CRS reports on topics such as North Korea's economic leverage, human rights, ballistic missile threat, China-North Korea relations, and NGO activities in North Korea.
