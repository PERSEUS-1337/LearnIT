    "title": "SB 563",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4610 of the Labor Code is amended to require employers to establish a utilization review process for medical treatment services based on medical necessity. This process can be done directly by the employer, through its insurer, or a contracted entity. Each utilization review process must have written policies and procedures ensuring decisions align with the schedule for medical treatment utilization. These must be filed with the administrative director and disclosed to employees, physicians, and the public upon request. If an employer, insurer, or entity requests medical information from a physician for authorization decisions, they must only ask for necessary information. A medical director with a valid license must oversee the review process to ensure compliance with regulations. This does not limit the authority of the Medical Board of California. No person other than a licensed physician can modify, delay, or deny medical treatment requests for reasons of medical necessity. Employers or utilization review entities cannot offer financial incentives to physicians based on the number of modifications, delays, or denials. Insurers or third-party administrators cannot refer utilization review services to entities they have a financial interest in, unless they disclose the entity and their financial interest to the employer in writing. The administrative director has the authority to review compensation agreements, payment schedules, or contracts between employers and utilization review physicians. Information disclosed to the director is confidential and not subject to public disclosure unless already in the public domain. Disclosure does not waive privilege under the Evidence Code. The criteria for utilization review process in approving, modifying, delaying, or denying medical treatment services must be developed with input from practicing physicians, consistent with the schedule for medical treatment utilization, evaluated annually, and disclosed to the physician and employee if used for a decision. An employer must disclose criteria or guidelines for medical treatment services upon request, with reasonable copying and postage charges allowed. Criteria can be accessed electronically, and no charge is required for an employee's physician's review. Approval, modification, delay, or denial of medical treatment requests by physicians must meet specific requirements. Prospective or concurrent decisions must be made promptly, not exceeding 5 working days from receiving necessary information, or 14 days from the physician's treatment recommendation. Retrospective reviews resulting in denial of medical services must be communicated within 30 days. If payment is made on time, approval for services need not be communicated. Decisions regarding employee medical treatment requests must be made promptly, not exceeding 72 hours after receiving necessary information, when there is a serious threat to health or potential loss of life. Decisions on medical treatment requests by physicians for employees must be communicated within 24 hours, with modifications, delays, or denials conveyed initially by phone or fax and in writing within 24 hours for concurrent review or within two business days for prospective review. Disputes are to be resolved as per Section 4610.5 or Section 4062 if the request is not fully approved. In concurrent review, medical care must continue until the physician agrees on a care plan suitable for the employee's needs. Insurers are only responsible for services deemed medically necessary. Disputes over medical necessity are resolved according to specific sections. Insurers must report non-medically necessary services to the licensing board of the provider for evaluation of possible violations. No fees are charged for required reports. Communications regarding decisions on medical treatment requests by physicians must specify approved services. Responses for modifications, delays, or denials should include clear reasons, criteria used, and clinical justifications. If a denial or delay is due to incomplete information, the decision must specify the reason and information needed. If the employer, insurer, or other entity cannot make a decision within specified timeframes due to lack of necessary information, consultation by an expert reviewer, or additional tests, they must notify the physician and employee in writing. The notification should specify the missing information, expert reviewer, or tests required, and provide an anticipated decision date. Upon receiving all necessary information, the employer will make a decision. Upon receipt of all necessary information, the employer must approve, modify, or deny the request within specified timeframes. Utilization review decisions to modify, delay, or deny treatment recommendations are effective for 12 months without further action by the employer unless there is a documented change in material facts. Utilization review is not required while the employer disputes liability for injury or treatment. If utilization review is deferred and the employer is found liable for treatment, retrospective utilization review starts when liability is determined, and prospective utilization review begins upon receipt of treatment recommendation. Employers must provide telephone access for physicians to request authorization for health care services. The administrative director may assess penalties for failures to meet timeframes or requirements. Penalties are not the exclusive remedy and are deposited in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Administration Revolving Fund. The Legislature imposes limitations on public access to protect privacy and integrity of information submitted to the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation."
