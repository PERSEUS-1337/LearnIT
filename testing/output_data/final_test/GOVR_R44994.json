    "content": "In 2017, North Korea tested intercontinental ballistic missiles, raising concerns about its ability to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear weapon. The regime may be close to mastering reentry vehicle technology, potentially posing a direct security threat to the U.S. homeland. North Korea's potential ability to threaten the U.S. with a nuclear weapon by 2018 has escalated tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. is considering diplomatic solutions and economic pressure to address the situation, while Congress may play a larger role in shaping policy towards North Korea. The Trump Administration has utilized economic pressure and diplomacy, including unilateral and multinational economic sanctions, to address the threat posed by North Korea. They have emphasized that all options, including military force, are on the table. The goal of their increased pressure campaign is denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Key questions for Congress include how to best employ the military to achieve denuclearization. Key questions for Congress regarding the use of military force to achieve denuclearization of North Korea include the risk of conflict escalation and substantial casualties. Analysts debate whether the risk of allowing North Korea to acquire nuclear weapons outweighs the potential dangers of military intervention. The concern of North Korea targeting the U.S. homeland is heightened due to their history of threats and aggressive actions. Some analysts suggest preemptive military action if there is an imminent launch of a nuclear-armed ICBM. However, few believe North Korea would launch an unprovoked attack. The U.S. and South Korea are seen to have an advantage in any conflict with North Korea. The conflict with North Korea could escalate quickly, with potential involvement from China or Russia making it more complicated and costly. The toll of such a conflict could be immense, with Seoul at risk from North Korean artillery and potential use of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. military casualties could also be significant, leading to considerations of increased military activities to denuclearize North Korea. The U.S. faces a decision on whether to support military actions to denuclearize North Korea or use other means to contain aggression. Key questions include the potential for regime change in North Korea and the implications for U.S. relationships in the region. The cost implications in terms of financial resources for the U.S. and its allies are also a concern. The U.S. faces a decision on whether to support military actions to denuclearize North Korea or use other means to contain aggression. Key questions include the potential for regime change in North Korea and the implications for U.S. relationships in the region. Cost implications in terms of financial resources for the U.S. and its allies are also a concern, along with the risks associated with military action against North Korea and the behavior of a nuclear-armed Kim regime. During the Korean War, the United States intervened on the Korean Peninsula, leading to a conflict where China also deployed its armed forces to assist North Korea. The war resulted in significant casualties, with over 33,000 U.S. troops killed and more than 400,000 Chinese troops lost. The fighting eventually led to a stalemate at the 38th parallel, with South Korea suffering heavy casualties as well. The war ended in 1953 with an armistice agreement. The United States and its allies have contained military threats from North Korea in Northeast Asia since the signing of an armistice agreement in 1953. The U.S. security commitment to South Korea has helped it become a major industrialized country and a flourishing democracy. South Korea is now a key economic and diplomatic partner for the United States globally. Key components of U.S. policy include the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty and the presence of 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea. The United States has 28,500 troops in South Korea to support its security approach in Northeast Asia. Efforts to compel North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and ICBM programs have been unsuccessful despite various tools such as diplomacy, sanctions, and strengthening alliances. China, with significant trade leverage over North Korea, plays a crucial role in pressuring Pyongyang to change its behavior. The Trump Administration, like its predecessor, focuses on expanding sanctions on North Korea and third-party entities dealing with North Korea. The U.S. led efforts at the U.N. Security Council to pass eight sanctions resolutions, including Resolution 2375 in September 2017. Congress also enacted the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 and the Korean Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act to strengthen actions against North Korea. The United States has imposed unilateral measures against North Korean entities and entities in third countries to implement sanctions required by the Security Council. Economic sanctions have been imposed on entities in China and Russia for activities that allegedly support North Korea's WMD programs. Additionally, efforts have been made to strengthen the military capabilities of South Korea and Japan. The Agreed Framework and Six-Party Talks aimed to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program. North Korea committed to denuclearization in exchange for economic and diplomatic gains during negotiations. However, North Korea withdrew from the talks in 2009 and has not returned to its denuclearization pledges since then. The United States focuses on increasing economic pressure to implement U.N. Security Council resolutions fully. Analysts believe North Korea's priority is regime survival, making an unprovoked attack on the U.S. unlikely. North Korea's strategic objective is developing a credible nuclear deterrent, including a long-range nuclear-armed missile. Kim Jong Un is focused on developing a long-range nuclear missile to threaten the U.S. mainland for regime survival and as a deterrent against outside threats. North Korea emphasizes its nuclear weapons as a deterrent against attacks from the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea views its nuclear weapons as essential for deterring attacks from the United States, emphasizing the need to maintain them for self-defense. Analysts are concerned about the possibility of North Korea launching a preemptive attack, highlighting the importance of cautious U.S. rhetoric. North Korea perceives a U.S. attack as imminent and emphasizes the importance of careful U.S. rhetoric to avoid miscalculation. The Director of National Intelligence stated that Pyongyang's nuclear capabilities are for deterrence, international prestige, and coercive diplomacy. Pyongyang may also view acquiring a nuclear-tipped ICBM capability as a way to increase its freedom of action. North Korea sees acquiring a nuclear-tipped ICBM capability as a means to increase its freedom of action and potentially reunify the Korean Peninsula. This process involves weakening the U.S. commitment to defend South Korea, persuading the U.S. to remove sanctions and troops from the Korean Peninsula, and seeking recognition as a nuclear weapons state for legitimacy. Sanctions, diplomacy, interdiction, and military capacity-building efforts have slowed but not stopped North Korea's nuclear ambitions. The Trump Administration has made North Korea's nuclear and missile programs a top U.S. foreign policy priority, adopting a \"maximum pressure\" approach to pressure Pyongyang into denuclearization. Despite sanctions slowing North Korea's WMD programs, progress in missile programs has accelerated. In August 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis outlined the U.S. policy objective for the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. aims for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula without regime change or accelerated reunification. Military options are considered alongside diplomacy and pressure to address the North Korean nuclear threat. The Administration's actions are driven by the assessment that North Korea may soon have the capability to reach the continental United States with a nuclear-tipped ICBM. This assessment increases the urgency for diplomatic efforts with North Korea, especially if a U.S. military strike is seen as more likely. Concerns also exist about threats to allies and U.S. Armed Forces in the region. Concerns persist that if denuclearization is not achieved, North Korea may continue to proliferate its missile and nuclear technology for financial profit by selling materials to state and nonstate actors, exchanging data with other states like Iran and Syria, or as part of a general provocative trend. Testimonies from DNI Dan Coats and former DNI Dennis Blair highlight North Korea's willingness to proliferate dangerous technologies for hard currency. Some argue that military force is not the solution to the DPRK standoff, as it could strengthen the Kim regime. Instead, they suggest focusing on influence operations to shape perceptions and potentially lead to the collapse of the regime for denuclearization. Others believe these operations may not have a significant impact on North Korean society. Some argue that influence operations may not significantly impact North Korean society, making regime degradation or collapse unlikely. Denuclearization is a long-term goal for the US, but achieving it in the short term is challenging due to the risk of military escalation. Military pressure, sanctions, deterrence, and containment are seen as more appropriate tactics than a preventive strike. Understanding the military capabilities in the current standoff is crucial for evaluating options to resolve the crisis. Understanding military capabilities on the Korean Peninsula is crucial for resolving the crisis. The DPRK prioritizes quantity over quality, focusing on asymmetric capabilities like weapons of mass destruction and cyber operations. In contrast, the ROK emphasizes quality, maintaining a skilled conventional force. The DPRK conducts aggressive cyber operations against the ROK despite limited internet connectivity. The Korean People's Army (KPA) is a large military force with over 1 million soldiers, but it has deficiencies in training and equipment due to food and fuel shortages. North Korea has invested in asymmetric capabilities to compensate for these deficiencies. The DPRK has heavily invested in asymmetric capabilities, including weapons of mass destruction and special operations forces. They possess chemical and biological weapons that could reach South Korea and Japan, with hardened facilities protecting their artillery and WMD capabilities. Additionally, they have missiles capable of reaching Guam and other U.S. bases. Estimates vary on the size of DPRK SOF, with some sources suggesting an end strength of up to 200,000. The DPRK maintains an end strength of up to 200,000 troops, including 140,000 light infantry and 60,000 in the 11th Storm Corps. They have a significant inventory of long-range rockets, artillery, ballistic missiles, and chemical weapons aimed at targets in South Korea. Reports indicate enhanced mobility of missile launchers and artillery batteries, along with hardened key facilities through underground tunnels. The Republic of Korea has improved its military capabilities by enhancing command, control, and communications, incorporating lessons from Operation Iraqi Freedom. Despite having a smaller active duty military compared to North Korea, South Korea relies on U.S. security assurances instead of acquiring nuclear weapons. Some in South Korea advocate for the redeployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons as a deterrent message to the North. The Republic of Korea has signed non-proliferation treaties and relies on U.S. security assurances. U.S. troops in South Korea act as a deterrent against North Korean hostilities. The U.S. provides military support, including intelligence and advanced aircraft rotations. The United States conducts regular rotations of advanced strike aircraft into South Korea for training, under the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty. In the event of military hostilities, the U.S. has plans to deploy units to reinforce South Korea, with the potential for up to 690,000 additional U.S. forces, 160 naval vessels, and 2,000 aircraft to be called upon. Predictions on how hostilities might unfold on the Korean Peninsula are compared to a complex game of three-dimensional chess. The Kim regime could respond to US/ROK military activity with various means, potentially escalating into a full-scale war. Despite deficiencies in its conventional force structure, DPRK could use its artillery against South Korea. The DPRK could employ conventional artillery and highly trained SOF to inflict damage on South Korea and sabotage U.S./ROK targets. There is a possibility of using weapons of mass destruction and escalating into nuclear warfare, leading to radioactive contamination affecting neighboring states. U.S. forces may need to operate in WMD-contaminated zones, resulting in devastation and loss of life on the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, North Korea could launch a cyberattack on the United States, South Korea, or other targets. North Korea's potential nuclear attack on the United States could affect millions of people on the Korean Peninsula, with estimates of up to 500,000 U.S. citizens at risk. In the event of a military conflict, casualties could range from 30,000 to 300,000 in the first days of fighting, with the possibility of even higher casualties if nonconventional weapons are used. In the event of a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula, casualties could range from 30,000 to 300,000 in the first days of fighting, with the potential for significantly higher casualties if nonconventional weapons are used. Estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of South Koreans could die in the initial hours of combat, and if the conflict escalates to a nuclear level, tens of millions could be at risk. If the war escalates to the nuclear level, there could be tens of millions of casualties and the destruction of the eleventh largest economy in the world. Pyongyang might attack Japan with ballistic missiles, targeting densely populated areas like the greater Tokyo area with a population of about 38 million. North Korea could also target U.S. military assets in Japan or South Korea with nuclear weapons to deter military action. Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned of the devastating consequences of a military campaign against the DPRK on the Korean Peninsula, highlighting the potential extraordinary loss of life and the challenges of evacuating American noncombatants. The strain on U.S. military capabilities, overwhelmed medical facilities, and impact on South Korean and global regions are all complicating factors in the prosecution of military operations. The impact of renewed hostilities on the South Korean, regional, and global economies, especially in the event of a full-scale war, would be substantial. A 2010 RAND study estimated that a conventional war could cost 60%-70% of South Korea's annual GDP. If North Korea detonated a nuclear weapon in Seoul, the financial costs could exceed 10% of South Korea's GDP over 10 years. Policymakers are likely considering the implications of military conflict between the DPRK and the U.S./ROK. The question on the Korean Peninsula is whether a military conflict between DPRK and the U.S./ROK could lead to a direct clash with China, as seen in the Korean War. China opposes war on the Peninsula and supports a peaceful, denuclearized solution through dialogue. Any preemptive strikes by the U.S. on North Korea could strain its relationship with China, its top trading partner. China has warned North Korea against launching missiles that threaten U.S. soil. China will stay neutral if North Korea launches missiles threatening U.S. soil first, but will prevent U.S. and South Korea from overthrowing the North Korean regime. The Global Times is used by China's leadership to test policy proposals. China supports the pressure campaign against Pyongyang but prioritizes stability on the Korean Peninsula over denuclearization. The paramount priority of Chinese leaders regarding the Korean Peninsula is to prioritize stability. The outbreak of war could result in a refugee influx into northeastern China. China has been reluctant to engage in discussions with the US and South Korea about military conflict in North Korea, possibly to avoid endorsing military action for denuclearization. Chinese statements could complicate matters for the US, as they may encourage aggressive actions by North Korea just below China's red lines. The use of U.S. military force on the Korean Peninsula could have significant implications for U.S. alliances and partnerships in the region, as well as for the overall security landscape in the Asia-Pacific. A military conflict on the peninsula could potentially impact regional powers and U.S. interests in East Asia, with a key question being the effect on the U.S.-China relationship. The use of U.S. military force on the Korean Peninsula could lead to varying levels of cooperation or hostility from China, potentially affecting the U.S.-China relationship. China may assert its leadership in East Asia, claim maritime territory, and possibly change its relationship with Taiwan, depending on the outcome of the military campaign. Washington and Beijing would need to navigate new dynamics in their bilateral relationship. If the United States were to use military force on the Korean Peninsula, it could impact the U.S.-China relationship. China's involvement in post-conflict reconstruction, through initiatives like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative, would increase its influence in the region. This could lead to negotiations with Beijing over the future of the peninsula, potentially including discussions on the presence of U.S. military forces in the area. If the United States were to use military force on the Korean Peninsula, it could impact U.S. bilateral alliances with South Korea and Japan. The credibility of U.S. commitment to its allies would be reinforced, but controversial issues like consultation before any strike could create fissures. If a military action resulted in mass casualties and was seen as Washington's choice alone, the alliances could be deeply shaken or abandoned. The security partnerships would face challenges in operating in a wartime theater, testing alliance planning and cooperation. The use of U.S. military force on the Korean Peninsula could test alliance planning and cooperation, with challenges such as operational control, logistical complexity, and political questions arising. Questions about U.S. commitment and obligations to allies may also surface post-operation. If the regime in Pyongyang falls, the reunification process between North and South Korea would face significant challenges due to differences in education, culture, and societal organization. The duration and extent of reconstruction efforts could be contentious, and alliances like the U.S.-ROK alliance may question their durability without the threat from North Korea. Factors such as pressure from Beijing could influence Korean leaders' decisions. Russia's future role in the region is uncertain, especially in the event of U.S. intervention. Moscow's security concerns are less immediate due to its distance from the DPRK, but it still has significant military capabilities that could complicate U.S./ROK operations. Some analysts suggest that Russia and China may support North Korea in the event of a regime collapse or aggressive actions by the U.S. and its allies to prevent a shift in the regional balance. Russia and China are motivated to prevent a change in regional balance caused by a reunified Korean peninsula under U.S. influence. Potential military options and their implications, along with associated risks, are outlined in this section. These options are not exhaustive and are based on open-source materials. The list aims to demonstrate how military force can be used to achieve foreign policy or national security goals, highlighting the various risks involved. The validity of these options being considered by U.S. and ROK leaders cannot be confirmed. The military options discussed aim to achieve the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and responding to hostilities by North Korea, assuming no Chinese or Russian intervention. The design of a military campaign depends on policy goals, with no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of Korea. There is no desire to station U.S. troops north of the Demilitarized Zone or inflict harm. The U.S. does not want to station troops north of the Demilitarized Zone or harm North Korean people. The objective is denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, with various approaches including increasing U.S. presence, communicating with Pyongyang and Beijing, and potentially eliminating DPRK's nuclear capabilities. The Trump Administration has not outlined a clear strategy for achieving denuclearization. The Trump Administration's approach to North Korea involves pressuring the regime through sanctions, urging China to apply more pressure, and strengthening alliances with South Korea and Japan. Key differences from the Obama Administration include a higher priority on the North Korean threat and openly discussing the possibility of a preventive military strike. The Trump Administration is openly discussing the possibility of a preventive military strike against North Korea to pressure the regime through sanctions and alliances with South Korea and Japan. Supporters argue it would be the least likely to escalate the crisis on the Korean Peninsula, giving time for international sanctions to take effect. Opponents fear the policy of \"strategic patience\" may not be effective. Opponents argue that the policy of \"strategic patience\" failed to compel North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and ICBM capabilities. They believe that maintaining the status quo could allow North Korea to develop a nuclear-tipped ICBM capable of reaching the U.S. homeland, leading to concerns about Japan and South Korea potentially building their own nuclear deterrent. This could trigger an arms race in Asia, increasing the risk of accidents or miscalculations in the region. The option of enhancing U.S. military presence on the Korean Peninsula and in the region, along with diplomatic and economic measures, could deter and contain North Korea's nuclearization. This approach aims to underscore the costs of DPRK nuclearization through prepositioning equipment, enhancing defensive capabilities, and boosting trilateral cooperation among the United States, South Korea, and Japan. The U.S. military is considering various options to deter and contain North Korea's nuclearization, including deploying additional troops, enhancing missile defenses, cyber defenses, and monitoring shipments to prevent WMD proliferation. Redeploying tactical nuclear weapons onto the Korean Peninsula is also being considered. These actions aim to enhance deterrence of conflict and ensure critical systems are nearby in case of hostilities. The U.S. military is considering options to deter and contain North Korea's nuclearization, including deploying troops, enhancing defenses, and monitoring shipments to prevent WMD proliferation. Skeptics argue that these moves could be seen as a prelude to a ground attack on North Korea and may not impact the Kim regime's decision-making. There are also political and diplomatic challenges to increasing military presence in places like Okinawa. Pursuing this option may mean focusing on mitigating the means of delivery of nuclear devices rather than immediate denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The United States is considering options to deter North Korea's nuclearization by focusing on mitigating the means of delivery of nuclear devices, particularly nuclear-tipped ICBMs. Testing is crucial for determining the reliability and effectiveness of ICBMs. The U.S. could use ballistic missile defense capabilities to intercept medium- and long-range missiles, but not ICBMs. This approach has advantages, such as disrupting North Korea's acquisition of a reliable nuclear ICBM without escalating tensions by sending additional forces into the region. The U.S. is considering using ballistic missile defense capabilities to intercept North Korean missile tests, which could provoke the DPRK. This approach aims to reduce risks to U.S. troops in the region, but skeptics worry about the ships being tied up and potential failures in intercepting missiles. There are concerns about debris from intercepted missiles causing problems in various areas. The U.S. is considering using ballistic missile defense capabilities to intercept North Korean missile tests, which could provoke the DPRK. This approach aims to reduce risks to U.S. troops in the region, but skeptics worry about potential failures in intercepting missiles and debris causing problems in various areas. North Korea could still respond militarily, escalating the conflict, and continue to hold U.S. forces and allies at risk. The focus would be on eliminating DPRK's long-range ballistic missiles and associated facilities through limited air strikes. Reports suggest North Korea is developing solid-fuel mobile missiles for rapid deployment. North Korea is developing solid-fuel mobile missiles for rapid deployment, which are harder to detect and can be deployed more rapidly than liquid-fueled missiles. The country also operates a diesel-electric submarine capable of launching a submarine-launched ballistic missile, making it difficult to detect and target. This poses challenges for U.S. anti-submarine warfare capabilities. The United States could potentially attack DPRK nuclear and ICBM facilities through airstrikes and cruise missile attacks, with the possibility of Special Operations forces conducting ground missions. This high-risk option aims to disrupt critical components of North Korea's ICBM infrastructure and signal that its nuclear program is unacceptable, potentially bringing the regime back to the negotiating table. Critics argue that this approach may escalate the conflict and only degrade, not eliminate, North Korea's ICBM capabilities. A more expansive military effort targeting DPRK nuclear and ICBM facilities, including production infrastructure, nuclear devices, and missile warheads. Possible methods include airstrikes, cruise missiles, and ground attacks by Special Operations forces. Proponents believe this option is most likely to eliminate the DPRK's nuclear program without regime change. Skeptics argue that U.S. strikes may not fully eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons program due to limited intelligence and hardened underground facilities. There is concern that attacking nuclear sites could lead to radioactive contamination. If the program persists, North Korea's conventional military forces could still pose a threat to South Korea and the U.S. Skeptics raise concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. strikes on North Korea's nuclear program due to limited intelligence and hardened underground facilities. The potential risks include radioactive contamination and the continued threat posed by North Korea's conventional military forces to South Korea and the U.S. Regime change remains a possible option if the Kim regime acts aggressively towards the U.S. or its allies. A comprehensive operation targeting key infrastructure, leaders, and military units in North Korea could destabilize the regime but risks full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. Advocates argue that removing the Kim Jong-un regime is crucial for regional and global security, while skeptics warn of high military and political risks, including potential preemptive strikes by North Korea. The possibility of preemptive strikes by North Korea in response to a regime change operation is a concern, as it could lead to a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula. Advocates argue for the importance of removing the Kim Jong-un regime for regional and global security, while skeptics warn of the risks involved, including the need for significant ground force involvement and long-term U.S. troop commitments for post-conflict stabilization operations. The presence of U.S. troops in South Korea and Japan is seen as a risk by North Korea. With the United States far away, Kim Jong-un may be more inclined to listen to China's advice for reforms and negotiate limits on his nuclear activities. Some suggest that withdrawing U.S. troops could be a useful change in strategy. Withdrawing U.S. troops in exchange for DPRK denuclearization could prevent North Korean military action against the United States and allow for internal political reform. However, skeptics argue that North Korea's history of non-compliance with agreements raises doubts about Pyongyang's long-term commitment to denuclearization. This could potentially leave the United States in a worse position relative to a nuclear DPRK. If North Korea does not completely dismantle its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, it could pose a threat to other countries in the region and engage in illicit materials trade. The absence of U.S. presence in South Korea may lead to renewed hostilities by North Korea to unify the Korean Peninsula. This could also make it challenging for the U.S. to reinforce its military presence later on. If the United States is seen as unreliable or absent, South Korea and possibly Japan may consider developing their own nuclear weapons. Congress may need to assess its role in decisions involving U.S. forces in potential hostilities on the Korean Peninsula. The Constitution divides war authority between Congress and the President, with Congress potentially authorizing, limiting, or prohibiting U.S. involvement in conflicts. Key considerations for Congress include whether the President needs prior authorization for military actions in Korea and what circumstances should be covered by such authorization. The Kim regime's aggressive actions could continue. The international legal ramifications of a preventive or preemptive strike on North Korea without a U.N. Security Council mandate are questioned. The implications of the executive branch initiating hostilities against a nuclear-armed North Korea without congressional authorization are also considered in relation to the preservation of Congress's war powers role. The potential implications of the executive branch initiating hostilities against North Korea without congressional authorization are discussed, including the broader question of Congress's status as an equal branch of government. The international legal ramifications of a preventive or preemptive strike without a U.N. Security Council mandate are also considered. Without detailed articulation of military use for U.S. objectives on the Korean Peninsula, assessing fiscal costs is challenging. Any action besides full withdrawal would likely result in significant additional costs. Factors affecting expenditure include the number of forces and equipment deployed, especially from the continental U.S., which would increase logistical costs. The logistical requirements of moving troops and materiel across the Pacific impact the mission set and intensity of U.S. forces. Options for increasing U.S. posture on the Korean Peninsula may require facility upgrades or new construction. Combat operations would lead to significant requests for supplemental funding, especially for WMD eradication or post-conflict stabilization. The time needed to achieve U.S. objectives is crucial for cost analysis, as seen in past operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The aftermath of a full-scale war on the Korean Peninsula could require significant U.S. resources for stabilization and reconstruction operations. Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 3000.0 emphasizes the U.S. military's role in maintaining a safe environment and providing humanitarian relief. U.S. forces have supported governments during past humanitarian crises like the 2005 Pakistan earthquake and the 2004 Asian tsunami. In the wake of past humanitarian crises, such as the 2005 Pakistan earthquake and the 2004 Asian tsunami, the United States military might have to respond to various issues in both North and South Korea. In North Korea, up to 25 million people could be affected by a conflict, leading to shortages of food and essential supplies. Additionally, prisoners in prison camps may need immediate attention. In South Korea, assistance may be needed for recovering and reconstructing key infrastructure, providing emergency supplies, and potentially disarming North Korea's military. In the event of a conflict in North Korea, the ROK may need to counter sabotage and insurgency by North Korean SOF. U.S. forces could assist in postconflict reconstruction in Japan, Guam, and other U.S. allies. Decontaminating areas affected by weapons of mass destruction would require significant manpower and medical support. Cleanup operations might extend to other countries due to WMD contamination in the atmosphere. U.S. personnel could also be involved in locating and eliminating DPRK WMD. In a conflict in North Korea, significant manpower may be needed to locate and eliminate DPRK WMD stockpiles. Other states like Japan or China could contribute resources for war efforts and stabilizing the Korean Peninsula. Beijing's role in post-conflict stabilization and eradicating DPRK weapons of mass destruction programs is crucial. Troop deployments north of the DMZ may be necessary for these activities. China may consider deploying forces across its border to stabilize North Korea in a conflict, or assisting U.S. military operations. Congress would need to consider the potential costs of increased military activity on the Korean Peninsula if the President requests additional funding. The United States needs to reconstitute its forces and capabilities after a catastrophic conflict, impacting U.S. deficits and government spending. The costs of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula to the global economy and the potential strain on U.S. forces due to ongoing military commitments elsewhere. Regional allies and the international community may need to contribute forces or resources in the event of a full-scale war between the DPRK and the U.S./ROK. The United States may need to shift forces from the Korean theater to other contingencies like Iraq, Syria, or Eastern Europe. Key inventories, such as missile defenses, might need to be regenerated. Congress might need to prioritize U.S. operations in the event of a conflict and consider difficult tradeoffs in global force management. Noncombatant evacuation operations for U.S. citizens and logistic operations to flow additional forces into theater may need to be conducted simultaneously on the Korean Peninsula. The text discusses the impact of the Budget Control Act on U.S. military readiness for combat operations on the Korean Peninsula. It raises questions about force requirements, force structure decisions, and the need for adjustments in force planning. Despite analysts believing North Korea would not launch an unprovoked attack on U.S. territory, Congress may face significant questions as the crisis evolves. The evolving situation on the Korean peninsula raises significant questions for Congress regarding U.S. policy in the region. Congress must determine if the U.S. can manage a nuclear-armed North Korea and if decisive action is necessary to prevent this capability. These decisions carry risks for the U.S., its allies, and global stability. The broader strategic implications of dealing with North Korea's nuclear weapons and ICBM programs also pose challenges for Congress in considering their impact on U.S. interests regionally and globally. The evolving situation on the Korean peninsula raises significant questions for Congress regarding U.S. policy in the region, including the impact on U.S. interests regionally and globally. Congress must consider the implications of dealing with North Korea's nuclear weapons and ICBM programs, as well as the effects on alliances and the global order. The DPRK military strategy emphasizes quantity and asymmetric capabilities like weapons of mass destruction. In contrast, South Korea focuses on quality and maintains a highly skilled conventional force. The Korean People's Army is the fourth-largest military in the world with over 1 million soldiers. Other regional allies like China, Russia, Japan, and Australia could also play a role in a conflict on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean People's Army (KPA) is the fourth-largest military in the world with 1 million soldiers. Despite its size, the KPA faces deficiencies in training and equipment due to shortages and economic hardship. The KPA has invested in asymmetric capabilities and possesses a significant inventory of long-range rockets, artillery, ballistic missiles, and chemical weapons aimed at targets in South Korea and U.S. military facilities. Reports indicate that the KPA has mobile missile launchers. The DPRK has mobile missile launchers and hardened key facilities with underground tunnels. North Korea's military consists of 4-5% on active duty and 25-30% in reserve. The KPA poses a continuous threat with legacy equipment near the DMZ. The KPA, based on outdated designs from the Soviet Union and China, lacks modern military capabilities. It has not acquired new fighter aircraft, relies on older air defense systems, and lacks ballistic missile defense. Analysts question the realism of its training scenarios, as the KPA has not been combat tested in over six decades. Some doubt its ability to translate quantitative supremacy into military advantage. The North Korean military consists of predominantly regular and light-infantry units, supported by armor, mechanized units, and heavy concentrations of artillery. They are fortified in underground facilities with long-range artillery capable of reaching Seoul. The ground forces have tanks, armored personnel carriers, and a large artillery force with long-range guns and rocket launchers. The North Korean Air Force primarily defends their airspace with a fleet of legacy Soviet aircraft. The North Korean Air Force (NKAF) is responsible for defending North Korean airspace and has missions including SOF insertion, transportation, logistics support, reconnaissance, and tactical air support for KPA ground forces. The NKAF's air defense relies heavily on surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) due to the technological inferiority of most of its aircraft fleet. The most capable combat aircraft in the NKAF are the MiG-29 FULCRUMs, MiG-23 FLOGGERs, and SU-25 ground-attack FROGFOOT aircraft. The majority of its aircraft are less capable models like MiG-15s, MiG-17s, MiG-19s (F-6s), and MiG-21s. Additionally, the NKAF operates a large fleet of An-2 COLT aircraft for inserting SOF into the ROK, along with several hundred helicopters for troop transport. The North Korean Air Force (NKAF) relies on aging aircraft and ground-based air defenses to counter air attacks. They have acquired drones for reconnaissance and potential chemical/biological payloads. The North Korean Navy (NKN) is the smallest service branch, consisting mainly of aging patrol craft. The North Korean Navy (NKN) is composed of aging patrol craft, submarines, air-cushioned hovercraft, and landing craft. They have one of the world's largest submarine forces with around 70 submarines. North Korea has tested six nuclear devices and declared itself a nuclear-armed state, making considerable strides in acquiring strategic nuclear capabilities. Since the breakdown of the Six-Party nuclear talks in 2009, North Korea has resumed plutonium production and built a uranium enrichment plant. Experts suggest they may have enough material for 13-21 nuclear weapons and could produce seven more warheads annually. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency believes North Korea may possess up to 60 nuclear warheads and has threatened to use them in an electromagnetic pulse attack. North Korea has been developing ballistic missile technology over the past 20 years, with successful satellite launches in 2012 and 2016. They have also tested medium-range missiles and a submarine-launched ballistic missile in 2016, posing a threat to U.S. bases and population centers in Japan and South Korea. In July 2017, North Korea test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential intercontinental range, reaching a capability milestone earlier than predicted. The missiles could potentially reach Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, or even the continental United States. North Korea is believed to be working towards deploying an operational nuclear ICBM capability. North Korea is investing in its special operations forces for potential unconventional warfare capabilities against U.S./ROK targets in the event of hostilities on the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang has a history of cooperation with Russia and China in ballistic missile development, with some components acquired illicitly. North Korean special operations forces (SOF) are highly trained and well-equipped, with an estimated end strength of up to 200,000. The 11th Storm Corps focuses on special and unconventional warfare, while SOF units are dispersed across North Korea for offensive operations and defense against foreign attacks. Pyongyang sees SOF capabilities as crucial for asymmetric coercion amid declining conventional capabilities relative to South Korea and the United States. North Korean special operations forces (SOF) are highly trained and well-equipped, with an estimated end strength of up to 200,000. They operate in specialized units emphasizing speed and surprise attacks against vulnerable targets in South Korea. Some analysts consider North Korea's cyber threat to be exceeded only by China, Russia, and Iran, engaging in hostile cyber activities like theft and website vandalism. North Korea's cyber capabilities include theft, website vandalism, and denial of service attacks. There is debate over whether they have the capability for more destructive cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Some reports suggest a sophisticated offensive cyber capability, while others believe they lack the necessary infrastructure and technical skill. General Curtis M. Scaparrotti noted in 2014 that North Korea employs hackers for intelligence collection, cyber-espionage, and disruptive cyber-attacks. North Korea's cyber capabilities include theft, website vandalism, and denial of service attacks. General Curtis M. Scaparrotti noted in 2014 that North Korea employs hackers for intelligence collection, cyber-espionage, and disruptive cyber-attacks. Several attacks on South Korea's banking institutions have been attributed to North Korea, and it is likely to continue emphasizing cyber warfare due to its deniability and low costs. The Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded in a 2015 report that North Korea will place strategic value in its cyber capabilities, with future cyberattacks ranging from low to high intensity. The DPRK is expected to integrate its cyber elements into its conventional military forces. In November 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment was hit by a cyberattack that disabled its systems, destroyed data, and leaked internal emails. Hackers threatened \"9/11-style\" attacks on theaters showing a film. Some analysts believe North Korea lacks the ability for complex cyber operations like the Stuxnet attack on Iran's nuclear program. The international community's fears of North Korean cyber activities may be exaggerated due to limited visibility into their actions. The FBI attributed the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack to North Korea, who also conducted cyberattacks on South Korean institutions. North Korea is targeting various sectors in the US. The Republic of Korea has improved its military capabilities, but its active duty military is half the size of North Korea's. The ROK active duty military is about half the size of the DPRK's, raising concerns about South Korea's ability to mass enough force. South Korea relies on U.S. security assurances and has chosen not to acquire nuclear weapons. There are suggestions to redeploy U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea. The ROK Army has an end strength of approximately 490,000 and an active reserve force of 600,000, with primary responsibility for defending South Korea. The ROK Navy, with an approximate end strength of 70,000, includes 29,000 in its Marine Corps. It comprises the Naval Operations Command, three Fleet Commands, and Submarine Force, responsible for various naval operations including anti-surface, anti-submarine, mine, counter-mine, and amphibious operations. The ROK Navy includes surface combatants like destroyers, frigates, patrol vessels, and patrol craft. The Submarine Force Command conducts submarine operations. The Marine Corps Headquarters oversees amphibious operations. The Northwest Islands Defense Command defends northwestern islands and supports the Navy with logistics and training. The ROK Air Force, with around 65,000 personnel, has three main commands: Operations, Logistics, and Evaluation and Training. Operations Command controls air operations, including counter-air and close-air support. The United States has engaged allies in the Asia-Pacific to develop an integrated regional BMD capability to counter North Korea ballistic missile threats. US BMD capabilities are enhanced by integrating them into a larger global BMDS. The U.S. has worked with allies in Asia-Pacific to develop regional BMD capabilities to counter North Korea's missile threats. However, integration of BMD systems between the U.S., South Korea, and Japan has been hindered by historical and political issues, potentially limiting effectiveness in case of conflict. South Korea's Navy operates Aegis destroyers similar to U.S. Navy's, enhancing their BMD capabilities. The Sejon Daewang (KDX-3) class ships entered service in 2008, 2010, and 2012. Three more KDX-3 ships are planned to be built with a BMD-capable version of the Aegis system. The existing ships can be modified to become BMD sensor-capable in the future. They have participated in military exercises and could indirectly contribute to BMD missions by defending BMD-capable ships from North Korean threats. The U.S. and Japanese BMD-capable ships are equipped to defend against North Korean threats, including submarines, surface ships, aircraft, and anti-ship cruise missiles. South Korea hosts a U.S. THAAD battery with eight launchers and 48 interceptors, believed to be fully operational. THAAD is effective against short-range and medium-range ballistic missile threats, designed to protect larger areas like parts of South Korea. South Korea has Patriot missile defense systems in place, with plans to upgrade to Patriot Advanced Capability-3 by 2018. The effectiveness of THAAD against ballistic missiles targeting Seoul is uncertain due to its operational range. South Korea is also developing its own BMD capability called Korean Air and Missile Defense. South Korea is developing an indigenous BMD capability called Korean Air and Missile Defense (KAMD) to counter SRBMs. The 2018-2022 Mid-Term National Defense Plan includes KAMD as part of a \"three-axis system\" for preemptive strikes and retaliation against North Korean threats. Efforts are being made to hasten performance improvements in the medium-range surface-to-air missile (M-SAM) system. South Korea is enhancing its cyber capabilities to counter potential cyberattacks, with plans to increase its cyber force to around 1,000 troops. The country has shifted from a defensive to offensive cyber doctrine, aiming to proactively detect and prevent online attacks. In 2016, the South Korean Cyber Command was hacked by North Korea. U.S.-ROK cyber defense coordination predates the Sony attacks. A new cybersecurity facility was created in 2014 for U.S. Forces Korea to coordinate efforts with other U.S. commands and Republic of Korea forces. The U.S. Forces Korea Joint Cyber Center serves as the focal point for increasing international cooperation against cyber aggression from North Korea. In 2014, U.S. and Korean forces conducted the first bilateral cyber tabletop exercise to enhance defensive measures against North Korean cyber aggression. There are 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea as a deterrent against DPRK hostilities, providing key enablers like military intelligence and advanced strike aircraft rotations since 2004. The United States has extended its deterrent umbrella to South Korea, including nuclear deterrence, through the U.S.-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty. Current U.S./ROK operational plans involve deploying units to reinforce the ROK in case of military hostilities, with up to 690,000 additional U.S. forces, 160 naval vessels, and 2,000 aircraft potentially being called upon. Arrival dates of these units in theater are listed in the Time-Phased Force Deployment List (TPFDL), with factors like operational need, unit readiness, and availability of strategic air and sealift determining their deployment timeline. Since 2015, the U.S. and ROK militaries have developed new war plans to target North Korean WMD facilities and leadership in emergencies. The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Korea plans to increase augmentation forces based on crisis developments using Flexible Deterrence Options (FDO) and Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). FDO is used initially to deter war and deploy designated forces, while TPFDD is activated if deterrence fails, deploying combat and support forces for ROK-US combined operations. The U.S. and ROK have developed new war plans targeting North Korean WMD facilities and leadership. If Reserve Component units need to be activated, mobilization involving Congress, the President, and military department Secretaries would be required. The U.S. military is relocating forces south from bases near the North Korean border, with South Korea funding new military facilities. The U.S. military is relocating forces from the large Yongsan base in downtown Seoul to USAG Humphreys and areas south of the Han River. This consolidation aims to reduce vulnerability and decrease the number of USFK sites to 96 from 174 in 2002. The U.S. military is relocating forces from Yongsan base in Seoul to Osan Air Base/USAG Humphreys and USAG Daegu, reducing USFK sites to 96 from 174 in 2002. Counter-fires forces near the DMZ will remain, with a relocation delay to USAG Humphreys until South Korean reinforcement plan completion in 2020. Dongducheon city has protested this decision. United States Pacific Command (USPACOM) was established in 1947 and covers 36 nations. USPACOM, commanded by Admiral Harry Harris, covers 36 nations and oversees various component commands including U.S. Pacific Fleet with 200 ships, Marine Corps Forces Pacific with 86,000 personnel, and U.S. Pacific Air Forces. It has approximately 375,000 military and civilian personnel assigned across the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. Expeditionary Forces in the Pacific Command AOR consist of about 86,000 personnel and 640 aircraft. U.S. Pacific Air Forces have approximately 46,000 airmen and civilians with over 420 aircraft. U.S. Army Pacific includes around 106,000 personnel from one corps and two divisions, along with over 300 aircraft. Additionally, there are more than 1,200 Special Operations personnel and 38,000 Department of Defense civilian employees in the region. U.S. Forces Japan have about 54,000 military personnel and their dependents, while approximately 5,000 servicemembers and their families are stationed in Guam. The ROK/U.S. Combined Forces Command (CFC) serves as the warfighting headquarters in the area. The Combined Forces Command (CFC) is the warfighting headquarters responsible for deterring or defeating outside aggression against the ROK. It has operational control over 600,000 active-duty military personnel from both countries, with potential augmentation from 3.5 million ROK reservists and additional U.S. forces. The CFC coordinates defense through its various component commands and is led by a four-star U.S. general with a four-star ROK Army general as deputy commander. The transfer of wartime command of Korean troops to South Korea has been postponed for several years. The Combined Forces Command (CFC) is responsible for deterring aggression against South Korea, with operational control over military personnel from both countries. The plan to transfer wartime command to South Korea recognizes their military strength and sovereignty. Progressive parties in South Korea support hastening the transition to separate U.S. and ROK military commands. Korea Command (KORCOM) involves combined U.S. and ROK military operations under a new command structure. U.S. forces may be under Korean operational command, with U.S. general officers leading subcomponents. A Military Cooperation Center plans operations, exercises, logistics, and intelligence exchanges. The goal is to transfer operational control in 2023, with the completion of the Korean Air and Missile Defense System by 2020 being a crucial step. $1.36 billion will be invested in the KAMD. In 2010, the Opcon transfer to South Korea was postponed to 2015 due to concerns about readiness and North Korean provocations. As the new deadline approached, worries arose about military preparedness and alliance deterrence. Some experts feared a reduction in US commitment to South Korean security. Questions also surfaced about the ROK military's ability to lead in joint warfighting. In October 2014, the US and South Korea announced a \"conditions-based approach\" to the Opcon transfer, considering South Korean military capabilities and the security environment on the Korean Peninsula. The delay in the transfer could be seen as adjustments to changing circumstances or indicative of alliance decision challenges. General Curtis Scaparrotti outlined three conditions for the Opcon transfer in April 2015. The Opcon transfer from the US to South Korea may not occur until 2020 or later, with a focus on improving South Korea's capabilities in areas such as C4, BMD, munitions, and ISR assets. South Korea's Ministry of National Defense aims to fulfill requirements for the transfer by the mid-2020s, including leading alliance military drills and organizing potential future headquarters for CFC.
