    "content": "The Environmental Restoration Act of 2003 may be cited as the \"Environmental Restoration Act of 2003\". Congress acknowledges the historical significance of coal mining in America and the environmental impact of gob piles contributing to acid mine drainage. These gob piles also hold potential energy that can be harnessed for alternative power sources, although high costs have hindered investment in this technology. Developing alternate energy sources reduces costs, lessens reliance on foreign oil, and boosts American industry competitiveness. Higher energy demands and dependence on limited sources lead to increased prices for homeowners and industry, hurting jobs and economic growth. Encouraging alternate fuel sources aims to meet rising demand for homeowners and industries. SEC. 45G. ENERGY PRODUCED FROM WASTE COAL.
