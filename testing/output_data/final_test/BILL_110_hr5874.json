It primarily affects individuals aged 30 to 35, with over 10,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the US. Several FDA-approved drugs show some success in managing symptoms and progression of the disease. 400,000 individuals in the US have MS, with relationships between MS and environmental/genetic factors not well understood. Small MS registries exist globally, but a national system for collecting MS data in the US is lacking. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry is conducting pilot studies to establish a national MS surveillance system. The establishment of a national surveillance system for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States aims to identify incidence and prevalence, collect important data for research, produce sound epidemiological data, promote better understanding of MS, assess resource impact, study genetic and environmental risk factors, and enhance biomedical and clinical research. The national surveillance system for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States aims to identify incidence and prevalence, collect data for research, promote understanding of MS, assess resource impact, study risk factors, and enhance research efforts to find treatments and a cure for MS. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a Multiple Sclerosis National Surveillance System. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a national surveillance system for collecting data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, including information on the disease's incidence and prevalence. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a national surveillance system for collecting data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, including details on incidence, prevalence, demographics, and recommendations by the Advisory Committee on the MS National Surveillance System. The Advisory Committee on the MS National Surveillance System, appointed by the Secretary, includes representatives from national health associations focused on MS and the National Institutes of Health, specifically the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute of Environmental Health. The Advisory Committee on the MS National Surveillance System, appointed by the Secretary, includes representatives from national health associations focused on MS and various organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, and other experts in fields like epidemiology, genetics, statistics, ethics, and law. The Advisory Committee on the MS National Surveillance System, comprised of ethicists, attorneys, and other stakeholders, is tasked with reviewing and making recommendations to the Secretary on the development, maintenance, data collection, and use of the system. A report is due within one year of the Committee's establishment. The Advisory Committee on the MS National Surveillance System will submit recommendations to the Secretary regarding the review conducted, grants may be awarded for data collection on MS, and coordination with state, local, and federal registries is required for the establishment of the system. The Disease Registry aims to utilize existing data and surveillance systems, including MS surveillance pilot studies, the MS database of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and current MS registries like the New York State MS Registry and NARCOMS Registry. The Disease Registry aims to utilize existing data and surveillance systems, including MS databases and registries recommended by the Advisory Committee to provide research access while protecting personal privacy. Coordination with other federal agencies will be done in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations. The Secretary will ensure that information obtained under subsection (a) is shared with agencies like the National Institutes of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense. The term 'national voluntary health association' is defined as a national nonprofit organization with chapters nationwide. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2013 for this section."
