Statistics show that many children have lost their lives due to firearms accidents caused by ignorance and carelessness. To reduce these accidents, it is crucial to practice and enforce firearms safety rules. The \"Child Safety Lock Act of 2003\" defines a locking device as a mechanism on a firearm that prevents discharge without the proper key or combination. This aims to reduce unintentional deaths related to firearms among children by enforcing firearms safety rules. The \"Child Safety Lock Act of 2003\" mandates that licensed manufacturers, importers, or dealers must provide a locking device and a warning with any handgun sale to prevent unauthorized use. The packaging of handguns should include a warning about responsible firearm storage, emphasizing the need to store them unloaded, locked, separate from ammunition, and inaccessible to children to avoid legal consequences. Exceptions to this requirement include sales to government entities.
