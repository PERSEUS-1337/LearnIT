    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to define key terms such as \"Adult,\" \"Child or minor,\" \"CASA,\" \"Court,\" \"Dependent,\" \"Nonminor dependent,\" and \"Ward.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the roles and responsibilities outlined in this chapter. Section 102 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require each CASA program to have a paid administrator accountable to the juvenile court judge. Volunteers can serve as CASAs for dependents, nonminor dependents, or wards. CASAs provide factual information to the court and can continue their appointment after the child reaches adulthood with consent. The Judicial Council mandates training for CASAs, covering child abuse, court structure, social services, child development, cultural competency, interviewing, report writing, roles and responsibilities, and legal procedures. The Judicial Council mandates training for CASAs on various topics, including child abuse, court structure, social services, child development, cultural competency, interviewing, report writing, roles and responsibilities, legal procedures, rules of evidence, discovery procedures, and verifying reports. The Judicial Council also adopts guidelines for screening CASA volunteers, including personal interviews, reference checks, checks for criminal records, and information from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Section 103 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require CASAs to undergo training, ongoing supervision, and evaluation. CASAs must commit to at least one year of service to a child, with the option to recommit annually. They must also avoid any conflicts of interest. Each CASA must not face discrimination based on certain factors and must adhere to court rules. They are sworn in by a judge before starting their duties and can be appointed by a judge when a child needs their services. The judge appoints a CASA by signing an order granting them authority to review documents and interview relevant parties. CASAs are considered court personnel and cannot participate in criminal or juvenile court ward proceedings. A Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) can participate in determinations and delinquency proceedings, except when acting as a support person or on behalf of a child who is a crime victim."
