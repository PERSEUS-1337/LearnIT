    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that there have been criticisms of the lack of oversight over the management of Indian trust assets and funds. Indian and tribal account holders lack confidence in reforms carried out by the same entities responsible for the current system. There is a conflict of interest in establishing internal controls for the trust management system. Establishing internal controls for a trust management system involves appointing, supervising, and potentially removing individuals by the entity overseeing the controls. It is crucial to avoid conflicts of interest by ensuring that the same official does not supervise both fiduciary and financial reporting activities. The reform and creation of internal controls should ideally be carried out by private contractors, following the Department of the Interior's Trust Management Improvement Project guidelines. SEC. 401 of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 establishes a Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal Control. The Office of Special Trustee for Data Cleanup and Internal Control is established within the Department of Interior, headed by the Special Trustee who reports directly to the Secretary. The Special Trustee is appointed by the Inspector General and must possess abilities in internal controls, trust management procedures, and trust management systems conversion or rehabilitation. Compensation for the Special Trustee is specified. The Special Trustee is paid at a rate determined by the Secretary, serving a 2-year term and overseeing various subprojects related to trust management improvement. The Special Trustee oversees the expenditure of funds for subprojects, approves contracts, and makes employment decisions. Activities are carried out through contracts with private entities or trust management specialists. The implementation plan can be modified as needed. The Special Trustee oversees activities related to the Department of the Interior's Trust Management Improvement Project, including overseeing expenditures, approving contracts, and making employment decisions. The Special Trustee will continue to be responsible for overseeing activities even after any modifications to the implementation plan."
