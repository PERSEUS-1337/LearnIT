    "content": "The \"Veterans Mobility Safety Act of 2016\" allows eligible persons to make personal selections for automobiles or adaptive equipment provided under the program. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must develop a comprehensive policy for quality standards of modification services for veterans. The policy for the automobile adaptive equipment program covers VA-wide management, safety standards, quality of equipment and installation, certification of providers, and consistent application of standards throughout the Department. The certification of providers by a third party organization designated by the Secretary, education and training of Department personnel administering the program, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and allowing veterans to receive modifications at their residence are key aspects of the automobile adaptive equipment program. The Secretary approves manufacturers and third party nonprofit organizations for certification under specific quality standards. If only one nonprofit organization is approved, it cannot provide certifications. The Secretary must approve a second third-party nonprofit certifying organization before allowing certifications. Updates to the Veterans Health Administration Handbook must be made within 1 year of the Act's enactment and every 6 years thereafter. Consultation with veterans service organizations is required for policy development. The Secretary must consult with various organizations and experts in developing policies for automobile adaptive equipment. Conflicts of interest must be minimized, and procedures established to prevent financial conflicts. A biennial report must be submitted within 1 year of updating the Veterans Health Administration Handbook. The Secretary updates the Veterans Health Administration Handbook 1173.4 biennially and submits a report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The report includes details on the implementation plan and performance measures for the automobile adaptive equipment program. The curr_chunk discusses the safety assessment and adequacy of the automobile adaptive equipment program for veterans. It includes evaluations on safety issues, installation quality, service adequacy, personnel training, and provider standards. The curr_chunk defines the \"automobile adaptive equipment program\" and \"veterans service organization\" under title 38, United States Code.

The Secretary must ensure that hearing aid specialists appointed under title 38 can only perform services within their state license, services provided to veterans must be part of a non-medical treatment plan developed by an audiologist, and veterans must have access to the full range of services provided by an audiologist at VA medical facilities. The Secretary consults with various stakeholders to determine qualifications for hearing aid specialists. An annual report on veterans' access to hearing health services is required by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The annual report on veterans' access to hearing health services includes staffing levels, performance metrics, and wait times for appointments related to hearing health. The annual report on veterans' access to hearing health services includes evaluations for hearing-related disabilities, hearing aid evaluations, dispensing of hearing aids, and follow-up appointments. It also tracks the percentage of veterans with wait times exceeding 30 days for appointments. Additionally, the report includes data on the number of veterans referred to non-Department audiologists and hearing aid specialists for care. The non-Department hearing aid specialists provide follow-up appointments for hearing aid evaluations and dispensing, as well as other services related to hearing health. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
