The curr_chunk defines terms related to educational institutions, including historically Black colleges and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions. The curr_chunk introduces the Minority Online Degree Pilot Program.

Each grant lasts for 6 years with annual grant payments. The Minority Online Degree Pilot Program awards grants to eligible educational institutions for developing digital and wireless networks for online educational programs. Grants range from $1,000,000 for the first year to $100,000 for the sixth year, with priority given to institutions serving counties with a high percentage of racial or ethnic minorities. The Minority Online Degree Pilot Program awards grants to eligible educational institutions based on specific criteria such as low educational attainment, high unemployment, poverty rates, negative population growth, and low median family income. Priority is given to institutions meeting multiple criteria. Grant funds can be used for developing online educational programs. The grant funds awarded under this section can be used for acquiring equipment, developing educational services, and strategic IT plans. Matching funds are not required for educational institutions receiving grants. The Administrator must submit an annual report on the progress of the pilot program to the Senate and House committees. Authorization of Appropriations for the pilot program under this section includes $4,500,000 for fiscal year 2008, $2,400,000 for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2012, and $500,000 for 2013.
