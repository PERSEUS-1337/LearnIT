The \"21st Century Homesteading Act\" focuses on addressing challenges in rural areas like out-migration, poverty, and lack of technology industry growth. It emphasizes recruiting high-skilled workers to enable economic prosperity. SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR RURAL AMERICA. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a program for up to 6 demonstration projects involving H-1B workers in rural areas to create high-tech job opportunities. Grants will be awarded to economic development planning districts in rural areas for this program. Each economic development planning district seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary of Agriculture. The grant amount awarded to a district will be based on the total fees paid by employers under the Immigration and Nationality Act for the employment of H-1B workers in that district. The Secretary of Agriculture designates a single entity for each economic development planning district to apply for and receive grant funds. Grants are for education, training, equipment, and infrastructure related to employing H-1B workers in the district. Planning districts can enter into agreements with adjacent districts for eligibility in the program. The term \"economic development planning district\" is defined as an area designated by the Secretary of Agriculture in a State bordering Canada, where counties or municipalities have shown support for high-tech development and have experienced significant population outmigration. The economic development planning district must meet certain criteria: high-tech development support, significant population outmigration, high unemployment or poverty rates, or a population of 10% or more Native American. Additionally, the district must have partnerships with industry or higher education, offer incentive packages for high-skilled workers, and provide training programs for residents. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF H-1B VISAS. Effective October 1, 2001, a maximum of 12,000 aliens may be issued H-1B visas each fiscal year for employment in demonstration projects. Additionally, a separate account called the \"Twenty-first Century Homesteading Account\" is established for H-1B nonimmigrant petition fees. Fees collected from H-1B workers will be deposited into an account for demonstration projects under the program established by section 3. SEC. 5 of the Act clarifies that it does not override the procedures for filing H-1B visa applications with the Secretary of Labor. SEC. 6 provides definitions. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"H-1B visa,\" \"H-1B worker,\" \"institution of higher education,\" and \"Native American.\" The term \"rural area\" is defined as an area outside a standard metropolitan statistical area or within a community with a population of 50,000 individuals or fewer."
