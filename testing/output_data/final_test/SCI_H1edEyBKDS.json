    "content": "Large transformer-based language models have impressive generation capabilities but controlling attributes like topic or sentiment is challenging without model modifications or retraining. The Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) offers a simple solution by combining a pretrained LM with attribute classifiers to guide text generation without additional LM training. Sampling involves gradients from the attribute model influencing the LM's hidden activations to steer generation. The PPLM model combines a pretrained LM with attribute classifiers to guide text generation without additional training. It allows for control over topics and sentiment styles, demonstrated through automated and human evaluations. The Transformer architecture has enabled large-scale language models to improve natural language processing tasks significantly. The PPLM model leverages unannotated data and a log-likelihood training objective to generate text with controlled attributes like topic and sentiment. It uses a pre-trained language model without changing parameters and employs attribute models like bag of words and linear discriminators. The controlled attributes are highlighted and bracketed in the generated text. The PPLM model generates text with controlled attributes like topic and sentiment using unannotated data and a log-likelihood training objective. It highlights controlled attributes in the generated text and utilizes attribute models like bag of words and linear discriminators. The economic crisis in 2008 resulted in governments losing power for the first time in modern history. Controllable generation requires modeling p(x|a), where a is the desired controllable attribute(s). The Plug and Play Language Model (PPLM) combines attribute models with a pre-trained language model for conditional language generation. It allows for generating text with controlled attributes by sampling from the combined model. The PPLM approach combines attribute models with a pre-trained language model for controlled language generation without the need for re-training or finetuning. The strength parameter controls the attribute influence, offering flexibility to combine different models during inference. The PPLM approach combines attribute models with a pre-trained language model for controlled language generation without re-training. It allows for the combination of different attribute controllers during generation, acting as \"control knobs\" to tune towards desired attributes. The code for experiments is available at: https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM. Key contributions include introducing the Plug and Play LM for controlled language generation and demonstrating text generation control on various attributes. The PPLM approach enables controlled text generation by combining attribute models with a pre-trained language model. It outperforms strong LM baselines in attribute relevance and fluency, can detoxify toxic content, and facilitate structurally constrained story writing. The effectiveness of PPLMs is validated through automated and human evaluations. Current methods for controlled text generation involve fine-tuning existing models with Reinforcement Learning, training Generative Adversarial Networks, or training conditional generative models. Unlike other approaches, our method does not require retraining any conditional generative model, allowing for flexible assembly of both the language model and the conditional model. Table 2 compares recent language modeling approaches. Subramani et al. (2019) demonstrated steering a pre-trained language model to generate specific sentences. Our focus is on conditional generation from an unconditional language model. Previous works leveraged Shannon Noisy Channel Theory for sequence-to-sequence modeling. PPLM scores samples without a forward model, relying on latent space updates. The curr_chunk discusses the reliance on latent space updates proposed by Nguyen et al. (2017) for forward modeling. It compares using p(x) as a forward model and reranking, noting varying performance. Different approaches to controlled language generation are mentioned, highlighting challenges with weighted decoding and biasing generation towards a topic without specific keywords. Baheti et al. (2018) proposed a decoding strategy for generation. The curr_chunk discusses text style transfer in dialogue systems, using bags of words and word embeddings. Different approaches are compared, including variational auto-encoders for style transfer and a simple approach based on conditional generative models. The key difference is the use of an offline discriminator for optimization. In text style transfer for dialogue systems, various approaches are compared, including using a transformer model to compute the unconditional probability of a sequence of tokens. This method is different from previous approaches that focus on style transfer tasks and do not offer plug-and-play functionality. In this paper, a transformer model is used to model the distribution of natural language efficiently. The transformer is interpreted using recurrent notation, where the history matrix H t consists of key-value pairs from the past. This allows for efficient language generation without repeated forward passes. To control the output of the language model, gradients are used to shift the history at each generation step. The proposed approach involves shifting the history at each generation step towards higher log-likelihood of a desired attribute and the unmodified language model. This is done by combining gradients from an attribute model and updating internal latent representations of the language model. The process is controlled by a variable multiplier to guide generation in a specified direction with a specified strength. The approach involves updating latent representations of the language model at each generation step to shift towards a desired attribute. This is done by combining gradients from an attribute model, leading to gradual changes in model activations that guide future generation in the desired direction. The update to the latent representations (\u2206H t) is initialized at zero and modified with gradients from the attribute model. The latent representations of the language model are updated at each generation step to align with a specific attribute. Gradients from an attribute model are used to adjust the latent representations (\u2206H t), leading to gradual changes in model activations for guiding future generation. The process involves updating \u2206H t with gradients from the attribute model, followed by a forward pass through the language model to obtain updated logits. This approach aims to generate text tailored to a particular discriminator, but without proper constraints, it may lead to unrealistic or misleading examples. To combat adversarial examples, the unconditional language model is used to minimize KL divergence and perform post-norm fusion for maintaining fluency. The KL coefficient is scaled by \u03bb KL, typically set to 0.01, and post-norm fusion is applied to prevent unrealistic or misleading text generation. Stahlberg et al. (2018) discuss the need for steps that maximize both log p(a|x) and log p(x) in text generation. They use a single step in continuous hidden representation space H, rather than discrete x space, to tie generated text to the LM distribution. Sampling from unmodified and modified output distributions with a normalizing factor \u03b2 helps maintain distribution validity. In text generation, the attribute model in PPLM uses a factor \u03b3 gm to control the distribution, with values between 0.8 - 0.95 working well. It provides a score for ranking samples based on the desired attribute and a gradient ascent direction for updating in the latent space. To address repetitive text issues, the mean of Dist-1, Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores is computed to indicate repetitiveness. In text generation, the attribute model in PPLM uses a factor to control the distribution, providing a score for ranking samples based on the desired attribute. Samples with a mean score below a threshold are discarded. Evaluation methodology and controlled generation results are described, including use cases in language detoxification and controlled storytelling. Top-k sampling is used, and the quality of generated text is assessed based on attribute satisfaction and fluency. The control knob can be adjusted to reach a tradeoff between attribute strength and fluency. The text discusses evaluating text generation using automatic means and human annotators, including measuring fluency with perplexity and diversity with n-grams. External sentiment classifiers are used for sentiment evaluation, and human annotation includes fluency and A/B testing. The text discusses human annotation for sentiment evaluation, including fluency and A/B testing on attribute relevance. Annotators rate fluency on a scale of 1-5 and rank pairs of variants based on desired attributes. Annotations are obtained from nine external annotators, with majority voting used for attribute relevance and averaging for fluency. The method of generation is hidden during A/B testing. The method of generation is hidden during A/B testing, with an ablation study conducted on four variants: B, BR, BC, and BCR. Baseline approaches include CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. Hyperparameters are specified for each experiment. The study explores attribute models using Bag of Words to represent different topics like SCIENCE, MILITARY, LEGAL, COMPUTERS, SPACE, POLITICS, and RELIGION. Increasing the probability of generating words in the bag also increases the likelihood of generating related topical words. The optimization procedure for attribute control in text generation involves updating representations from the past over a finite window and using an adaptive normalization scheme. Human annotators found text from certain attribute models to be significantly more on topic than others, with manipulated latents demonstrating desired attribute control with only a slight degradation in fluency scores. The ablation approaches in attribute control for text generation show that BCR slightly outperforms CTRL and significantly outperforms WD. Gradient-based latent updates have a greater influence on topic relevance than reranking based on the score. Shifting meaning in latent space is more effective than shifting the output distribution directly through reweighting. WD's direct control of the output distribution leads to meager performance. The text discusses the controllability of text attributes across different topics, with some topics being easier to control for than others. It mentions the success of PPLM in controlling attributes, even in unusual combinations. The importance of using sophisticated discriminators for attribute control is highlighted, especially when simple bag of words models may not suffice. The text discusses training a discriminator on input sentences to predict target labels for attribute control. The discriminator consists of a single layer classifier with a small number of parameters compared to the LM model. A greedy approach is adopted to optimize for higher probability of specific attributes in the generated sequence. The objective involves optimizing the generated text for specific attributes by shifting the distribution towards desired outcomes using softer optimization approaches like REINFORCE and Gumbel-Softmax trick. This aims to avoid language degeneration and improve text diversity. In the ablation study, mean\u00b1std-dev results are reported across fluency metrics for human and automated evaluations. Topic accuracy is measured by the fraction of samples matching the target topic. Approaches BC and BCR show significant control over text topic while maintaining diversity scores and minimal degradation in Perplexity and Fluency compared to baseline LM (B). Manipulating latent variables (Ht) in BC results in a higher gain in topic accuracy (35.8%) compared to baseline. Perplexity is computed using GPT LM, different from the LM generating text (GPT-2). Human evaluation comparisons with BCR via A/B testing are reported for CTRL and WD. PPLM outperforms CTRL and WD on topic-relevance and is comparable on fluency scores. The sentiment discriminator distinguishes between POSITIVE and NEGATIVE sentiments and is trained on the SST-5 dataset. Samples are generated using 15 prefixes for each sentiment class for evaluation. The prefixes used are not necessarily associated with movie reviews, supporting generality. The evaluation results show a significant increase in attribute control accuracy using latent manipulation and ranking, with a decrease in fluency compared to the baseline. Sampling and ranking lead to higher attribute accuracy, while BC results in improved consistency with the desired attribute. The study obtained annotations for ablation study and baseline comparisons from annotators across samples and sentiments. The study evaluates attribute control accuracy using latent manipulation and ranking, showing a significant increase in accuracy while retaining fluency. Comparisons with baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD indicate that BCR performs comparably to CTRL and outperforms other models. Language models trained on large corpora reflect biases in the data, as shown in a recent paper by Wallace et al. (2019) conducting adversarial attacks. The country's top prison system is forcing prisoners to use a trash dump instead of a toilet to flush waste, as authorities fear toxicity and cancer risks. Evaluation of models on sentiment control task shows BCR provides significant sentiment control with minimal fluency degradation. GPT2-FT-RL is fine-tuned for positivity only. Human evaluation compares baselines CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD with BCR through A/B testing. GPT-2 models produce racist output with specific trigger strings. Toxicity percentages for different prefixes are reported. Adversarial triggers increase toxicity levels significantly. PPLMs can be adapted for language detoxification using toxicity classifiers. Training a classifier on toxicity data shows promising results. More details can be found in Section S12. The toxicity data from the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge (jig) shows that PPLM-Discrim methods work well on natural prompts and adversarial triggers, with toxicity percentages ranging from 4% to 10%. Adversarial triggers resulted in a significant drop in toxicity levels to 4.6% on average. Details on annotation procedures and results can be found in Table S23 and Section S12. The potential for models to generate toxic language is briefly discussed. Controlled generation is explored for assistive story writing to maintain coherence and structure. PPLM is a method for controlled language generation that allows flexible assembly of a pre-trained language model and a discriminator to control attributes like topics and sentiment. It shows great capability of attribute control while maintaining fluency, serving as a simple baseline for open-ended language generation tasks. There is ongoing discussion about the ethics of advanced language models. The authors discuss the potential risks and benefits of language models, acknowledging the possibility of creating toxic language. They aim to suggest a mechanism to detoxify language models while recognizing the inherent risks of machine learning technologies. The authors express gratitude to various individuals for their contributions to the work. The authors express gratitude to Julien Chaumond, Lysandre Debut, Thomas Wolf, and the Hugging Face team for their contributions to the PPLM demo. They believe their method could serve as a simple baseline for language generation tasks. Three baselines are considered: CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD, with WD being a weak baseline. The authors conducted human and automated evaluations to compare their method with baselines like CTRL, GPT2-FT-RL, and WD. Human annotators ranked text samples for attribute relevance and fluency, while automated evaluations included perplexity and sentiment analysis. The recent conditional language model, CTRL, was used as a benchmark for comparison. The study utilized the CTRL model with around 50 control codes to generate text samples for various attributes. Two topics, Military and Space, did not match with CTRL. Positive and negative sentiments were matched with the Reviews control code. Specific control codes were appended with a secondary code \"Text:\" to encourage longer passages. Text prompts were generated for each control code based on corresponding attribute models. The study compared GPT-2 fine-tuned model with PPLM in text generation tasks. GPT-2 generated positive texts using human feedback, while PPLM used a discriminative approach. Different sampling methods were used, with GPT-2 generating three samples per prefix and PPLM generating 20 samples. A baseline approach integrating conditioning into the decoding process was also considered. Incorporating sentiment control into text generation by sampling from a modified distribution based on attribute model scores. This approach contrasts with previous methods like beam-search, aiming to improve language quality for GPT-2. The distribution is defined with a parameter \u03c4 set to 10 for experiments. Incorporating sentiment control into text generation by sampling from a modified distribution based on attribute model scores. Evaluations include attribute relevance, language fluency, and a \"clickbait\" style control, assessed through human annotation and automated methods. The evaluation process includes human annotations and automated methods such as perplexity, Dist-1, Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores. Different models are compared based on the number of annotations for ablation studies and baseline comparisons. The evaluation process includes human annotations and automated methods such as perplexity, Dist-1, Dist-2, and Dist-3 scores. Different models are compared based on the number of annotations for ablation studies and baseline comparisons. An additional discriminator attribute model, clickbait classifier, was evaluated using 810 annotations. The generation procedure for BCR, BR, and BC is initiated from the same random seeds. The results are presented in tables and figures for PPLM-BoW and PPLM-discrm sentiments, including comparisons with strong baselines.

Different models are compared based on the number of annotations for ablation studies and baseline comparisons. The results for PPLM-discrm sentiments, along with strong baselines, are presented in tables and figures. The fluency scores show similar distributions across different methods, and the impact of PPLM gradient steps on topic relevance is highlighted. Human evaluation also shows the relevance of discriminators and different versions of combined results. Table S8 presents the full results of human and automated evaluation of PPLM-BoW, focusing on attribute relevance and language fluency. The study explores how PPLM can influence text generation in odd or illogical topic and prefix combinations. For example, it examines if phrases like \"The potato\" can still prompt sensible text generation under the topic of RELIGION. Various combinations of prefixes controlled by different topics are designed for analysis. The study explores how PPLM can influence text generation in odd or illogical topic and prefix combinations, such as \"The potato\" under the topic of RELIGION. The researchers found that PPLM control is achievable even in these scenarios by adjusting the strength parameter. The resulting generation is included in tables for reference. The study demonstrates PPLM's ability to generate coherent text samples even with unusual topic and prefix combinations, such as [Military]. Examples show PPLM's effectiveness in producing sensible and relevant content related to the military, including special operations missions in Afghanistan. The operation involved sending special forces to Afghanistan for counterterrorism training. In a legal case, a woman was sentenced to jail for contempt of court after defying a judge's orders. The city and county will officially recognize the lake with a name change, following a designation from the City Clerk's Office. State Law Division attorney David E. states that many are pleased with the change. The computer games of early fantasy RPGs featured heroes who were the most important unit for gameplay, generated by graphics programs on computers with graphics processing units. Examples of generated odd combinations include a topic on politics discussing the potential taxation of expensive potatoes for NHS benefits. Tax experts suggest taxing tax-free sales to generate revenue from the \u00a32.7bn potato industry. Property tax assessments in a tax zone are based on property value and tax rate, ranging from 0% to 50%. PPLM can generate fluent samples on the topic of [Religion], including references to chickens as God's loyal servants and the sacred status of potatoes in Hinduism. \"In India, a woman in Mumbai spoke about the Hindu god Vishnu coming to save people from the curse of the devil. The Old Testament mentions the Euphorbia lake for washing away sins, with references to Moses being washed in the Euphorbia River.\" The topic is [Space]. PPLM can generate fluent, sensible, and interesting samples related to the topic. A study found a way to prevent the growth of starfish in the inner solar system, potentially keeping them alive. The S-Star system orbits a gas giant star called HD 9 C. Mars has two major life-giving planets, with giant stars known as starlets having planets orbiting them. Starlets, known as binary star systems, have planets orbiting them. NASA's Curiosity Mars rover discovered that Mars has a thick and reflective mantle of rock on its surface. Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory found layers of meteoroid and meteoraceous minerals on Mars. The planet's moon is not just Earth's moon. The Avenged Sevenfold is a rock musical with a strong presence. The \"Avenged Sevenfold\" is a masterfully performed rock musical with breathtaking music, incredible performance, and captivating magic and story. It is hailed as the greatest rock musical of all time and is highly recommended. The musical is beautiful and has received praise for its amazing food. Degeneration in language generation can occur when the update step size is too large, leading to repetitive keywords. This issue can be mitigated by reducing the update step size or using early stopping latent updates. After 20 time steps, samples show less degeneration by modifying key-value pairs for the most recent w tokens in vector H t. For control with bag of words, w = 5 produces fluent passages. The neural attribute model updates the entire latent history, while the bag-of-words model enforces a word from the bag to appear at least once in the generated passage. Normalization is done by the maximum gradient norm over time to make smaller updates when less likely. The potato, once considered a nutritious food source, has been found to have harmful health issues, especially when grown on genetically engineered wheat and corn. Genetically modified potatoes are far more damaging to the human body than conventional ones, according to a study by researchers from Johns Hopkins University. The study revealed that a gene is responsible for creating potatoes' taste buds, potentially leading to the development of a drug to block this gene's activity. Researchers caution that their study does not prove a chemical in the plant's DNA causes the taste but could be prevented by altering the plant's genes. The potato chip experiment measures how easily nutrients are converted into a drug. Eating triggers brain stimulation to eat more, but in the experiment, only a small amount of nutrients is converted from the food. The potato, a staple in nutrition science, is commonly used in studies to measure research results. Scientists have used potatoes for decades, and a recent study published in Science Advances showed impressive results on how science can be studied in a laboratory setting. The study published in Science Advances demonstrates how studying science in a laboratory setting can improve science literacy and communication. The research focuses on skeleton story generation using different attribute models. The patient has been in terrible pain, constantly screaming for help since the incident. Volunteers assigned toxicity labels to texts generated from GPT-2 and toxicity-controlled GPT-2, prompted with natural words and adversarial triggers. Adversarial triggers are used to generate toxicity-controlled text from GPT-2. The percentages of toxicity before and after control are compared. Different sentence starters are used for evaluating PPLM-BoW and PPLM-Discrim generation. In this essay, attribute control is demonstrated using different models to generate skeleton stories with controlled effects. The distribution of fluency scores based on controlled generation with PPLM-Discrim is illustrated. The distribution of fluency scores from different models for attribute control in generating skeleton stories is shown using PPLM-Discrim. The scores are similarly distributed across all four approaches. Legal terms such as bankruptcy, warrant, crime, court, defense, lawsuit, judge, jury, prosecution, and testimony are essential in the field of law.
