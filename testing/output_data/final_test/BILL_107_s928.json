    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Older Workers' Rights Restoration Act of 2001\". Congress finds that age discrimination in employment remains a serious problem nationally and among State agencies, with invidious effects on victims, the labor force, and the economy. This discrimination increases the risk of unemployment among older workers. Age discrimination in employment increases the risk of unemployment among older workers, prevents optimal use of labor resources, affects morale and productivity, and perpetuates stereotypes. Private civil suits are crucial for enforcing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, but the Supreme Court limited Congress's power in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents. Congress cannot use the 14th amendment to remove State sovereign immunity for age discrimination suits under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Private civil suits are essential for enforcing the Act, especially after the Kimel decision limited remedies for victims of age-based discrimination by State employers. Federal law has long considered nondiscrimination obligations a crucial aspect of programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance. Without adequate Federal remedies, there is a higher risk of entities misusing such assistance to violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Discrimination based on age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance is prohibited by the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, except in employment where the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 already addresses such discrimination. Congress mandated State recipients of Federal financial assistance to waive immunity from discrimination claims under the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, closing a loophole that left many State employees without a Federal remedy for age discrimination. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress' authority to impose conditions on receiving Federal funds. In response to the Kimel decision, Congress required States receiving Federal financial assistance to waive sovereign immunity for age discrimination claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to ensure compliance and provide remedies for violations. In response to the Kimel decision, Congress mandated that States receiving Federal financial assistance must waive sovereign immunity for age discrimination claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. This waiver applies only to programs or activities that receive or use such assistance, providing remedies for violations within those specific areas. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 mandates that State employees will have the same remedies as other covered employees. The Act allows suits for prospective injunctive relief against State officials, with the relief being no broader than before the Kimel decision. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ensures that State employees have the same remedies as other covered employees. The Act aims to provide State employees with rights and remedies for age discrimination violations, ensure State waiver of sovereign immunity for programs receiving Federal assistance, and allow suits for injunctive relief against State officials. State officials can be sued in their official capacities for violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. SEC. 4. REMEDIES FOR STATE EMPLOYEES. Section 7 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 is amended to allow State employees to sue for relief under the Act, waiving sovereign immunity for States receiving Federal financial assistance. An official of a State can be sued for injunctive relief if procedures are followed. The court may award costs to the prevailing party in a suit under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as authorized by section 722 of the Revised Statutes. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or its amendments is deemed invalid, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. Waiver of Sovereign Immunity and Suits Against Officials under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act apply to specific circumstances after the enactment of this Act."
