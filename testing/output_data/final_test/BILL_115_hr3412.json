    "content": "The \"LEAD'R Act\" aims to establish Federal oversight for the safety of highly automated vehicles, promoting their testing and deployment. It grants authority to NHTSA and addresses state preemption for autonomous motor vehicles. The \"LEAD'R Act\" amends Section 30103 of title 49, United States Code, regarding the preemption of state laws on highly automated vehicles and motor vehicle safety standards. No state can enforce laws on the design or performance of highly automated vehicles unless identical to federal standards. The \"LEAD'R Act\" amends Section 30103 of title 49, United States Code, regarding the preemption of state laws on highly automated vehicles and motor vehicle safety standards. States can maintain laws on registration, licensing, driving education, insurance, law enforcement, and traffic unless they unreasonably restrict design, construction, or performance. The \"LEAD'R Act\" amends Section 30103 of title 49, United States Code, allowing states to maintain laws on registration, licensing, driving education, insurance, law enforcement, and traffic for highly automated vehicles. States can also regulate the sale, distribution, repair, and service of these vehicles without preempting federal law. The \"LEAD'R Act\" amends Section 30103 of title 49, United States Code, allowing states to regulate highly automated vehicles without preempting federal law. States can enforce standards identical to those prescribed under this chapter, and may impose higher performance requirements for their own use. Compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards does not exempt a person from common law liability. The \"LEAD'R Act\" allows states to regulate highly automated vehicles without preempting federal law. Compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards does not exempt a person from common law liability. The act also defines an \"automated driving system\" as hardware and software capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task. The \"LEAD'R Act\" allows states to regulate highly automated vehicles without preempting federal law. Compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards does not exempt a person from common law liability. The act also defines a \"dynamic driving task\" as all real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, excluding strategic functions like trip scheduling and destination selection. This includes lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control, monitoring the driving environment, object and event detection and response, maneuver planning.

Compliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards does not exempt a person from common law liability. The act also defines a \"dynamic driving task\" as all real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, excluding strategic functions like trip scheduling and destination selection. This includes lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control, monitoring the driving environment, object and event detection and response, maneuver planning, enhancing conspicuity via lighting, signaling, and gesturing. The act also defines a \"highly automated vehicle\" as a motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system, excluding commercial motor vehicles. Additionally, it introduces the term \"operational design domain\" as the specific conditions under which a given driving automation system or feature is designed to function. The Secretary must be notified of any revisions to defined terms in Recommended Practice Report J3016. If the new definition is deemed unsuitable for motor vehicle safety or inconsistent with the chapter's purposes, the existing definition will remain in effect. If the Secretary does not reject a revised definition by SAE International, conforming amendments will be made promptly. The Secretary may update definitions if changed circumstances impact motor vehicle safety. The Secretary may update definitions if changed circumstances impact motor vehicle safety, requiring updates to reflect such circumstances."
