The Public Utilities Code in California is amended to establish a program for disclosing information on fuel sources for electric generation and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Definitions for \"greenhouse gas emissions intensity\" are provided. The Public Utilities Code in California is amended to establish a program for disclosing information on fuel sources for electric generation and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Definitions for \"greenhouse gas emissions intensity\" are provided. A \"retail supplier\" in California offers electricity products for sale to retail consumers, including various entities like electrical corporations and community choice aggregators. A \"system operator\" is responsible for the efficient use and reliable operation of the transmission grid. The Public Utilities Code in California is amended to establish a program for disclosing information on fuel sources for electric generation and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Definitions for \"greenhouse gas emissions intensity\" are provided. \"Purchases of electricity from specified sources\" are traceable to specific generation sources by auditable contract trails, while \"electricity from unspecified sources\" is not traceable. Retail suppliers may rely on annual data for verification. Section 398.4 of the Public Utilities Code in California is amended to require retail suppliers to disclose electricity sources and associated greenhouse gas emissions intensity to consumers in promotional materials. This disclosure must be made for the previous calendar year and applies to all product-specific materials, excluding general circulation media. Retail suppliers in California must annually disclose electricity sources and associated greenhouse gas emissions intensity to end-use consumers. The disclosure must be made by the end of the first complete billing cycle for the third quarter of the year and distributed separately for each portfolio offering. Guidelines for disclosure format and means will be specified by the Energy Commission, and the costs of disclosure are considered generation related. Retail suppliers in California are required to disclose their electricity sources as a percentage of annual sales from specified categories and identify total California system electricity. The disclosure must also include the percentage of annual sales derived from specific fuels, sources of energy, or electricity products. The Energy Commission in California requires retail suppliers to disclose their electricity sources, including coal, large hydroelectric, natural gas, nuclear, and eligible renewable energy resources like biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, and wind. Annual sales from unbundled renewable energy credits must also be included in the disclosures. Retail suppliers must ensure that all electricity sources meet specific requirements. The Energy Commission in California mandates retail suppliers to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of their electricity portfolios and statewide sales. They must purchase electricity from sources connected to the Western Electricity Coordinating Council grid and follow a methodology for calculating emissions intensity in consultation with the State Air Resources Board. Establish guidelines for adjustments to greenhouse gas emissions intensity factors for local publicly owned electric utilities with excess generation, ensuring that excess generation procured in a single year is not counted more than once or resold to another retail supplier. Retail suppliers must ensure no double-counting of greenhouse gas emissions when reporting electricity production data. Guidelines for reporting emissions intensity must be adopted by January 1, 2018, with reporting required starting June 1, 2020. Retail suppliers must ensure no double-counting of greenhouse gas emissions when reporting electricity production data. Guidelines for reporting emissions intensity must be adopted by January 1, 2018, with reporting required starting June 1, 2020. Any new community choice aggregator formed after January 1, 2016, shall report data on greenhouse gas emissions intensity associated with retail sales within 24-36 months of serving its first customer. Marketing claims must align with Energy Commission methodology. Exemptions apply to onsite generators and affiliates. Retail suppliers are required to report annual electricity data to the Energy Commission, including kilowatthours purchased, sold, and disclosures made to consumers for each offering. Reporting must be consistent with meter data and include sources from California and other subregions within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Retail suppliers must report annual electricity data to the Energy Commission, including disclosures made to consumers for each offering. Trade secrets will be protected, and guidelines for information submission will be specified to minimize reporting burden and cost. The Energy Commission may verify environmental and procurement claims made by retail suppliers, with exceptions for certain generators providing onsite electric service. No reimbursement required by this act as local agencies or school districts can levy charges to cover mandated services. This act may incur costs for creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
