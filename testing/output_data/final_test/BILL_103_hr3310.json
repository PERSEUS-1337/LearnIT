    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Barbara McClintock AIDS Cure Act\" and establishes the Barbara McClintock Project for Curing AIDS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a project to develop a cure for AIDS, with a focus on ensuring a well-functioning immune system and normal lifespan. The program will not be run by the National Institutes of Health, and specific requirements must be met during implementation. The project under subsection (a) must meet requirements such as pursuing basic science investigations on diverse theories related to AIDS pathogenesis and identifying promising curatives for testing with extraordinary powers detailed in section 5. SEC. 3. EFFICIENT AND COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF PROJECT. The Secretary must ensure that the project establishes one central location for its work, with primary research staff working there and interacting with contributing researchers worldwide. The National Institute of Health's AIDS research programs must be maintained, and all basic science research supplementary to the project must be done cooperatively. Primary research staff and administrators must be compensated only by the project and avoid conflicts of interest with private organizations. The project requires primary research staff and administrators to suspend relationships with private organizations to avoid conflicts of interest. This includes positions, fees, and ownership with for-profit organizations. Funding for the project must come from public sources, not private. The project must be funded by public money and not diverted from other health programs. It will include an on-site clinic for research trials with human participants. A Governing Council composed of scientists, clinicians, and representatives from affected communities will set policies and oversee research priorities. The Governing Council for the research project must have diverse representation, including scientists, clinicians, people with AIDS and HIV, and their advocates. It should consist of at least 21 members to ensure a variety of perspectives and accountability to those directly affected by the research. Members will rotate out periodically. The Governing Council for the research project will oversee research priorities, set policies, and evaluate the work of the project. It will ensure high-quality and diverse research staff, with the power to create new positions and remove scientists when necessary. The Governing Council for the research project will oversee research priorities, set policies, and evaluate the work of the project to match the urgency of the epidemic. It will solicit and evaluate new theories, direct scientists to respond to proposals, and monitor compliance with medical ethics and conflicts of interest. Scientists will report progress directly to the council. The Governing Council for the research project will report progress directly to the President, hold public meetings quarterly, and evaluate its structure annually to function more effectively. The Secretary will establish a coordinating committee for the project under section 2, with three elected scientists responsible for communication, progress evaluation, and convening staff meetings to assess project direction and consider new theories. The coordinating committee, established by the Secretary, is responsible for informing the policy council of project progress and making decisions on hiring, equipment purchases, and day-to-day needs. Their first task is to review existing pathogenesis hypotheses and develop plans for evaluation and testing. The coordinating committee, established by the Secretary, is responsible for informing the policy council of project progress and making decisions on hiring, equipment purchases, and day-to-day needs. Their first task is to collectively develop plans for evaluating and testing each of the viable hypotheses, including timelines for evaluating the progress of this work. SEC. 4. OPEN AND PRODUCTIVE RESEARCH PATHS. The Secretary must ensure equal consideration for conventional and other medical approaches in the project, with researchers representing divergent theories on the research staff. The project will focus on researching AIDS pathogenesis, including virological/immunological theories and co-factors related to immune system damage. Further work will be done on the potential role of other factors in AIDS development. Further research will focus on the potential role of recreational drugs, alcohol, nutritional factors, chemical toxins, and heavy metals in disease progression. Psychoneuroimmunology will be studied to understand the connections between psychological stress, lack of social support, and immune compromise. Various pathogenesis theories related to HIV will be examined, including those considering HIV as a primary cause with co-factors and those questioning its causative role. Diverse theories will be developed and tested through laboratory experiments and epidemiological research. Research will focus on epidemiological and blood studies of long-term survivors with HIV and AIDS to isolate sustaining factors. Subjective evidence will be collected from individuals and their care providers to supplement quantifiable data. Consideration will be given to hypotheses and results from other countries, with efforts to recruit top researchers. The project aims to study AIDS pathogenesis and manifestations in all populations, including women, children, gay men, lesbians, people of color, injection drug users, hemophiliacs, and those with inadequate medical care. Research will focus on people at every stage of AIDS and HIV, from the sickest to the healthiest, with a commitment to saving those considered \"near death\". The project aims to study AIDS pathogenesis and manifestations in all populations, with a focus on people at every stage of AIDS and HIV. Information generated by the Project will be freely available to researchers and health care providers. Curatives released due to project research will not result in financial gain to any private organization and will be available to all affected people regardless of ability to pay. SEC. 5. EXTRAORDINARY POWERS. The Secretary has extraordinary powers to direct existing research entities to test promising cures, design protocols, and fund clinical trials for the project's goals. The project has the power to fund clinical trials for its own compounds and exercise eminent domain to obtain samples and data for potential curatives. Private companies must adhere to approved time frames and provide data for clinical testing. The project can use existing pharmaceutical company facilities for production of curatives, and if a company hinders development, the project can work with them or acquire the compound for just compensation. The project is authorized to use eminent domain powers to obtain samples and data if a company refuses to cooperate. It can also acquire patents of compounds if a company fails to develop them promptly. Funds will be allocated immediately for planning the project under section 2, including facilities, staff selection, funding, structure, and schedules, to ensure the project can start functioning promptly."
