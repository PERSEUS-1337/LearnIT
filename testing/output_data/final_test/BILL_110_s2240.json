    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Job Protection Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The \"Volunteer Firefighter and EMS Personnel Job Protection Act\" defines terms such as emergency, major disaster, qualified volunteer fire department, volunteer emergency medical services, and volunteer firefighter. A volunteer firefighter is a member in good standing of a qualified volunteer fire department. Volunteer firefighters and emergency medical personnel cannot be terminated from their positions. Employees cannot be terminated, demoted, or discriminated against for being absent or late due to serving as volunteer firefighters or providing volunteer emergency medical services in response to emergencies or disasters. This protection also applies to employees specifically deployed for such purposes or volunteer firefighters who are part of a qualified volunteer fire department. Employees serving as volunteer firefighters or providing volunteer emergency medical services in response to emergencies or disasters are protected from termination, demotion, or discrimination. This protection also extends to employees deployed by the emergency management agency of the State, as long as they are not part of a qualified fire department with a mutual aid agreement with the affected community. There are limitations on the number of days an employee can be absent for this purpose and on responding to emergencies without official deployment. An employer can withhold pay for employee absences related to responding to emergencies or disasters. Employees must provide written verification of their official capacity and participation schedule from relevant officials. Employees must make a reasonable effort to notify their employer and provide updates during their absence for emergency response. An individual who has faced employment discrimination can file a civil action seeking reinstatement, back wages, fringe benefits, and seniority rights within 1 year of the violation. The Secretary of Labor will conduct a study on the impact of the Act on employers of volunteer firefighters and individuals providing volunteer emergency medical services. A report on the study will be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
