The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) was established in 1996 to explore privatizing publicly owned airports. Only two airports have completed privatization, with one reverting to public ownership. Lack of interest in privatization could be due to readily available financing for public airports, barriers to privatization, and lack of incentives. Airport privatization in the United States typically involves partial privatization, such as outsourcing non-core operations to private firms. Full privatization is rare, with only two airports completing the process under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program. Various models exist, from service contracts to transferring ownership out of the public sector. Some U.S. airports outsource non-core operations to private firms specializing in services like cleaning, landscaping, shuttle operations, and concessions. Management contracts are also common, where private companies handle facilities like parking, terminal operations, and aircraft refueling. AvPorts, a Virginia-based company, manages airports like Albany International Airport and Westchester County Airport. Private sector involvement in airport operations can take various forms, such as developer financing/operation, long-term lease or sale, and full privatization. Examples include the Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain model and the sale or lease of airports to private owners or operators. This allows for capital improvements and profit-sharing arrangements. Airport privatization involves obligations like upfront payments and profit-sharing. Only two airports have long-term leases. Full sale transfers ownership and operation responsibility to a private buyer. Stakeholders include airport owners, air carriers, private investors, and the federal government. Different objectives and interests may affect the decision-making process. Privatization can impact passengers through airport concession offerings and operations. Privatization of airports can have effects on operational efficiency, prices, and fees. Passenger interests are often not formally represented in discussions. Airport owners, typically local governments, may consider privatization to generate revenue for general use. However, federal regulations usually restrict the use of privatization revenue to airport purposes. Surrendering control of airports through privatization can lead to the loss of public-sector jobs. Public-sector owners may not see many benefits unless the airport is losing money. The federal Airport Privatization Pilot Program aims to encourage privatization by granting exemptions to public-sector owners regarding revenue diversion and other obligations. Air carriers seek to keep costs low and have control over airport revenues, while potential private operators aim to increase revenue. Air carriers also want well-maintained airports for operational efficiency. Private investors and operators support airport privatization for lower charges, better services, and growth potential. They aim to increase profitability through additional flights, improved amenities, and attracting more traffic. However, conflicts may arise with air carriers over increased fees or rents. The federal government, through the Department of Transportation and FAA, is directed to involve private capital in aviation infrastructure. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is tasked by Congress to involve private capital in aviation infrastructure development while ensuring safety and enforcing grant assurances. Stakeholder interests and balancing them during privatization are key concerns of the Airport Privatization Program. The Airport Privatization Program (APPP) was established by the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 to increase private participation and investment in airport operations. The program allows the Secretary of Transportation to exempt airports from certain federal requirements, such as using airport revenue for airport-related purposes or repaying federal grants. Initially limited to five airports, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 expanded participation in the program. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 increased the number of airports that can participate in the Airport Privatization Program (APPP) from 5 to 10. Only one large hub commercial airport can participate and can only be leased, not sold. General aviation airports can be sold under the APPP. Since its inception, 12 airports have applied to enter the program, but only 2 have completed privatization. One airport that privatized later reverted to public ownership. Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, NY, was the first commercial service airport privatized under the APPP in 2000. Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, NY, was the first commercial service airport privatized under the APPP. National Express Group PLC paid $35 million upfront for a 99-year lease and agreed to pay 5% of the airport's gross income. They also made a $10 million capital contribution. The state of New York agreed to use lease payments for airport purposes and recoup past subsidies for Stewart Airport. National Express was unsuccessful in increasing passenger traffic at Stewart. The airport saw a decrease in enplanements from 274,126 in 2000 to 156,638 in 2006 under National Express management. The company's attempt to rename the airport faced local opposition. In 2006, National Express focused on school bus operations and sold its lease on Stewart to the Port Authority for $78.5 million. The Port Authority reported losses of $0.8 million in 2007 and $5.5 million in 2008, suggesting the airport may not have been profitable for the private owner. National Express sold its lease on Stewart Airport to the Port Authority for $78.5 million. The airport's privatization efforts did not materialize, but the City of Chicago leased Midway Airport to private investors. The Chicago City Council agreed to a $2.52 billion, 99-year lease with Midway Investment and Development Corporation in 2008. The lease agreement for Midway Airport in Chicago was terminated in 2009 due to financing issues during the global economic crisis. MIDCo had to pay a $126 million penalty to the city. A renewed effort to lease the airport in 2013 was abandoned, leading to the suspension of plans for privatization. The City of Chicago withdrew its privatization application, leaving the APPP slot open for a large hub airport. Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport in Puerto Rico is the only commercial service airport operating under private management after privatization. The FAA approved the final privatization contract in February 2013, transferring the airport to a private operator, Aerostar. Aerostar Airport Holdings took over Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport in Puerto Rico in February 2013, paying $615 million upfront and agreeing to a 40-year lease with additional payments. They also committed to a $1.2 billion capital plan for renovations and improvements. Hendry County Airglades Airport in Florida received preliminary approval for privatization in 2010. In October 2010, FAA approved privatization under the APPP for Westchester County Airport in NY. The airport serves 1.75 million passengers annually. St. Louis Lambert International Airport's preliminary application was accepted in April 2017. The program has not been successful in generating widespread interest in airport privatization. The APPP has not been successful in stimulating wide interest in airport privatization due to the time-consuming process and risks involved. Examples include the lengthy approval process for airports like Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport and Hendry County Airglades Airport, taking years to complete. The application process starts with a preliminary application for FAA approval, reserving one of the ten slots available under the APPP for the airport. The APPP process for airport privatization involves submitting a preliminary application to reserve a slot, followed by selecting a private operator, negotiating an agreement, and submitting a final application to the FAA. The FAA then reviews the final application, conducts a public review and comment period, and issues a decision in a Findings and Record of Decision (ROD). The Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) process involves submitting a preliminary application, selecting a private operator, negotiating an agreement, and submitting a final application to the FAA. The FAA then reviews the final application, conducts a public review and issues a decision in a Record of Decision (ROD). Regulatory requirements under the APPP, such as the need for air carriers' approval, restrictions on rate increases, and reduced federal funding for improvements, have been criticized for discouraging airport privatization. Publicly owned airports have access to various sources of funding, including federal grants from the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and passenger facility charges. This funding helps with planning and development of capital projects related to aircraft operations. Airport privatization may be discouraged due to reduced federal funding and other regulatory requirements. Tax-exempt bonds secured by airport revenue offer cheaper financing for airport projects like passenger terminals and ground access improvements. Tenant leases, landing fees, and state/local grants also contribute to airport revenue. Privatizing a publicly owned airport may limit access to federal funds and tax-exempt bonds, leading to higher financing costs for the private operator. Privatizing an airport under the Airport Privatization Pilot Program (APPP) would give the private operator more freedom to set passenger fees and charges, but they would have to provide a 30% match for federal grants. However, they would not have access to tax-exempt bonds and would face limitations on raising fees for air carriers. This has made airport privatization less attractive in the United States compared to other countries. Airport privatization has been less attractive in the United States compared to Europe and Canada due to factors like the absence of national government ownership of major airports and the tax-favored status of debt issued by state and local governments. The momentum for airport privatization began with the privatization of the British Airport Authority by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration. The British Airport Authority (BAA) was privatized by the administration of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1987, transforming the airport sector in the UK and globally. The government listed BAA plc on the London stock exchange, privatizing seven airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted. The government sold all shares by 1996 but retained a \"golden share\" until 2003. Economic regulation of airport charges was overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority. In 2012, airports with over 5 million annual passengers are subject to government regulation of charges. Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted are closely supervised. BAA was privatized in 1987, sold to Airport Development & Investment Ltd in 2006 for \u00a310.1 billion. BAA's non-U.K. airport stakes were sold off, and the name BAA was dropped in 2012. The company BAA was rebranded as Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd (HAH) in 2012. Ferrovial remains the largest shareholder in HAH with a 25% stake. Cardiff Airport in Wales was purchased by the Welsh government for \u00a352 million in 2013 due to declining passenger numbers. Prestwick Airport in Scotland was bought by the Scottish government for \u00a31 in 2013 after several carriers ceased service. After the privatization of major airports in Europe in 1987, some private owners acquired ownership interests in other airports. Public-sector airport operators also expanded by providing management services at other airports. Approximately 14% of European airports are owned by mixed public-private shareholders and 9% are fully privatized. The Dutch government's Schiphol Group rebuilt and operates Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport in New York. A 2016 study by Airports Council International\u2014Europe highlighted these trends. The Canadian government devolved the operation, management, and development of airports to local airport authorities in the early 1990s. This included leasing out major airports like Calgary, Vancouver, Edmonton, and Montreal. Transport Canada announced a National Airports Policy in 1994, categorizing airports into different groups. The National Airports System (NAS) in Canada includes various types of airports, with ownership of regional and local airports transferred to regional or local interests. Canadian Airport Authorities (CAAs) manage the NAS airports, while the government receives rent payments. Operating subsidies for regional or local airports were removed, and an Airport Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) was established for safety-related projects. The Airport Capital Assistance Program (ACAP) provides federal funding for safety-related airside capital projects at small airports. Most small airports have been transferred to local interests as required by the National Airports Program (NAP). The government supports remote and Arctic airports serving isolated communities. Airport charges at transferred airports are determined by airport authorities, with the government only regulating airports operated by Transport Canada. Airports can impose local passenger fees for revenue generation. They pay rent to the federal government and \"payments in lieu of tax\" to municipalities. Critics question the \"users pay\" system in Canada's airports, with passengers paying high taxes and charges compared to the US. Many Canadians choose to fly from US airports, with Plattsburgh International Airport being a popular choice. Plattsburgh International Airport near the Canadian border has 85% of its annual passengers as Canadian residents. A report highlighted how Canada's airport fees were affecting the competitiveness of Canadian airports near the US border. Congress is considering airport privatization to reduce federal assistance dependency and increase aviation capacity. However, current federal law hinders privatization goals, as budget savings are uncertain. Privatization outside the APPP framework is unappealing due to higher financing costs and loss of federal AIP. Privatization under the APPP may lead to minor reductions in federal outlays, but it may not necessarily benefit public-sector owners or air carriers. Private investors' earnings from a privatized airport are limited by restrictions on fees. Air carriers may only benefit from privatization if they can negotiate lower fees in return. Streamlining the APPP application and review process could make airport privatization more attractive by reducing risks. Structural changes to the airport financing system, such as offering the same tax treatment to private and public airport infrastructure bonds, may be necessary to increase interest in privatization. This could involve eliminating the federal income tax exemption on bonds issued by public-sector airport owners or extending tax benefits to bonds issued by private investors. Changing AIP requirements, such as reducing the percentage match for private operators to obtain grants, could make privatization more appealing to investors but increase federal funding. Relaxing AIP grant assurances for private investors may also attract more interest, but certain changes like allowing the sale of airport property could conflict with federal interests in aviation system capacity and safety. Privatizing airports by liberalizing rules on fees and revenue use could attract investors but face airline opposition and potentially raise costs for passengers. Different types of airports, including Commercial Service Airports, are discussed in the report. The report discusses different types of airports, including Commercial Service Airports that cater to varying levels of passenger traffic. Large Hub Airports handle 1% or more of passengers, Medium Hub Airports handle 0.25% to 1%, Small Hub Airports handle 0.05% to 0.25%, Non-Hub Airports handle less than 0.05%, and Non-primary Commercial Service Airports handle 2,500 to 10,000 passengers annually. General Aviation Airports support business, personal, and instructional flying. General Aviation Airports support various types of flying, including military service, agricultural spraying, air ambulances, on-demand air-taxies, and charter aircraft service. Reliever Airports, designated by the FAA, help relieve congestion at commercial airports and improve general aviation access."
