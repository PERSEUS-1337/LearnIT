    "content": "The \"Rural Education Development Initiative for the 21st Century Act\" aims to provide increased learning opportunities for rural school students in the United States. Congress finds that rural school districts lack specific federal education policies addressing their needs, with only 22% of education funds allocated to them despite serving 46% of public schools. Rural schools struggle with hiring and retaining qualified teachers, leading to educators teaching multiple subjects. Rural schools face tough challenges like shrinking tax bases, high transportation costs, and limited resources. Data from NAEP shows large achievement gaps between high-poverty schools and others, posing challenges in preparing students for high standards on assessments. The text chunk \"SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\" is a concise statement defining terms within a document or legislation. In this Act, terms like \"elementary school\", \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", and \"State educational agency\" are defined according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. An \"eligible local educational agency\" is one that serves a school age population with 15% or more from families below the poverty line and falls under specific school locale codes or student population criteria. The term \"rural area\" is also defined. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to education, such as \"rural area,\" \"poverty line,\" \"school locale code,\" \"school age population,\" and \"Secretary.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the context of the Act. SEC. 5. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. From amounts appropriated under section 9, the Secretary reserves 0.5 percent for awards to Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. Grants are awarded to State educational agencies for local educational activities. Each State agency receives a grant based on a formula. The Secretary reserves funds for Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and awards grants to State educational agencies based on a formula. If a State agency does not participate, the Secretary may award funds to local educational agencies through a competitive process. The school age population data is determined using the most recent Census Bureau data. Under section 7, the Secretary may competitively award funds to eligible local educational agencies in the State. Each agency receiving a grant must match the Federal funds with resources from non-Federal sources. The grant funds are to be used for local educational technology efforts and professional development activities for teachers. The Act provides funding for academic enrichment programs, including support for teachers in subjects outside their primary area, remedial instruction in core subjects, and recruitment of highly qualified teachers in Special Education, Math, and Science. Funds received under this Act will not affect eligibility for other federal funding.
