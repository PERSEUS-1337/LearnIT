The Hispanic Cultural Center Act of 1997 acknowledges the significant Hispanic influence in the United States, dating back to 1528. The Hispanic culture in New Mexico, traced to 1539, is an integral part of daily life for its diverse population. The first capital in the United States, San Juan de los Caballeros, was established by Don Juan de Onate and the first New Mexican families in July of 1598. There are approximately 650,000 Hispanics in New Mexico with roots reaching back ten or more generations, and an additional 200,000 Hispanics living outside of New Mexico with roots in the state. The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center serves as a tribute to the Hispanic experience and aims to preserve the 400-year old culture. The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center was established in 1993 to teach, showcase, and share all facets of Hispanic culture, promote cross-cultural understanding, and oversee the planning and operation of the center with a mission to create a greater appreciation and understanding of Hispanic culture. The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center serves as a local, regional, national, and international site for the study and advancement of Hispanic culture. It showcases Hispanic arts and humanities, provides a venue for presenting historic and contemporary representations of Hispanic culture, and sponsors arts and humanities programs.
