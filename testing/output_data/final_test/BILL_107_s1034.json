    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act\" and includes regulations for ballast water treatment. The \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act\" includes regulations for ballast water treatment and amends Section 1101(b) of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to promulgate regulations concerning aquatic nuisance species. The \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act\" regulations aim to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes by applying to all vessels entering the Great Lakes with ballast water, ensuring that water containing aquatic nuisance species is not discharged into the lakes. The Great Lakes regulations establish a ballast water treatment standard for vessels to prevent the introduction of aquatic nuisance species. This standard includes a 95 percent volumetric exchange of ballast water or a treatment that destroys at least 95 percent of animal fauna. The regulations for vessels in the Great Lakes aim to protect safety, minimize organism transfer, regulate ballast water discharge, consider various operating conditions, and ensure compliance with technologies. The regulations for vessels in the Great Lakes aim to ensure environmentally sound treatment methods for ballast water and sediments to prevent infestations of aquatic nuisance species, with a detailed timetable for implementation of cost-effective technologies. The regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes include certification by the vessel's master of compliance with innovative treatment methods, ensuring maximum compliance through practical means. The regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes include certification of ballast water treatment vendors and vessel vendors based on the best scientific information available, without superseding any discharge requirements. The Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act mandates regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes, including certification of ballast water treatment vendors and vessel vendors. The Secretary of Transportation will establish requirements under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and a regulatory schedule within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Transportation will promulgate final regulations for the implementation of treatment methods for vessels entering the Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act. The Secretary of Transportation will finalize regulations for treatment methods for vessels entering the Great Lakes as per the Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act, within 270 days of enactment. The regulations for treatment methods for vessels entering the Great Lakes must be finalized within 270 days of the enactment of the Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act, or within 720 days after the enactment date if not specified in the timetable. The Secretary must review and revise regulations every 3 years to enhance effectiveness, incorporate better management practices, and update ballast water treatment standards. The Secretary of Transportation must allow at least 120 days for public comment on proposed regulations and set an effective date at least 30 days after the final regulations are published. Additional regulations may be implemented. The Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 is amended to include a definition of 'treatment method' for ballast water tanks to remove nonindigenous organisms through various approved techniques. SEC. 3. INVASIVE SPECIES AND BALLAST WATER TECHNOLOGIES RESEARCH GRANTS. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other agencies, can award Invasive Species and Ballast Water Technologies Research Grants to study the impact of invasive species in the Great Lakes region and develop technologies to remove them. Grants can be awarded to post-secondary educational institutions in the US. The Secretary of Commerce awards grants to post-secondary educational institutions in the US for research on invasive species and ballast water technologies. Special consideration is given to institutions collaborating with the US shipping industry. Grant funds must be used for activities outlined in the grant. Technologies developed through these grants should be commercially available. $100,000,000 is authorized for this program. $100,000,000 authorized for grants for research on invasive species and ballast water technologies from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2006."
