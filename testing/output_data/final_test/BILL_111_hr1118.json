    "content": "The Act titled \"Health Care Choices for Seniors Act\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that individuals who do not sign up for part A of the Medicare program when signing up for social security benefits will lose such benefits, regardless of their reasons or preferences. Additionally, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 increased health insurance options by authorizing health savings accounts for contributions. Seniors and families can make contributions to health savings accounts, with limits on deductions for income tax purposes. A Medicare beneficiary can only enter into a private contract with a physician if no claim for payment under Medicare will be submitted. The physician must sign an affidavit acknowledging the contract and forgo reimbursement under Medicare for the service provided. To enter into a private contract with a physician, a Medicare beneficiary must forgo reimbursement for the service provided for two years. SEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO ELECT VOUCHER PROGRAM INSTEAD OF MEDICARE PART A ENTITLEMENT. Section 226 of the Social Security Act is amended to allow individuals entitled to Medicare benefits under part A to waive their entitlement and enroll in the Medicare Alternative Voucher Program if they have a health savings account. Individuals entitled to Medicare benefits under part A can waive their entitlement and enroll in the Medicare Alternative Voucher Program if they have a health savings account. This waiver must be made during the initial enrollment period, and those who waive entitlement will not be treated as entitled to benefits under title XVIII for tax purposes. Additionally, individuals who waive entitlement under part A will not be eligible for benefits under part B or D of title XVIII during that period. The Secretary establishes a procedure for individuals to terminate a waiver of entitlement under Medicare during an annual period. Once the waiver is terminated, the individual is treated as entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII. An individual who terminates the waiver cannot make the waiver again. Additionally, the Secretary establishes the Medicare Alternative Voucher Program. The Secretary establishes the Medicare Alternative Voucher Program (voucher program) for individuals who waive entitlement under Medicare. Automatic enrollment occurs for those who waive entitlement, and vouchers are provided based on age cohort. The Medicare Alternative Voucher Program provides vouchers to individuals who waive entitlement under Medicare, with a monthly limit of $200. The vouchers are calculated based on the monthly actuarial rate and age cohort adjustment factor determined by the Secretary. The Medicare Alternative Voucher Program offers vouchers to individuals who opt out of Medicare, with a $200 monthly limit. Vouchers are based on actuarial rates and age cohorts defined by the Secretary. Vouchers can be used for health savings accounts or premium payments. The Medicare Alternative Voucher Program provides vouchers for individuals who opt out of Medicare, with a $200 monthly limit. Vouchers can be used for health savings accounts or premium payments under a high deductible health plan. If an individual terminates the waiver, their enrollment in the voucher program will also be terminated. The Medicare Alternative Voucher Program offers vouchers to individuals opting out of Medicare, with a $200 monthly limit. The program allows contributions to health savings accounts. The amendment to increase the limitation shall take effect six months after the enactment of the Act. The Act applies to individuals eligible for Medicare benefits under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act after the enactment date. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code applies to taxable years ending after the same date. SEC. 4. SUSPENSION OF MEDICARE LATE ENROLLMENT PENALTIES BETWEEN AGES 65 AND 70. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Social Security Act regarding the eligibility for Medicare benefits between ages 65 and 70. It specifies that individuals not entitled to benefits under certain sections will not have certain months counted towards their eligibility if they are between the ages of 65 and 70.
