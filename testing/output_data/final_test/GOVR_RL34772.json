    "content": "The historical efforts to merge the FS and BLM agencies suggest various possibilities, including expanding shared offices and employees through the Service First program. This program allows joint permitting and leasing, reciprocal duties, and co-located facilities. One advantage is its feasibility without needing new laws, but it requires authorization extension and potential legislative support for expansion. The Service First program allows joint permitting and leasing, reciprocal duties, and co-located facilities. One advantage is its feasibility without needing new laws, but it requires authorization extension and potential legislative support for expansion. The potential transfer of agencies like FS to DOI or BLM to USDA could place both agencies under a single Deputy or Under Secretary, simplifying processes for users but also posing challenges with different sets of laws for different permits. The potential transfer of agencies like FS to DOI or BLM to USDA could lead to greater inter-agency coordination and consistency in planning and budgeting. However, such a transfer would require new legislation. The FS accounted for 6% of the FY2007 USDA budget authority and 36% of USDA staff years. The BLM accounted for 14% of the budget authority. A potential transfer of agencies like FS to DOI or BLM to USDA could improve inter-agency coordination and consistency. The transfer would involve no change in legal mandates but could impact land management through increased coordination. Merging the agencies has been proposed, with consequences depending on the nature of the merger. A merger of the FS and the BLM could potentially improve agency performance by eliminating inefficiencies and duplication. This merger would lead to better coordination and consistency in managing federal lands, reducing public confusion and improving service quality. A merger of the FS and the BLM could lead to a common set of laws, policies, and regulations, enhancing service and reducing duplication. It would improve consistency in managing leasable and locatable minerals, eliminating the current situation where two agencies manage different aspects of the same resource on national forests. Proponents believe consolidating federal land management in one agency could result in a greater focus and higher priority for land and resource management. A merger of the FS and the BLM could lead to more effective control and consistent direction in resource management. Proponents argue that consolidating federal land management in one agency would result in a more comprehensive national natural resources policy. The Service First Initiative aims to improve public service and resource management. However, the benefits of coordinated efforts may not necessarily require a merger, as some benefits are already occurring without one. It is uncertain how many additional benefits could come from expanding the Service First Initiative or from a merger. Opponents question the necessity of a merger for achieving these benefits. A potential merger between the FS and the BLM is debated for its impact on agency responsiveness and bureaucracy size. Critics argue that a larger agency could stifle creativity and hinder public service. They suggest focusing on improving current structures rather than pursuing a merger for the sake of creating a larger bureaucracy. The nature of the merger could have significant implications for both institutions and employees. The FS may dominate a combined agency due to its larger size in terms of employees and budget. It administers more land in certain states compared to the BLM. The FS was traditionally more active in timber management, but there has been a shift towards energy production. The agency also had a strong esprit de corps historically. The Forest Service's image has been tarnished by internal conflicts, exemplified by the creation of the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics. This organization represents current and retired employees and is actively involved in litigating FS policies. There are ongoing disputes within the agency regarding national forest management. In contrast, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a history of not receiving much respect, with nicknames like \"Bureau of Large Mistakes\" and \"Bureau of Livestock and Mining.\" The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has faced criticism for its history of not receiving much respect, with nicknames like \"Bureau of Large Mistakes\" and \"Bureau of Livestock and Mining.\" Despite its challenging beginnings, the BLM has built an effective organization for federal land management. A potential merger with the Forest Service (FS) could disrupt programs and require BLM employees to learn new laws, regulations, and procedures. A potential merger between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service (FS) could lead to internal conflicts and morale problems among employees. The merger would require everyone to learn new laws, regulations, and procedures, potentially causing retirements, transfers, and job losses. Despite the agencies becoming less disparate over time, the merger could still be disruptive due to differing views on federal policies and obligations. Creating a new agency through a merger or restructuring could lead to morale issues among employees. It may offer opportunities for shaping the future of natural resource management by allowing newer employees to contribute with their different backgrounds. A new agency could blend differences into a cohesive organization with a common vision, potentially reducing costs by eliminating duplicative personnel and offices. The Carter Administration estimated annual benefits of $100 million from its Department of Natural Resources proposal. The benefits of merging the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) offices include potential annual savings of $100 million, as estimated by the Carter Administration in 1984. The merger could lead to a more efficient and effective management structure for federal lands and resources by eliminating duplicative efforts and creating a cohesive organization with a common vision. A merger of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Forest Service (FS) offices could potentially lead to more efficient management of federal lands and resources. While there may be some short-term implementation costs such as changing signs and selling redundant facilities, the benefits of eliminating duplication and creating a cohesive organization with a common vision could outweigh these costs. A merger of the BLM and FS offices may not necessarily lead to greater efficiency as competition can drive efficiency. The potential competition between the agencies could be used to improve efficiency, but legal and political ramifications could complicate a merger. Merging the FS and BLM may provide few benefits if the competition is eliminated. Merging the FS and BLM offices raises questions about consolidating legal authorities, which could be a challenging task due to the complexity of laws governing each agency. The FS and BLM have different sets of laws and management directions, making a merger complicated. In recent years, congressional management direction has led to the proliferation of designated BLM and FS sites, including national monuments, conservation areas, recreation areas, and more. A consolidation of federal land law could result in two possible outcomes, one being the retention of existing laws. The consolidation of federal land law could result in two outcomes: retaining existing laws with some revisions or completely revising laws to simplify management guidance. Simplifying legislative direction may lead to more agency discretion and potential disputes among interest groups. Differences in federal water rights between national forests and BLM lands could further complicate a merger. Issues may arise regarding federal reserved water rights and jurisdictional complications in merging the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) due to historical reservations and differing legislative authorities. Congressional committees have jurisdiction over BLM and public lands, while Agriculture Committees oversee forest lands and management. The drafting of bills will determine which committee has jurisdiction. The drafting of bills will determine which committee has jurisdiction over public lands legislation or forest management bills. Agency transfers do not always change congressional jurisdiction, and committee jurisdictions can change without changes in the executive branch structure. Jurisdiction over Forest Service funding shifted from the Agriculture Subcommittee to the Interior Subcommittee in 1955. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management were created at different times and are organized differently. The Forest Service is organized around 156 national forests, each with ranger districts for on-the-ground activities. Any merger between the two agencies would involve both the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees. The Forest Service is organized into 156 national forests with ranger districts for on-the-ground activities. The national forests are administered by forest supervisors and organized into nine regional offices. BLM is organized into 12 state offices and lands are administered by field offices and resource areas. The BLM is organized into 12 state offices with field offices reporting to them. The state-based structure allows for direct communication with governors and state delegations, making the BLM more sensitive to state-level issues. However, this may result in less sensitivity to local and national issues. A potential merger could lead to a consistent organizational structure, but the specific structure and terminology used could impact effectiveness. The federal government's exemption from taxation on federal lands has led to compensation programs for counties, such as the FS payment of 25% of gross receipts from timber sales. This program was temporarily replaced by the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. The Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-393) allowed counties to receive payments based on historical receipts, which expired in FY2006 but was extended for one more year in FY2007. If the program expires, payments will revert to the 1908 formula of 25% of gross receipts. Different compensation programs exist based on historical payments, location of lands, and legal authority. For example, states and counties receive varying percentages of mineral receipts from public lands, with Alaska receiving 90%, while other receipts like land or timber sales have different distribution percentages. Counties receive a percentage of grazing receipts from different types of lands, with exceptions for specific areas like Alaska and Nevada. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 also provided payments to certain counties. The federal government compensates counties for tax-exempt federal lands through various programs, including Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Act. Different special land designations receive varying payments, ranging from 0%-50% of receipts. PILT payments are based on a complex formula considering acreage of federal lands and county population. PILT payments are limited by county population and reduced by other compensation programs. Counties have been receiving less than the calculated payments due to insufficient appropriations. The challenge lies in determining fair and consistent compensation for federal lands. Some advocate for guaranteed payments regardless of budget constraints, but this is difficult to achieve. The ongoing reauthorization debate for the Secure Rural Schools legislation faces challenges due to the Budget Act's requirement for offsetting mandatory spending. Proposed solutions include basing payments on a 5- or 10-year rolling average of receipts to reduce fluctuations. Determining \"fair\" compensation is complex due to varying funding mechanisms used by states and local governments. Compensating state and local governments for tax-exempt federal lands is a complex issue, with various compensation systems and rates being considered. The challenge lies in determining fair and consistent compensation that does not under- or overcompensate jurisdictions. Despite the political difficulties, an agency merger could potentially streamline the process without overhauling the current compensation systems. Revising laws for federal multiple-use resource management could impact compensation for state and local governments. The cost of wildland fire management by the FS and DOI has increased significantly, leading to discussions about creating a separate wildland fire management agency. Annual appropriations for wildland fire management have risen to $3.55 billion in FY2008 from $1.09 billion in FY1994-FY1999. The share of the total budget allocated to wildfire management has increased substantially, with wildfire suppression costs accounting for a significant portion of FS discretionary funding since FY2001. Rising wildfire suppression costs are impacting other FS programs, and both agencies have the authority to borrow unobligated funds for emergency wildfire suppression expenditures. Borrowing has had relatively minor impacts on DOI programs. Since FY2000, the Forest Service has had to borrow funds from various accounts due to rising wildfire suppression costs and a smaller Knutson-Vandenberg Fund balance. This has led to borrowing from accounts meant for land purchases, recreation, and wildlife management. Repayment is often made in subsequent appropriations acts. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to insulate agency appropriations from emergency fire suppression funding, as rising borrowings create uncertainty in fund availability. Some suggest creating a separate agency for wildfire management to prevent funding issues. The President proposed moving wildland fire management funding from the BLM budget to DOI Department-wide Programs in the FY2009 budget request. This reflects the current situation where 40% of BLM wildfire funding is transferred to other DOI agencies. About 40% of BLM wildfire funding is transferred to other DOI agencies, which could help preserve funding for other programs. Separating fire management from land and resource management could make coordinating wildfire with resources more difficult, as some ecosystems rely on wildfire for regeneration and habitat. A separate federal wildfire agency may focus more on fire control, drawing attention due to the measurable performance standard of acres burned. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) are addressing wildfire ecological and cost concerns through appropriate management response and wildland fire use practices. These approaches involve treating each wildfire individually and managing naturally occurring wildfires within predetermined areas to provide resource benefits while minimizing threats to people and property. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manage lands for multiple uses and sustained yields without impairing productivity. They sell timber, permit grazing, allow mineral exploration, protect watersheds, manage wildlife habitats, administer recreation, and preserve wilderness areas. Proposals to transfer or merge the agencies have been frequent due to their similar missions, proximity, and separate Cabinet departments. The FS was created in 1905 by Congress transferring forest reserves to USDA and merging them. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have similar missions but have evolved independently since their creation. Proposals to transfer or merge the agencies have been made under multiple presidents, but reorganization attempts have been hindered by Congress. President Reagan proposed a consolidation of lands and personnel between the agencies to improve federal land administration. Proponents and critics have debated the benefits and problems of merging the BLM and the FS. Questions about the nature of the merger and its potential consequences have been raised. Supporters argue that a merger could improve service to the public by creating a single federal resource agency with uniform practices. Critics fear that a merger could lead to a larger, less responsive bureaucracy and stifle creativity and public policy debates. The merger would have significant effects on the institutions, with the FS potentially dominating due to its larger number of employees. The FS may dominate the merger with its larger workforce and budget, historically seen as more active in timber management. However, the BLM has been improving in these areas, bringing their management styles closer together. A merger could be less disruptive now due to changes in timber sales and energy production emphasis. Transfers and adjustments may disrupt programs and morale, while merging varying practices and procedures could be challenging. A merger of federal natural resources management agencies could be challenging due to differing practices and procedures. While lower costs are a common reason for mergers, there may be short-term implementation costs involved. Competition between agencies could drive efficiency, and some efficiencies may already be achieved through existing initiatives. Overall, a merger may provide limited benefits. A merger of federal natural resources management agencies could be challenging due to differing practices and procedures. Consolidating legal authorities governing agency processes and practices would be difficult, with laws needing to be consolidated, extended, or simplified. Jurisdictional issues within Congress could complicate the legal consolidation. Recent questions have been raised about a possible merger of federal natural resources management agencies, particularly due to concerns about wildfire suppression costs impeding federal multiple-use management. One suggested option is creating a separate federal wildfire agency from the existing wildland fire management organizations within the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. This would allow the agencies to focus more on non-fire activities. The USDA Forest Service and DOI Bureau of Land Management are considering creating a separate federal wildfire agency to refocus management efforts on non-fire activities and insulate program budgets from emergency borrowing for wildfire suppression. This would separate wildfire management from other land and resource management, despite its importance in temperate ecosystems. The agencies are developing appropriate management responses to wildfires, ranging from monitoring fires to aggressive suppression based on resource benefits and values at risk. The Forest Service, part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has a historical background starting from federal funding for forestry in 1876. It evolved from providing information to Congress to offering forestry assistance to states and private forestland owners. The Bureau of Forestry was established in 1901. Congress granted the President authority to establish Forest Reserves in 1891. In 1891, Congress granted the President authority to establish forest reserves from public domain lands under DOI jurisdiction. The forest reserves were initially administered by a Division of Forestry in the DOI General Land Office. Gifford Pinchot became chief of the USDA Division of Forestry in 1898 and argued for USDA control over the reserves. Pinchot's influence on federal forestry increased when his friend Theodore Roosevelt became President in 1901. In 1905, Congress enacted the Transfer Act to shift the responsibility for administering the forest reserves to USDA, creating the Forest Service with Gifford Pinchot as the first chief. President Roosevelt expanded the forest reserve acreage to 151 million acres by 1907. Congress limited the President's authority to proclaim additional reserves and renamed them national forests. In 1911, the Weeks Law authorized additions to the National Forest System through the purchase of private lands. The National Forest System has grown to 193 million acres in 44 states, with 25 million acres in the eastern half of the country. Forestry funding began in 1876 and was consolidated under the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee in 1955. Michael Kirwin complained about the loss of his largest agency, the Bureau of Reclamation, and argued for a substitute of comparable size, which led to the Forest Service (FS) being chosen. Concerns were raised about the transfer of FS funding to Interior appropriations, with House Speaker Sam Rayburn clarifying that it was just an administrative realignment. Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Carl Hayden also emphasized that the transfer was not intended to suggest an agency transfer. The National Forest Management dates back to the Organic Administration Act of 1897. In 1897, the Organic Administration Act established national forests for improving and protecting forests, securing water flows, and providing timber for US citizens. The Forest Service focused on fire control and livestock grazing, with authority upheld by the Supreme Court in 1911. Timber sales remained low until after World War II, then increased rapidly in the 1950s. The national forests' sale program was stable from 1960 to 1988 but declined since 1989 due to various factors like water quality protection and wildlife habitat conservation. Recreation activities increased post-World War II and management goals were outlined in the 1897 act and expanded in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, emphasizing outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 directs national forest management for a combination of uses to meet the needs of the American people. It focuses on coordinated resource management for multiple uses without necessarily maximizing dollar returns. The act also emphasizes sustained yield, ensuring high resource outputs without impairing land productivity. Management of the National Forest System is guided by the Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 and the National Forest Management Act of 1976, promoting foresight in using renewable resources and establishing long-range strategic planning for forest conservation. The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976 provides guidance for forest conservation by requiring an Assessment, Program, Presidential Statement of Policy, and Annual Report to monitor and evaluate FS activities. NFMA expanded FS responsibilities to prepare comprehensive land and resource management plans integrated with the RPA planning process. Other FS programs include providing forestry assistance to states and private forest owners, and conducting forestry research authorized in 1928. The Forest Service (FS) first conducted authorized forest studies in the 1870s and enacted the McSweeny-McNary Act in 1928 to ensure timber supplies. The FS also manages lands in the National Forest System, including national grasslands and land utilization projects established under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act for various conservation purposes. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was formed in 1946 by merging two DOI agencies to oversee public domain lands. The emphasis is on conserving resources and protecting public lands, not for industrial or commercial use. Some lands acquired under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act are administered by the FS, while others are managed by the BLM. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was established in 1946 to oversee public domain lands, focusing on conservation and protection. Lands were conveyed to states, railroads, and individuals through grants and sales. The General Land Office managed forest reserves until 1905 when they were transferred to the USDA. The Taylor Grazing Act was passed to address overuse and deteriorating range conditions on public lands. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 established federal management of public domain lands, with a provision for eventual transfer out of federal ownership. Debate arose over whether the Forest Service or Department of Interior should oversee the lands, leading to the creation of the U.S. Grazing Service within the General Land Office. The U.S. Grazing Service, established in 1939, was terminated in 1946 due to political influence from the ranching industry and congressional dissatisfaction. President Harry Truman merged it with the General Land Office to form the Bureau of Land Management in July 1946. Congress granted lands in 1866 for a railroad from Portland, OR, to the California state line. In 1866, Congress granted lands for building a railroad from Portland, OR, to the California state line. The grant included every other square-mile section for 20 miles on each side of the right-of-way. A new company, the Oregon and California (O&C) Railroad, used the grant lands to capitalize the company. The company built the rail line and sold some of the lands, but in 1903, Southern Pacific decided to sell no more land due to rising timber prices. President Roosevelt investigated fraudulent O&C land grant transactions in 1903. In 1908, Congress requested the U.S. Attorney General to enforce compliance with the disposal requirement of O&C land grant lands. A federal court decision in 1913 stated that unsold land could be forfeited. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1915 ruled that Congress could dispose of the grant lands as it saw fit. In 1916, the Chamberlain-Ferris Act was enacted to return remaining lands to federal ownership and direct their administration by the DOI. Tax equivalency payments were made to counties, extended through 1926 by the Stanfield Act. In 1937, Congress enacted the O&C Act to provide for sustained yield of timber managed by DOI. The act directed payments to counties of 50% of timber revenues, with up to 25% for delinquent tax equivalency payments and deficient Stanfield Act payments. The Public Land Law Review Commission and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 led to scattered management authorities. In 1976, Congress enacted the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) to retain public lands in federal ownership for multiple use and sustained yield. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976 determined that disposal of certain parcels of BLM lands would serve the national interest. Despite previous transfers of BLM lands to other federal agencies, the BLM still manages the most land of any federal agency, with 258.2 million acres, 33% of which are in Alaska. The BLM, like the Forest Service, is directed to manage its lands for multiple use and sustained yield. The BLM is directed to manage its lands for multiple use and sustained yield, as outlined in the Multiple Use, Sustained Yield Classification Act of 1964 and FLPMA of 1976. FLPMA established permanent management goals for public lands, emphasizing fair market value unless specified by law. FLPMA, also known as the BLM Organic Act, consolidated management responsibilities of the BLM and amended previous public land laws. It requires resource management planning for public lands, but with less detail compared to national forests under NFMA. Federal forestry began in the Department of Agriculture almost by accident in 1876. In 1876, federal forestry began in the Department of Agriculture after a bill directing a forestry study stalled in the House Committee on Public Lands. Discussions about transferring forest reserves from the Interior Department to Agriculture started in the early 20th century. Despite congressional opposition, the transfer was enacted in 1905. The Wilson Administration proposed transferring the national forests to the Department of the Interior or creating a new conservation department. Efforts to transfer the forests began in 1911 during the Taft Administration, with bills introduced in subsequent Congresses. The Forest Service disputed the need for DOI oversight of national parks and monuments but the National Park Service was established in 1916. In the Harding Administration, there was a second attempt to transfer national forests in Alaska to DOI. President Harding questioned the transfer of national forests in Alaska to the Department of the Interior, possibly influenced by the Teapot Dome scandal. President Hoover later transferred the General Land Office to the Department of Agriculture in 1932 after facing challenges during the Great Depression. The attempt to reorganize federal land management was disapproved in 1933, leading to a debate on transferring the Forest Service to the Department of the Interior under President Roosevelt. Secretary Harold Ickes was at the center of the controversy, which included the transfer of national monuments to the National Park Service and recommendations to create more National Park System units from national forest lands. Despite recommendations in 1936 to transfer the Forest Service to the Interior, disputes and distractions delayed action. During the Truman Administration in 1947, Congress established the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of Government, chaired by ex-President Herbert Hoover. The first Hoover Commission recommended concentrating federal land management in the Department of Agriculture. The Hoover Commission recommended consolidating forest and range management in the Department of Agriculture, but no direct actions were taken on the proposal. The Eisenhower Administration's Advisory Committee also supported this recommendation, stating it could be implemented without separate legislation but would be controversial. The Senate and House Committees recommended consolidating federal forestry functions within the Forest Service despite opposition from DOI and the Bureau of the Budget. President Eisenhower proposed Reorganization Plan No. President Eisenhower proposed Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1959 to transfer certain DOI functions to the Secretary of Agriculture, but decided not to transmit the plan due to differing timber sale practices. Senate Interior Committee Chairman James Murray concurred with the decision, highlighting the lack of coordination among federal timber selling agencies. The Kennedy Administration did not focus much on resource management issues, but the Agriculture and Interior Secretaries proposed greater cooperation in a letter known as the \"Treaty of the Potomac.\" In 1964, Congress established the Public Land Law Review Commission to review management of public domain lands. One recommendation was to transfer the Forest Service to the Department of the Interior. The Public Land Law Review Commission recommended transferring the Forest Service to the Department of the Interior, but no explicit proposal for a merger of the BLM and FS was presented during the Nixon Administration. President Nixon's Advisory Council considered creating a Department of Environment and Natural Resources or a Department of Natural Resources, which would have combined various agencies including the FS, DOI, USDA, Army Corps of Engineers, and others. President Nixon issued Reorganization Plan #3 in 1970, establishing the Environmental Protection Agency. In March 1971, he presented a proposal for a Department of Natural Resources to Congress. Various bills were introduced in the 92nd Congress for a DNR or Natural Resources and Environment department. Hearings were held on the proposals, discussing potential disruptions to agency operations and interest group-agency relationships. Arguments were made for a DNR to facilitate national policy implementation but concerns were raised about stifling policy debates. In 1970, President Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency with Reorganization Plan #3. In 1971, he proposed a Department of Natural Resources to Congress. Various bills were introduced in the 92nd Congress for a DNR or Natural Resources and Environment department. Concerns were raised about stifling policy debates and fragmenting congressional oversight. In 1973, Nixon presented a revised reorganization proposal with a Department of Energy and Natural Resources. Legislation was introduced in the 93rd Congress, but no bills were reported to establish a new department with a natural resource focus. Congress enacted separate major management laws for the BLM and FS in 1976. President Carter announced a reorganization plan on March 1, 1979, to create a Department of Natural Resources from the existing DOI, USDA FS, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The plan aimed to merge the BLM and FS by enacting FLPMA and NFMA, separate major management laws for the two agencies. Congress explicitly retained and amended the separate management functions of the BLM in FLPMA, with substantial differences enacted for BLM management of public lands. The Department of Commerce proposed a reorganization plan to combine the FS, BLM, and the Conservation Division of the U.S. Geological Survey into a National Forest and Land Administration under the Reorganization Act of 1946. However, Members of Congress objected, citing concerns about exceeding presidential authority and potential dilution of FS expertise if merged with the BLM. Congressional hearings were held on President Carter's plan, leading to substantial opposition and concerns about the agency's professionalism. The Reagan Administration proposed a land exchange between the FS and BLM, transferring over 25 million acres of land. Public hearings were held in 1985 to discuss the state-by-state implementation plans for the interchange. Legislation was proposed to adjust the land jurisdictions. The Administration proposed legislation in 1986 to adjust land jurisdictions but faced challenges in getting the proposal introduced. In 1991, a proposal to consolidate departments was made, including DOI, USDA, and Department of Energy into a Department of Natural Resources. President Clinton established the National Performance Review in 1993 to improve government efficiency. The DOI supporting report in 1997 recommended pilot tests for coordinated management areas to improve government efficiency, including joint permitting and leasing programs between FS and BLM under the Service First program. The Service First program authorized reciprocal delegations of authorities between the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to promote customer service and efficiency in managing public lands and national forests. The program was extended and expanded in subsequent appropriations acts. The Service First program, authorized by the Interior appropriations act for FY2006, is set to expire at the end of FY2008. However, there is a lack of data on the nature and extent of Service First projects in agency budget justifications and websites."
