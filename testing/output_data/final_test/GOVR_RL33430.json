    "content": "The increase in air ambulance crashes has raised concerns among aviation safety experts. A study by the NTSB found 55 crashes between 2002 and 2005, a rate not seen since the 1980s. With about 750 helicopters and 150 fixed-wing aircraft in the fleet, one in every 50 helicopter air ambulances has been involved in a crash annually. This high rate is compared to commercial airlines, where if the same proportion of large passenger jets were lost, 90 airliners would crash each year. The NTSB notes a rise in air ambulance accidents, with an increase in flight hours but no centralized database for accurate data. The accident rate for helicopter air ambulances has also increased, but recent figures are not provided. The focus is on helicopter operations, which make up over 80% of the air ambulance fleet. The report focuses on safety data and findings related to helicopter air ambulances, with accident rates estimated at 3.50 accidents per 100,000 flight hours from 1991 to 2004. The estimated overall accident rate for helicopter air ambulances rose to an average of 4.75 accidents per 100,000 flight hours from 1998 onwards, with a slight increase in the fatal accident rate to 1.25 accidents per 100,000 flight hours. The trend in the three-year moving average accident rates shows a steady increase from 1991 through 2003, with a slight reversal in 2004. There has also been a slight rise in the fatal accident rate over the past five years. The data on air ambulance accident rates, particularly since 1998, suggest a concerning safety trend. The estimated accident rates have steadily increased over the past 14 years, with a notable rise since 1998. These rates are higher than many other aviation sectors, raising significant concerns. The accident rates for non-scheduled air taxi operators and air ambulance operators have been concerning. From 1991-2005, non-scheduled air taxi operators had an overall accident rate of 2.52 accidents per 100,000 flight hours and a fatal accident rate of 0.67 fatal accidents per 100,000 flight hours. The increasing accidents and estimated accident rates in air ambulance operations, especially helicopter operations, warrant policy analysis to reduce these numbers. In 1988, the NTSB found that the overall accident rate for commercial emergency medical service helicopter operations was 12.34 per 100,000 flight hours. The fatal accident rate for helicopter air ambulances between 1980 and 1985 was estimated to be about 3 \u00bd times higher than non-scheduled helicopter air taxis and all turbine-powered helicopters. Safety improvements have been made in air ambulance operations since the early 1990s, with lower accident rates observed. Specifically, between 1991 and 1995, the helicopter air ambulance industry had an estimated 1.81 accidents and 0.91 fatal accidents for every 100,000 flight hours. The helicopter air ambulance industry has shown potential for achieving a better safety record than in the past, with accident rates similar to other commercial aviation operations. Despite the inherent risks of air ambulance operations, concerns have been raised about accepting a higher accident rate without taking sufficient steps to reduce accidents. The FAA and industry acknowledge ongoing safety concerns, but critics argue that more action is needed to address the issue. Critics argue that current actions by the FAA and industry to address ongoing safety concerns in the air ambulance industry are inadequate. To improve safety, examining the operational role and management practices of air ambulances may be beneficial. The predominant form of air ambulance service involves helicopter transports of trauma patients, with a history dating back to the early 1970s and proven effectiveness in reducing combat mortality. Civilian air ambulance services began in the early 1970s and have since grown significantly. Studies show that helicopter evacuations for trauma patients can improve chances for recovery and reduce mortality rates. Providing surgical intervention within the \"Golden Hour\" after injury is crucial for survival. Air ambulances, especially helicopters, play a vital role in rapidly transporting patients to trauma centers for effective treatment and advanced life support. Air ambulances, including helicopters and airplanes, play a crucial role in providing advanced life support and transporting critical patients, especially in rural areas lacking specialized medical facilities. They are utilized for on-scene responses, inter-facility transfers, and specialty medical team transports. About 54% of air medical transports are hospital to hospital, 33% are on-scene responses, and 13% include organ and medical supply transports. Air ambulances are essential for emergency evacuation of critical care patients and transporting medical supplies to disaster areas. While some criticize their overuse, there is widespread acceptance of their benefits. The air ambulance community acknowledges that in some cases, their utilization may be unnecessary, but guidelines have been refined to ensure maximum patient benefit. Air ambulance guidelines have been refined over 15 years by the air ambulance community and emergency room physicians. These guidelines provide specific criteria for decision makers and analysts to assess whether to dispatch a flight and allocate resources efficiently. Despite being costly on a single-case basis, air medical transport is cost-effective on a system-wide basis due to efficient coverage of large areas and reduced patient transport times. Overall, air ambulance services have broad community and medical support for improving access to critical healthcare. The civilian air ambulance industry has seen steady growth in the United States, especially in rural areas where access to specialized healthcare is limited. Safety concerns have been raised due to this growth, with the industry tracing its origins back to the early 1970s. The air ambulance industry saw significant growth starting in the 1970s with the first hospital-based medical helicopter service in Denver, Colorado. By 2000, there were 231 helicopter emergency services flying 400 helicopters. Factors like Medicare reimbursement rates and declines in rural healthcare services have fueled industry growth. The air ambulance industry has experienced significant growth in the past five years, with an 88% increase in the number of helicopter air ambulances in the United States since 2000. There were also around 150 fixed-wing airplanes dedicated to air ambulance operations in 2005. The industry has been growing at a rate of about 4.5% per year over the past 15 years, and this growth is expected to continue. Most air ambulance services are privately owned and operated. Air ambulance services in the United States are mainly privately operated, with some government-operated aircraft providing about 10% of services. The industry has seen significant growth in recent years, with a large majority of services being provided by private operators. Private air ambulance services in the United States are regulated by the FAA and have been the focus of safety studies. These providers may operate under direct contracts with hospitals or independently with affiliations to multiple hospitals. Regulatory changes in the late 1990s required separate billing for ambulance services and increased Medicare reimbursement for air ambulance flights. The reimbursement for air ambulance flights in the US brought significant changes to the industry, with many services now operated by private entities with hospital affiliations. While some states provide air ambulance services, privately-run operations are more common. For example, the Maryland State Police Aviation Command is funded by automobile registration fees and state treasury funding. The privately-operated air ambulance model bills patients directly for transport and medical costs, unlike state-funded services. Critics argue that financial pressures and lack of oversight may impact flight safety. Competition and financial challenges were noted in a 1988 NTSB examination of air ambulance helicopter safety. In the 1980s, air ambulances were mainly used as a marketing tool by hospitals to attract patients. However, the current competition is more focused on the flight mission, with private-sector air ambulance services marketing directly to hospitals, emergency officials, and the general public. This shift in business model includes selling yearly \"memberships\" to the public. Various competitive pressures in the air ambulance industry, such as direct competition and the desire to satisfy hospital and emergency medical service administrators, can potentially impact flight safety. Operating air ambulances as private businesses may create financial pressures that could compromise safety measures. These operational pressures and their potential impact on safety will be further examined in relation to air ambulance crashes. Air ambulance accidents are often caused by pilot decision-making, flight conditions like darkness and terrain, and lack of situational awareness regarding weather and terrain. A study analyzed 120 helicopter air ambulance accidents between 1991 and 2004, categorizing causal factors based on accident circumstances and weather conditions. The analysis of helicopter air ambulance accidents from 1991-2004 showed that 80% of accidents were influenced by the interaction between pilots and environmental factors like weather and terrain. The most common causal factors were controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and aeronautical decision making/situation awareness (ADM/SA), each cited in 27.5% of accidents. Pilot decision making, specifically continuing VFR into IMC, was a significant factor in helicopter air ambulance crashes, accounting for 9% of incidents. Other pilot-related factors included loss of aircraft control, pilot technique, and visual illusions, often occurring in poor visibility conditions. The NTSB's safety recommendations for air ambulance operations focus on flight operational factors and pilot situation awareness of weather conditions, particularly the lack of formal flight dispatch procedures among operators. Air ambulance pilots often rely on emergency dispatchers for information. In response to NTSB recommendations, policymakers may consider implementing formal flight dispatch procedures and training for air ambulance operators and emergency communication specialists to improve safety in air ambulance missions. In the emergency medical field, mission pressures can lead to poor judgment among air ambulance pilots. Lack of on-site supervision and isolation from management forces pilots to seek guidance from other sources, potentially compromising flight safety. The NTSB found that mission pressures in the medical field can compromise flight safety, as hospital management and EMS personnel may pressure pilots to fly in marginal weather conditions to complete missions. Additionally, the relationship between air ambulance operators and hospitals can influence decisions to accept or continue missions in unsafe conditions to maintain good business relations. The relationship between air ambulance operators and hospitals can influence decisions to accept or continue missions in unsafe conditions to maintain good business relations. Pilots may feel pressured to speed up response time, potentially compromising mission safety by missing important risk factors during flight preparation. Policymakers may need to consider options to address these pressures. Policymakers may need to require specific training and risk management techniques for air ambulance operators to mitigate accidents related to poor judgment and decision-making errors. Training in aeronautical decision making specific to air ambulance operations could help address external pressures that may affect pilot judgment. The FAA recommends helicopter air ambulance operators to implement formal operational risk assessment programs for evaluating flight safety and risk for every mission. This includes empowering pilots to make final decisions on mission assignments, using formal risk assessment tools, and implementing risk mitigation plans. Factors considered in pre-flight risk assessments include weather conditions, terrain, pilot qualifications, maintenance issues, and aircraft performance. The FAA recommends helicopter air ambulance operators to implement formal operational risk assessment programs for evaluating flight safety and risk for every mission. This includes empowering pilots to make final decisions on mission assignments, using formal risk assessment tools, and implementing risk mitigation plans. Factors considered in pre-flight risk assessments include weather conditions, terrain, pilot qualifications, maintenance issues, and aircraft performance. The NTSB has recommended that these flight risk evaluation programs be made mandatory for all air ambulance operators, and require formal training in the risk evaluation process for all employees directly involved in flight missions, not just pilots. Conditions in the Flight Environment include night, weather, and obstructions. The FAA recommends helicopter air ambulance operators to implement formal operational risk assessment programs for evaluating flight safety and risk for every mission. Factors considered in pre-flight risk assessments include weather conditions, terrain, pilot qualifications, maintenance issues, and aircraft performance. Night, weather, obstructions, and mountainous terrain have been found to play a role in helicopter air ambulance accidents. Air ambulance operators are not required to equip their aircraft with instruments for situation awareness or special equipment for visibility in poor weather conditions. The NTSB has recommended mandatory implementation of flight risk evaluation programs for all air ambulance operators. Based on a 2006 special study, the FAA should mandate terrain warning systems on air ambulances to prevent mechanical failures and maintenance-related crashes. Approximately 22% of helicopter air ambulance accidents were linked to mechanical issues, with engine failures accounting for 50% of these incidents. Maintenance of air ambulances poses a significant safety risk, with 13% of accidents attributed to the main rotor drive, 13% to the tailrotor system, and another 13% to faulty flight controls. While current efforts focus on flight operations and pilot performance, policymakers should also consider examining maintenance practices to reduce maintenance-related accidents. Options for improving air ambulance safety include changes to regulatory standards, oversight, system safety principles, additional training for flight and medical crews, and the use of technology to enhance pilot visibility. Concerns have been raised about the FAA's oversight of air ambulance operators, with critics suggesting that the agency has not kept up with the industry's rapid growth and has been lax in inspecting new operators and bases. The FAA has faced criticism for its slow regulation of air ambulance operators, with concerns about safety oversight and lack of specific recommendations for regulatory changes. Special guidance and inspections have been implemented to review training and procedures for helicopter air ambulance operators. The FAA has implemented an inspection program for air ambulance operators to focus on policies, procedures, training, communications, and management of flight operations with the goal of improving safety culture and preventing accidents. Inspectors will look for improvements in pilot training for low visibility conditions, cockpit instrument reliance, and recovery from unusual aircraft attitudes. Operators are expected to implement procedures like pre-flight assessments of obstacles and terrain considerations. The NTSB found that air ambulance operators may operate under less stringent regulations when patients are not on board, leading to accidents in 35 out of 55 cases studied. This lack of regulations includes no set minimum requirements for in-flight visibility and no regulations for flight and duty time for pilots. The NTSB found that air ambulance operators may operate under less stringent regulations when patients are not on board, leading to accidents in 35 out of 55 cases studied. In 10 of these accidents, flights were conducted in weather conditions that did not meet the minimum requirements for operation under stricter commercial regulations required for flights with patients on board. The NTSB recommended that the FAA require air ambulance operators to comply with more stringent commercial flight regulations whenever medical personnel are on board, as they currently do when carrying patients. The lack of specific duty time regulations for flights without patients also impacts operations with patients on board. Flights without patients are not counted in a pilot's duty time totals, potentially leading to pilot fatigue and safety issues during subsequent flights with patients. Current regulations do not require considering flights without patients in compliance with industry-specific flight time and rest time requirements for helicopter air ambulance pilots. Policy makers may need to find alternative approaches to limit pilot duty times accurately reflecting actual flight time logged, regardless of whether patients are onboard or not. Addressing concerns over pilot fatigue in air ambulance operators is crucial due to the combination of stress, rotating shift work, and minimal flight crew staffing levels. While fatigue may not be identified as a direct cause in many accidents, it is difficult to substantiate its presence post-accident. In the EMS helicopter industry, pilot fatigue has been suggested as a primary cause of accidents. Notable changes in regulations have not occurred since the NTSB highlighted pilot fatigue as a concern in 1988. Preventing pilot fatigue remains a significant objective for improving safety in air ambulance operations. Policymakers may need to consider changes in pilot duty time and flight time regulations to address concerns over fatigue's potential role in flight safety. Specific regulations on flight time and rest requirements may need separate examination from other commercial operating regulations. Air ambulance operators are concerned that existing commercial flight regulations may limit their ability to accept missions in reduced visibility due to weather reporting requirements. Specific exemptions or separate requirements may be needed for air ambulance operations to work around this issue. While commercial flight regulations may not fully address safety concerns in air ambulance operations, tailoring regulations to specific needs is crucial. Maintenance oversight is also lacking, with maintenance issues contributing to a significant portion of air ambulance accidents. Air ambulance accidents are often caused by mechanical or maintenance issues, with inadequate maintenance being a significant factor. While aviation safety experts focus on flight operational safety, there is a lack of specific attention to air ambulance maintenance practices. Additional oversight and scrutiny of maintenance practices could help prevent maintenance-related incidents and accidents. Improving aircraft crashworthiness is also crucial for enhancing safety in air ambulance operations. Improving Aircraft Crashworthiness is a crucial regulatory issue for air ambulance safety. A study found that main cabin occupants of air ambulance helicopters have a higher risk of death or serious injury compared to other helicopters, likely due to cabin design modifications. Lighter weight air ambulance helicopters have greater risks in crashes with post-crash fires, occupants not wearing shoulder harnesses, and mechanical-related crashes. Larger helicopters also have distinctions in crash risks between air ambulances and other aircraft. The study concluded that improving crashworthiness in air ambulance operations could significantly enhance occupant survivability and reduce crash-related injuries. It also suggested the use of energy-absorbing seats, lap and double-shoulder harnesses, and helmets to mitigate serious and fatal head injuries. The shift towards smaller, lighter-weight helicopters by autonomous private operators may have implications on safety. Improving crashworthiness in air ambulance operations through design modifications and equipment standards could reduce the risk of serious and fatal head injuries in crashes. Policymakers may need to consider specific guidance for seats, seatbelts, and interior design, as well as operational requirements for shoulder harnesses and helmets. Balancing protective measures for flight and medical crews with patient care and mission functions is crucial. Training and practicing safety principles within the air ambulance industry are of interest, despite existing guidance from the FAA and industry organizations. The air ambulance industry is working on improving safety practices, with initiatives like \"Vision Zero\" aiming to reduce accidents by 80% in the next decade. While efforts show a commitment to safety, some argue that voluntary measures may not be enough. The NTSB argues that voluntary safety measures in the air ambulance industry may not be sufficient, advocating for mandatory safety-related changes like formal dispatch procedures and risk management practices. Policymakers will need to weigh the safety benefits against the costs of implementation. The NTSB's study found that a formal risk evaluation process could have prevented accidents, but most operators have not implemented it despite FAA guidelines. The FAA has issued guidelines for implementing risk assessment programs for helicopter air ambulance operations, but they are not mandatory. The NTSB recommended that the FAA require all air ambulance operators to develop and implement flight risk evaluation programs. In the airline industry, initiatives like FOQA programs collect and analyze safety-related operational data to improve safety measures. The Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) allows airline employees to confidentially report safety concerns to the FAA with protections against negative consequences, aiming to preemptively identify and correct unsafe operations. While comprehensive programs may be complex for the air ambulance industry, policymakers may consider implementing similar initiatives. In 2000, the air ambulance industry proposed training for crew resource management (CRM) to the FAA, similar to what airline crews receive. However, this proposal has not led to any FAA recommendations or regulations. Currently, there are no specific training requirements for air ambulance pilots on CRM, risk management, or aeronautical decision making. The general requirements for commercial pilot certification and ratings do not adequately cover topics like aeronautical decision making, especially in the context of air ambulance operations. Training on operational risks unique to air ambulances is at the discretion of the operator, with no industry standard for content or objectives. The NTSB found that many air ambulance pilots lacked current instrument proficiency, which could lead to dangerous situations. Training programs varied in the industry, with some not adequately preparing pilots for real-world conditions. The NTSB recommended incorporating supplemental training material on aeronautical decision making into pilot training programs to address real-world conditions. They also suggested revising guidelines for FAA inspectors to ensure adequate instruction on poor weather operations and accident scene procedures. The FAA targeted inspection program for helicopter air ambulance operators aims to address these concerns, highlighting the importance of ongoing FAA inspections in oversight. Additionally, there is a focus on providing aviation-specific training to all members of the air ambulance team. The FAA has suggested special training for ground communications specialists in air ambulance operations, covering aviation weather and flight tracking procedures. Unlike airlines, air ambulance pilots are typically dispatched by EMS dispatchers without formal aviation training. The NTSB recommends implementing formal flight dispatch procedures with dedicated aviation dispatchers to assist pilots in assessing weather data and making informed decisions. The NTSB recommends implementing formal flight dispatch procedures with dedicated aviation dispatchers to assist pilots in making informed decisions. Policymakers need to determine the feasibility of requiring dedicated flight dispatchers in the air ambulance environment and evaluate training options for emergency medical communication specialists. Various technologies are available to improve visibility and pilot situation awareness of terrain, obstacles, and weather for air ambulance missions. Some operators have concerns over the cost and suitability of these systems if made mandatory. The NTSB recommends equipping all helicopters and aircraft used in emergency medical services with terrain awareness and warning systems. The NTSB recommends equipping helicopters and aircraft used in emergency medical services with terrain awareness and warning systems (TAWS) for terrain avoidance. TAWS-A uses detailed terrain databases, GPS data, and radio altimeters for height above terrain information, required on commercially operated aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats. TAWS-B, a less sophisticated version without radio altimeter inputs, is required on turbojets and turboprops with six or more passenger seats, costing between $10,000 and $30,000 per aircraft. The NTSB recommends installing TAWS on air ambulances to prevent controlled flight into terrain accidents. Operators are concerned about potential distractions from false alarms generated by TAWS systems. The NTSB recommends installing TAWS on air ambulances to prevent controlled flight into terrain accidents. Concerns about false alarms distracting pilots exist, but the benefits of TAWS in improving pilot awareness of terrain outweigh the negatives. Further testing in simulated air ambulance missions may be necessary to fully assess TAWS suitability in helicopter operations. Technologies like night vision imaging systems (NVIS) can improve pilot visibility in low visibility conditions and at night, reducing the risk of accidents caused by reduced visibility. Night vision goggles (NVGs) are an example of NVIS technology that enhances a pilot's view of the outside scene to avoid terrain and obstacles. The FAA has approved the use of night vision goggles (NVGs) to enhance safety and reduce pilot workload during night flights. However, most operators do not use NVGs due to cost and limited effectiveness in densely populated areas with ambient light. The NTSB found that NVGs could have prevented some accidents but did not formally recommend their usage. Other imaging systems are also available for aviation use. Other imaging systems like FLIR and EVS are available for aviation use, providing enhanced images for night and low visibility scenes. EVS systems, certified by the FAA, use infrared cameras to improve visibility in instrument flight operations, especially for air ambulance operations flying into unprepared landing sites. The FAA has approved synthetic vision systems (SVS) for operational use in aviation. SVS relies on precise GPS positioning and accurate terrain databases to provide pilots with computer-generated images of known terrain features and obstacles. This technology can be overlaid on navigational instruments or projected on a head-up display for improved situational awareness during flight. SVS, along with accurate positioning information, can enhance helicopter air ambulance pilots' navigation and terrain avoidance in low visibility conditions. EVS and SVS imaging combinations are being tested and certified to improve cockpit situation awareness for air ambulance operations."
