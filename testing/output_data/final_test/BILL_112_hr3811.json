    "content": "The Act titled \"Keystone For a Secure Tomorrow Act\" aims to expedite the completion of the Keystone XL pipeline for the delivery of oil from Alberta, Canada to domestic markets in the United States, citing it as in the national interest. The permit for the Keystone XL pipeline project, filed in 2008, has been approved. The permit requires compliance with all relevant laws and codes for construction and operation, as well as measures to prevent environmental impact. The approved permit for the Keystone XL pipeline project mandates compliance with laws to prevent environmental impact and historic property disruption during construction and operation. The final environmental impact statement from August 26, 2011, fulfills requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Any modifications to the plan do not necessitate additional environmental review. The construction, operation, and maintenance of the facilities for the Keystone XL pipeline project must adhere to the Construction Mitigation and Reclamation Plan in the final environmental impact statement issued by the Secretary of State on August 26, 2011, with any modifications specified in subsection (d). Special conditions agreed upon by the permittee must also be followed. The Keystone XL pipeline project must adhere to special conditions agreed upon with the Administrator of the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Governor of Nebraska for specific regions, as outlined in appendices U, H, and S of the final environmental impact statement. The permit approved under subsection (a) for the Keystone XL pipeline requires reconsideration of routing within Nebraska, a review period for potential route alterations, and coordination with the President and Nebraska for necessary data and technical assistance. If the President does not approve the route within Nebraska submitted by the Governor within 10 days, it will be considered approved by law. This section does not affect existing processes for securing access from private property owners for the Keystone XL pipeline."
