    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Black Rock Desert-High Rock Canyon Emigrant Trails National Conservation Area Act of 2000\". Key findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that the Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon areas in northwestern Nevada contain the last untouched segments of the historic California emigrant Trails, offering a unique opportunity to experience emigrant conditions in an unaltered setting for present and future generations. The Black Rock Desert and High Rock Canyon areas in Nevada contain a diverse range of land forms and wildlife, including golden eagles, sage grouse, mule deer, and bighorn sheep. The region also holds cultural and natural resources eligible for National Historic Landmark status, such as the John Charles Fremont exploration route and early homesteading sites. The Black Rock-High Rock region in Nevada contains archeological, paleontological, and geographical resources including Native American sites, wooly mammoth sites, natural potholes, and a dry Pleistocene lakebed. The conservation area offers solitude and protects historic emigrant trails. Public lands have been used for livestock grazing for over a century, benefiting community stability and the local economy. The Black Rock Desert playa is a unique natural resource that attracts visitors to the conservation area, including those attending large-scale events. Grazing on the lands will continue in accordance with the management plan and regulations. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term ``Secretary'' refers to the Secretary of the Interior.
