The global economy's complexities make policymaking challenging, and Congress plays a crucial role in legislating and overseeing international commerce. The focus of the previous 115th Congress was overseeing the Trump Administration's trade policy, which represented a significant departure from past approaches. The Trump Administration's approach to international trade diverges from past administrations by questioning the benefits of U.S. leadership in global trade and expressing concerns over sovereignty limits. Key actions include withdrawing from the TPP, imposing trade restrictions, renegotiating NAFTA, modifying KORUS FTA provisions, and reviewing U.S. participation in the WTO. Congress is also addressing legislation to strengthen the review process for foreign investment transactions. The Trump Administration has taken a critical view of U.S. trade agreements, focused on bilateral trade balances, and emphasized \"fair\" and \"reciprocal\" trade. China has also been a key focus in international trade discussions. The Trump Administration has emphasized \"fair\" and \"reciprocal\" trade, particularly with China, addressing concerns over intellectual property and technology transfer. The President imposed unilateral trade restrictions on U.S. imports, sparking debate among Members of Congress on the economic implications and risks to the international trading system. Some Members introduced bills to amend the President's trade authorities. The implications of changes in the U.S. trade landscape for the 116th Congress will depend on factors like the impact of increased tariffs on U.S. industries, firms, and workers, as well as the reaction of trading partners. Congress will likely examine the U.S.-China trade relationship, including China's Belt and Road Initiative and industrial practices. The 116th Congress may need to address legislative and policy questions related to U.S. trade agreements, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, constitutional authority over tariffs, modernizing past FTAs, negotiating new FTAs with key partners, and the impact of FTAs excluding the United States. These issues are crucial in the evolving global economic landscape. The 116th Congress may need to address legislative and policy questions related to U.S. trade agreements, including the impact of FTAs excluding the United States. The role of the United States in the multilateral trading system under the WTO is also a major issue, with debates on updating WTO rules to reflect current realities such as global supply chains and technology advancements. The report provides an overview of international trade and finance, highlighting the global economic recovery in 2017. The IMF estimates a rise in real global GDP from 3.3% to 3.7%, with advanced economies growing at 2.3% and emerging markets at 4.7%. In 2017, major U.S. trading partners had varying growth performances, impacting trade relations and exchange rates. Canada's GDP growth doubled to 3.1%, China grew at 6.9%, while India and Mexico saw lower growth. IMF forecasts show improved short-term growth for advanced economies at 2.1% in 2019 and 4.7% for emerging markets. However, growth is expected to slow in the medium term as output gaps close. Global financial conditions are expected to remain accommodative, with rates falling below pre-recession levels. Aging populations and shrinking labor forces in advanced economies will hinder expansion. Fiscal policy will shift from expansionary to contractionary by 2020. Emerging markets face vulnerabilities due to trade uncertainties, depreciating currencies, and volatile equity markets. Political and policy uncertainty could also constrain economic growth. In Argentina, Brazil, Pakistan, Turkey, and South Africa, political and policy uncertainties may hinder economic growth. China is expected to see slower growth as it shifts towards private consumption. Venezuela's economy has collapsed with hyperinflation. Declining commodity prices could destabilize national incomes in emerging markets. These factors could impact global financial markets and U.S. banks. The United States remains a strong economic force, accounting for a significant portion of global output, exports, and growth. The economy grew faster in 2017, with forecasts indicating continued strong performance in 2018. However, there are concerns that growth may slow down by 2019 due to higher commodity prices. Forecasts suggest that U.S. growth may plateau in 2019 due to various factors such as higher commodity prices, inflationary pressures, Fed tightening, trade uncertainties, and global risks. The labor market indicates near full employment, with the jobless rate projected to fall below 4.0% in 2018. The decline in oil prices impacts both the global and U.S. economy, with potential positive effects on consumer incomes and industry competitiveness, offset by employment and investment reductions in the energy sector. Despite projections for trade growth in 2018 and 2019, there are downside risks including escalating trade tensions between major economies. The IMF and WTO expect global trade growth to slow due to rising trade tensions between major economies like the United States and China. Restrictive trade policy measures are affecting trade flows and prices in targeted sectors, leading to concerns over disruptions to supply chains and potential increases in trade restrictions. The OECD projects that further trade tensions could have adverse effects on global investment and jobs, while exchange rates are experiencing volatility with some currencies depreciating against the U.S. dollar. The IMF and WTO predict a slowdown in global trade growth due to rising tensions between major economies like the US and China. This has led to volatile currency markets, with currencies like the Chinese renminbi, Argentine peso, Turkish lira, and South African rand depreciating against the US dollar. Uncertainties in global financial markets could complicate the US Federal Reserve's efforts to tighten monetary policy, while other major economies may pursue unconventional monetary policies. This could put upward pressure on the US dollar as investors seek safe-haven currencies. Some economies may face debt issues and potential economic crises due to volatile currencies and low commodity prices. The US Constitution gives Congress authority over foreign trade. The US Constitution assigns authority over foreign trade to Congress, granting them the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Congressional trade debates in the 19th century often revolved around tariff rates, with northern manufacturing regions advocating for high tariffs and southern raw material exporting regions pushing for low tariffs. The passage of the highly protective \"Smoot-Hawley\" Tariff Act of 1930 marked a significant shift in US trade policy, leading to a decline in world trade and worsening the impact of the Great Depression. Since then, Congress has continued to play a key role in shaping US trade policy. Since the Tariff Act of 1930, Congress has delegated trade authority to the executive branch. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to reduce tariffs through pre-approved agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 aimed to open markets and establish international trade norms. Congressional approval is required for changes in nontariff barriers in trade agreements. The Act has been renewed or amended five times, including granting \"fast-track\" trade negotiating authority. Since 1974, Congress has renewed the Act five times, granting \"fast-track\" trade negotiating authority, now known as trade promotion authority (TPA). Congress also oversees trade policy, including laws on trade programs, unfair practices, tariffs, and import/export policies. Various trade laws delegate authorities to the President for national security purposes. The Trump Administration is using trade acts to impose tariffs on steel, aluminum, vehicles, auto parts, and Chinese products for national security and unfair trade practices. Some Members of Congress oppose these tariffs and may seek to revisit or curtail these statutes. Congress plays a role in international investment and finance policy by considering bilateral investment treaties and setting the level of U.S. involvement. Congress plays a crucial role in international investment and finance policy by considering bilateral investment treaties, setting U.S. financial commitments to multilateral development banks, funding trade agencies, and overseeing institutions like the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. Trade Promotion Authority is a key tool for Congress to assert its constitutional authority over trade policy. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is a means for Congress to assert its authority over trade policy and agreements. TPA, signed into law in 2015, allows for expedited consideration of implementing bills for trade agreements, with limited debate and no amendments. The President must meet certain obligations, including achieving progress in meeting U.S. trade policy objectives and consulting with Congress throughout the negotiation process. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was enacted in the Trade Act of 1974 and has been renewed or amended five times since. TPA allows for expedited consideration of implementing legislation for trade agreements, preserving Congress's role while enhancing the executive branch's negotiating credibility. Congress may use TPA to consider agreements like the USMCA in 2019. The United States has been a driving force in breaking down trade barriers and promoting open global trading systems through various international agreements. Despite recognizing the benefits of reducing barriers to trade, there are challenges presented by globalization, impacting consumers, workers, firms, and industries in the US. Globalization has brought benefits to many in the United States, with lower prices and a wider variety of goods for consumers, and opportunities for industries to focus on their strengths and innovate. However, some argue that globalization has led to job losses, stagnant wages, and income inequality, raising concerns about its inclusivity and impact on the economy. Some policymakers perceive growing U.S. trade deficits as evidence of \"uneven\" trade with other nations. Existing global trade rules are seen as outdated in the 21st century, especially regarding technological advances and national security threats. The 2008-2009 financial crisis exacerbated concerns about U.S. trade policy and led to increased domestic nationalism. Members of Congress aim to achieve a \"level playing field\" for U.S. industries and workers. Members of Congress have the unique authority to influence U.S. trade policy to support industries, workers, and the country's standard of living. Policy debates often focus on the impact of trade on U.S. jobs, with economists emphasizing that macroeconomic forces like technology and demographics play a significant role in shaping trade and foreign investment. In the United States, trade and foreign investment relationships are shaped by economic activities, with jobs constantly being created and replaced. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that exports support 10.7 million jobs in the economy, with higher wages in export-intensive manufacturing industries. Trade liberalization can impact workers and firms differently within the same industry. Workers who switch jobs due to trade liberalization may see reduced wages, especially in routine task occupations exposed to imports from low-income countries. On the other hand, occupations linked to exports may experience rising incomes. Congress established Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) to address the varying effects of trade liberalization on workers and firms. The U.S. trade deficit, influenced by trade liberalization, has been a focus of Congressional interest, particularly under the Trump Administration. The deficit is used as a measure of success or failure in international trade, trade policy, and trade agreements. It is seen as a significant factor affecting the U.S. economy, including unemployment rates and slow economic growth. The U.S. trade deficit is often blamed for economic issues like unemployment and slow wage growth, but some economists argue that it is more a result of macroeconomic policies and savings-investment imbalances. Addressing underlying macroeconomic issues is seen as crucial to effectively tackling the trade deficit and avoiding economic distortions. The U.S. trade deficit is often blamed for economic issues like unemployment and slow wage growth, but some economists argue that it is more a result of macroeconomic policies and savings-investment imbalances. U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) are negotiated based on U.S. trade objectives established by Congress. FTAs have evolved in scope and depth since the 1980s, starting with the bilateral FTA with Israel focused on tariff elimination. The United States has pursued comprehensive trade agreements focused on eliminating tariffs, starting with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. These agreements include provisions on market access, rules of origin, intellectual property rights, foreign investment, and dispute resolution. Core provisions in most U.S. FTAs involve tariff elimination, nontariff barriers, rules of origin, and commitments on services. The United States has pursued trade agreements focused on eliminating tariffs, starting with NAFTA in 1994. Core provisions in most U.S. FTAs involve tariff elimination, nontariff barriers, rules of origin, and commitments on services, national treatment, IPR protection, foreign investment, labor and environmental provisions, government procurement, and dispute settlement. The core provisions of U.S. FTAs include tariff elimination, nontariff barriers, rules of origin, services, IPR protection, government procurement, and dispute settlement mechanisms. FTAs must be ratified by the governments involved, with Congress needing to approve them in the United States. Congress evaluates the economic impact and adherence to set objectives before voting on an agreement. The Trump Administration used quotas and quota-like arrangements in 2018 to achieve trade objectives, raising concerns about a shift towards managed trade. This approach involves government efforts to set specific market shares or targets through quantitative restrictions on trade. The Trump Administration used quotas and quota-like arrangements in 2018 to achieve trade objectives, raising concerns about a shift towards managed trade. This approach involves setting specific market shares or targets through quantitative restrictions on trade. The 116th Congress may wish to examine the Administration's adoption of managed trade policies, their effectiveness, and impact on U.S. and international trade. Advocates believe these policies can ensure fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade, while critics view them as protectionist and harmful to the economy. Many economists question their efficacy. Many economists question the efficacy of prodding U.S. trading partners into negotiating quotas or numerical targets, as well as the state's ability to efficiently allocate resources. Policies restricting U.S. imports and boosting exports may not reduce the trade deficit, driven by macroeconomic factors like low savings. Moving towards a system based on numerical outcomes could lead to trade restrictions, retaliation, higher prices, and lower global economic growth. The rapid growth of digital technologies has created new opportunities and challenges in international trade. Consumers now access e-commerce, social media, and telemedicine, while businesses use advanced technology to reach new markets and analyze big data. Recent international negotiations aim to improve market access for digital goods and services and address concerns like cybersecurity and privacy protection. Digital trade barriers, including tariffs, export controls, nontariff barriers, internet sovereignty, data localization requirements, technology transfer, and cybersecurity issues, hinder market access for firms in foreign countries. These barriers restrict what companies can offer and how they can operate, raising costs and risks for foreign firms. Cybersecurity issues like intellectual property infringement, trade secret theft, economic espionage, and national security concerns are key considerations for the 116th Congress regarding technology and trade. This includes discussions on the USMCA, e-commerce negotiations at the WTO, online privacy policies, and trade relations with China. U.S. officials emphasize the importance of economic interests in national security strategy, incorporating concepts like \"geoeconomics\" and \"economic statecraft.\" In recent years, a combination of domestic and international forces are challenging the U.S. leadership role in ways that are unprecedented in the post-World War II era. China's economic competition for leading-edge technologies poses a threat to U.S. national security interests. The Trump Administration has integrated trade and economic relationships with national security, defense, and foreign policy objectives in its national security strategy. The Trump Administration has integrated trade and economic relationships with national security, defense, and foreign policy objectives in a confrontational and unilateral manner. There is a view that the United States lacks a holistic approach for addressing economic challenges in relation to national security, leading to the introduction of the National Economic Security Strategy Act of 2018. The 116th Congress may introduce legislation to optimize Federal policies for the competitiveness, prosperity, and security of the United States. Policy debates may include unilateral tariffs, U.S.-China trade relations, USMCA implementation, and bilateral trade negotiations with the EU, Japan, and the UK. The 116th Congress may address concerns over international trade and finance, including trading partner trade practices, the U.S. trade deficit, and negative effects of U.S. imports. The Trump Administration has imposed increased tariffs on various imports under different trade laws, allowing presidential action to address specific concerns. Congress has delegated aspects of its authority to regulate foreign commerce to the President through these laws. The Trump Administration has imposed increased tariffs on imports, totaling $282 billion in 2017. Additional tariffs are in effect, with the prospect of more on $267 billion of imports from China and $361 billion of auto imports. These tariffs benefit U.S. producers but increase costs for consumers and downstream users. Trading partners have initiated WTO dispute settlement proceedings and imposed retaliatory tariffs in response. Partners have initiated WTO dispute settlement proceedings and imposed retaliatory tariffs on $126 billion of annual U.S. exports in 2017, causing export declines in targeted industries. Congressional concerns over potential negative economic implications, seeking exclusions to tariffs, and adherence to trade laws. The 115th Congress held hearings on tariff effects, with Members introducing legislation altering the President's authorities. The issue may see further debate in the 116th Congress. Sections 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 address \"unfair\" foreign barriers to U.S. exports, particularly concerning China's policies. The Trump Administration launched a \"Section 301\" investigation in August 2017 due to concerns over China's policies on intellectual property, technology, and innovation. President Trump signed a memorandum justifying U.S. action against China under Section 301 in March 2018. The Administration focused on Chinese policies that force technology transfers, unfair technology licensing practices, investments and acquisitions leading to technology transfer, and cyber intrusions into U.S. computer networks. On June 15, the U.S. Trade Representative announced a plan to impose 25% ad valorem tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. The U.S. Trade Representative announced a plan to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. China retaliated with its own plan. President Trump directed the USTR to propose tariffs on $200 billion worth of products. Tariffs went into effect on July 6 and August 23. Additional tariffs were imposed on Chinese imports, prompting China to raise tariffs on U.S. imports. At the conclusion of the December 2018 G-20 summit in Argentina, Presidents Trump and Xi agreed to negotiate \"structural changes\" on IP, technology, and agriculture services within 90 days. China agreed to make substantial purchases of U.S. products, leading to a suspension of planned tariff rate increases by President Trump. China also agreed to purchase 1.13 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans. While some policymakers and business representatives support the Administration's goals of improving China's IP and technology policies, they question the effectiveness of tariff hikes. Members of Congress are concerned about the impact of the trade conflict on higher-priced imports from China and lost U.S. export sales. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. Commerce investigates specific products and, if necessary, the President may adjust imports using tariffs or quotas. The Trump Administration initiated Section 232 investigations on U.S. steel and aluminum imports in response to global overcapacity and trade practices. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March 2018. Commerce established a process for product exclusion requests to mitigate negative effects on U.S. businesses and consumers. Over 49,000 exclusion requests have been received. The Trump Administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March 2018, leading to over 49,000 exclusion requests. The United States negotiated tariff exemptions with several countries, but the USMCA did not address the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico. Trading partners are challenging the tariffs under WTO rules, leading to potential escalation of retaliatory measures. The United States has filed WTO complaints against six countries over retaliatory tariffs. Congress is debating the Administration's Section 232 actions. The debate over the Administration's Section 232 actions includes potential amendments to the delegation of constitutional authority to the President, examining investigation and implementation processes, and addressing market-distorting practices causing steel and aluminum overcapacity through international forums and trade negotiations. The President can provide temporary import relief under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 based on industry petitions or self-initiated investigations by the President, with recommendations from the U.S. International Trade Commission. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) recommended relief due to increased imports causing serious injury to U.S. manufacturers. Unlike antidumping and countervailing duty cases, Section 201 investigations focus on import surges of fairly-traded goods. President Trump imposed temporary tariffs on large residential washing machines and solar products based on ITC's findings of serious injury. President Trump's administration is committed to defending American companies from harmful import surges that threaten jobs. While these actions may benefit domestic producers, they could raise prices for consumers and industries using imports. Imposing tariffs could also strain relations with trading partners and potentially violate WTO and FTA agreements. Several U.S. trading partners, including Canada, China, Mexico, and the European Union, have initiated dispute settlement proceedings in response to recent U.S. tariff actions, citing violations of WTO and FTA commitments. Retaliatory tariffs have been imposed by several countries, leading to escalating disputes at the WTO. Analysts are concerned about the potential destabilization of the multilateral trading system due to the political sensitivity of national security issues and the possibility of countries disregarding unfavorable WTO rulings. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by trading partners in response to U.S. tariff actions have led to concerns about the negative economic effects. Six countries have imposed tariffs on $25 billion of U.S. exports, while China has imposed tariffs on $101 billion of U.S. exports. This has affected industries such as soybeans, motor vehicles, steel, and aluminum, potentially making U.S. exports less competitive in foreign markets. Since China's economic liberalization in 1979, U.S.-Chinese economic ties have significantly expanded, with total bilateral trade reaching $636 billion in 2017. China became the largest trading partner of the United States, with a merchandise trade deficit of $376 billion in 2017, projected to increase to $418 billion in 2018. U.S. merchandise exports to China grew rapidly at 82.4% from 2008 to 2017, outpacing exports to other major trading partners. Sales by U.S.-invested firms in China totaled $464 billion in 2016. The U.S. trade deficit with China reached $418 billion in 2018. Tensions stem from China's incomplete transition to an open-market economy, with concerns over subsidies, trade barriers, intellectual property policies, and lack of rule of law. The American Chamber of Commerce in China business climate survey in 2018 found that 75% of foreign businesses felt \"less welcomed\" in China compared to before. The \"Made in China 2025\" initiative aims to make China a global leader in advanced manufacturing, raising concerns among U.S. business representatives. The Trump Administration's Section 301 actions against China are aimed at curbing this initiative. Presidents Trump and Xi have agreed to negotiations to address these issues. The 116th Congress may monitor ongoing 301 actions. The 116th Congress may monitor ongoing 301 actions and potential bilateral agreements to address U.S. trade concerns, particularly regarding the lack of effective protection of intellectual property rights in China. A study estimated that global IPR theft costs the U.S. economy billions, with China accounting for a significant portion. In 2014, the U.S. indicted members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for cyber-espionage against U.S. companies. During President Xi Jinping's 2015 visit, an agreement on cyber security was reached between the two countries. In 2015, an agreement on cyber security was reached between the U.S. and China, pledging not to conduct cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial purposes. However, in 2018, Crowdstrike identified China as a major threat actor in cyber intrusions across various sectors. FBI Director Christopher Wray and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions highlighted China's increasing economic espionage against the U.S. China's economic espionage against the United States has been rapidly increasing, with China linked to over 90% of the Department of Justice's cases involving economic espionage. The 116th Congress may consider legislation to address these threats. China's Belt and Road Initiative, launched in 2013, aims to promote economic connectivity and integration through infrastructure investment and policy coordination. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aims to promote economic connectivity through infrastructure investment. China has signed agreements with over 100 countries and projects could require $1 trillion to $4 trillion in capital. Concerns exist about transparency, debt sustainability, and motives behind the initiative. The United States is concerned about China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) due to perceived lack of transparency, potential debt sustainability issues, and economic leverage for geopolitical goals. The Trump Administration is focusing on modernizing development finance tools and collaborating with allies on infrastructure projects in the region. Congress passed the BUILD Act in response to China's growing economic influence. The BUILD Act (P.L. 115-254) was signed into law in October 2018. The 116th Congress may hold hearings on Chinese economic practices and BRI, consider tools to counter Chinese influence, and support U.S. firms in economic activities abroad. Congress may also oversee funding for U.S. participation in multilateral development banks, institutions involved in BRI, and debt transparency issues. The U.S. has worked on reducing trade barriers through bilateral and regional trade agreements. The United States has concluded 14 FTAs with 20 countries since 1985, including the renegotiation of NAFTA into the USMCA by the Trump Administration. The issue of FTAs may be a focus of the 116th Congress. The Trump Administration renegotiated NAFTA into the USMCA, which requires congressional approval. Minor adjustments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA were made by proclamation. The Administration plans to negotiate trade agreements with the EU, Japan, and the UK in 2019, with Congress expected to provide input throughout the process. In 2018, President Trump, Canada, and Mexico signed the USMCA, a proposed trade agreement to replace NAFTA. Congress may debate implementing the agreement in the 116th Congress, focusing on enforcement of labor and environmental provisions and the economic impact. Many trade policy experts credit FTAs like NAFTA for expanding trade and economic linkages, improving production processes, and increasing availability of lower-priced goods. Proponents argue NAFTA has positive political ties within North America and improves democratic governance. However, critics claim NAFTA has negatively impacted the U.S. economy, citing weak labor provisions and advocating for stronger enforcement in the proposed USMCA to address issues like outsourcing and job displacement. The proposed USMCA retains most of NAFTA's chapters but makes notable changes to rules of origin for motor vehicles and agriculture products. It also includes provisions on intellectual property rights, digital trade, services trade, access to the Canadian dairy market, currency misalignment, state-owned enterprises, anti-corruption, a sunset clause, government procurement, and investment. The USMCA proposes changes to rules of origin for motor vehicles, including increasing content requirements to 75% and adding a wage requirement of $16 per hour for 40%-45% of auto content. Supporters believe the agreement modernizes NAFTA with updated provisions in digital trade and financial services. The USMCA proposes changes to rules of origin for motor vehicles, which could raise compliance and production costs. However, the overall economic effects are not expected to be significant due to duty and barrier-free trade with Canada and Mexico. The U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement has been a key aspect of economic relations since 2012. Negotiations to modify the US-South Korea free trade agreement began in January 2018, following public criticism by President Trump. In September, a modified agreement was signed, with relevant U.S. tariff changes effective from January 1, 2019. President Trump's concern over the bilateral trade deficit was a major factor in the renegotiation, although economists argue other factors played a key role. The U.S. trade deficit with South Korea decreased by over $7 billion in 2017, partly due to increased U.S. energy and services exports. The modifications to the KORUS FTA were relatively minor and focused mainly on. The modifications to the US-South Korea free trade agreement were relatively minor, focusing on U.S. tariff adjustments and South Korean implementation issues. Changes include extending the 25% U.S. light truck tariff for twenty years, doubling the number of U.S. vehicle exports to South Korea, confirming South Korea's adherence to KORUS commitments, and addressing concerns over potential U.S. Section 232 tariffs on auto and auto parts. The Trump Administration notified Congress of its intent to negotiate a trade agreement with the European Union, focusing on eliminating tariffs and boosting trade in various sectors. Preparatory talks have been ongoing, potentially de-escalating recent tariff conflicts. The Trump Administration notified Congress of its intent to negotiate a trade agreement with the European Union, focusing on eliminating tariffs and boosting trade in various sectors. Both sides agreed not to impose further tariffs during negotiations, but the scope and inclusion of agriculture remain contentious. Challenges from previous negotiations could resurface, especially regarding geographical indications, investor-state dispute settlement, and data flow restrictions. The UK's impending withdrawal from the EU may also impact the negotiations. The United Kingdom's potential withdrawal from the EU could impact trade negotiations by removing a key voice on trade liberalization. The US may adjust its approach to trade issues following the proposed USMCA. Congress will be involved in shaping any final U.S.-EU trade agreement. Discussions may focus on the impact of transatlantic trade liberalization on the U.S. economy and the development of global trade rules. President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Abe announced plans for bilateral trade negotiations in September 2018. The Administration notified Congress of intent to start bilateral trade negotiations with Japan, a key trade partner. Japan's recent FTAs with other markets could disadvantage U.S. exporters, prompting U.S. interest in new talks. Japan had preferred regional trade negotiations but is now willing to engage in bilateral talks. Japan's willingness to enter bilateral talks with the United States is driven by potential Section 232 tariffs on Japanese autos and auto parts. The negotiations will focus on goods and services initially, with agriculture and autos being contentious issues. Both sides have expressed priorities for the talks, with Japan planning to limit new agriculture market access and the U.S. seeking increased production and employment in the auto industry. The agreement may be limited in coverage, representing a shift from previous U.S. FTAs. The U.S.-Japan talks mark a shift from previous FTAs, with negotiations covering trade in goods, services, agriculture, investment, intellectual property, state-owned enterprises, and digital trade. The aim is to address tariff and nontariff barriers for fairer trade, in consultation with Congress. This shift is influenced by the potential Section 232 tariffs on Japanese autos and auto parts. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress have called for launching U.S.-UK free trade agreement negotiations. President Trump and Prime Minister May discussed laying the groundwork for a future FTA in January 2017. A bilateral working group has been established to explore ways to strengthen trade and investment ties, with the Administration formally notifying Congress of its intent to enter into negotiations. The 116th Congress may hold consultations with the Administration over the scope of the negotiations. The UK-EU Brexit negotiations are surrounded by uncertainty, with prospects depending on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and the future UK-EU trade relationship. A transition period could extend through at least 2020, allowing the UK to negotiate trade agreements with other countries. Challenges arise from the \"Irish border\" issue, with a backstop agreement in place if no alternative arrangement is reached to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The UK Parliament rejected a proposal to avoid a \"hard border\" between Northern Ireland and Ireland in January 2019. The alignment of the UK with the EU in regulations could impact U.S.-UK FTA negotiations. Some experts see a U.S.-UK FTA as more feasible than one with the EU due to historical trade policy similarities. However, domestic interests may complicate negotiations. Concerns have been raised about food safety regulations in bilateral FTA talks. Other key issues include financial services, investment, and e-commerce. The number of global free trade agreements has grown significantly since 1990. The number of global free trade agreements has grown significantly since 1990, with nearly 300 agreements in force globally. The proliferation of FTAs presents challenges for the United States, as they are inherently discriminatory and provide preferential treatment to some countries. U.S. exporters benefit from these agreements, but the majority do not involve the United States. During the 116th Congress, the issue of preferential treatment in free trade agreements may become more prominent as agreements among top trading partners are finalized. Recent agreements like the TPP-11 and EU-Japan FTA could give Japanese exporters a competitive advantage in markets like the EU by eliminating tariffs. The EU's 10% auto tariff gives Japanese exporters a competitive advantage in the EU market. Other countries are engaging in new FTA negotiations that may impact U.S. economic and strategic interests. The WTO oversees global trade rules and negotiations, succeeding the GATT to promote a rules-based trading system. The U.S. has been a key player in multilateral trade negotiations. The WTO, established after the GATT, has facilitated trade liberalization through successive rounds of negotiations, leading to reduced trade barriers and the enforcement of rules like nondiscrimination. Members have significantly lowered their average MFN tariffs since 1994. The WTO's dispute settlement system has handled over 500 disputes to manage trade tensions and ensure stability. Despite its foundational role in the global trading system, the WTO faces challenges and calls for reforms to maintain relevance and effectiveness. The Trump Administration has shown skepticism towards the WTO and raised the possibility of U.S. withdrawal. Debates over the future of the WTO highlight issues for the 116th Congress, including the impact of WTO agreements on the U.S. economy. The Doha Round of negotiations stalled in 2015, with no clear path forward due to differences in priorities among members. The deadlock in WTO negotiations is due to differences in priorities among countries. The 11th Ministerial Conference in 2017 did not lead to major breakthroughs. Efforts continue through plurilateral agreements, with a focus on achieving a deal on fisheries subsidies by 2020. Talks on agriculture are stalled, but progress is seen in areas like e-commerce and investment facilitation. The U.S. supports these efforts and views the Ministerial outcome positively. The 11th Ministerial outcome at the WTO was seen positively by states as breaking the impasse, allowing like-minded countries to pursue new work. Some members, including the US, advocate for plurilateral or sectoral settings. The EU, Canada, China, and others have proposed WTO reform. The dispute settlement system is crucial for enforcing commitments and resolving disputes peacefully. The WTO dispute settlement process involves consultation, launching a dispute, presenting it to a panel, and adopting a decision. Cases can be appealed to the Appellate Body. If a party violates an agreement, it must bring its law into compliance. The U.S. Trade Representative can initiate cases on behalf of the United States. If compliance is not met, the aggrieved party can retaliate by imposing tariffs equivalent to the economic damage. The United States is a frequent user of the WTO dispute settlement system, initiating 123 disputes since 1995. China and the EU are the main targets of complaints. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress are skeptical of the system and are pushing for reforms, including withholding the appointment of AB panelists. USTR Robert Lighthizer has called for systemic changes but specific proposals have not been made yet. U.S. concerns include expansive interpretations of agreements by AB panelists. The United States has concerns about the WTO dispute settlement system, including whether AB panelists interpret agreements too expansively, the timeliness of proceedings, and allowing AB jurists to finish cases after their terms expire. The EU and others have proposed reforms, but the U.S. rejected them. The U.S. Ambassador to the WTO believes the proposals endorse problematic approaches. The U.S. has historically been a leader in the WTO, with many U.S. firms relying on WTO rules to advance economic interests. There are concerns about the future direction of the WTO due to the failure to conclude the Doha Round. Recent U.S. tariff actions and trade disputes are straining the system, raising questions about member commitment to uphold WTO rules. The WTO's ability to handle challenges from emerging markets like China is also in doubt. The U.S. Administration has expressed skepticism about the value of the WTO and multilateral trade negotiations. The U.S. Administration's approach to the WTO has raised concerns about future U.S. leadership in the organization. Observers believe reforms are needed to maintain the WTO's role in the global trading system. Other countries, like the EU and Canada, are exploring institutional reforms to promote the system amidst perceived protectionist actions by the Trump Administration. The 116th Congress may consider new U.S. negotiating objectives or oversight hearings to address prospects for WTO reforms and rulemaking, including intellectual property rights (IPR) such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Debate over IPR includes concerns about its role in the U.S. economy as a source of innovation and comparative advantage. The 116th Congress may consider new U.S. negotiating objectives or oversight hearings to address prospects for WTO reforms and rulemaking, including intellectual property rights (IPR) such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Debate over IPR includes concerns about its impact on U.S. commercial, health, safety, and security interests, as well as the balance between protecting IPR to stimulate innovation and advancing other public policy goals. Protection and enforcement of IPR in the digital environment, including cyber-theft, is of increasing concern, while lawful limitations to IPR, such as exceptions in copyright law for media, research, and teaching, may also have benefits. IPR is addressed in trade agreements and U.S. law, with Congress directing the Executive Branch to seek IP commitments that exceed the minimum standards of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United States has various trade policy tools to advance intellectual property rights (IPR) goals, including the \"Special 301\" provision and Section 337 investigations. The IPR provisions of the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement may be a central part of the debate in the 116th Congress. The 116th Congress may focus on the IPR provisions of the USMCA, which include core protections from NAFTA, updated provisions like data protection for biologics and copyright term extension, and penalties for trade secret theft. Congress may also monitor negotiations with China on IPR issues raised by the Section 301 investigation. Some Members of Congress and others have sought to improve labor and environmental conditions in other countries through enforceable provisions in U.S. free trade agreements. Concerns include forced technology transfer, cyber-intrusion, discriminatory licensing restrictions, and efforts to acquire sensitive U.S. technology. Policymakers differ on the scope and enforceability of these provisions, with some believing the International Labor Organization should address these issues. Trade agreements are seen as enabling economic growth. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is being considered by Congress in relation to worker rights protection, a key issue in U.S. free trade agreements. Since 1988, Congress has prioritized worker rights in trade promotion authority legislation, with NAFTA being the first agreement to address this by enforcing labor laws. The proposed USMCA includes similar language, requiring countries to uphold labor laws without derogation. The USMCA, like previous FTAs, mandates countries to adhere to ILO principles such as freedom of association, collective bargaining rights, elimination of forced labor, child labor, and employment discrimination. It also includes commitments for Mexico to protect worker representation in collective bargaining. NAFTA was the first agreement to include environmental provisions, requiring parties to enforce their own laws and resolve disputes cooperatively. The Trade Act of 2002 was the first TPA to contain environmental negotiating objectives. The 2015 grant of TPA expanded environmental obligations in U.S. FTAs, requiring parties to adopt laws consistent with multilateral environmental agreements and not to weaken laws to attract trade. Dispute settlement provisions include withdrawal of trade concessions for noncompliance. The WTO lacks environmental protection provisions, but negotiations are ongoing to eliminate tariffs on environmental goods to support broader environmental goals. In the proposed USMCA, Congress may examine environmental provisions for consistency with TPA and enforcement mechanisms. Import policies are used by the United States to achieve foreign and domestic policy goals, such as providing duty-free access to foster economic growth in less developed countries and addressing unfair trade practices. Congress created investigative processes to offset unfair competition for domestic producers and workers. Congress has created six trade preference programs since 1974 to assist developing countries, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA). The current Administration's trade policies may be overseen by Congress, including decisions on anti-dumping investigations. The Partnership Encouragement Acts (HOPE I and II), Haitian Economic Lift Program (HELP), Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and Nepal Preference Program provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for select products from developing countries. The 116th Congress may consider extending CBTPA and GSP, as they expire in 2020. Congress may consult closely with the Administration on product and country eligibility. The Trump Administration is interested in negotiating reciprocal trade agreements with current preference program beneficiaries. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer mentioned the possibility of new reciprocal free trade agreement negotiations with African countries. Congress may influence the scope and prioritization of these negotiations in the 116th Congress. Trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duty actions are taken to address injury to domestic industries caused by unfair trade practices. These laws are administered by the International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. In the 116th Congress, Congress may influence new negotiations for reciprocal free trade agreements with preference program beneficiaries. Trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duty actions are used to address injury to U.S. industries. AD/CVD orders place additional duties to offset dumping or subsidies, with 462 orders affecting imports from 47 countries as of October 22, 2018. Critics argue they are protectionist and overused, while advocates believe they are based on sound economics and ensure fair trade. Congress plays an oversight role in the use of these remedies. Congress oversees the U.S. trade remedy regime, including the self-initiation of investigations. AD/CVD actions are meant to be impartial, but constituent involvement can influence decisions. Members of Congress support importer requests for tariff suspensions to reduce manufacturing costs. The American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016 revised the process for tariff suspensions, allowing importer petitions for reduced duties. Congress passed the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018 using this new procedure. In 2017, the U.S. was the largest source and recipient of foreign direct investment. The United States is a leading source and recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI), with significant economic, political, and domestic interests at stake in international investment policies. U.S. investment policy intersects with trade policy debates, focusing on economic impact, trade restrictions, national security, and regulatory sovereignty. The U.S. traditionally supports an open and liberalized investment environment, negotiating rules in trade agreements and reviewing foreign investment transactions for national security implications. The U.S. investment policy landscape may be evolving. The U.S. investment policy landscape is evolving due to the Trump Administration's approach to investment issues in the USMCA and legislation passed in the 115th Congress to update CFIUS. Congress debates the impact of foreign investment on U.S. economic and national security interests, treating foreign investors similarly to U.S. firms with exceptions for national security. Congress asserted its role in foreign investment policy with the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 established the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to oversee national security implications of foreign direct investment. The law grants the President authority to block investments threatening U.S. national security, including those by foreign governments. It has been used five times to block acquisitions, with growing concerns over Chinese investment in 2017. In 2017, concerns over Chinese investment in U.S. high-technology firms led to bipartisan legislation to strengthen CFIUS. President Trump signed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) in 2018, amending the CFIUS process to review investment transactions for national security. The legislation is the most comprehensive reform of CFIUS since its creation, expanding its jurisdiction. Some provisions took immediate effect, while others are subject to further regulations. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA) amended CFIUS process to review investment transactions for national security, potentially allowing discrimination among foreign investors by country of origin. The debate over FIRRMA raises questions for Congress on balancing national security interests with open U.S. investment. The United States negotiates international investment agreements (IIAs) to reduce restrictions on foreign investment and ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of investors. U.S. IIAs typically take the form of Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) or BIT-like chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs). These agreements are viewed as more comprehensive and of a higher standard than those of other countries. Congress may focus on implementing legislation for proposed investment agreements. The investment provisions in the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) differ significantly from previous agreements like NAFTA and BITs. Differences include changes in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), which is a contentious issue among the U.S. business community and civil society groups. The proposed USMCA would eliminate ISDS with Canada and impose limits with Mexico, allowing claims for specific violations. However, certain claims like indirect expropriation would be restricted, and claimants must exhaust local remedies first. The treatment of ISDS in new U.S. trade agreements with Japan, the EU, and the UK may be influenced by the EU's move towards an Investment Court System. The federal government aims to include an Investment Court System in trade agreements to support U.S. exports and investment. Trade promotion agencies like the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation raise issues for Congress regarding economic justifications and federal resource use. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is the official U.S. export credit agency that provides financial support for U.S. exports to promote U.S. employment. It charges interest, premiums, and fees for its services, which are used to fund its activities. Proponents argue that it supports U.S. exports and jobs, while critics claim it crowds out private sector activity and poses risks to taxpayers. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) operates under a renewable general statutory charter extended through September 30, 2019. However, it is not fully operational due to a lack of quorum on the Board of Directors since July 2015. This has led to a backlog of almost $40 billion in pending transactions. In recent years, Ex-Im Bank authorizations for finance and insurance transactions have declined. The 115th Congress approved four nominees to the Board, pending before the Senate in the 116th Congress. Potential issues include consideration of nominations to the Board and reauthorization of Ex-Im Bank. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is up for reauthorization, with discussions on terms and duration. Ex-Im Bank follows OECD guidelines for financing, but concerns arise over foreign ECAs like China. Congress may review international ECA rules and negotiations to address competition issues. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) was established in 1971 under USAID. OPIC, established in 1971 under USAID, is the primary U.S. development finance institution aiming to promote economic growth in developing economies. It provides project financing, investment fund financing, and insures against political risks for U.S.-linked private investors. In FY2018, OPIC made $3.3 billion in new commitments for investment projects in various regions. Congress has renewed OPIC's authority through appropriations legislation, and the 116th Congress will oversee its consolidation and expansion under the BUILD Act. The BUILD Act establishes a new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) as a successor to OPIC. The IDFC could become operational as early as summer 2019, with a focus on balancing mandates to support U.S. businesses and development while addressing strategic concerns, especially regarding China. The 116th Congress may examine implementation issues and consider the IDFC's effectiveness in responding to global economic challenges. The 116th Congress may debate the economic and policy implications of U.S. government support for private investment, considering national security concerns and the balance between foreign policy objectives and commercial interests. Congressional discussions may also focus on international rules for development finance and the use of economic sanctions to achieve foreign policy goals. The President has authority to control exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons. Various programs and statutes exist for controlling exports of nuclear materials, defense articles, and dual-use goods. Licenses are required for exports under each program, administered by multiple U.S. departments. The Export Control Reform Act of 2018 authorized the dual-use export control system. The U.S. export control system was reformed under the Obama Administration. The U.S. export control system has a unified control list, integrated IT system, and enforcement agency. Licensing responsibilities are divided among Commerce, State, and Treasury, with advisory input from Defense. Enforcement involves multiple agencies including Justice and Homeland Security. Congress is concerned about illicit technology acquisition by foreign powers, especially China. The new export control act enhances investment scrutiny and interagency cooperation. The new export control act enhances investment scrutiny and interagency cooperation to identify and assess national security implications of foundational and emerging technologies. Economic sanctions are coercive measures, including trade embargoes, restrictions on exports/imports, and denial of foreign assistance. Secondary sanctions can impede trade and access to U.S.-located assets of foreign entities engaging with primary targets. The United States maintains economic sanctions against foreign governments, entities, and individuals identified as supporters of terrorism, nuclear proliferation, human rights abuses, corruption, and threats to regional stability. Sanctions also target those involved in egregious human rights abuses and corruption within the state. The United States imposes economic sanctions on foreign governments, entities, and individuals involved in terrorism, nuclear proliferation, human rights abuses, corruption, and threats to regional stability. Sanctions target activities such as international terrorism, narcotics trafficking, weapons proliferation, conflict diamond trade, and transnational crime. The 116th Congress may influence President Trump's foreign policy and national security decisions, particularly regarding Iran's missile proliferation and relations with North Korea. The 115th Congress showed interest in reviewing the President's national emergency authorities for sanctions. Informal and formal forums have been used since World War II to coordinate economic policies, including the G-7, G-20, IMF, OECD, World Bank, and WTO. The United States' role in international organizations is evolving under President Trump, with Congress playing a key role in shaping policy. The 116th Congress may focus on monitoring global economic developments and their impact on U.S. interests, including exchange rate policies, the U.S. dollar's role, trade issues, and potential economic crises. The Group of 7 (G-7) was a small group of developed industrialized economies discussing international economic matters from the 1970s to the 2000s. In response to the global financial crisis, the Group of 20 (G-20) was formed, including G-7 members and other developed and emerging-market economies. The G-20 is now considered the premier forum for international economic cooperation and coordination. The G-7 and G-20 are key international economic forums. The United States traditionally played a leading role, but under President Trump, there has been a shift with the U.S. becoming more isolated on trade and climate change issues. In 2018, President Trump withdrew support for a G-7 joint statement, raising concerns about the significance of agreements reached at these summits. The G-20 summit in Argentina in 2018 raised questions about the communiqu\u00e9's significance. France and Japan will host the G-7 and G-20 summits in 2019. U.S. participation in these summits is driven by the Administration, with Congress having oversight through hearings. The IMF, established in 1945, focuses on promoting macroeconomic stability and providing assistance to member states in economic crises. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act authorized U.S. participation in an IMF reform package, doubling IMF core resources and giving emerging markets a stronger voice. Legislation also sunsets U.S. contributions to the New Arrangements to Borrow fund in 2022. Members are evaluating IMF rules on providing large loans, with proposed legislation aiming to limit the U.S. Executive Director's ability to vote for large IMF programs. The IMF is working on reviewing its quota resources and seeking increased country contributions. The Trump Administration opposes boosting Fund resources, believing the IMF already has enough resources to fulfill its mission. The Administration believes recent reforms have stabilized the global monetary system. Countries have alternative resources to the IMF in case of a crisis. The US is a major donor to five major multilateral development banks, established after WWII to provide financing for economic development in developing countries. The Trump Administration is pushing for reforms in major multilateral development banks to promote financial discipline, graduate borrowers like China, and shift lending to lower income countries. This comes as developing countries can now borrow from international capital markets and emerging-market countries establish their own MDBs. Funding for MDBs may change under the Trump Administration. In 2018, the United States and other World Bank members approved a $60.1 billion capital increase for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and a $5.5 billion capital increase for the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Exchange rates play a crucial role in the global economy, impacting imports, exports, and overseas investments. U.S. policymakers are concerned about the proposed capital increase and the implications for the economy. Some U.S. policymakers are concerned about currency manipulation by other governments to gain unfair advantages in exports, but no specific country has been labeled as a currency manipulator by the IMF, G-7, G-20, or the U.S. Treasury in over two decades. Calls for stronger actions to combat currency manipulation have been made by some Members of Congress and were a key issue for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The 116th Congress may debate currency manipulation in the context of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and China's currency policies. US concerns about currency manipulation are not focused on Canada and Mexico, but addressing it in the USMCA could set a precedent for future trade agreements. China's currency policies have been a particular concern for US policymakers. China's currency depreciation in 2018 is believed to be a response to US tariffs. The US dollar has been the dominant global currency for 70 years, with central banks holding reserves in dollars and global debt denominated in dollars. This could impact trade disputes between the US and China. The U.S. dollar's status as a reserve currency provides benefits like lower borrowing costs for the government. However, challenges to its dominance are emerging, with some countries exploring alternative payment systems to bypass U.S. financial sanctions. Concerns about U.S. economic policy and trade conflicts are fueling debates about the dollar's future. The 116th Congress may consider the benefits of the dollar as a reserve currency and the long-term impact of economic policies on its global role. Analysts are concerned about debt sustainability in emerging markets due to an influx of capital post-2008 financial crisis. The influx of capital into emerging markets post-2008 financial crisis has led to investment bubbles and concerns about debt sustainability. Argentina and Turkey faced pressures in 2018, raising worries for other countries reliant on external financing. China's financing of projects in developing countries, like Pakistan, is causing fiscal problems. Analysts are concerned about countries meeting financial obligations to China and the implications. The 116th Congress may monitor economic conditions in emerging markets and developing countries for U.S. interests and IMF's role. The U.S. has limited economic exposure to emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey. A broader crisis in these countries could have significant economic and foreign policy implications for the U.S. Congress may monitor the IMF's response to crises, focusing on program size, reforms, and Chinese financing transparency. The 116th Congress may focus on key areas such as transparency in Chinese financing, burden sharing in IMF assistance, impact of tariffs on U.S. workers and firms, altering presidential authority on tariffs, implementing USMCA legislation, overseeing trade negotiations with EU, Japan, and UK, and monitoring WTO reform efforts. The Trump Administration's policies at the WTO, oversight on trade issues with China and other major economies, reauthorization of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, evaluation of major legislation passed in the 115th Congress, U.S. leadership in international economic policy coordination, adjustments to U.S. funding for the World Bank, and monitoring financial market developments. The U.S. economy is influenced by exchange rate policies, high debt levels in emerging markets, and the role of the U.S. dollar. Congressional actions on trade and economic policy can impact the economy, businesses, workers, standard of living, and geopolitical interests. There may be differing views on the benefits and costs of U.S. trade policy, leading to a potential robust debate in the 116th Congress. The 116th Congress may engage in a robust debate on trade and finance issues."
