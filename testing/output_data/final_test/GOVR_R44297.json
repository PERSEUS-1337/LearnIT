    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was last comprehensively amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Congress has not reauthorized the ESEA, but programs continue to receive annual appropriations. The House Education Committee passed the Student Success Act for ESEA reauthorization, while the Senate HELP Committee reported the Every Child Achieves Act for the same purpose. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed by both chambers of Congress in 2015, with key provisions focusing on Title I-A and Title II-A accountability and formula issues. The ESSA reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), updating the structure of the education system. The ESSA reauthorized the ESEA in 2015, focusing on Title I-A and Title II-A accountability and formula issues. Table 2 outlines the ESEA structure under the ESSA with appropriations for FY2017-FY2020. Table 3 shows programs authorized under current law not retained by the ESSA. President Obama and the Secretary announced ESEA flexibility waivers for states in 2011. The ESEA flexibility waivers allow State educational agencies to apply for optional waivers related to various programs and funding requirements. To receive the waivers, SEAs must agree to meet four principles established by the U.S. Department of Education for improving student academic achievement and increasing the quality of instruction. The ESEA flexibility waivers involve a significant redesign of accountability and teacher-related requirements by the Administration. 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have approved these waivers as of December 2015. The ESSA will end all waivers associated with the ESEA flexibility package on August 1, 2016. The report focuses on current law and does not compare ESSA provisions. Key areas of interest in the ESSA include structural issues, funding, Title I-A accountability, formulas, and teacher-related aspects. The ESSA addresses structural and funding issues, Title I-A accountability, formulas, teachers, principals, and school leaders, flexibility, and choice. Tables provide details on program structure, authorization amounts, and examples of programs not authorized under the ESSA. Under the ESSA, certain programs that would no longer be authorized may still have allowable uses of funds. For example, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants program could support counseling, safe school environments, physical education, technology, and reimburse low-income students for accelerated learning exam fees. This list is not exhaustive but focuses on programs not continuing under the ESSA."
