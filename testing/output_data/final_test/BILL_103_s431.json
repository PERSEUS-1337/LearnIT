    "content": "The \"Vehicle Damage Disclosure and Consumer Protection Act of 1993\" aims to protect purchasers of motor vehicles with prior damage or those repurchased under lemon laws. The Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act defines terms related to manufacturer buyback vehicles and State lemon laws. Manufacturer buyback vehicle refers to a vehicle repurchased under a State lemon law, which requires manufacturers to repurchase vehicles with nonconformities. Section 408 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act is amended to require States to disclose on vehicle titles if the vehicle has a history of being salvaged, junked, reconstructed, damaged by flood, or a manufacturer buyback. The Secretary is tasked with prescribing rules for this disclosure within 90 days of the Vehicle Damage Disclosure and Consumer Protection Act of 1993. The Vehicle Damage Disclosure and Consumer Protection Act of 1993 requires States to disclose vehicle damage information on titles, including severe damage and dollar value, within specific timeframes. Uniform standards and procedures for disclosure must be established within 12 months of enactment. Recommendations for maximizing consumer protection are to be developed in consultation with relevant task forces. The Vehicle Damage Disclosure and Consumer Protection Act of 1993 mandates the inclusion of the dollar value of damage to a motor vehicle on all certificates of title during title transfers. This requirement applies to vehicles not declared total losses or branded with salvage, junk, reconstructed, rebuilt, or flood damage symbols. Additionally, within 12 months of the Act's enactment, minimum form and content requirements for State certificates of title must be established through rulemaking. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF MANUFACTURER BUYBACK VEHICLES. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study on disclosing manufacturer buyback vehicles to prospective purchasers. This includes considering different disclosure methods like a national uniform sticker or consumer disclosure statement. The Secretary of Transportation will report to Congress within 6 months of the enactment of the Act regarding the disclosure of manufacturer buyback vehicles to prospective purchasers. The report will be submitted to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives. The Secretary of Transportation will report to Congress on manufacturer buyback vehicles within 6 months of the Act's enactment. Definitions for \"manufacturer buyback vehicle\", \"dealer\", and \"distributor\" are based on the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act. The Senate passed the legislation on November 20, 1993. Walter J. Stewart attested to the document."
