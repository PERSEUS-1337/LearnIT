    "content": "The \"Student Attendance Success Act of 2009\" defines terms like local educational agency, Secretary, State educational agency, and truancy. It also establishes a Truancy Prevention Discretionary Grant Program. The Secretary can award grants to State educational agencies for subgrants to local educational agencies to create initiatives to improve student academic achievement and retention. Subgrants are awarded for 3 years and can be renewed for an additional 3 years based on performance reports. The State educational agency awards subgrants on a competitive basis to address truancy in grades 5 through 9. Applications must be submitted by both State and local educational agencies to receive funding. Local applications for funding to address truancy in grades 5 through 9 must demonstrate a history of significant truancy, describe the activities for which assistance is sought, and provide additional assurances as required by the State educational agency. The local educational agency receiving a subgrant will partner with a community-based organization to create initiatives aimed at keeping students in school. They must also submit a report on their performance, and there are authorized appropriations for this program. Authorized appropriations are provided for fiscal year 2010 and the following 5 years to support initiatives aimed at keeping students in school. The National Resource Center for Positive Youth Development and School Success is established. The Secretary awards a grant to an eligible nonprofit organization to establish and operate a National Resource Center on Positive Youth Development and School Success. The Center provides resources and training to help students succeed in school and avoid risky behavior like truancy. The National Resource Center on Positive Youth Development and School Success offers a free information service for schools and conducts research on the relationship between youth development and academic success. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the next six fiscal years. SEC. 5. NATIONAL DEFINITION OF TRUANCY. Section 4112(c)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a definition of truancy as each absence of a student required to attend school without a valid excuse. The definition of truancy includes 3 consecutive school days for elementary students and 3 or more class periods on each of 3 consecutive school days for middle or secondary students. Excused absences require approval from a parent, teacher, or administrator. The definition of truancy includes consecutive school days for elementary students and class periods on each of consecutive school days for middle or secondary students. An absence is not considered truancy unless it is unexcused and reviewed by a school official, or if it is due to a school decision to remove a student from attendance."
