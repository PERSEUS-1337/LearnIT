    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2016\". It includes a report on the designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. Congress finds that North Korea has harbored members of the Japanese Red Army since a 1970 hijacking, bombed Korean Airlines Flight 858 in 1987, and carried out the Rangoon bombing in 1983. Additionally, a North Korean agent was convicted in 2005 for kidnapping a U.S. resident. Members of the Illinois congressional delegation demand full accountability from North Korea before supporting its removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. Iran and Syria are also on the list for supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. In 2008, a North Korean agent was convicted for attempting to assassinate a South Korean military officer. In December 2009, a North Korean arms shipment containing rockets, surface-to-air missiles, explosives, and other weaponry was seized in Thailand. Similar shipments were impounded in the UAE and intercepted by Israel, believed to be destined for Iranian-backed terrorists like Hezbollah and Hamas. In June 2010, North Korean officials were convicted of attempting to assassinate a dissident in South Korea. In July 2010, a US court found North Korea provided support to the Japanese Red Army. In November 2012, a South Korean court sentenced a North Korean agent to 4 years in prison for attempting to assassinate a North Korean dissident in exile. In December 2012, South Korean prosecutors determined that North Korean agents assassinated a human rights activist helping North Korean refugees in China in August 2011. In 2011, a North Korean agent attempted to assassinate a human rights activist with a poisoned needle in Yanji, China. North Korea has also been involved in violent acts against its citizens abroad, including an attempted kidnapping in Paris in 2013. Additionally, North Korean entities have provided essential foreign equipment and assistance for Syria's liquid-propellant missile program, and helped build the Al Kibar nuclear reactor in Syria. In 2007, Israel destroyed a reactor that could have produced plutonium for nuclear weapons. In 2014, a US court found that North Korea supported Hezbollah in terrorist attacks against Israel. In 2014, Hamas tried to negotiate an arms deal with North Korea for missiles and communications equipment to continue attacks against Israel. The deal was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and was facilitated by a Lebanese-based trading company. On November 24, 2014, the hacker group \"Guardians of Peace\" leaked confidential data from Sony Pictures Entertainment, including personal information, emails, executive salaries, and unreleased films. On December 16, 2015, they threatened Sony Pictures regarding the movie \"The Interview\" and referenced the 9/11 attacks. On December 19, 2015, the FBI concluded that North Korea was responsible for the cyber attack on Sony Pictures and the threat against movie theaters. The South Korean government had previously accused North Korea of a cyber attack on nuclear power plants in December 2014. On April 13, 2015, a U.S. court awarded $330 million in damages against North Korea for kidnapping and murder. On May 17, 2015, three South Koreans were arrested for conspiring to murder North Korean dissidents. On October 22, 2015, Ambassador Sung Kim made a statement. On October 22, 2015, Ambassador Sung Kim testified that North Korea's conduct poses a growing threat to the United States and global nonproliferation regime. Ms. Hilary Batjer Johnson noted that weapons transfers violating nonproliferation or missile control regimes could be a relevant factor for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1988 but had the designation rescinded in 2008 after committing to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. Consequences of this designation include bans on arms exports, restrictions on foreign assistance, and financial sanctions. The United States prohibits financial transactions with State Sponsors of Terrorism and requires disclosure of investments in these states. Congress believes North Korea should be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. The President must report on this within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The President must report to Congress within 90 days of the Act's enactment on whether the Government of North Korea committed acts of terrorism and supported international terrorism. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress determining if North Korea supports international terrorism and provide a detailed justification if the legal criteria are not met. This report will also be included in the first annual report under the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The report required by subsection (c)(1) shall be submitted in unclassified form, with the option to include a classified annex if necessary, on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations and the House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs. \"North Korea\" is defined as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and \"state sponsor of terrorism\" refers to a country determined by the Secretary of State for specific purposes. A government that has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism is subject to sanctions under various provisions of law."
