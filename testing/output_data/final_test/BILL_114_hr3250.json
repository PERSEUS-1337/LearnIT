    "content": "The \"DXM Abuse Prevention Act of 2015\" requires retailers to implement a verification system for sales of over-the-counter drugs containing dextromethorphan. Failure to do so is considered a prohibited act under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Retailers selling dextromethorphan in interstate commerce must have a verification system in place to ensure compliance with age restrictions. This system can include electronic point-of-sale prompts, employee training, signage, designated approval for sales, or other measures approved by the Secretary. Retailers must verify the age of individuals purchasing dextromethorphan, except for those over 26, with a valid prescription, or with a valid military identification card proving enrollment. To sell a drug containing dextromethorphan, retailers must verify the purchaser's age by examining a valid identification card with a photo and date of birth. It is an affirmative defense if the seller reasonably believed the ID was valid and showed the buyer was at least 18 years old. The ID must be issued by a State or the Federal Government. Section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include civil penalties for violations of section 301(ddd). Violators will receive a notification for the first offense and face escalating fines for subsequent violations. The amended Section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act imposes civil penalties for violations of section 301(ddd), with fines increasing for repeat offenses. Retailers can mitigate penalties by implementing employee training programs on dextromethorphan products and ID checks. The amended Section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act imposes civil penalties for violations of section 301(ddd), with fines increasing for repeat offenses. Retailers can mitigate penalties by implementing employee training programs on dextromethorphan products and ID checks. Violations at multiple physical locations are considered separate offenses. The Secretary must promptly notify violators and provide details of the observed violation. Employees are prohibited from violating the law. In subsection 301(ddd), employees are not penalized unless they knowingly participate in a conspiracy to violate the section. A conspiracy involves an agreement between individuals to violate the section and the commission of at least one overt act. The term 'employee' refers to non-managerial staff in a retailer, while 'retailer' includes grocery stores, drug stores, and other distributors. The activities of distributors involving products with dextromethorphan are primarily limited to personal sales, including online sales. SEC. 3. RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION OF BULK DEXTROMETHORPHAN. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include restrictions on the distribution of bulk dextromethorphan. No person can possess or receive unfinished dextromethorphan unless registered under the law for pharmacy or drug distribution. Distribution to unregistered individuals is prohibited. Common carriers are exempt from these restrictions. The section defines common carriers as providers of transportation services for merchandise and unfinished dextromethorphan as the substance not in finished dosage form. It also prohibits the distribution of unfinished dextromethorphan to unregistered individuals. A person who violates section 506H may face a civil penalty of up to $100,000."
