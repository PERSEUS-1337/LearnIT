    "content": "Medicare patients have high hospital readmission rates, costing $15 billion annually. Nearly 20% of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and over were readmitted within 30 days in 2005. MedPAC estimates two-thirds of readmissions may be preventable due to fragmented post-acute care. Coordination of care across providers and settings is limited. In MedPAC's view, existing incentives to coordinate care across providers and settings are limited under Medicare's fee-for-service payment system. Changes addressing hospital readmissions, such as effective discharge planning and payment reforms, may improve patient care and generate cost savings. Implementation is complicated due to varying readmission rates and hospital utilization across geographic locations. After a hospital stay, roughly 40% of Medicare beneficiaries are discharged to a post-acute setting providing skilled nursing care or rehabilitation services. Rates of 30-day hospital readmissions among beneficiaries discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have been increasing over time; almost one-quarter of the Medicare beneficiaries discharged from a hospital to a SNF in 2006 were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. MedPAC has found that the risk-adjusted rate at which Medicare covered SNF patients with any of five potentially avoidable conditions (congestive heart failure, respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, sepsis and electrolyte imbalances) vary substantially among geographic locations. The 30-day hospital readmission rate for Medicare beneficiaries discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in 2009 was 14.2%, with significant variation among SNFs. Current Medicare payment rules do not incentivize hospitals and post-acute providers to coordinate care, share clinical information, ensure appropriate placement, or address inefficiencies. Hospitals must comply with Medicare's Conditions of Participation (COP) for billing, which includes having a discharge planning process for all patients. This process involves evaluating potential adverse health consequences upon discharge, developing a discharge plan, arranging for its implementation, and counseling the patient. Transitional care models supplement hospital discharge planning by providing services before and after discharge, targeting care for vulnerable chronically ill patients at risk for readmission. Readmissions are seen as outcomes preceded by intermediary events that can be addressed. From August 2008 to July 2011, Medicare's Quality Improvement Organizations in 14 states identified primary factors contributing to readmissions, such as fragmented documentation, poor patient self-management, inadequate follow-up care, community awareness issues, lack of patient support, and medication discrepancies. Collaborative efforts with community stakeholders can help reduce readmissions by implementing standardized processes to support patients before and after discharge. Community stakeholders collaborate to establish standardized processes for patient support pre and post-hospital discharge. QIO initiatives focus on enhancing patient education, medication management, and communication through health records. QIOs continue efforts to reduce readmissions in their 10th SOW, providing technical assistance for the Community Care Transitions Program under the ACA. This report aims to inform Congress on Medicare's strategies to address hospital readmissions. The report discusses factors influencing hospital readmissions, Medicare's readmission measures, payment incentives, COPs, efforts to improve discharge procedures, and upcoming payment initiatives like HRRP and bundled payment demonstrations by CMMI. There is ongoing debate about factors influencing readmissions and hospitals' control over them. Medicare faces challenges in reducing hospital readmissions by providing incentives for hospitals to address underlying causes and minimize rehospitalizations. Research shows that certain medical conditions and demographic characteristics make Medicare beneficiaries more likely to be readmitted after discharge. Medicare beneficiaries with certain medical conditions and demographic characteristics are more likely to be readmitted to the hospital after discharge. Readmission rates vary widely by condition and procedure, with most rehospitalizations being for medical conditions. Patients with multiple chronic illnesses and a history of prior rehospitalizations have higher readmission rates. Patients with worse health, indicated by higher clinical severity scores, also have higher 30-day readmission rates. Differences in readmission rates between patients with higher and lower severity scores have increased over time. The study found that demographic characteristics like race, age, gender, and socio-economic status do not consistently predict hospital readmissions. However, there is some evidence of variation in readmission rates by race and socio-economic status, with advocates pushing for these factors to be included in readmission models. One study compared readmission rates of black and elderly Medicare patients at minority-serving hospitals and non-minority serving hospitals from 2006 to 2008. It found higher readmission rates for older black patients than white patients for AMI, CHF, and PN, with the site of care having a greater impact than race. Concerns have been raised about including non-clinical factors like race and socio-economic status in statistical models for public health outcome reporting. Including an adjustment for race or socioeconomic status in readmission rate calculations for hospitals is a contentious issue. Advocates argue that without such adjustments, safety-net hospitals serving minority and low-income patients may face disproportionate financial penalties, potentially reducing the quality of care for these populations. On the other hand, some believe that including these adjustments could lower the performance bar for hospitals serving a high proportion of these patients, leading to unequal incentives to minimize readmissions compared to other hospitals. This debate raises concerns about the impact on patient care and hospital behavior. The high readmission rates for certain patient categories may be due to factors like poor self-management of health conditions and lack of post-discharge support. Without proper follow-up care from primary care providers, patients discharged from the hospital are at risk of readmission if their condition worsens. Communication between hospital physicians and primary care providers could help mitigate these situations. Post-discharge communication between hospitals and primary care providers is lacking, leading to potential readmissions. Limited awareness of post-acute care options and medication errors during hospitalization are also contributing factors. Additionally, incomplete recording of diagnostic information hinders proper follow-up care by primary care providers. Communication between hospital staff and patients is crucial for better patient satisfaction and lower readmission rates. Currently, hospitals lack financial incentives to prevent rehospitalizations or delay discharges under the Medicare fee-for-service system. This includes the lack of reimbursement for supportive services and transitional care services that could reduce readmissions. Providers may not offer additional services like telephone reminders for follow-up appointments, medication reminders, or in-home check-ups post-discharge due to lack of financial incentives. Shorter hospital stays under Medicare's payment system do not necessarily lead to higher readmission rates. Factors such as age and patient illness may contribute to readmission rates, warranting further investigation into the reasons for readmission. Adverse events can occur before, during, or after hospitalization. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has established readmission measures for common Medicare hospitalizations as quality indicators. These measures are included on the Hospital COMPARE website for public assessment of hospitals' performance in reducing readmissions. The measures for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia (PN) were finalized in 2008. Starting in June 2009, Hospital COMPARE displays hospitals' risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for Medicare patients with HF, AMI, and PN compared to the national average. CMS's Inpatient Quality Reporting program includes this data as quality measures since FY2010, impacting hospitals' payment rates based on their reporting. Three readmission models estimate hospital-specific 30-day readmission rates for Medicare patients discharged alive to non-acute care settings. The CMS measures readmission rates for Medicare patients with HF, AMI, and PN discharged to non-acute care settings. The measures are risk-adjusted for patient factors and hospital quality using hierarchical regression modeling. Hospitals with higher-than-expected readmission spending for Medicare FFS beneficiaries face penalties under the HRRP established by ACA. Starting in FY2013, hospitals with higher-than-expected readmission spending on Medicare FFS beneficiaries initially hospitalized with HF, AMI, or PN will face penalties capped at 1% in FY2013, 2% in FY2014, and 3% in FY2015 and beyond. CMS uses all-cause readmission measures within 30 days of the original admission, while other approaches aim to identify preventable readmissions. Certain hospitals and their advocates are concerned about the potential financial implications of Medicare's all-cause readmission measures, which may result in different relative readmission rates and penalties for hospitals starting in FY2013. Hospital advocates argue that the measures do not exclude a sufficient number of planned or unrelated readmissions, potentially penalizing hospitals unfairly for factors beyond their control, especially safety-net hospitals serving challenging patient populations with limited resources. CMS has implemented policy initiatives and projects to assist low-performing providers with rehospitalizations. Concerns exist about financial and quality incentives in the FFS payment system, which does not incentivize hospitals to reduce readmissions or improve care quality. Medicare currently pays for all readmissions, regardless of quality or outcomes. Medicare pays for all readmissions except within 24 hours for the same condition. Hospitals may lose income by reducing readmissions under existing payment incentives. Medicare FFS pays hospitals and physicians separately. Post-acute care providers are paid separately for each Medicare admission. IPPS hospitals are paid per case, while physicians are paid per service. Hospitals are financially rewarded for efficient care delivery and are incentivized to discharge patients earlier. Medicare requires hospitals to provide discharge care instructions to beneficiaries, with regulations subject to survey and recertification efforts. The hospital must have a discharge planning process for all patients, identifying those at risk early on. A timely evaluation of post-acute service needs must be done and included in the patient's record. The hospital must discuss the evaluation results with the patient or representative, develop a discharge plan, and arrange for its implementation. Counseling and preparation for post-hospital care must be provided to patients and their families. The hospital must transfer patients with necessary medical information for post-hospital care. Studies show incomplete discharge planning and delayed information provision to physicians and post-acute providers. Primary care physicians value information like main diagnosis, physical findings, test results, and discharge medications. Studies have found that hospital discharge documents often lack important information, with only 12% to 34% of physicians having access to them. Discharge summaries frequently do not include pending test results or the patient's final cognitive status. Inadequate information may lead to suboptimal follow-up care decisions by outpatient physicians. The impact of hospital discharge planning on readmissions may vary depending on the assessment measures used. The study found no significant association between CHF readmission rates and a discharge planning measure based on documentation in medical records. However, there was a modest association between PN and CHF readmissions and a measure based on patient-reported experience with discharge planning. The correlation between the two discharge measures was weak. Comprehensive and timely discharge planning is important to reduce hospital readmissions, as supported by previous research. A meta-analysis of studies on heart failure patients showed that comprehensive discharge planning reduced hospital readmission risk by 75%. Another review found that individualized discharge plans lowered readmission risk by 85%. Recommendations have been made to update hospital processes to improve patient outcomes, such as providing discharge instructions to community providers within 48 hours. CMS published proposed changes to hospital COP regulations on October 24, 2011, which were finalized on May 16, 2012. Efforts have been made to address Medicare rehospitalizations, including the Community Based Care Transitions Program. QIOs collaborated with providers to identify causes of readmissions and develop prevention strategies from August 2008 to July 2011. The Care Transitions Quality Improvement Organization Support Center (QIOSC) identified three main causes of patient readmissions: declining health conditions, inappropriate medication regimens, and misuse of emergency rooms. These issues were attributed to gaps in patient care, including lack of patient engagement, inconsistent transfer processes among providers, and ineffective sharing of information. The QIOs worked on approaches to engage patients, develop standard discharge processes, and ensure timely information for clinicians. They aim to reduce readmissions by 20% by 2013, preventing rehospitalization of 1.6 million patients. The QIOs aim to reduce readmissions by 20% by 2013, preventing rehospitalization of 1.6 million patients. Section 3026 of the ACA establishes a five-year community-based care transitions program (CCTP) for eligible entities to test models for improving care transitions for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries. Eligible entities include IPPS hospitals with high readmission rates or certain community-based organizations providing care transition services. Consideration is given to entities that participate in care transitions programs for medically underserved populations, small communities, and rural areas. The Community-Based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) aims to improve transitions of high-risk beneficiaries from hospitals to other care settings, reduce readmissions, and demonstrate savings to Medicare. Awardees are expected to collaborate with ACOs and medical homes to manage care transitions effectively. Medicare plans to invest $500 million over five years in this program. Medicare plans to invest $500 million in the Community-Based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) starting in January 1, 2011. Entities interested in participating must submit applications detailing root cause analysis, beneficiary notification process, and implementation strategy. Prior experience in managing care transitions and reducing readmissions is required for applicants. A two-year agreement is awarded, with the possibility of extension based on performance. Entities selected for the Community-Based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) are awarded a two-year agreement that can be extended based on performance. They must provide a budget and per eligible discharge rate for transitional care services. The Lewin Group will provide support and technical assistance to entities, gathering best practices and facilitating information sharing. CMS pays entities a per eligible discharge rate monthly for services delivered in the previous month. The Community-Based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) selects sites for online collaboration and national meetings. The program includes care transition interventions such as timely post-discharge follow-up, patient education, and medication management. The interventions do not cover payment for discharge planning services required under Medicare COP. The CTTP solicitation provides information on evidence-based care transition models, including the Care Transitions Initiative (CTI) which offers a four-week program with a nurse transition coach to assist patients with complex care needs. In a trial, patients receiving CTI had lower readmission rates and hospital costs. The CTI intervention led to lower readmission rates and hospital costs for patients. Qualitative results showed improved self-management and confidence in study participants. The CTI model has been implemented in various hospitals and health systems, including a 2007 initiative in 10 California locations funded by the California Health Care Foundation. The Transitional Care Model (TCM) involves a transitional care team led by an advanced practice nurse, providing care before, during, and after hospital discharge. The Transitional Care Model (TCM) involves a transitional care team led by an advanced practice nurse (TCN) targeting chronically ill high-risk older adults. In a multi-site randomized control trial for persons age 65 and older hospitalized with heart failure, the TCM intervention group had fewer readmissions and 39% lower total cost of care per patient than the control group. Project BOOST aims to improve care transitions for older adults through a risk assessment and interventions tailored to specific patients. Project BOOST and Project RED are initiatives aimed at improving hospital discharge care. Project BOOST focuses on quality of life and communication between hospital and physicians, while Project RED involves discharge advocates addressing care transition elements. In a study, Project RED participants were less likely to be readmitted or visit the emergency department compared to non-participants. Additionally, Project RED participants were more likely to have a follow-up appointment and their primary care physicians received discharge information promptly. Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB) was established in 2003 to enhance patient care quality and staff satisfaction in hospitals. One aspect of TCAB focuses on transitional care, including assessing post-discharge options, educating patients and caregivers, providing medication information to outpatient providers, and scheduling follow-up care for high-risk patients. The intervention for moderate risk patients included a follow-up phone call and scheduled physician office visit, resulting in reduced patient wait times and increased satisfaction. Care transition models aim to coordinate care between hospital and post-hospital settings, educate patients and caregivers, monitor patient health post-discharge, and provide care from a transitional team. The scope and costs of the intervention vary based on the targeted patients, duration, and services involved. The CCTP program aims to assess Medicare's potential benefits. The CCTP program aims to assess Medicare's potential benefits by evaluating care transition services. While previous programs did not show clear improvements in patient care or cost savings, successful care coordination involves in-person interactions with patients and close collaboration with physicians. Experts recommend proven care transitions programs for effective cost savings and quality improvement, but hospitals may face challenges in implementing and sustaining these initiatives. Patient participation rates in care transitions programs have been low, with many patients not interested in enrolling or receiving home visits. One study showed a 50% reduction in 30-day readmission rates for heart failure patients in a transitions program. However, the financial impact on hospitals was significant, with each patient reducing the profit margin by $227 and hospitals losing an average of $750 in revenue per patient. Despite potential future payment reforms, hospitals may not have a financial incentive to invest in transitions programs. Incentives like bundled payments or episode-based payment reforms may be needed to promote integration of the delivery system and improve transitional care programs. A study analyzed different payment models, including pay-for-performance and episode-based payments, showing that hospitals' responses would vary based on payment incentives from different payors. The simulation suggested that payers could save money by reducing payments to low-performing providers for exceeding readmission benchmarks. In a simulation, low-performing hospitals did not change behavior when paid less for exceeding readmission benchmarks, while high-performing hospitals' payments remained unchanged. Only 7% of low-performing hospitals responded to payment penalties by implementing programs to reduce readmissions. Episode-based payment structures could motivate at least half of New York state hospitals to implement care transition programs. ACA included payment initiatives to encourage fee-for-service models and establish CCTP for high readmission hospitals. The ACA included payment initiatives to encourage hospitals to minimize rehospitalizations and coordinate patient care. This included the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) and a national bundled payment pilot program. HRRP reduces Medicare payments to hospitals with higher than expected readmission rates, starting in October 2012. CMS selects high-volume conditions with readmission measures endorsed by NQF, expanding to include additional conditions in FY2015. The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) identifies conditions for penalties based on excess readmissions in acute-care hospitals. The penalty is calculated using a floor adjustment factor or an excess readmissions ratio, resulting in reduced Medicare payments for hospitals with higher readmission rates. CMS is implementing the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) over two years, with penalties estimated to be around 0.2% of Medicare's IPPS payments in 2013. The program includes three readmission measures for high-volume conditions PN, AMI, and HF, with a 30-day time frame for readmissions. Medicare's time frame for readmissions is 30 days, endorsed by NQF and CMS. Hospitals will be assessed on readmissions over a three-year period starting in July 2008. IPPS hospitals with fewer than 25 cases in selected conditions will not face penalties. Critical access hospitals and IPPS exempt hospitals are also exempt from readmission penalties. The HRRP's risk-adjustment aims to address differences in patient characteristics across hospitals, but some argue that certain factors influencing readmissions are not considered. Hospitals with complex patient populations or in specific locations may struggle more to reduce readmission rates due to limited resources. Some hospitals face challenges in reducing readmission rates due to limited resources and location factors. Payment penalties only apply to hospitals, not other providers, potentially offsetting losses from readmissions. Annual caps on payments may also hinder HRRP's incentives to reduce readmissions. Hospitals may alter coding practices or transfer policies to avoid readmission penalties. They could target Medicare patients with specific diagnoses to minimize costs. The report discusses the focus on preventing readmissions for Medicare patients with specific diagnoses to minimize costs. It also mentions the National Payment Bundling Pilot Program and the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement Initiative, which involve making a single payment for a group of services instead of individual payments. Bundled payments aim to reduce Medicare costs, improve care quality, and enhance care coordination. The ACA established a pilot program for a single entity to receive payments for all services during a care episode. Implementation details are limited, with key decisions left to the Secretary. The pilot program for bundled payments under the ACA defines a care episode as three days prior to hospital admission, the hospital stay, and the first 30 days post-discharge. Participating providers must offer care coordination, medication reconciliation, discharge planning, and transitional care services. The pilot can cover up to 10 conditions, including chronic or acute conditions, surgical or medical conditions, with a focus on reducing readmissions and improving post-acute care. The pilot program for bundled payments under the ACA covers care episodes from three days prior to hospital admission through the first 30 days post-discharge. Conditions with significant variation in readmission or post-acute spending, high volume, or potential cost reduction without affecting quality are considered suitable for bundled payments. Payment methods include bundled payments and bids for episodes of care. An appropriate patient assessment instrument will be used to determine the most clinically appropriate post-acute care site. Site neutral quality measures will be developed, and participating entities must offer a choice of providers and suppliers to beneficiaries while ensuring budget neutrality. The pilot program for bundled payments under the ACA covers care episodes from three days prior to hospital admission through the first 30 days post-discharge. Conditions suitable for bundled payments are those with significant variation in readmission or post-acute spending, high volume, or potential cost reduction without affecting quality. Bundling payments for acute and post-acute care has the potential to reduce costs without compromising outcomes by changing incentives within FFS Medicare. Entities participating in the program must ensure budget neutrality and offer a choice of providers and suppliers to beneficiaries. With bundled payments, there is a strong incentive to coordinate care across settings and provide necessary post-acute care in the least expensive setting. However, challenges may arise in identifying providers willing to share payments. Monitoring post-hospital care is crucial to avoid unintended consequences, such as limiting access to necessary care. Bundled payments alone may not lower patient volume as hospitals and providers could profit from additional episodes of care. CMS has made implementation of bundled payments a priority. CMS has implemented a Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative to test innovative payment models. The project, starting in 2012, includes four bundled payment models where one payment covers all services during an episode of care for Medicare beneficiaries. Participating organizations have flexibility in determining episode length, target price, and participating providers. The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative by CMS includes four models where payments are made for all services during an episode of care for Medicare beneficiaries. Participating organizations have flexibility in determining episode length, target price, and participating providers. A post-episode monitoring period ensures that Medicare spending does not increase, with awardees paying for any excess expenditures. In bundled payment models, participants will receive a single bundled payment for the episode, allowing gainsharing arrangements for financial benefits from coordinated care efficiencies. Mandatory participation in gainsharing is not allowed. Model 1 involves reduced payments to hospitals under IPPS, with no change in Medicare Part B payments to physicians. Hospitals are financially responsible if Medicare expenditures exceed a threshold during the inpatient stay or 30 days post-discharge. Expenditures increase beyond a threshold for the period of the inpatient stay or 30 days post-discharge in Models 2 and 3 of bundled payment models. Medicare will pay providers at full rates, but payments will be reconciled with a target price. Aggregate Medicare expenditures will be compared to the target price after the episode of care concludes. In Model 4 of bundled payment, Medicare will make a single bundled payment to the acute-care hospital for all Part A and Part B services during the inpatient stay. The hospital will be responsible for distributing the payment to other providers. Payment is based on historical spending trends and the awardee will be financially responsible. The awardee is financially responsible for Medicare expenditures for related readmissions for at least 30 days. Program savings are not shared with beneficiaries. Providers receive a bundled payment for all eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Beneficiaries cannot opt out of the program for a specific provider but can choose a different one. Medicare requires hospitals to have a discharge planning process for all patients. Medicare incentivizes hospitals to improve discharge planning processes by modifying payment incentives and providing technical and financial assistance. Hospitals are encouraged to adopt care-transition programs to better manage patient discharge and reduce readmissions. Future penalties for hospitals with higher readmission rates may drive further improvements. Starting in October 2012, Medicare will increase the importance of publicly reported 30-day risk-adjusted readmission rates for aged Medicare patients with AMI, HF, and PN on its Hospital Compare website. Low-performing hospitals will face readmission penalties, while bundled payment methods aim to incentivize hospitals to avoid overutilization of services and improve care coordination. However, concerns have been raised about hospitals' control over readmissions, especially since the fee-for-service payment system still reimburses providers based on the volume of services provided. The payment changes in Medicare aim to reduce readmissions and improve care coordination, but concerns remain about hospitals' control over readmissions. Factors like post-acute and outpatient care quality, access to caregivers, and unique circumstances can influence readmission rates. CMS believes existing measures adjust for clinically relevant factors related to patient outcomes and encourages hospitals to collaborate with communities to lower readmission rates. Initiatives are in place to motivate hospitals to lower readmission rates and improve patient care, with a focus on understanding and addressing the complex issue of Medicare readmissions. CMS emphasizes the importance of monitoring implementation to avoid negative impacts on patient access to quality care. Appendix A outlines hospital actions that can help mitigate readmissions, including improving discharge procedures to provide clear and timely information to patients and caregivers. The discharge process in a hospital involves coordinating post-discharge services, medications, and follow-up appointments for patients. It is crucial to have a standardized process with clear roles and responsibilities among hospital staff to prevent adverse events and rehospitalization. Education for patients and caregivers should start early and continue throughout the hospitalization. The discharge process in hospitals should have a standardized discharge summary completed before discharge, including patient health records with medication information and a checklist. Discussions have included a potential requirement for hospitals to provide discharge instructions to community providers within 48 hours. Lapses in discharge planning can impact post-discharge care quality. Hospital personnel provide information to patients about test results, medications, and post-discharge care. Fragmented documentation can affect discharge planning and post-hospital care. A complete discharge summary should include pending test results. Improving patient-provider communication is crucial for effective management of a patient's condition. A study revealed deficiencies in documenting pending test results and follow-up provider information in discharge summaries. Timely access to patient information outside the hospital setting is essential for continuity of care. Inadequate communication between healthcare providers and patients can lead to medication non-compliance. Patients may struggle with medication compliance due to various factors such as limited understanding of their condition, cultural conflicts with instructions, cognitive impairment, and lack of access to services. The complexity of healthcare choices and the introduction of technology can make patient engagement challenging. Transitional care teams focus on educating patients about warning signs and coaching to empower patients to advocate for their own care. \"Activation\" in healthcare research is linked to better care quality. Patient resources like housing and caregivers can impact follow-up care. Post-discharge contact by hospital staff can improve communication and compliance. Studies show mixed results on the benefits of post-discharge telephone calls. Certain proponents advocate for a post-discharge phone call program to reinforce instructions, monitor patients, and intervene if needed, especially for high-risk patients. Predictive models are used to identify at-risk populations, but their success in predicting readmissions is limited. Targeting patients at risk of readmission involves complex questions and is debated among healthcare stakeholders. Predictive models for readmission risk have limited success. Hospitals can target high-risk patients for interventions based on recent admissions, longer stays, high-risk diagnoses, and diabetes. The HRRP program incentivizes hospitals to focus on managing readmissions for Medicare patients with specific conditions. Hospitals may find it more cost-effective to implement systemic changes rather than targeting specific patient populations. Accessing and Training Available Caregivers Caregivers\u2014family and friends who provide care without compensation\u2014can significantly impact hospital discharge and post-discharge activities for Medicare beneficiaries. Caregiver support can reduce the risk of hospital readmission for patients with compromised abilities due to aging or cognitive impairments. Patients with access to caregiver support have lower risk of hospital readmission compared to those living alone. Caregivers play a crucial role in addressing medication management, patient's condition, and post-discharge care. Involving caregivers in coaching sessions and training can improve the quality of assistance provided, potentially reducing readmissions. Hospitals aim to empower caregivers to provide strong support to discharged patients. Minimizing medical errors is crucial for discharged patients to prevent readmissions. Errors in diagnosis, treatment, medication, and surgery can lead to adverse events. Patients experiencing postsurgical adverse events have a higher risk of hospital readmission. Patients experiencing postsurgical adverse events have a one-third higher risk of hospital readmission. Efforts to minimize errors and their implications include system-wide quality improvements, new protocols and checklists, payment incentives or penalties for providers, and additional training requirements for hospital staff. Medicare COP requires hospitals to develop discharge plans and arrange post-hospital care for patients. In order to reduce hospital readmissions, hospitals should effectively communicate with post-acute providers and assist patients in scheduling follow-up appointments. Transitional care teams can play a crucial role in ensuring patients have access to necessary care after discharge. Transitional care programs aim to provide post-discharge support for patients, including creating after-hospital care plans with provider contact information, appointment schedules, and medication plans. These programs involve ongoing communication with patients through telephone or in-person visits, ensuring a smooth transition to post-acute care settings. Developing collaborations between providers and community organizations is crucial to improving transitions in care and reducing hospital readmissions. This involves working across organizational boundaries and enlisting the resources of community organizations to provide complementary services. Readmissions can be influenced by care provided by hospitals, outpatient physicians, post-acute providers, and supportive services in the community. Various programs target the health of patients beyond hospital walls to address these issues. Developing collaborations between providers and community organizations is crucial to improving transitions in care and reducing hospital readmissions. Programs targeting the health of at-risk individuals are run by local or state agencies, but coordination can be challenging due to lack of information sharing and financial relationships. Collective action among community providers can lead to a more efficient healthcare system and lower readmission rates. QIOs and others focus on reducing readmissions by bringing together resources. To reduce hospital readmissions, QIOs and others collaborate with providers and community organizations to understand patient populations and care deficiencies. Tracking patients across providers is crucial, as 20% to 40% are rehospitalized elsewhere. CMS collects and reports on hospital readmissions, with a readmission being an admission within a certain time frame after discharge. Different definitions of readmission rates can lead to a wide divergence in measures. Factors such as patient inclusion criteria, exclusion of certain cases, risk adjustment methods, and counting of multiple readmissions can all impact the reported rates. Technical decisions in defining readmissions can result in varying outcomes. Different technical decisions in defining readmissions can lead to different readmission rates and hospital performance rankings. There is no consensus on distinguishing preventable readmissions from unavoidable ones, resulting in different potentially preventable readmission rates. Five approaches to determining readmission measures will be discussed in this appendix. In this appendix, five approaches to determining readmission measures are discussed: the Jencks framework categorizes readmissions as planned or unplanned, potentially preventable or not; the Geisinger Health System warranty covers specified adverse events and/or readmissions from a particular surgery; UnitedHealthcare uses an all-cause measure defining preventable readmissions more narrowly than Jencks; the 3M approach defines preventable readmissions related to selected medical conditions; and the NQF all-cause readmission calculation adopted by CMS generally does not consider the relationship between index discharge and readmission. Unplanned readmissions within 30 days make up 90% of all 30-day readmissions, which could reduce Medicare expenditures. Readmissions can be categorized as related and unplanned, or related and planned, depending on the circumstances. Examples include readmissions for adverse events or scheduled follow-up care. Some readmissions are related and planned, while others are unrelated and planned or unplanned. Different approaches to defining readmissions are taken by payers, providers, hospitals, and health systems like Geisinger and UnitedHealthcare Group. Geisinger Health System and UHG define PPRs differently. Geisinger's ProvenCare program covers preoperative, inpatient, and postoperative care for nonemergency CABG surgery under one fixed price. Geisinger physicians agree not to be paid for readmissions within 90 days that are \"not unrelated\" to the initial surgery, such as atrial fibrillation, venous thrombosis, and postoperative infections. This approach helps Geisinger avoid distinguishing between clearly related and unrelated readmissions. In its reporting of readmission rates for California hospitals, UHG uses a different approach compared to Geisinger Health System. UHG distinguishes between readmissions that are clearly related and those that are possibly related to the surgery based on Medicare payment diagnostic categories. Only readmissions billed under the same MS-DRG or for infections are considered reasonably preventable by UHG. The approach involves comparing each patient with all other patients statewide with the same initial DRG to adjust for patient risk severity. In the 3M PPR approach, readmissions for a medical condition following an initial admission are considered preventable, while surgical readmissions are not. Medical readmissions include heart failure, pneumonia, and COPD, while surgical readmissions include cardiac stent placement and major surgeries. However, unintended results may occur, such as a patient admitted for a heart attack then readmitted for diabetes being considered a PPR. The 3M approach aims to refine the definition of preventable readmission by using APR-DRGs to classify patients and establish clinical relationships between initial and subsequent admissions. Expert panels assess if readmissions could have been prevented through quality care, discharge planning, follow-up, or improved coordination. The 3M approach refines preventable readmission definition using APR-DRGs to classify patients and establish clinical relationships between admissions. Exclusions include major malignancies, trauma, burns, and certain chronic conditions. The algorithm identifies readmissions within 7 to 30 days post-index hospital admission. Adjusted PPR rate is calculated using readmission chains as the numerator. The 3M approach uses APR-DRGs to define preventable readmissions by establishing clinical relationships between admissions. Exclusions are made for major malignancies, trauma, burns, and certain chronic conditions. The algorithm identifies readmissions within 7 to 30 days post-index hospital admission. The hospital's adjusted PPR rate is calculated by dividing the actual number of PPRs by the risk-adjusted expected number of PPRs. CMS addressed the use of the 3M PPR approach for HRRP in the FY2012 final rule, and although Florida uses this measure, it was not endorsed by NQF in 2009 due to concerns about the methodology used to specify clinically related admission-readmission pairs. The NQF Steering Committee and CMS disagreed on the reliability of judgments regarding preventable readmissions based on coded diagnoses. CMS adopted the risk-standardized 30-day readmission measures for HF, PN, and AMI, expanding to seven conditions in 2015. Only one readmission within 30 days post-discharge counts. The AMI 30-day risk-standardized readmission measure excludes certain planned follow-up procedures and patients discharged alive on the same day. Other exclusions include patients who die during initial hospitalization, same day readmissions for the same condition, transfers to another acute care facility, and patients who are. In the view of CMS, readmissions unrelated to the original admission should not disproportionately affect hospitals. Hospital advocates argue that the current exclusions for unrelated readmissions are insufficient. Hospital advocates argue that the current exclusions for unrelated readmissions are insufficient, as they believe hospitals will be penalized for readmissions beyond their control. They suggest conducting a study to identify common reasons for readmissions and recommend excluding patients with certain conditions. However, CMS declined to make additional exclusions in its FY2012 rulemaking. CMS will assess hospital performance on readmissions using a three-year measurement period starting in July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2011. The use of a three-year performance period and a 25 minimum case threshold generated public comments, but CMS finalized its proposal. The risk-standardization method adjusts for patients' medical history and comorbid conditions. The hierarchical logistic regression used by CMS also considers age, gender, and hospital-specific quality. Factors like admission source, discharge disposition, and socioeconomic status are not accounted for in the analysis. The risk adjustment methodology for readmission standards includes patient characteristics like medical diagnosis, age, and gender. Public comments during the FY2012 rulemaking process suggested including patient race, language proficiency, life circumstances, environmental factors, and socioeconomic status in the risk adjustment methodology to account for their impact on health outcomes. This could affect hospitals serving lower SES patients differently than those serving higher SES patients. CMS disagreed with commenters who suggested that the NQF-endorsed risk adjustment methodology used in the HRRP would harm minorities. They argued that the current methodology already adjusts for case-mix differences based on clinical status at admission, taking into account how race or SES may influence disease burden in patient groups. CMS believes that adjusting for patient race could obscure differences in quality of care received by different patient groups. Hospitals with a high proportion of minority patients are held to different quality standards. The risk-standardized readmission ratio measures relative performance, with ratios above one indicating worse performance. CMS uses hierarchical logistic regression modeling to calculate the ratio, adjusting for each hospital's unique quality of care for its patient population. The hierarchical model used in CMS measure development has been criticized for reducing variation in hospital performance, making it less useful for consumers. Small hospitals are particularly affected as they receive rates close to the national mean, underestimating excess readmissions, especially for those with high readmission rates. This methodology is also challenging to explain to the public and stakeholders familiar with observed over expected ratios. The methodology used in measuring hospitals' readmission rates can significantly impact the results. Boutwell and Jencks found varying 30-day readmission rates in Massachusetts hospitals under different methodologies: 3M PPR (10.7%), UHG (19.3%), and CMS all-cause (21.9%). Hospital rankings differed across methodologies, highlighting the importance of measure design in assessing readmission rates. The time interval between initial discharge and readmission affects readmission measures. CMS uses a 30-day period, but readmissions can occur within 7, 15, or 30 days. Longer time frames could lead to more Medicare savings. MedPAC reports annual spending of $5 billion for 7-day, $8 billion for 15-day, and $12 billion for 30-day readmissions. However, longer time frames pose challenges in identifying related readmissions and assigning responsibility for prevention. The curr_chunk discusses an illustrative example of the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program calculation, detailing the components of the formula and how it is applied in practice. It includes determining the excess readmissions ratio for the hospital and calculating aggregate payments for excess readmissions. The curr_chunk explains the calculation process for the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, including determining excess readmissions ratio, calculating aggregate payments, and applying adjustment factors to hospital payments for excess readmissions. The Hospital Readmission Reduction Program calculates penalties for excess readmissions by multiplying the base DRG payment amount for discharges by the adjustment factor. The penalty is determined by the number of patients with the condition, base DRG payment, and percentage of readmissions above expected. Excessive payments are totaled and divided by the hospital's total Medicare payments to derive a penalty percentage, capped depending on the year. An illustrative example for FY2013 is provided for better understanding. In FY2013, the hospital's excess payment ratio is not the adjustment factor used to calculate its readmission penalty. Some believe the penalty should only apply to readmissions for specific conditions, while others argue it should be based on the excessive number of readmissions for those conditions. Hospital advocates argue that the excess readmissions ratio in statute will lead to penalties exceeding Medicare payments. They suggest redefining the ratio as a percentage of Medicare excess readmissions to total admissions, capping penalties at actual Medicare payments. MedPAC notes that the current formula overestimates excess readmissions, but hierarchical models help adjust for hospital and national averages. The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) penalties may not provide enough incentives for hospitals to address readmissions. Hospitals with lower than average readmission rates face no financial penalty, leading some to question the effectiveness of the current penalty structure. Maintaining the status quo may be financially beneficial for hospitals facing penalties due to the costs of implementing transition care interventions and lost revenue from readmissions. The HRRP payment adjustment issues, including lost revenue from readmissions, are expected to receive significant attention during the upcoming IPPS rulemaking cycle."
