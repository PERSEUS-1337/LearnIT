    "title": "SB 1358",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 69433.5 of the Education Code states that only California residents are eligible for an initial Cal Grant award, with renewal dependent on residency, attendance, and academic progress. Part-time students cannot be discriminated against in award selection, and their award is based on their program time. First-time part-time students can receive a full-time renewal award if they become full-time students. The Cal Grant Program awards are given without discrimination based on various factors. Applicants cannot receive multiple Cal Grant awards simultaneously or exceed a certain amount over four to six years of full-time undergraduate study. The award can only be used for educational expenses leading to an undergraduate degree or certificate. The commission increases Cal Grant awards for students who accelerate college attendance during summer terms. The total amount a student can receive over four to six years cannot be increased by attending summer sessions. Recipients are notified of summer funding availability through various means. The commission may require reports and documents from award recipients and institutions. Cal Grant awards are for qualifying institutions only. Recipients can switch between Cal Grant A and B awards based on eligibility. Cal Grant awards can be renewed for up to six years. The total number of years of eligibility for Cal Grant awards can be up to six years, based on the student's educational level. Starting from the 2014-15 academic year, recipients previously disqualified for exceeding income levels or failing to meet minimum need thresholds may be eligible for renewal awards if they meet all program requirements and have remaining eligibility. Each year of ineligibility reduces renewal award eligibility by one full-time equivalent year. Starting from the 2015-16 academic year, recipients previously disqualified for exceeding income levels or failing to meet minimum need thresholds may be eligible for renewal awards if they meet all program requirements and have remaining eligibility. Each year of ineligibility reduces renewal award eligibility by one full-time equivalent year. For students in a five-year undergraduate program, Cal Grant A and B awards can be renewed for up to five years if financial need persists. Graduates pursuing teacher preparation programs may be eligible for an additional year of Cal Grant renewal if financial need continues. The Legislature intends to provide additional financial aid options for postsecondary students. Payment for an extra year is limited to courses needed for teaching authorization. Cal Grant renewal eligibility must not lapse more than 15 months before payment."
