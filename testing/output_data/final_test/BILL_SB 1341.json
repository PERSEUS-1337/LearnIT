    "title": "SB 1341",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 3041.5 of the Penal Code is amended to allow inmates to review their files before parole hearings and to speak on their own behalf during the hearing. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation designates a person to ensure all relevant facts are presented at parole hearings, including contradictory assertions. Inmates have the right to request a stenographic record of proceedings and if the hearing is to postpone or rescind parole, they have additional rights. The board sets a date for reconsideration of parole release to ensure a meaningful consideration of suitability. The parole board must provide written statements to inmates within 10 days of granting parole, outlining conditions for release and consequences of non-compliance. If parole is denied, a written statement with reasons and suggestions for beneficial activities while incarcerated must be provided within 20 days. The board schedules the next hearing, taking into account the views and interests of the victim. The parole board may consider granting parole 15 years after a denial, unless clear evidence shows a need for 10 more years of incarceration. Alternatively, parole may be considered 10 years after a denial, unless clear evidence shows a need for 7 more years of incarceration. After a parole denial, the parole board may consider granting parole after three, five, or seven years, depending on public and victim safety concerns. The board has the discretion to advance a hearing to an earlier date, not less than two years after a denial, if new information suggests a shorter period of incarceration is appropriate. The parole board must provide a written statement to the inmate within 10 days of rescinding parole, stating the reasons and scheduling the next hearing. The parole hearing is conducted as a de novo hearing, where prior findings are considered but not binding. The board may admit prior victim or witness testimony and determine the appropriate action based on specific criteria. An inmate can request the parole board to advance a hearing date by submitting a written request with notice to the board and the victim, citing new information that suggests early consideration for release. The parole board has the authority to decide on written requests for advancing a hearing date, considering the victim's views. The board can deny requests that do not meet requirements or lack sufficient justification for early release. Review by a court is limited to cases of manifest abuse of discretion by the board. An inmate can only submit one written request for a parole hearing every three years. After a denial of a request or a board decision to deny parole, the inmate must wait three years before submitting another request."
