    "content": "U.S. industry has a long history in spaceflight, with contractors building spacecraft for NASA, reconnaissance satellites for the DOD, and weather satellites for NOAA. The commercial space sector is growing, with a majority of U.S. satellites now owned and launched by commercial entities. Congressional and public interest is shifting towards commercial activities in space, such as reusable rockets and Earth-imaging satellites. Multiple federal agencies regulate the commercial space industry, with the FAA licensing commercial launch and reentry vehicles. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licenses commercial launch and reentry vehicles, NOAA licenses commercial Earth remote sensing satellites, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licenses commercial satellite communications. Various reform proposals have been made to streamline regulations on commercial space use. NASA is evolving in how it utilizes commercial space capabilities. The federal government is evolving in how it utilizes commercial space capabilities, including contracting with commercial service providers for cargo delivery and procuring communications bandwidth from commercial satellite companies. Congress primarily addresses these developments through oversight of agency programs and decisions on agency budgets, rather than through authorizing legislation. The federal government is exploring how to regulate and utilize commercial space capabilities. Key questions include consolidating regulatory frameworks, simplifying licensing processes, adjusting policies for new industry developments, and determining government activities that can be conducted by commercial entities. Key agencies involved include the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Commerce. The Department of Commerce regulates Earth remote sensing, promotes the U.S. space industry, and controls space technology exports. The Federal Communications Commission oversees satellite communications. Agency roles for functions like space situational awareness are still being determined. Before the 1980s, NASA launched satellites for private companies and foreign governments. The space shuttle, operational since 1982, aimed to replace expendable rockets for government and commercial payloads but couldn't meet all demand, leading to interest from launch vehicle manufacturers in offering launch services. In 1984, President Reagan designated the Department of Transportation as the lead agency for commercial expendable launch vehicle activities. The Office of Commercial Space Transportation was established to carry out these duties, later becoming part of the Federal Aviation Administration. Congress affirmed the establishment of AST and set out statutory requirements for commercial space launch regulation and licensing in the Commercial Space Launch Act. This act mandates that no person can launch a launch vehicle or operate a launch site within the United States without proper authorization. The Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC) provides information and recommendations to the Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST). AST licenses commercial launch and reentry vehicles through specific licenses for identified launches or reentries, and operator licenses for a family of similar vehicles over a period of years. For example, SpaceX is authorized to launch eight flights of the Falcon 9 rocket carrying specified satellites, while United Launch Alliance has a license for an unspecified number of flights. License LLO 18-113 authorizes United Launch Alliance to launch various versions of the Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida for five years. There have been a total of 299 licensed launches, including 24 in 2018. Additionally, there have been 17 licensed reentries, mostly by SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 allows AST to grant permits for experimental reusable launch vehicles that are suborbital. Launch permits have fewer requirements and a faster approval timeline than licenses. There have been a total of 44 permitted launches, with the most recent in October 2016. As of September 2018, there were no active launch permits. Commercial spaceports must also be licensed under 14 C.F.R. Part 420. As of September 2018, 11 spaceports held active launch site operator licenses, with several pending applications. Some spaceports are located at government launch facilities like Cape Canaveral Spaceport, while others are at commercial airports or purpose-built as commercial spaceports. Most licensed launches use three main sites: Cape Canaveral Spaceport in Florida, California Spaceport at Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Midatlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. The Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation requires launch providers to carry third-party liability insurance, with a maximum probable loss estimation method up to $500 million. The federal government indemnifies licensees for up to an additional $3.1 billion in case of a loss exceeding the required insurance amount. Congressional attention has been drawn to AST's method due to potential costs to the government if a claim exceeds the insured amount. The U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act mandated an update to AST's methodology for indemnification of commercial space launches. Congress periodically reviews the policy, which has been extended through September 2025. The increased development of crewed spacecraft has raised concerns about the safety regulations for human occupants. The U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act mandated an update to AST's methodology for indemnification of commercial space launches, with a focus on regulating the safety of human occupants on commercial spacecraft. AST has the authority to regulate design and operation to protect human health and safety, with limitations on addressing past serious incidents or high-risk events. The current moratorium is in effect until October 2023, with extensions granted in the CSCLA. Additionally, the Secretary of Transportation is tasked with facilitating the development of voluntary industry standards to enhance safety in commercial human spaceflight. The Committee on Commercial Spaceflight established a consensus standard for commercial spaceflight safety terminology and has draft standards in development. The FAA report to Congress identified indicators of industry readiness for a regulation-based safety framework. The FAA is working on developing a safety framework for the commercial spaceflight industry, with indicators of progress including voluntary safety reporting and consensus standards. The agency is also preparing for the transition with the authority and expertise in human spaceflight safety. President Trump's Space Policy Directive-2 directs the Department of Transportation to review regulations governing commercial launch and reentry licensing, with a deadline of February 1, 2019 for revisions or proposed rule changes. Key considerations include a single license for all operations and a shift to a more flexible licensing approach. The Space Frontier Act of 2018 aims to reform commercial space launch regulations by transitioning to a performance-based approach. Industry stakeholders have raised concerns about the pace and lack of engagement in this effort. Suggestions include elevating the head of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) to Assistant Secretary and potentially moving AST back to the Office of the Secretary of Transportation. The 2017 GAO study found that moving the Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) back to the FAA could be done administratively, with industry support but FAA opposition. Advantages include a unified industry contact, while disadvantages include coordination challenges. The impact on regulatory reform pace is uncertain, with differing stakeholder views. The study recommended identifying goals, costs, and benefits before reorganization. The Department of Commerce plays multiple roles in commercial space. The Department of Commerce has various roles in commercial space, including regulating and licensing space-based commercial remote sensing, promoting the commercial space industry, administering export controls for space technologies, and issuing licenses for private remote sensing space systems. NOAA's Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office oversees this authority, while the Advisory Committee on Commercial Remote Sensing provides information and recommendations. The Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office (CRSRA), established in 2002, issues licenses for operating imaging satellites. Licenses are posted on the CRSRA website and can be for individual satellites or constellations. Majority of licensees are corporations, colleges, and universities. CRSRA consults with US government agencies to address security concerns and ensure compliance with international obligations. In 2000, an agreement was made among the intelligence community and various government departments regarding commercial remote sensing regulations. Concerns exist in the industry about the time-consuming and nontransparent process. Recent legislation aims to strengthen the authority of the Secretary of Commerce and provide more clarity to license applicants. A review of the licensing regime was mandated by SPD-2, leading to a public comment period on regulatory reform in June 2018. The Commerce Department's Office of Space Commerce oversees commercial remote sensing licensing and regulatory processes, focusing on promoting investment in space activities and assisting commercial providers in conducting business with the government. The Office of Space Commerce oversees commercial remote sensing licensing and regulatory processes, promoting investment in space activities and assisting commercial providers in conducting business with the government. It also acts as an industry advocate within the executive branch to ensure space-related requirements are met using commercially available goods and services, promotes the export of space-related goods and services, and seeks to remove impediments to space commerce. The Office of Space Commerce, established under the Technology Administration Act of 1998, oversees commercial remote sensing licensing and regulatory processes. It is part of NOAA since 2005 and administers export licensing for space-related items through the Commerce Control List. The Department of State also administers a separate export licensing regime. The Department of State administers export licensing under the Arms Export Control Act via ITAR. Commercial satellites were moved between ITAR and the Commerce Control List due to industry complaints. Some space technologies are still subject to ITAR, while most fall under Export Administration Regulations. The Office of Space Commerce and FAA AST publish a guidebook on U.S. export controls for the commercial space industry. The U.S. Export Controls for the Commercial Space Industry were reviewed under SPD-2, leading to the establishment of the SPACE Administration within the Department of Commerce. The proposal involved relocating some offices and requesting Congress permission to move others under the reprogramming of FY2018 appropriations. In October 2018, the Department of Commerce proposed changing the Office of Space Commerce to the Bureau of Space Commerce, elevating the director to Assistant Secretary for Space Commerce. The bureau would oversee promotion, coordination, and regulation of commercial space activities, with the Assistant Secretary reporting directly to the Secretary of Commerce. The proposal did not explicitly place the bureau in the Office of the Secretary or transfer CRSRA to the new bureau, but directed the Secretary to act through the bureau for issuing commercial remote sensing regulations. Commercial satellites must obtain a license from the FCC to communicate using radio frequencies, as the FCC considers satellites to be radio stations in space and regulates which frequencies they can use. The FCC's authority to license commercial satellite communications comes from the Communications Act of 1934 and the ITU Radio Regulations. The FCC's licensing procedures for satellites go beyond regulating radio frequency use, including coordination with the ITU for orbital slot assignments. In early 2018, a license was denied for a small satellite deemed difficult to track by the Department of Defense. The FCC's Satellite Division grants licenses for U.S. commercial satellites under regulatory procedures, with 200 licenses granted as of September 2018. Additionally, the division allows U.S. market access for commercial satellites licensed by other countries. The FCC proposed a rule in May 2018 to streamline the licensing process for small satellites, aiming to reduce the burden on applicants. This includes creating a new license application category that has raised concerns among school and college researchers regarding the classification of small educational satellites. The FCC proposed a rule in May 2018 to streamline the licensing process for small satellites, aiming to reduce the burden on applicants. Small educational satellites are currently in the experimental category, and moving between categories could increase license fees for schools and colleges. Space Policy Directive\u20132 directed officials to provide a report on improving the global competitiveness of the US space sector through radio frequency spectrum policies. Multiple offices in the Department of State have roles in commercial space policy. The Office of Space and Advanced Technology (SAT) in the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES) is the primary State Department office for commercial space policy, representing the United States in consultations with other countries and international organizations. The Office of International Communications and Information Policy (CIP) in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs (EB) handles policies related to communications satellites and advocates for U.S. commercial business interests in telecommunications overseas. The Office of Commercial and Business Affairs (CBA) in the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs also advocates for U.S. commercial interests abroad. The Department of State, through various bureaus such as PM/DDTC and ISN, plays a role in controlling the export of commercial space technologies and advising on export license applications for commercial remote sensing satellites. Additionally, the Office of Space and Advanced Technology in the Bureau of OES represents the US in consultations on commercial space policy internationally. The Department of State controls the export of commercial space technologies and advises on export license applications for commercial remote sensing satellites. Numerous agencies regulate, oversee, and promote the commercial space industry, including NASA, DOD, U.S. Coast Guard, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, FCC, intelligence community, Department of the Interior, and NOAA. Commercial space companies must comply with various regulatory requirements, including financial and non-space-specific regulations. The National Space Council, established in 1989 and reestablished in June 2017, coordinates the development of national space policy involving multiple agencies. It is chaired by the Vice President and includes key officials from various departments. Regulations for commercial space industry are overseen by multiple agencies including NASA, DOD, U.S. Coast Guard, and others. SpaceX's sonic booms during rocket returns are regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service to prevent marine mammal harassment. The National Space Council, reestablished in June 2017, met for the first time in nearly 25 years in October 2017. Debris in Earth orbit poses a serious risk to spaceflight, including defunct satellites, rocket stages, and other man-made objects. The Space Surveillance Network tracks orbital debris larger than 10 centimeters, with over 21,000 objects of that size and 500,000 smaller ones. Collision with even tiny objects in orbit can be a threat due to their high speeds. In 1997, the U.S. Government developed the Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices to minimize debris, accidental explosions, collisions, and dispose of spacecraft components. Federal agencies and commercial space sector follow these principles for spacecraft operations and licensing requirements. The U.S. Government's Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (USGODMSP) are followed by federal agencies and commercial space sector for spacecraft operations and licensing requirements. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) incorporate these principles into their licensing requirements. Space Policy Directive-3 (SPD-3) issued in June 2018 directs NASA to update the USGODMSP and emphasizes the need for active debris removal in addition to debris prevention. The challenge of monitoring operational satellites and debris in orbit, known as space situational awareness (SSA), is closely related to orbital debris mitigation. The DOD Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) collects SSA data to project potential collisions and provides direction to satellite operators to avoid them, a process known as space traffic management (STM). DOD is authorized to provide SSA services and information to non-U.S. government entities under 10 U.S.C. \u00a72274. The DOD provides space situational awareness (SSA) data to commercial entities. Congress directed the Department of Transportation to study the feasibility of taking on this responsibility. The resulting report noted that most close approaches in orbit involve commercial systems and concluded that the Department of Transportation could release safety-related SSA data. The FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation is responsible for releasing safety-related SSA data on tracked objects. In contrast, SPD-3 designates the Department of Commerce as the civil agency for public release of DOD SSA data. It directs Commerce and Defense to develop a plan for providing basic SSA data and STM services, limiting the federal role to supporting standards and best practices. The American Space SAFE Management Act also identifies Commerce as the lead civil agency for SSA. The Department of Commerce is designated as the lead civil agency for SSA, with a directive to establish a program providing SSA services equal to or better than the current DOD program. The Secretary of Commerce is also tasked with promoting voluntary space traffic coordination guidelines and reporting biennially on STM developments. DOD's SSA authority was amended in 2018, limiting its role to providing data and services to commercial space companies starting in 2024. The act authorizes the provision of SSA data and services to commercial space companies and non-U.S. government entities for national security interests. It also requires a plan for another federal agency to provide SSA services. FAA, NOAA, and FCC regulations are considered to meet international space law requirements for commercial space activities. Congressional interest lies in regulating other commercial activities in space. In April 2016, the Office of Science and Technology Policy proposed giving the FAA the responsibility of \"mission authorization\" for commercial space activities not covered by current regulations. Some advocate for a hands-off approach, while others argue that compliance with treaty provisions does not require congressional action. The American Space Commerce Free Enterprise Act (H.R. 2809) aims to improve existing mechanisms for authorizing and supervising nongovernmental space activities. The bill would charge the Secretary of Commerce with issuing certifications for space object operations, with exceptions for entities holding FAA payload approval. The Space Frontier Act of 2018 (S. 3277) would allow the FAA to authorize nongovernmental space activities related to launch or reentry licenses. The Commerce Department's October 2018 proposal also addresses legislative changes for space activities. The Commerce Department's October 2018 legislative proposal aims to develop procedures for authorizing and supervising commercial space activities not covered by other Federal authorities. This includes regulating, overseeing, and promoting the commercial space industry, with the federal government also being a customer of commercial services. The proposal discusses various aspects such as commercial resupply of the International Space Station, commercial launch of government satellites, and potential government use of in-space services like satellite repair and refueling. The section discusses NASA's reliance on the space shuttle for transporting cargo and crews to the International Space Station (ISS) before its retirement in 2011. Since then, ISS cargo has been carried by various spacecraft, including U.S. commercial providers like SpaceX and Northrop Grumman. NASA also awarded a contract to Sierra Nevada Corporation for ISS cargo missions starting in 2020. The discussion also includes potential government use of future in-space services and new commercial initiatives proposed by NASA. NASA has contracts with SpaceX and Boeing to transport ISS astronauts, with crewed demonstration flights planned for 2019. Operational crewed flights are projected to start in late 2019 or 2020. Congressional debates highlight potential issues for other agency programs utilizing commercial space capabilities, including competition concerns. During NASA's funding of potential providers, Congress debated the need for multiple providers to ensure competition and future cost savings. A commercial approach may require agencies to use unfamiliar contracting models, such as Space Act Agreements, for development phases of ISS cargo and crew programs. This approach offers flexibility and cost-sharing options. NASA is using fixed-price contracts under the Federal Acquisition Regulation for procurement of ISS transportation services, which reduces financial risk but may limit government insight into contractor management. Agencies using commercial space capabilities may face challenges in ensuring requirements are met, as seen in NASA's safety certification process for ISS crew transportation providers. NASA's certification plans have drawn attention from Congress, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, and other stakeholders. A GAO analysis in July 2018 highlighted concerns about the program's ability to assess key deliverables in a timely manner, posing a schedule risk. Presidential directives and statutory requirements have mandated U.S. civil government agencies to support the domestic commercial launch industry by contracting with commercial launch providers. The Federal Government must acquire space transportation services from US commercial providers whenever needed. NASA and the US Air Force manage commercial launches through different programs. SpaceX was certified for providing launch services. The Air Force announced awards to United Launch Alliance, Blue Origin, and Northrop Grumman for new launch vehicles. Launches by the US Government do not require FAA licenses, except for certain exceptions like the National Reconnaissance Office satellite launch in May 2017. Several government agencies are utilizing commercial satellite data to supplement their own capabilities. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and NASA have pilot programs to acquire data from commercial satellites for various purposes, such as Earth science and weather forecasting. The intelligence community is also incentivizing the development of automated methods for analyzing high-resolution satellite imagery. The government agencies, including NASA and NOAA, are exploring the use of commercial satellite data for weather forecasting. There are concerns about the limitations on data dissemination when acquiring data commercially, as opposed to using their own satellites. The commercialization of NOAA weather satellites is prohibited by the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992. Additionally, agencies like the Department of Defense lease commercial satellite bandwidth to supplement their own capabilities. The Department of Defense has become increasingly reliant on commercial satellite communications, spending over $1 billion in FY2011. NASA is considering public-private partnerships for space communications, and there are opportunities for commercial providers to offer in-space services to government agencies, such as satellite servicing and orbital debris removal. NASA Authorization Act of 2018 allows for these partnerships. The NASA Authorization Act of 2018 (H.R. 5503) directs NASA to acquire in-space services commercially and use \"space products\" to the greatest extent practicable. NASA's FY2019 budget proposes relying on commercial partners for ISS research by 2025 to develop the commercial space industry and reduce costs in low Earth orbit. The NASA Authorization Act of 2018 directs NASA to use commercial services in space and reduce costs in low Earth orbit by partnering with commercial entities. However, a skeptical response from some Members of Congress and stakeholders raised concerns about the feasibility of fostering increased commercial activity in low Earth orbit within the proposed timeline. NASA's National Space Exploration Campaign aims to transition U.S. human spaceflight in LEO to commercial operations, support ISS transition, develop commercial orbital platforms, and fund commercial lunar landers for Moon exploration. The Federal Acquisition Regulation prohibits contracts for inherently governmental functions, with Congress providing guidance on this. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 highlighted the importance of a strong commercial sector in supporting NASA's space exploration program. Non-inherently governmental activities, such as supplying water and fuel to low Earth orbit, can be provided commercially. The Federal Acquisition Regulation prohibits contracts for inherently governmental functions, with Congress providing guidance on this. The NASA Authorization Act of 2008 emphasized the importance of a strong commercial sector in supporting NASA's space exploration program. Non-inherently governmental activities, such as supplying water and fuel to low Earth orbit, can be provided commercially. Agencies have discretion in deciding whether to conduct activities in-house or procure them commercially based on factors like operational nature, technology requirements, and technical capabilities comparison with the private sector. NASA has chosen to use commercial launch services for carrying cargo and crews to the ISS, instead of developing new government-owned spacecraft. The technology is mature, with a focus on cost reduction and reliability improvement. NASA is developing its own spacecraft for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, with each mission being unique. Launch beyond Earth orbit is still challenging, with few missions conducted since 1972. NASA has chosen to use commercial launch services for carrying cargo and crews to the ISS, instead of developing new government-owned spacecraft. Launch beyond Earth orbit has few identifiable commercial customers, with NASA focusing on building Orion and the SLS for deep space missions. The commercial market for Landsat data has evolved, with some studies revisiting user willingness to pay for images. As Congress considers key policy questions regarding commercial space activities, proposals for consolidating regulatory functions and simplifying the licensing process are being discussed. Congress has shown little interest in transferring regulatory responsibilities between agencies so far. The challenge in interagency consultation on commercial remote sensing licenses lies in balancing industry's timeliness and transparency needs with government's national security objectives. As the commercial space industry evolves, federal regulatory policies may need adjustments to accommodate new capabilities. Additionally, for commercial human spaceflight, Congress may consider lifting limitations on FAA safety regulations as the industry matures. The commercial space industry is evolving, and there are proposals for new mechanisms for authorization and supervision under the Outer Space Treaty. Satellite servicing may raise issues for space situational awareness. Government and industry collaboration is crucial as commercial space capabilities expand, creating opportunities for agencies to work with commercial entities. The creation of a Space Force within DOD could also lead to new opportunities, but stakeholders may not always agree on suitable programs for a commercial approach. Stakeholders may disagree on suitable programs for commercial approach due to differing perspectives on government and industry roles, technical maturity, and commercial demand. Debates also focus on structuring agency-contractor relationships through public-private partnerships or contracting approaches."
