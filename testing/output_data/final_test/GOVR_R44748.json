This rule did not increase spending but targeted existing funds differently. Several bills in the 114th Congress aimed to apply the 10-20-30 rule. This report discusses the application of the 10-20-30 rule to other programs and executive departments in the 114th Congress. It explains the definition of \"persistent poverty\" and how different interpretations and data sources can result in varying lists of persistently poor counties. The report does not compare the rule against other policy options or examine its applicability to different programs or policy goals. Research suggests that areas with a poverty rate of 20% or higher face more severe systemic issues than lower-poverty areas. The poverty rate of 20% is a critical point discussed in academic literature for examining social characteristics of high-poverty versus low-poverty areas. High-poverty areas have lower property values and less return on investment, leading to financial disincentives for property owners. The ill effects of high poverty rates are documented in both urban and rural areas, suggesting the need for policy interventions at the community level. Poverty rates are computed by the Census Bureau for different geographic areas, with the official definition based on family income. The poverty rate is determined by comparing family income to a poverty threshold, with rates calculated based on counts of persons below the threshold in a county. Data sources for poverty estimates include the American Community Survey and the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program. After Census 2000, the decennial census no longer collects income information, leading to the need to decide between using ACS or SAIPE poverty estimates for determining persistently high poverty rates at the county level. The ACS provides continuous measurement of various topics, similar to the decennial census. The ACS provides continuous measurement of a wide range of topics at the local community level, while the SAIPE program specifically estimates poverty at the county level for school-age children and the overall population. SAIPE data are available annually and reflect one calendar year, unlike the ACS which covers a five-year time span. The Census Bureau recommends using SAIPE poverty estimates for funding allocations for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The SAIPE poverty estimates are suitable for county-level estimates, especially for counties with small populations. For more detailed demographic and economic information, the ACS is recommended. SAIPE data use administrative data to reduce uncertainty in estimates for small population counties, while ACS estimates are available for a wider array of geographic levels. The ACS provides estimates for various geographic areas, but only in five-year ranges for smaller areas. SAIPE data, based on a single year, are more current. Poverty status is not defined for those in institutions or military barracks, and the homeless population is not counted in poverty statistics. The ACS does not count homeless individuals not in shelters in poverty statistics. SAIPE estimates use SNAP and tax data, indirectly reflecting some homeless individuals. College dorm residents are not defined for poverty status, but off-campus students are included. Counties with many off-campus students may have higher poverty rates due to lower money income. The 10-20-30 rule was developed to identify counties with persistently high poverty rates, but it may not be flexible enough to target counties that have recently fallen on hard times. Other economic measures may be more appropriate for counties experiencing a recent spike in poverty rates. In ARRA, persistent poverty counties were defined as those with 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty. Persistent poverty counties are identified as those with a poverty rate of at least 20% over the past 30 years. Two approaches can be used to compile this list: using poverty rates of 20.0% in all three years or rates that round up to 20% or higher. The former approach is more restrictive, resulting in a shorter list, while the latter is more inclusive. The rounding method and data source selection significantly impact the number of counties listed as persistent poverty counties. Using different rounding methods and data sources can result in a variation of approximately 80 to 100 counties in a given year. The list of persistent poverty counties is based on data from the 1990 Census, Census 2000, and the 2015 SAIPE estimates, including counties with poverty rates of 19.5% or greater. The curr_chunk discusses how poverty rates are calculated using data from household surveys and the importance of sample size for accurate estimates in smaller geographic areas. It also mentions that a national-level survey can provide reliable estimates for the entire United States without needing responses from every county. Before the mid-1990s, the decennial census was the only data source with a sample size large enough to provide meaningful estimates at the county level. One-sixth of all U.S. households received the census long form, which included income questions, allowing for poverty estimates for every county in the nation. The decennial census long form provided poverty estimates for every county in the nation, but it was discontinued after Census 2000. The American Community Survey (ACS) and the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program (SAIPE) were developed in the mid-1990s to ensure poverty data for small areas like counties are still available. The ACS replaced the long form and was designed to provide detailed information on small communities more frequently than every 10 years. The American Community Survey (ACS) collects information continuously from respondents every month to provide estimates for small communities more frequently than the decennial census. One-year estimates are pooled for geographic areas with 65,000 or more persons, while five-year estimates are used for the smallest geographic levels, including all U.S. counties. Data collection is ongoing, but the publication of data occurs once a year for both types of estimates. The Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program was developed in the 1990s to provide poverty estimates for local areas between census years. Congress recognized the need for more current poverty data for disadvantaged communities in the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994. SAIPE estimates are model-based, using survey and administrative data for Title I-A funding allocations. The modeling procedure combines survey data and administrative data to produce more stable estimates, especially for counties with small populations. The U.S. Census Bureau provides guidance on choosing the appropriate data source for income and poverty analysis. The CPS ASEC is recommended for national analysis, while the ACS is preferred for subnational data. Users seeking state-level trends before 2006 should use CPS ASEC 2-year averages, and the ACS is recommended for 1-year estimates at the state level. The SAIPE program produces poverty and household income estimates with smaller standard errors than direct survey estimates. Users should use SAIPE for comparing poverty and income estimates for counties or school districts, especially for populations under 65,000. The ACS is recommended for other characteristics like poverty among Hispanics or median earnings. The SIPP provides longitudinal poverty data at the national level and reliable state-level estimates for select states since 2004. The SAIPE program provides poverty estimates for smaller geographic areas with lower standard errors. It is recommended for comparing poverty and income estimates for counties or school districts. The program also offers poverty estimates for different time periods, including monthly rates."
