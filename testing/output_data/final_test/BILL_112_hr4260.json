    "content": "The \"Adjusting for Income Disparity Act of 2012\" includes a new section called \"Income Disparity Credit\" in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Income Disparity Credit\" section allows individuals to claim a credit against their tax for the taxable year based on their income disparity credit amount. This amount is determined by the applicable credit amount, percentage, and phaseout threshold in relation to the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. The phaseout thresholds for the Income Disparity Credit are as follows:\n- No dependents: $2,500 credit, 3 1/3 percentage, $15,000 threshold\n- 1 dependent: $4,000 credit, 5 1/3 percentage, $20,000 threshold\n- 2 dependents: $4,500 credit, 6 percentage, $25,000 threshold\n- 3 or more dependents: $5,000 credit, 6 2/3 percentage, $30,000 threshold. Definitions and Special Rules for the Income Disparity Credit include the meaning of 'dependent' and 'modified adjusted gross income'. The Income Disparity Credit is subject to certain rules for married individuals filing joint returns, a limit on excessive investment income, and ineligibility for dependents. No credit under this section for any taxable year of an individual beginning in the calendar year if they are a nonresident alien unless treated as a resident of the United States. Principal place of abode must be in the United States for more than half of the taxable year to be eligible for the credit. The Earned Income Credit requires an individual to have their principal place of abode in the United States for more than half of the taxable year. Military personnel stationed outside the US are subject to similar rules. A minimum of 390 hours of service is required for the credit, with special rules for self-employment. The Earned Income Credit requires the inclusion of TINs for individuals and dependents on the tax return claiming the credit. Dollar amounts for the credit are adjusted for inflation annually. The Earned Income Credit requires TINs for individuals and dependents on tax returns claiming the credit, with annual inflation adjustments. Increases in the credit are rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The amendments made by sections 3 and 4 accelerate the sunset dates for certain tax relief acts to December 31, 2011."
