    "content": "Millions of people worldwide flee their homes and cross borders due to threatening circumstances, including refugees and asylum-seekers. A refugee is someone fleeing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Asylum-seekers are individuals who claim refugee status but have not been evaluated. The UNHCR registers and assists this population, contributing to a statistical database for tracking and analysis. The UNHCR database tracks refugee and asylum-seeker inflows in the United States and other OECD countries. The recent economic downturn may impact the worldwide population of concern, leading to resource shortages and potential food-based migration. The economic downturn may lead to food-based migration and conflict, impacting refugee and asylum-seeker inflows. The United States is facing economic challenges, raising questions about increasing admissions of refugees. Comparing refugee inflows in the US and other OECD countries provides valuable insights for Congress. The report aims to provide Members of Congress with a comparative data context on how policies in the United States and other OECD countries are impacting refugee and asylum-seeker inflows. It highlights that there is no uniform trend across OECD countries regarding these inflows, with a focus on asylum-seekers due to less political support. The analysis will discuss policy developments in OECD countries that may affect refugee and asylum-seeker flows. Several OECD countries, including the United States, have seen a convergence in asylum-seeker inflows, with levels lower than in the 1990s. Countries on the EU periphery have experienced an increase in asylum-seeker inflows due to geographic proximity to non-EU countries. The United States remains the main host country for resettled refugees globally, despite lower numbers compared to a decade ago. The United States and other OECD countries have seen a decline in refugee resettlements over the past decade. Despite this, the United States remains the main host country for resettled refugees globally. Refugee policy in these countries is based on the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the subsequent 1967 Protocol, aiming to provide sanctuary to individuals fleeing persecution. Under the UN Convention and 1967 Protocol, states must provide admitted refugees with rights like access to courts, employment, education, healthcare, and artistic expression. Nonrefoulment principle prohibits expulsion of refugees to dangerous territories. OECD countries offer permanent sanctuary. US refugee law shaped by conflicts in South and Central America in the 1970s and 1980s. The current U.S. law, shaped by conflicts in South and Central America in the 1970s and 1980s, and the collapse of the former Soviet Union, led to the Refugee Act of 1980. This Act established a uniform procedure for refugee admissions and provided federal assistance for their resettlement and self-sufficiency under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Refugees and asylees are individuals who are unable or unwilling to return to their country due to persecution. They can be admitted to the United States from abroad or apply for asylum within the country. Aliens arriving without proper documents may undergo expedited removal, but those expressing fear of persecution receive a \"credible fear\" review. The U.S. law addresses certain populations facing civil unrest, violence, or natural disasters, offering temporary protected status or relief from removal. The UNHCR deals with refugee issues globally, categorizing refugees and asylum-seekers as \"populations of concern.\" The UNHCR categorizes refugees and asylum-seekers as \"populations of concern.\" Refugees and asylum-seekers undergo a \"status determination\" to determine their eligibility for sanctuary in a host country. The 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol set standards for evaluating claims for sanctuary, but individual states determine their own procedures for granting protective status. Evaluations are done by national government programs, UNHCR, or jointly operated programs. Despite UNHCR evaluation programs, host countries have final authority to grant sanctuary. UNHCR tracks data on \"populations of concern\" including refugees, asylum-seekers, and IDPs. In 2007, the worldwide population of concern was... In 2007, the global population of concern was around 31.7 million, with refugees making up 36%, asylum-seekers 2%, internally displaced persons 43%, and other populations 19%. The number of refugees increased by 15% to 11.4 million in 2007 due to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The global population of concern in 2007 was around 31.7 million, with refugees making up 36%, asylum-seekers 2%, internally displaced persons 43%, and other populations 19%. Asylum-seekers decreased from 1.1 million in 2001 to 740,000 in 2007, a 32% decline. The population of internally displaced persons grew to nearly 13.7 million in 2007, a twofold increase since 2005. Africa and Asia were the main regions of origin for the populations of concern in 2007. In 2007, the global population of concern was around 31.7 million, with refugees making up 36%, asylum-seekers 2%, internally displaced persons 43%, and other populations 19%. Among OECD countries, the United States stands out for its large-scale resettlement of refugees, while most OECD countries do not participate in refugee resettlement. Resettlements are used as a protection tool and durable solution for resettled individuals. OECD countries do not participate in refugee resettlement, fulfilling 1951 Convention terms by processing asylum-seekers within their borders. Only 12 other OECD Member States have participated in resettlement in the past decade, with countries like Australia, Canada, and the United States leading in resettling thousands of refugees annually. The United States has consistently resettled more refugees than all other OECD countries combined since 1994. The United States experienced a decline in refugee inflows post-9/11, but saw an upward trend since 2002, resettling over 48,000 refugees in 2007. In contrast, other OECD countries resettled between 22,000-32,000 refugees annually from 1996 to 2007. The OECD as a whole resettled at least 50,000 refugees annually, not exceeding 1% of the worldwide refugee population total. Refugee resettlement is a challenging and resource-intensive process, with only a small percentage of refugees chosen for resettlement. Close coordination with national governments and NGOs is required for identifying and screening candidates. While some argue that more refugees could be resettled in industrialized countries, the significant size of the worldwide refugee population is evident. The fluctuations in refugee resettlement worldwide are largely influenced by changes in inflows to the United States. From 1994 to 2001, the US contributed 73% to 77% of refugee resettlement in OECD countries, affecting resettlement patterns globally. Since 2003, the mirroring pattern continued, with changes in the ratio more likely due to the worldwide decline in the refugee population rather than US inflows. The United States accounted for 58%-67% of total OECD refugee resettlement inflows from 2003 to 2007, representing a decrease from the mid-1990s. Policy approaches towards refugees are influenced by countries' views on immigration. The US, Canada, and Australia have proactive immigration policies, while many European countries historically had restrictive policies. This is reflected in the US accepting hundreds of thousands of permanent immigrants annually, resulting in refugees constituting a smaller share. In contrast to the US, many European countries prefer temporary immigration and view asylum as a loophole. The influx of asylum-seekers has strained resources and led to dissatisfaction with the asylum system. Policymakers are wary of repeating the burden caused by past waves of migrants. Many European countries have restrictive policies towards asylum-seekers due to past burdens caused by waves of migrants. The lack of geographic barriers in Europe makes some countries more susceptible to asylum-seeker inflows. The expansion of the European Union has raised concerns about the impact of free movement on various countries. EU countries are increasingly coordinating immigration and asylum-seeker policies, with a focus on restricting flows from outside the EU area. Security concerns have prompted new European security-based provisions that may impact asylum-seekers. The concept of \"country reception capacity\" is being used to determine security risks posed by unauthorized immigrants. Many OECD countries are struggling with illegal migration issues. The challenge for many countries is distinguishing between illegal economic migrants and genuine asylum-seekers. OECD countries, with strong economies, are attractive destinations for asylum-seekers seeking upward mobility. Policymakers are grappling with how to control inflows without excluding legitimate asylum-seekers. Strong economies incentivize both authorized and unauthorized migration. Recent asylum-seeker policies in OECD countries assume asylum-seekers are economically rational actors. Proactive measures, like safe third-country agreements, aim to control asylum-seeker inflows. Efforts to control inflows embrace the concept of \"beggar thy neighbor.\" In the context of asylum flows, some OECD countries employ policies that shift asylum-hosting obligations and costs to other countries, a practice known as \"beggar thy neighbor.\" This approach is seen as either avoiding obligations or ensuring an equitable distribution of costs in sheltering asylum-seekers and refugees. The United States has implemented some of these policy mechanisms, while others are unique to different OECD member states. U.S. policymakers have long been concerned about controlling the mass inflow of asylum-seekers, with measures in place prior to 1996 to address aliens arriving without proper immigration documents. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) made significant changes to the asylum process, including expedited removal proceedings, time limits on filing claims, and limited judicial review in certain circumstances. Critics argued that illegal aliens were abusing the system by filing frivolous asylum claims and obtaining work authorizations while their cases were backlogged. The IIRIRA of 1996 implemented reforms to the asylum process, including detaining foreign nationals with credible fear claims, consequences for frivolous applications, and delaying work authorization for asylum applicants. It also codified regulatory changes made by previous administrations. The IIRIRA of 1996 implemented reforms to the asylum process, including detaining foreign nationals with credible fear claims and consequences for frivolous applications. One form of cost shift and inflow control in the OECD has been through \"safe third country\" provisions, limiting asylum requests based on persecution from coercive population control policies to 1,000 each year. Safe third-country agreements allow receiving countries to refuse asylum determinations if the asylum-seeker passed through a country responsible for examining the application. The UNHCR supports responsibility-sharing agreements between states to enhance international protection of refugees. The U.S.-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, in place since 2004, allows for the orderly handling of asylum applications. The U.S.-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, in place since 2004, allows for the orderly handling of asylum applications. UNHCR independently monitors the program's implementation and offers recommendations. During the first year, 66 claims were made at land border points of entry, with 62 subject to the agreement. Canadian authorities returned 303 individuals to the U.S. under the agreement. The concept of a safe third-country mechanism originated in the 1990 Dublin Convention of EU Member States. The Dublin Convention and subsequent agreements outline responsibilities for accepting third country asylum-seekers. Critics raise concerns about unilateral application of safe third countries, leading to \"refugees-in-orbit\" scenarios. EU Member States have third country responsibilities, but non-Member States do not have the same requirements. Since 1999, the EU has been working on harmonizing minimum standards for granting refugee status and creating an EU list of safe third countries. Bilateral safe third country agreements have led to mismatched lists among EU Member States. OECD countries outside the EU have also implemented their own safe third country provisions, potentially affecting the distribution of asylum-seekers. The United Kingdom, located in Europe, has refused consideration to around 20,200 asylum-seekers from 1996 to 2007. Policy mechanisms in some OECD countries aim to control asylum-seeker inflows and deter fraud. Critics argue that some migrants engage in \"asylum shopping.\" Some migrants engage in \"asylum shopping\" to maximize benefits and positive asylum outcomes. Countries like the United States use deterrence mechanisms like expedited removal and the REAL ID Act. Shared databases and biometric identifiers help track asylum-seekers to prevent benefit-seeking migration. The European Pact requires Member States to issue biometric visas, establish an electronic entry/exit system, and regularize unauthorized individuals on a \"case-by-case\" basis. The UK introduced programs to prevent asylum shopping, focusing on fraud, illegal immigration, and human smuggling. One program replaced cash benefits with vouchers for asylum-seekers. The UK Home Office replaced cash benefits with vouchers for asylum-seekers, but faced operational problems and complaints leading to embarrassment. The voucher program was eventually replaced with \"smart card\" identification requirements. In the United States, asylum-seekers are banned from receiving public benefits until they become legal permanent residents. The UK government implemented a dispersal scheme to send asylum-seekers throughout the country to control inflows and distribute service costs. However, critics argue that the policy has been harsh and linked to increased racism, harassment, and violence against refugees. Studies have shown that better communication between authorities and refugee groups could ease tensions. Asylum applications in the UK rose sharply from 1996 to 2002 but then dropped significantly by 2007. The introduction of measures to control asylum flows raised ethical concerns for advocacy groups. Despite a recent reduction in new asylum applications, tensions persist around deterrence mechanisms and asylum-seekers, fueling political and social divisions. The EU's \"beggar thy neighbor\" policy has raised concerns, leading some to label it as \"Fortress Europe.\" While data show a decrease in asylum-seeker inflows in OECD countries, they remain the largest inflow population. The number of asylum-seekers in OECD countries has decreased in recent years, with a 50% drop from 2001 to 2005. This trend may be due to inflow control policies, but other factors like regional stability could also play a role. Larger OECD states are converging in asylum-seeker admissions, with some countries experiencing increasing inflows. Overall, asylum-seeker numbers still exceed historical lows from the past two decades. The asylum-seeker admissions in OECD countries have been decreasing, with a 50% drop from 2001 to 2005. The convergence trend of the five major recipient countries - the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada - is evident from 1996 to 2007. These countries have shown a convergence in their annual refugee admissions, with variations in inflow rates driven by decreases in some countries and increases in others. Since 2002, asylum-seeker inflows in OECD countries have shown a downward trend. The United States has been a major recipient, with its share fluctuating between 13% and 19% annually from 2002 to 2007. In 2007, the U.S. received 17% of the total asylum-seeker inflows in OECD countries, while Germany, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom each received approximately 6-9%. Other OECD countries accounted for the remaining 26% of asylum-seeker inflows. The significant increase in asylum-seeker inflows in certain smaller Member States of the European Union may be attributed to third-country policies. These countries serve as access points to the EU by land or sea, making them especially subject to asylum-seeker inflows. Greece, Poland, and Sweden have experienced increases in asylum-seeker inflows, as shown in Figure 5. The asylum-seeker inflows in Poland, Sweden, and Greece increased significantly from 1996 to 2007. Sweden had the largest absolute increase, with inflows rising from less than 6,000 to over 36,000. Poland's inflow rate tripled, while Greece saw a more than 15-fold increase. Other European \"portal countries\" also experienced increases in asylum-seeker inflows during the same period. Anti-immigrant groups in countries with high inflow levels have criticized their governments. Anti-immigrant groups criticize governments for high asylum-seeker inflows, questioning if positive asylum decisions attract more seekers. Efforts to reduce incentives for asylum-seekers focus on public benefits. The relationship between positive decisions and inflow rates is debated, with a wide range of decision rates among OECD countries. The decision rates for asylum applications varied significantly among OECD countries from 2004 to 2007. Turkey had the highest annual positive decision rate at around 78%, while Greece only granted positive asylum decisions in 1% of cases. The United States had a higher average positive decision rate compared to most OECD countries during this period. The data suggest that the positive decision rates do not necessarily correlate with the inflow levels of asylum-seekers. The positive decision rates for asylum applications varied among OECD countries from 2004 to 2007. Despite different trends, Canada and Poland had similar average positive asylum decision rates. Greece had a high increase in asylum-seeker inflows but the lowest positive decision rate. Statistical analysis confirms these observations, suggesting that factors like accessibility, cultural ties, and family connections drive asylum-seekers more than positive decision rates. The data analysis focused on refugee inflows in OECD Member States, emphasizing the economic costs and population size. Using economic and demographic indicators, the section aimed to provide a comparative context for understanding the burden of refugee populations. The analysis considered a country's existing refugee population in relation to national income and productivity, using GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity to assess the financial burden. The analysis focused on refugee inflows in OECD Member States, using GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity to assess the financial burden. The United States and Germany had the highest relative burden in hosting refugees, ranking in the top 35 worldwide. The majority of OECD countries had one refugee per $1 GDP (PPP) per capita or less. The United States had a burden 11 times greater than most OECD countries for the 2002-2006 period. Iceland had over 100 times fewer refugees than the United States relative to national income. Another way to measure burden sharing is by considering a country's existing population. The United States had 1.7 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants. The United States had 1.7 refugees per 1,000 inhabitants, ranking 56th worldwide. The highest ratios were in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Norway. OECD countries averaged 1.0 or fewer refugees per 1,000 inhabitants. Refugees are the costliest recipients of public benefits in the US, but the benefits of hosting them cannot be quantified in monetary terms. Refugee populations in the United States contribute to multicultural diversity and economic development. Notable refugees like Albert Einstein and Madeleine Albright have made significant contributions to the country. The benefits of hosting refugees go beyond monetary costs and include contributions to political, economic, cultural, and religious life. The United States resettles more refugees and has a higher inflow rate of asylum-seekers than any other OECD country. Positive asylum decisions are above the OECD average, but millions of refugees worldwide are growing, especially with the economic downturn. Balancing resources against the demand for refugee assistance will continue to be a challenge."
