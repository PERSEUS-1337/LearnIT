    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Indonesia Military Assistance Accountability Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The Congress finds that political stability and economic growth in Indonesia are crucial to the national interests of the United States. However, the Government of Indonesia, including the armed forces, is denying democratic freedoms, human rights, labor rights, and environmental participation rights. The government is currently in a period of crisis. The Government of Indonesia is in crisis due to extensive human rights violations, suppression of dissent, interference with the media, and corruption. The armed forces play a key role in preserving nondemocratic rule in the country. The Government of Indonesia is preserving nondemocratic rule by repressing dissent and interfering with parliamentary elections, jeopardizing the upcoming May 1997 elections. They deny political rights to opposition candidates and refuse to recognize independent trade unions. The Indonesian government is cracking down on dissent by arresting union leaders and harassing civil society organizations. The armed forces also continue to occupy East Timor in violation of UN resolutions. The armed forces in East Timor are violating UN resolutions by carrying out torture, killings, and other human rights abuses. Bishop Carlos Felipe Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos Horta were awarded the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor. They are seen as inspirations for peace in the region. One-third of East Timor's population has perished due to various causes. The Indonesian military pledged to reduce combat troops in the region in 1993. Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher emphasized the need for a peaceful transition of power in Indonesia. The purpose of this Act is to promote a peaceful transition to democratic rule in Indonesia by conditioning US military assistance on specific democratic reforms. The Act aims to promote democratic reforms in Indonesia by limiting military assistance to the government. The Act restricts US military assistance to Indonesia unless the government allows opposition parties to freely select their candidates and party leaders for national elections. The Government of Indonesia accredits independent election-monitoring organizations like KIPP to observe national elections without interference. Police or military in Indonesia do not confiscate materials from NGOs or engage in illegal raids on their offices or homes. The Government of Indonesia respects the rule of law by investigating and prosecuting individuals responsible for the attack on the Democratic Party of Indonesia headquarters in 1996. This includes making public the postmortem examination of the individuals killed in the attack. The Government of Indonesia has released political prisoners detained for expressing political views and has entered into dialogue with Portugal and East Timorese leaders to resolve conflict in East Timor under the auspices of the United Nations. The Government of Indonesia has implemented a plan to reduce troops in East Timor and released political prisoners, including Fernando DeArujo, for expressing political views. Indonesia has also ensured religious rights by prohibiting persecution and harassment practices. The Government of Indonesia has improved labor rights by dropping charges of subversion against trade union leaders and releasing them from custody. The Government of Indonesia has recognized SBSI as a trade union and returned confiscated equipment. The limitation on US military assistance can be waived in case of an emergency or national security interest. The limitation on US military assistance and arms transfers to Indonesia will only apply to agreements made in fiscal years after the enactment of the Act, with a 15-day notification period to Congress before taking effect. SEC. 4. UNITED STATES MILITARY ASSISTANCE AND ARMS TRANSFERS DEFINED. The term \"United States military assistance and arms transfers\" in this Act includes assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 for military assistance and international military education and training, excluding civilian personnel training promoting dialogue in Indonesia. The Arms Export Control Act allows for the transfer of defense articles, services, and construction to Indonesia, excluding certain types of assistance."
