    "content": "The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers Act, also known as the Trade Act of 1974, introduces a new chapter on Adjustment Assistance for Farmers, defining key terms related to this assistance. The chapter defines key terms related to agricultural commodities, including the definitions of agricultural commodity, agricultural commodity producer, and contributed importantly. The determination of the impact of imports on agricultural commodity prices is made by the Secretary of Agriculture. Key terms like 'duly authorized representative' and 'national average price' are defined in the chapter. \"SEC. 292. PETITIONS; GROUP ELIGIBILITY.\" \"A petition for certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance can be filed by agricultural commodity producers or their representative. The Secretary will publish notice and conduct a public hearing if requested within 10 days. Group eligibility requirements will be certified by the Secretary.\" The Secretary can certify a group of agricultural commodity producers for adjustment assistance if the national average price for their commodity is below 80% of the average price for the previous 5 years, and if increased imports have contributed to the price decline. The group of agricultural commodity producers can apply for assistance under certain conditions if the national average price for their commodity is below a specified level and if certain requirements are met. The term 'qualified year' refers to consecutive years after a group of agricultural commodity producers is certified as eligible. The Secretary treats each class of goods within an agricultural commodity as a separate commodity for determining group eligibility, national average price, and level of imports. SEC. 293. DETERMINATIONS BY SECRETARY. The Secretary must determine if a petitioning group meets the requirements within 60 days of filing under section 292. If eligible, a certification of eligibility is issued for agricultural commodity producers. The determination is published in the Federal Register with reasons. Termination of certification can occur if the Secretary decides. If the Secretary determines that the decline in price for the agricultural commodity is no longer due to specified conditions, the certification of eligibility will be terminated and notice will be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 294. STUDY BY SECRETARY WHEN INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION BEGINS INVESTIGATION. Whenever the International Trade Commission initiates an investigation under section 202 regarding an agricultural commodity, they must notify the Secretary who will then conduct a study on the number of producers eligible for adjustment assistance and the potential use of existing programs to aid in their adjustment to import competition. The Secretary is required to submit a report within 15 days of the Commission's report under section 202(f). The Secretary must submit a report to the President under section 202(f) of the Commission's findings, which will be made public except for confidential information. A summary of the report will also be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 295. BENEFIT INFORMATION TO AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY PRODUCERS. The Secretary must inform producers about benefit allowances, training, and employment services available under this title. They must also assist groups in preparing petitions or applications for program benefits. Written notice of benefits is mailed to agricultural commodity producers covered by a certification, and notice is also published for these benefits. The benefits available to agricultural commodity producers covered by certifications are published in newspapers for their residents. \"Qualifying requirements for agricultural commodity producers are outlined in Section 296.\" Payment of a trade adjustment allowance is available to adversely affected agricultural commodity producers who meet specific conditions, including filing an application within 90 days of certification of eligibility. The producer must provide information on the amount of agricultural commodity produced, certify no receipt of other cash benefits, and demonstrate a net farm income below a certain threshold. The producer must certify a net farm income below a certain threshold and meet with an Extension Service employee for information and technical assistance on adjusting to import competition for the affected agricultural commodity. The producer of an adversely affected agricultural commodity can receive adjustment assistance based on yield and marketing improvements. The amount of cash benefits is calculated as half of the difference between the national average price of the commodity for the past 5 years and 80% of that average price. The amount of cash benefits for an agricultural commodity producer is determined based on the national average price of the commodity over the most recent marketing year and the amount of the commodity produced. For subsequent qualified years, the average national price is calculated using a 5-marketing-year period. The maximum amount of cash assistance is also specified. The maximum amount of cash benefits for an agricultural commodity producer is $10,000 in any 12-month period. Producers receiving cash benefits are not eligible for other cash benefits but can receive employment services and training benefits. \"SEC. 297. FRAUD AND RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS.\" Repayment of overpayments under this chapter is required if it is determined that the recipient was not entitled to the payment, with the option for the Secretary to waive repayment in certain circumstances. If an overpayment is not recovered or waived, the Secretary will deduct the amount from future payments to the individual. If a person knowingly makes false statements or fails to disclose material facts resulting in receiving payments they were not entitled to under this chapter, they will be ineligible for further payments. Repayment or deduction of overpayments is required only after a determination is made, except for overpayments determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. No deduction can be made until the Secretary makes a determination, provides notice and a fair hearing, and the determination becomes final. Any amount recovered will be returned to the Treasury. Penalties include fines up to $10,000 or imprisonment for knowingly making false statements or failing to disclose material facts to obtain payments under this chapter. Authorization of appropriations up to $100,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2002-2006 for the Department of Agriculture to implement chapter purposes. Reduction in assistance if appropriations are insufficient. Amendment to Trade Act of 1974 to include Adjustment Assistance for Farmers. Chapter 6 outlines the Adjustment Assistance for Farmers program, including definitions, group eligibility, determinations by the Secretary, study requirements, benefit information, qualifying requirements, fraud prevention, and authorization of appropriations up to $100,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2002-2006."
