    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Native American Indian Education Act\" and includes findings and purpose. Congress finds that nontribal colleges play a valuable role in providing educational opportunities to Native American Indian students, with some 4-year colleges offering tuition-free education to hundreds of Native American Indian students as mandated by Federal statute. The value of these tuition waiver benefits far exceeds the original contributions. The financial burden of providing tuition-free education to Native American Indian students is no longer equitably shared among states and colleges. In fiscal year 2012, Colorado paid $13,000,000 in tuition fees for Native American Indian students at Fort Lewis College, while Minnesota waived $2,600,000 in tuition for Native American Indian students at the University of Minnesota. The Act aims to secure Federal funding to support colleges and States in waiving tuition charges for Native American Indian students, even those from out-of-state, amidst budget constraints. SEC. 3. STATE RELIEF FROM FEDERAL HIGHER EDUCATION MANDATE. The Secretary will pay eligible colleges the tuition charges for Native American Indian students who are not residents of the state where the college is located and are enrolled in the academic year before the fiscal year. Eligible colleges must provide tuition-free education to Native American Indian students as mandated by Federal statute with state support. The Secretary will pay eligible colleges tuition charges for Native American Indian students not residents of the state where the college is located and enrolled in the previous academic year. Colleges must provide tuition-free education to Native American Indian students as mandated by Federal statute with state support. The amount paid to colleges cannot exceed tuition charges for non-resident Native American Indian students enrolled in the college for the 2012-2013 academic year. Amounts received by colleges are considered reimbursement from the state and fulfill the Federal mandate to admit Native American Indian students tuition-free. The section mandates that colleges must provide tuition-free education to Native American Indian students, with reimbursement from the state for any tuition charges that exceed the amount received under this section. In this section, the term 'Native American Indian students' includes 'Indian pupils' as defined in Federal statutes requiring colleges or States to offer tuition-free education to Native American Indian students. SEC. 4. OFFSET. The text chunk discusses the rescission of $15,000,000 in appropriated discretionary funds on a pro rata basis from unobligated funds. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will determine the accounts and amounts for rescission within 60 days. Exceptions are made for unobligated funds of specific departments. The rescission of $15,000,000 in appropriated discretionary funds from unobligated funds is discussed, with exceptions for specific departments like the Department of Education and the Department of the Interior for Native American Indian students."
