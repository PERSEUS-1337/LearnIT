    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strengthening Medicaid for America's Children Act of 2009\" and includes an enhanced FMAP for children under Medicaid. The \"Strengthening Medicaid for America's Children Act of 2009\" amends Section 1905 of the Social Security Act to include a Conditions-Based Enhanced FMAP for children in states that meet certain requirements and implement specific policies under their State plan. The \"Strengthening Medicaid for America's Children Act of 2009\" introduces a Conditions-Based Enhanced FMAP for states meeting specific requirements to maintain investment in health care programs for children. The \"Strengthening Medicaid for America's Children Act of 2009\" introduces a Conditions-Based Enhanced FMAP for states to increase reimbursement rates for providers and coverage expansion while maintaining eligibility standards and provider rates at or above 2008 levels. The scaling of the increase is based on the degree of policy implementation by the state. The \"Strengthening Medicaid for America's Children Act of 2009\" introduces a Conditions-Based Enhanced FMAP for states to increase reimbursement rates for providers and coverage expansion while maintaining eligibility standards and provider rates at or above 2008 levels. The percentage under this subparagraph varies based on the number of policies implemented by the state, ranging from 100% for 6 policies to 50% for 3-4 policies. Policies include 12-month continuous coverage for children and maintaining eligibility for children leaving foster care on their 18th birthday. Children can maintain eligibility for medical assistance up to age 23 while attending college full- or part-time. The state must not apply an asset test or require a face-to-face interview for eligibility. Renewals of eligibility can be done for children without additional conditions. The State must implement various eligibility options for medical assistance and child health assistance, including joint applications, presumptive eligibility for children, and the Express Lane eligibility option. The State must coordinate care for children with medical assistance through a medical home or similar model. This subsection does not apply if the State is eligible for increased FMAP under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Children are defined as individuals under 21 years of age."
