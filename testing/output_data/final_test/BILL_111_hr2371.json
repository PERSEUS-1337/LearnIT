    "content": "HOME HEATING OIL AND PROPANE CONSUMERS. The section defines \"carbon content\" as the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from fuel combustion and \"cost-effective\" as meeting the Total Resource Cost Test for energy efficiency programs. The Administrator is required to allocate resources annually from 2012 to 2030. The Administrator will distribute 1.5 percent of emission allowances among States annually from 2012 to 2030 based on the carbon content of home heating oil and propane sold. States must sell these allowances within a year of receipt. States must sell emission allowances distributed under this section within 1 year of receipt. Proceeds from sales should be used exclusively for energy efficiency programs benefiting consumers of home heating oil or propane for residential or commercial purposes. States must allocate funds from the sale of emission allowances for energy efficiency programs that benefit consumers of home heating oil or propane for residential or commercial use. States must use a minimum of 50% of funds for cost-effective efficiency programs to reduce fuel costs, limit administrative expenses to 5%, and deliver funding through existing energy efficiency and consumer energy assistance programs. The State must coordinate energy efficiency and consumer energy assistance programs funded under this section to deliver comprehensive, fuel-blind services to consumers without displacing existing funding sources. Each State receiving emission allowances must report on their use. Each State receiving emission allowances must report to the Administrator within 12 months, detailing the use of proceeds from sales of emission allowances, demonstrating the cost-effectiveness and energy savings of funded energy efficiency programs, and including an independent evaluation of program performance. Enforcement measures may be taken if a State is found to be non-compliant with the requirements of the emission allowances program, including withholding allowances equal to twice the value of the non-compliant allowances, to be distributed among other States."
