    "content": "The FY2000 appropriations act for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and related agencies (P.L. 106-78, H.R. 1906) was signed into law on October 22, 1999, with $60.56 billion in regular appropriations and $8.7 billion in emergency spending for farm income and disaster assistance. A consolidated appropriations act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113) was signed into law on November 29, 1999, including provisions such as additional emergency farm assistance, a two-year extension of the Northeast dairy compact, and a requirement for USDA to adopt a fluid farm milk pricing option supported by Eastern and Southern milk producers. This act also includes a 0.38% across-the-board cut in total discretionary budget authority for FY2000, resulting in cuts within USDA and FDA. The FY2000 appropriations act for USDA and related agencies (P.L. 106-78) included a $49 million cut in USDA and a $4 million cut in FDA programs. USDA has various responsibilities beyond agriculture, with outlays of $63.9 billion in FY1999, mainly for food and nutrition programs like food stamps and child nutrition programs. Total FY1999 outlays for USDA included funding for the stamp program, child nutrition programs, WIC program, farm and foreign agricultural services, natural resource and environment programs, research and education, rural development, and marketing and regulatory activities. USDA spending for FY1999 includes funding for food stamp program, child nutrition programs, farm commodity price support, federal crop insurance, and conservation reserve program. Mandatory programs account for three-fourths of total USDA spending and are entitlement-based. The food and nutrition programs are funded annually based on projected spending needs, with supplemental appropriations made if estimates fall short. Historically, farm commodity support programs were a larger portion of the USDA budget, but spending levels have become more predictable since the 1996 farm bill. Emergency provisions in the FY1999 and FY2000 appropriations acts also impact USDA spending. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations act (P.L.105-277) and the FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) provided $14.6 billion in additional funding to farmers for low commodity prices and natural disasters. USDA budget includes discretionary programs funded by annual appropriations acts, such as rural development, research, agricultural credit, and nutrition programs. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations bill provided funding for various USDA programs, including agricultural credit, WIC, international food aid, meat inspection, and food marketing. The President's budget requested $62.5 billion for these programs, with $61.2 billion for USDA and $1.2 billion for other agencies. This request was $7.8 billion lower than the previous year due to higher reimbursement for Commodity Credit Corporation losses. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations bill provided funding for various USDA programs, including agricultural credit, WIC, international food aid, meat inspection, and food marketing. The Senate passed S. 1233 and H.R. 1906 for FY2000 appropriations, with additional emergency funding of $576 million enacted. The House approved H.R. 1906 with $60.96 billion in budget authority for USDA and related agencies, $1.5 billion below the Administration request. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations bill, H.R. 1906, provided $60.96 billion in budget authority for USDA and related agencies, $1.5 billion below the Administration request. Amendments were made to increase funding for elderly nutrition programs and reduce funding for Agricultural Research Service programs and USDA's Chief Information Officer. A compromise was reached in the FY2000 agriculture appropriations bill, H.R. 1906, after House leadership suspended consideration due to proposed funding cuts. The bill was amended to trim $102.5 million, with $70.5 million from USDA buildings and $20 million from FDA salaries. A separate amendment prevented FDA from using FY2000 funds for drugs like RU-486. The Senate version was approved on June 15, 1999, with further adjustments made by the full committee on June 17, 1999. The Senate reported bill S. 1233 (S.Rept. 106-80) on June 17, 1999, with new budget authority of $61.04 billion. $13.98 billion was allocated for discretionary programs, $535 million below the President's request but $292 million above FY1999 levels. Floor debate on S. 1233 focused on health care amendments unrelated to USDA funding. The Senate passed a Republican-sponsored amendment providing $7.4 billion in emergency funding for farmers and exempting agricultural and medical products from unilateral sanctions. The conference agreement to H.R. 1906, reported on September 30, 1999, includes $60.559 billion in regular FY2000 appropriations for USDA and $8.7 billion in emergency funding for farmers. It does not contain exemptions for agricultural products from trade sanctions or mandated changes in dairy pricing policy. The emergency funding includes $1.2 billion in disaster payments added by conferees. The emergency funding in H.R. 1906 includes $1.2 billion in disaster payments. The House and Senate passed the measure, with Senate consideration delayed by Eastern senators. The President signed it into law as P.L. 106-78 on October 22, 1999. Subsequent to this, Congressional leaders and the Administration reached agreement on FY2000 appropriations bills. The provisions in P.L. 106-113 include additional USDA funding of $576 million for Hurricane Floyd damage, a two-year extension of the Northeast dairy compact, and a federal milk pricing option. The bill also includes a 0.38% cut in discretionary budget authority for FY2000, leading to cuts in USDA and FDA programs. The House and Senate approved the measure in November 1999, with the President signing it into law. The President signed the measure into law on November 29, 1999, containing $8.7 billion in emergency farm spending. The debate focused on the financial needs of the farm sector given the current state of the farm economy. The Senate measure added $1.2 billion compared to the Senate-passed bill. The final conference agreement included $1.2 billion in disaster payments for farmers. An additional $576 million in emergency assistance was provided in the omnibus budget agreement. Emergency provisions in P.L. 106-78 allocated funds for direct payments to grain and cotton farmers, disaster payments, soybean and oilseed crop growers, crop insurance subsidies, tobacco growers, livestock assistance, and dairy income assistance. The emergency provisions in P.L. 106-78 and the FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $576 million in additional USDA disaster assistance. This included funds for livestock assistance, dairy income assistance, incentive payments for cotton exporters, peanut growers, and the suspension of a marketing assessment on sugar. The USDA disaster assistance program provides various forms of financial support, including farm disaster payments, livestock assistance, funding for watershed and flood prevention programs, emergency conservation programs, USDA farm loans, rural housing loans, rural housing grants, and noninsured assistance program. The program also waives certain requirements for farmers affected by disasters. The agreement waives the 35% crop loss requirement for farmer payments in disaster-declared counties. In FY1999, emergency spending packages provided $6 billion in October 1998 and $574 million in May 1999. Three dairy issues were addressed in the appropriations debate. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) extends the authority for the dairy price support program and provides $125 million in emergency assistance to dairy farmers. The subsequent consolidated appropriations act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113) includes provisions that cause changes to both milk marketing orders and the Northeast dairy compact, with support from Eastern and Southern dairy farm groups and opposition from dairy processors. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) extends the authority for the dairy price support program and provides $125 million in emergency assistance to dairy farmers. The subsequent consolidated appropriations act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113) includes provisions supported by Eastern and Southern dairy farm groups and opposed by dairy processors and Upper Midwest dairy farmers. One provision is the extension of authority for the Northeast dairy compact for 2 years through September 30, 2001, and a requirement for USDA to adopt an alternative milk pricing policy to maintain minimum fluid farm milk prices close to current levels. The final rule in Vermont was indefinitely postponed, extending the Northeast compact. Wisconsin and Minnesota Senators opposed dairy provisions in the budget agreement. A cloture motion was adopted on November 19, 1999, followed by Senate approval and the President signing it into law on November 29. Farm commodity programs are funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation, supporting various commodities. The CCC receives annual funding from a $30 billion line of credit with the U.S. Treasury, not requiring an annual appropriation. However, the annual appropriations bill usually includes funding for \"reimbursement of CCC net realized losses\" to repay its debt and avoid exhausting borrowing authority. This reimbursement is mandatory and not part of discretionary spending. The annual appropriation request for CCC reflects losses from the previous fiscal year, not projected spending for the current year. The USDA requested $14.368 billion for the CCC in FY2000 to cover previous losses, with $9.3 billion for FY1998 losses and $5 billion for anticipated FY1999 losses. Without this appropriation, CCC borrowing authority would be exhausted before the end of FY2000 due to high spending in FY1999. The CCC spending in FY2000 could exceed $22 billion, with most of the emergency spending for farmers funded through CCC borrowing authority. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. USDA absorbs a large percentage of program losses. The USDA's crop insurance program absorbs program losses, compensates reinsured companies for delivery expenses, subsidizes premiums for producers, and funds its administering agency. The estimated cost for FY2000 is $1.7 billion, with $997 million required for the Crop Insurance Fund. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) requires $997 million for the Crop Insurance Fund, with $640 million funded from previous years. An additional $70.7 million is requested for RMA's salaries and expenses. H.R. 1906 includes $400 million for USDA to offer premium discounts in the 2000 crop year. Despite reforms in 1994, farmer dissatisfaction with the program has increased, especially among those affected by disasters. The enactment of nearly $6 billion in emergency disaster and price relief payments in the omnibus FY1999 appropriations act spurred efforts to enhance the crop insurance program. Several bills have been introduced to improve the program, with the House passing a comprehensive measure (H.R. 2559). Senate action is pending. USDA, through its Farm Service Agency, serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers, providing direct farm loans and guarantees for qualified loans from commercial lenders to help farmers recover from natural disasters. The federal government provides loans to help farmers meet operating expenses and recover from natural disasters. Loans may have subsidized interest rates, and agencies must estimate the cost of loans. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations bill allocated $82 million to support $3.08 billion in FSA farm loans. The funding includes $200 million for guaranteed unsubsidized farm operating loans. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations bill allocated $200 million for guaranteed unsubsidized farm operating loans, compared to a request for $97 million. This funding is part of a larger $800 million increase in loan authority for farm loan programs, with a total of $230.1 million allocated for FSA farm loans in FY1999. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) allocated $813 million for conservation programs, an increase from the previous year but less than the Administration's request of $866.1 million. The Act did not provide the $50 million requested for the Farmland Protection Program. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) allocated $661 million for the Farmland Protection Program, rejecting Administration proposals for initiatives like the Clean Water Action Plan and Lands Legacy Initiative. The primary source of technical assistance within NRCS is Conservation Operations (CO). The Act included earmarks and rejected new spending proposals for global climate change and Clean Water Action Plan. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) rejected some earmarks and allocated funds for various initiatives. This included $17 million for the grazing lands initiative, $7.9 million for animal feeding operations, and $99 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations. The act also specified funding for pilot rehabilitation projects and placed a limit on spending for technical assistance. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) rejected an Administration proposal to transfer $50 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to the Farmland Protection Program. It provided $6.3 million for the Forestry Incentives Program, funding five NRCS programs through the CCC. The Administration requested $300 million for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), $209 million for the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), and $28 million for the Farmland. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) rejected Administration requests for increased funding for mandatory conservation programs. The Act limited spending on EQIP, WRP, and the Conservation Farm Option below their authorized levels. The Administration budget proposals included a reduction in NRCS staffing by approximately 10%, affecting 1,055 positions. NRCS temporarily halted technical assistance for new enrollments in the CRP but received emergency supplemental appropriations in May to fully support CRP enrollment for FY1999 and FY2000 without significant reductions in field staff. FSA administers the largest conservation program, the CRP, funded through the CCC, offering multi-year rental agreements to producers who retire highly. The CRP, funded through the CCC, offers multi-year rental agreements to producers who retire environmentally sensitive lands from production. P.L. 106-78 includes provisions limiting funding for certain components. The Administration requested a $20 million increase in FY2000 for CRP, stating enrolled acreage would grow. Conservation funding may be affected by provisions in the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill related to the Lands Legacy Initiative. The FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill does not provide funding for the Administration's Lands Legacy Initiative, which aims to allocate over $1 billion for resource protection, including $268 million for USDA programs. This includes increased funding for agriculture programs such as the Forest Legacy Program, Urban and Community Forestry Program, smart growth partnership loan program, Forest Service land acquisitions, and the FPP. Congress also rejected a proposal to increase USDA funding by $262 million. The proposal suggests an increase of $262 million for USDA programs as part of the Clean Water Action Plan. The Forest Service would receive $89 million, while NRCS would get $169 million, with $126 million for EQIP and $34 million for Conservation Operations. USDA's international activities include foreign food aid, commercial financing guarantees, and support for overseas markets. Some programs require direct appropriations, while others use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) provides $1.063 billion for international programs, including foreign food aid and USDA's export subsidy programs. The Act increases food aid but reduces funding for the Foreign Agricultural Service compared to the Senate-passed bill. The Administration had requested $1.057 billion in budget authority to support a program level of $5.563 billion. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) provides $1.063 billion for international programs, including foreign food aid and USDA's export subsidy programs. The budget authority requested for federal credit programs in FY2000 was $139.9 million below FY1999. The supported program level would be $1.3 billion less than the estimated program level for FY1999 of $6.853 billion, due to borrowing from the CCC for expanded food aid to Russia and export credit guarantees to Asian markets. Food aid is typically provided through P.L. 480 or the Food for Peace Program, with Title I allowing sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) provides $1.063 billion for international programs, including foreign food aid and USDA's export subsidy programs. Title I provides for sales of U.S. agricultural commodities to developing countries through concessional financing, Title II provides for commodity donations for feeding programs, and Title III provides for bilateral grants of food aid for development activities in least-developed countries. The appropriation for P.L. 480 is $951 million, with funding allocated as follows: $149 million for Title I, $800 million for Title II, and no funds for Title III. The President had requested $915 million for P.L. 480 in FY2000. The House-passed bill for H.R. 1906 provided $1.015 billion for P.L. 480 in FY2000, keeping Title II funding at $837 million and eliminating funding for Title III. The Senate-passed version allocated $922.9 million for P.L. 480, with a program level of $946 million. The Senate concurred with reducing Title II funding by $50 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee expects that the budget authority recommended, together with carryovers, will enable USDA to maintain P.L. 480 program levels in FY2000 at the FY1999 level. The Senate-passed bill also eliminates funding for Title III commodity grants. Emergency funding of $149 million for Title II commodity donations provided in supplemental appropriations is designated for humanitarian food relief for Kosovar refugees. The Administration had requested a program level of $4.5 billion for the CCC export credit programs in FY2000, $200 million below the FY1999 estimate. In FY2000, CCC export credit programs would remain at a high level despite a $200 million decrease from FY1999. Budget authority of $4.085 million was requested for administrative expenses. P.L. 106-78 provides $3.82 million for administrative expenses, supporting the requested program level of $4.5 billion for export credit guarantees. FAS spending was reduced to $109 million in FY2000, $27 million below FY1999 levels. In FY2000, CCC export credit programs would remain at a high level despite a $200 million decrease from FY1999. Budget authority of $4.085 million was requested for administrative expenses. P.L. 106-78 provides $3.82 million for administrative expenses, supporting the requested program level of $4.5 billion for export credit guarantees. FAS spending was reduced to $109 million in FY2000, $27 million below FY1999 levels. The Senate level is $28.5 million below the Administration request and the House level. The House committee report calls upon FAS to allocate resources to advance American farmers, ranchers, and consumers in trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization framework, including reallocating current spending if necessary. CCC-Funded Programs include the Food for Progress Program, Section 416 commodity donations, Export Enhancement Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, and Market Access Program funded by the CCC. Funding for CCC-funded programs in FY2000 is estimated at $777 million, a decrease from $1.554 billion in FY1999. There are no restrictions on CCC-funded international activities in P.L. 106-78. Conferees removed a Senate provision banning MAP spending on alcohol exports. An amendment to stop all MAP funding was rejected during the passage of H.R. 1906. Section 416 is also mentioned. The budget proposes significant cuts to various agricultural programs in FY2000, including a drastic reduction in funding for Section 416 from $1.47 billion to $49 million. Additionally, the Food for Progress program would see a decrease from $133 million to $91 million, and the Export Enhancement Program would be limited to $494 million. Despite the proposed cuts, it is noted that EEP spending was only $2 million in FY1998 and just over $1 million in FY1999. In FY2000, USDA expressed reluctance to use the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) due to fears of further depressing export prices, especially for wheat and feed grains. The budget proposed $99 million for FY2000 DEIP subsidies, similar to FY1999 levels. The Market Access Program (MAP) was allocated $90 million in FY2000, the same as the previous year, and faced opposition from budget cutters. Amendments to eliminate MAP funding in FY2000 were defeated in the House. The House Appropriations Committee report directed the Department to notify them before making changes to the funding of the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP), which supports market development for generic commodities. Approximately $3.6 million of the total MAP funding of $90 million in FY1999 was allocated to alcoholic beverages, but a Thurmond floor amendment to the Senate-passed bill prohibiting the use of MAP funds for exporting alcoholic beverages was deleted by conferees. The budget proposed a program level of $27.5 million of CCC funds for FMDP in FY2000, aiming to remove the program from the list of those requiring the enactment of budget authority. The House Appropriations Committee report directed the Department to notify them before making changes to the funding of the Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP). P.L. 106-78 did not include a provision to exempt agricultural exports from economic sanctions imposed by the United States for foreign policy reasons. Strong opposition to this proposed foreign policy change, which would partially break the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, led to a stalemate in conference. The Administration also opposed requiring congressional approval for future sanctions on agricultural and medical products. The House Appropriations Committee opposed requiring congressional approval for future sanctions on agricultural and medical products, arguing it would limit the President's flexibility in using sanctions for foreign policy and national security objectives. The Ashcroft amendment was dropped in the final conference report, leading to strong disapproval from some Senators. The Nethercutt amendment, which aimed to exempt food and medicine from U.S. economic sanctions, was defeated in committee and later withdrawn during House floor debate. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) includes over $2 billion for USDA's research, education, and economics agencies, which is more than previous versions and the Administration request. It does not provide funds for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems or the Fund for Rural America. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations act also prohibited expenditures on both initiatives. Four agencies carry out USDA's REE function: Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Agricultural Library, Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES), and Economic Research Service (ERS). They provide scientific support, economic analysis, and liaison with state-level programs. ARS receives $886.8 million in funding under P.L. 106-78. P.L. 106-78 provides $886.8 million for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with $834.3 million for research programs and $52.5 million for building and facility renovations. The House bill allocated $823.4 million solely for research, while the Senate bill allocated $862.5 million, including $53 million for facilities. The Administration proposed terminating some research projects to redirect funds to high-priority areas like human nutrition and food safety. P.L. 106-78 maintains funding for terminated projects at FY1999 levels, similar to the House bill, while the Senate bill would have reallocated $7.3 million from terminated projects. The Senate-passed bill allocated $10 million for food safety projects and $11 million for the President's Food Safety Initiative. P.L. 106-78 provides $950.1 million for CSREES, with $485.6 million for research and education, $424.9 million for outreach programs, and $39.5 million for integrated research and extension programs. The Senate-passed bill allocated funding for various agricultural programs under the Agricultural Research, Education, and Extension Reform Act of 1998. The House bill also provided funding for these programs, including support for state research and education programs, Extension activities, and integrated programs. Additionally, funding was allocated for the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The House-passed bill allocated $70.3 million, with $12.2 million earmarked for studies on child nutrition, WIC, and food stamp programs. Conferees agreed on $99.4 million for NASS, including $16.5 million for the Census of Agriculture. USDA's marketing and regulatory programs aim to facilitate domestic and international marketing of agricultural products and ensure animal and plant health. APHIS spending accounts for most of the marketing efforts. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act provides $446.5 million for APHIS, with $441.3 million for programs to protect U.S. agriculture and $5.2 million for facility renovation. User fees would contribute an additional $87 million. The Senate-passed version allocated $444.6 million for APHIS, including $439.4 million for programs and $5.2 million for facility renovation, with an option for $90 million in user fees. The House bill proposed $444 million for salaries and expenses, $7.2 million for facilities, and allowed for an extra $87 million in user fees. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act provides $444 million for salaries and expenses, $7.2 million for facilities, and permits an additional $87 million in user fees to support agency activities. APHIS's FY1999 appropriation is $425.8 million for programs, $7.7 million for facilities, and provides for the expenditure of $88 million in user fees. Agricultural Marketing Service's total funding for FY2000 is increased by more than $4 million to $65.3 million in P.L. 106-78. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act provides funding for various agency programs, including the Pesticide Data Program and support for small farmers. GIPSA programs receive funding at the House-passed and Administration-requested level. GIPSA is working to improve monitoring of livestock markets. The final measure includes user fees for grain weighing and inspection services. Mandatory reporting of livestock prices is also included in the legislation. Livestock Prices. P.L. 106-78 mandates new daily reporting requirements on the largest 10% of cattle and hog packing plants, with penalties for violations. USDA is tasked with collecting and publishing data regularly. Lawmakers debate funding for the program, with some urging the use of existing funds while the Secretary argues for a separate appropriation. Prior to this legislation, packers and processors were not required to report prices, although AMS collected data voluntarily. The USDA has set goals for food safety under the Government Performance and Results Act. The Department plays a key role in the President's Food Safety Initiative. In 1995, an Office of the Under Secretary for Food Safety was established to elevate the Department's role in this mission area. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) was established in 1995 under the USDA to ensure the safety of meat, poultry, and processed egg products through mandatory inspections. FSIS is implementing a new system called Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) to reduce pathogens in products. Concerns have been raised about FSIS's ability to enforce HACCP due to budget constraints. P.L. 106-78 provides $649.4 million for FSIS in FY2000, an increase from the previous year. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) received $649.4 million in FY2000, an increase from the previous year's appropriation. The bill also includes $89 million in user fees for overtime and holiday inspection services. Additionally, FSIS is required to deliver a report on the authority and operations of the meat product recall coordinator by January 2000, and provide an analysis of staffing needs by February 15, 2000. The USDA provides rural development assistance through programs administered by three agencies: Rural Utilities Service, Rural Housing Service, and Rural Business-Cooperative Service. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act allocates $2.213 billion for rural development programs, a 1.7% increase from the previous year. This funding supports subsidies for direct and guaranteed loan amounts totaling $7.629 billion. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act provides $217 million in subsidies for direct and guaranteed loan amounts totaling $7.629 billion. This includes funding for activities administered by the Rural Housing Service and Rural Utilities Service, with a decrease in loan subsidies compared to the previous year. No funding is provided for the Alternative Agriculture Research and Commercialization Corporation revolving fund. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act provides $217 million in subsidies for direct and guaranteed loan amounts totaling $7.629 billion. This includes funding for activities administered by the Rural Housing Service and Rural Utilities Service, with a decrease in loan subsidies compared to the previous year. P.L. 106-78 provides $54 million in budget authority for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, with $53 million in loan authority for business and job creation efforts in rural America. Additionally, $20 million in loan subsidy is allocated to support businesses in rural areas. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act provides $20 million in loan subsidy for businesses in rural areas through the Rural Business-Cooperative Service. This funding is part of the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP) under USDA, which includes various financial assistance programs for rural development. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) provides $35.04 billion for food and nutrition programs, including funding for food stamp program, meal programs in schools and child care facilities, supplemental feeding programs for low-income women, infants, and children (WIC), commodity assistance programs, and federal salaries and expenses. This amount is $6.3 billion less than the Administration's request but $227 million more than the previous year's appropriation. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) provides $35.04 billion for food and nutrition programs, including funding for food stamp program. The $6.3 billion difference between the Administration request and P.L. 106-78 is mainly due to the rejection of advance funds for the food stamp program. The House and Senate recommended $21.6 billion for food stamp expenses, while P.L. 106-78 provides $19.6 billion, reflecting a re-estimate of program needs. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) provides $35.04 billion for food and nutrition programs, including funding for the food stamp program. The re-estimated program needs resulted in $100 million allocated for the food stamp contingency reserve, no advance funding for FY2001, and $1.27 billion for Nutrition Assistance for Puerto Rico. Additionally, $98 million is designated for Emergency Food Assistance Program mandatory commodities. Conferees removed a Senate proposal for a study on food stamp participation decline and obstacles for eligible households. No major policy changes were proposed for child nutrition programs. The Administration proposed changes for child nutrition programs in the FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78), providing $9.554 billion for programs like school lunch and breakfast. Majority of funds are allocated to school lunch ($5.48 billion), school breakfast ($1.42 billion), and child and adult care food program ($1.76 billion). The total funding for child nutrition programs is $9.56 billion, $377 million more than projected FY1999 spending. The difference in funding levels is due to $7 million allocated for the school breakfast pilot project. The FY2000 agriculture appropriations act (P.L. 106-78) proposed $9.554 billion for child nutrition programs, with a focus on school lunch and breakfast. The legislation required the USDA to use \"bonus commodities\" to meet the 12% federal school lunch assistance requirement, resulting in projected savings of $40 million. House and Senate negotiators have agreed to make the \"12% solution\" permanent to use $55 million in savings for new spending in the budget package. The special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children (WIC) was funded at $4.032 billion in FY2000, $108 million more than FY1999 but $73.5 million less than the Administration's request. There was debate over exempting natural sugar in fruits from sugar limits for cereals in the WIC program. The conference report to P.L. 106-78 directs USDA to make no exception to the current sugar limit for cereals approved for WIC program use. The House and Senate bills do not approve the Administration's request to fund the Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) from Commodity Assistance Program (CAP) funds. They also require $10 million of WIC funding to be used within 45 days for the FMNP. The FMNP provides WIC participants with vouchers to buy fresh foods at farmers markets.
