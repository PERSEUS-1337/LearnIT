    "content": "Prior to the mid-1980s, federal assistance for homeless individuals and families was limited. The Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program, established in 1983, was the first federal program to provide aid to all homeless people, regardless of age. Administered by FEMA, the EFS program offers emergency food and shelter. In 1987, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act was enacted to address the comprehensive needs of homeless individuals, including food, shelter, healthcare, and education. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (P.L. 106-400) was renamed after Representatives Stewart B. McKinney and Bruce F. Vento. It includes programs from various departments such as HUD, DOL, HHS, and ED to provide assistance to homeless individuals and families. The definitions of homelessness used by federal programs determine who is served. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act provides targeted assistance to homeless individuals and families through various federal programs. This report discusses federal efforts to end homelessness and includes funding levels for programs assisting homeless individuals. Homelessness in the United States gained national attention in the 1970s and 1980s as the characteristics of the homeless population changed. In the 20th century, homelessness was characterized by \"skid rows\" where transient single men lived in hotels and single-room dwellings. However, starting in the 1970s, the homeless population grew and became more visible, including women with children, younger individuals, more racial diversity, lower employment rates, higher rates of mental illness, and drug abuse. Various reasons have been suggested for the increase in homelessness. The growth in homelessness in the 20th century was attributed to various factors such as urban development displacing residents, decreased availability of affordable housing, reduced need for seasonal labor, and changes in mental health care. Congress responded in the 1980s with grant programs to address food and shelter needs for homeless individuals. In the 1980s, Congress established programs to address the food and shelter needs of homeless individuals, including the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, Emergency Shelter Grants Program, and Transitional Housing Demonstration Program. A Federal Interagency Task Force on Food and Shelter for the Homeless was created in 1983 to coordinate the federal response. Legislation was introduced in 1986, but no further action was taken. The Urgent Relief for the Homeless Act (H.R. 5710) was passed in 1987 with bipartisan support and later renamed the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. It was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan and established 15 programs to provide services for homeless individuals. The act also created the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness to coordinate federal efforts in addressing homelessness. The McKinney-Vento Act guides federal response to homelessness by coordinating efforts of multiple agencies. Legislative changes have expanded programs for homeless individuals, with varying definitions of homelessness among federal programs. The majority of programs use the original McKinney-Vento Act definition of a \"homeless individual.\" The McKinney-Vento Act defines \"homeless individual\" for various programs, with some using their own definitions. The definition was amended in 2009 by the HEARTH Act. Programs like HUD's Homeless Assistance Grants and VA homeless veterans programs use the Section 103 definition. The original McKinney-Vento Act Section 103 definition of homelessness remained the same for years, describing a homeless individual as someone who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. The definition compares to those used in other programs and has changed under the HEARTH Act and HUD's implementing regulations. The original McKinney-Vento Act Section 103 definition of homelessness describes a homeless individual as lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. This definition contrasts with other federal programs that may consider individuals homeless even if they have temporary or precarious accommodations. The Department of Education program also defines homeless children and youth based on this definition, including those sharing housing due to loss of housing or economic hardship. The definition of homelessness under various programs includes individuals lacking fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, such as those sharing housing due to loss of housing or economic hardship, living in hotels, motels, or substandard housing, awaiting foster care placement, or children of migrant workers. Other programs define homeless youth as those unable to live in a safe environment with relatives or lacking alternative living arrangements. The PATH program defines an \"eligible homeless individual\" as someone with serious mental illness and possibly a substance use disorder, who is homeless or at risk of homelessness. The HEARTH Act broadened the definition of \"homeless individual\" in 2009, moving away from literal homelessness requirements. HUD released regulations in 2011 to clarify some aspects of the definition. The HEARTH Act in 2009 broadened the definition of \"homeless individual\" to include those living in hotels or motels paid for by a government entity or charitable organization, and all persons in transitional housing. Amendments were made to the McKinney-Vento Act language to specify suitable places for people to sleep. HUD released regulations in 2011 to clarify these changes. The amended law clarified unsuitable places for people to sleep and added criteria for individuals facing imminent loss of housing. HUD's 2011 regulation specified that a person exiting an institution cannot have resided there for more than 90 days to be considered homeless. The law also defined \"shelter\" as emergency shelter, excluding transitional housing. The HEARTH Act expanded the definition of homelessness to include individuals or families facing imminent loss of housing within 14 days, lacking resources to stay in a hotel or with others, and without a subsequent residence identified. It also added unaccompanied youth and homeless families with children to the definition of \"homeless individual.\" HUD defined youth as individuals under 25 years old in the final regulations of the HEARTH Act. Seven federal programs were listed by HUD to define homeless families with children and unaccompanied youth, including the Runaway and Homeless Youth program, Head Start, and others. These programs either share the Education for Homeless Children and Youths definition or use a similar one. HUD defined youth as individuals under 25 years old in the final regulations of the HEARTH Act. Homeless families with children and unaccompanied youth must meet specific criteria, including experiencing a long-term period without permanent housing, instability with frequent moves, and barriers to stable housing due to various factors. The HEARTH Act amendment broadens the definition of homeless individuals to include those fleeing domestic violence or dangerous living conditions. Communities can use up to 10% of CoC program funds for families with children defined as homeless under federal statutes, with exceptions for low homelessness rates. The HUD's 2011 final regulation specifies that homelessness is when an individual lacks resources or support to find housing, with conditions occurring at the primary nighttime residence or making them afraid to return. Federal programs like the Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) aim to provide equal access to education for homeless children and youth. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a711431-11435) The Education for Homeless Children and Youth (EHCY) program, authorized under the McKinney-Vento Act, was last reauthorized as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. Grants are provided to facilitate the enrollment, attendance, and success in school of homeless children and youth, including tutoring, supplemental instruction, and health services. Each state must submit a plan to receive funds for this program. The McKinney-Vento Act requires states to submit plans for identifying and supporting homeless children and youth, including ensuring access to food programs, transportation, immunization, and education services. States must designate a coordinator to monitor and support local education agencies (LEAs) in implementing the program. LEA McKinney-Vento liaisons are responsible for enrolling homeless students, ensuring they receive educational services, and addressing any barriers to their education. The McKinney-Vento Act requires LEAs to continue homeless students' education in the school of origin or enroll them in a public school they are eligible for. EHCY grants are allocated to SEAs based on Title I, Part A grants, with minimum funding levels set. Additionally, funds are reserved for outlying areas and services for homeless children provided by the Bureau of Indian Education. States can reserve up to 25% of their Homeless Education program funding. States can reserve up to 25% of their Homeless Education program funding for state activities, with minimally funded states allowed to reserve up to 50%. LEAs receive remaining funds competitively and report data on homeless student enrollment annually. In SY 2015-2016, 4,303 out of 17,678 LEAs received EHCY grants, with 1,304,803 homeless students enrolled. States provided an average per pupil rate of $57.43 in federal McKinney-Vento funding to LEAs. Title I-A of ESEA provides funds to schools with high numbers of low-income students for educational services. LEAs must reserve funds to support homeless students, determined by a needs assessment. These funds can be used for various services, including transportation to the school of origin. The Emergency Food and Shelter program, established in 1983, allocates funds to local communities for homeless programs and prevention services. The program is administered by FEMA and governed by a National Board representing various organizations. The Emergency Food and Shelter program uses a formula based on unemployment and poverty rates to allocate funds to local jurisdictions. Eligible organizations can receive grants for expenses like food pantry items, mass shelter needs, homelessness prevention, and program expenses. The program was established by the Temporary Emergency. The Emergency Food and Shelter Program (EFS) provides grants for food, shelter, and equipment purchases up to $300. Established by the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, it continues to be funded through annual appropriations. The Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) Program focuses on providing outpatient health centers for homeless individuals, funded through grants to nonprofit, state, or local government entities. The Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) Program provides primary health care and substance abuse services to homeless individuals, connecting them with support services like emergency shelter and job training. In 2017, 299 program grantees served over 1 million homeless individuals, with the majority living at or below the federal poverty level. HCHs were authorized in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) is a formula grant program that distributes funds to states to support local organizations providing services for people with serious mental illness who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. States receive funds based on their urban population, with a minimum allotment for each state and territory. Matching funds are required, with federal funds covering up to 80% of the costs. The PATH program requires states to provide matching funds for federal funds. Up to 20% of the federal payments can be used for housing-related assistance, including services like access to housing, repairs, security deposits, and rental payments. Other services offered include outreach, mental health and substance abuse treatment, case management, and job training. The program is administered by SAMHSA's Center for Mental Health Services. Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals (GBHI) is a competitive grant program supporting services for homeless individuals with substance use disorders. Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals (GBHI) support services for homeless individuals with substance use disorders and co-occurring mental illness. Programs include substance abuse treatment, mental health services, outreach, screening, staff training, case management, job training, and housing services. Administered by SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, the program continues to be funded through annual appropriations. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, administered by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) within HHS's Administration for Children and Families (ACF), was established in 1974 and authorized by the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008. It includes the Basic Center Program (BCP), Transitional Living Program (TLP), and Street Outreach Program (SOP) to provide services to runaway and homeless youth. Funding for BCP and TLP was consolidated in 1999. The Basic Center Program provides short-term shelter and services for youth under 18 at risk of homelessness. Grantees must allocate 10% of funds for services under the program. Services are coordinated with the Street Outreach Program and Transitional Living Program. The Basic Center Program offers short-term shelter and services for youth under 18 who are at risk of homelessness. These centers aim to reunite youth with their families or find alternative placements, providing counseling, basic provisions, and support. They serve as an alternative to involving youth in law enforcement, juvenile justice, child welfare, and mental health systems, with grantees required to coordinate services with various agencies. The Basic Center Program provides short-term shelter and services for youth under 18 at risk of homelessness, aiming to reunite them with their families or find alternative placements. Grantees must coordinate services with various agencies, including the school district liaison for homeless youth. BCP grants are allocated to nonprofit entities based on the proportion of youth in each jurisdiction, with minimum allotments for states, territories, and Puerto Rico. Funding is distributed for three-year periods. The Transitional Living Program (TLP) offers longer-term shelter and assistance to youth aged 16-22, including pregnant and/or parenting youth, who have left their homes due to family conflict. TLP grants are competitively distributed by HHS to community-based organizations, allowing up to 20 youth to be housed in various settings for up to 540 days. Youth aged 16-22 can stay in the program for a continuous period of 635 days. The Transitional Living Program (TLP) provides shelter and assistance to youth aged 16-22 for up to 635 days under exceptional circumstances. TLP services include life-skills training, educational preparation, job attainment assistance, substance abuse counseling, and health care services. Grantees must ensure proper referrals to social services, law enforcement, education, vocational training, and coordinate with the McKinney-Vento school district liaison. The Transitional Living Program (TLP) provides shelter and assistance to youth aged 16-22 for up to 635 days under exceptional circumstances. Grantees coordinate with the McKinney-Vento school district liaison to ensure homeless youth receive educational services. TLP funds are used to serve unwed pregnant and parenting teens, providing parenting skills and promoting well-being. The Street Outreach Program supports runaway and homeless youth at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, aiming to transition them to safe living arrangements. Services include outreach, education, counseling, and provision of support. The Street Outreach Program provides outreach, education, counseling, and support to runaway and homeless youth at risk of sexual abuse. It also offers health and hygiene products, food, and drink items. The program is funded separately from the Transitional Living Program and assists in transitioning youth to safe living arrangements. The Transitional Housing Program provides short-term housing assistance and supportive services, including counseling, safety planning, and practical services like child care and employment support. It was authorized by the PROTECT Act in 2003 and receives annual funding to support states, local governments, tribes, and organizations. The Transitional Housing Program, authorized by the PROTECT Act in 2003, received annual funding through the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. Funding levels decreased from $40 million to $35 million for FY2014-FY2018. Congress funded the program separately from FY2004-FY2011 and FY2012-FY2016. The Homeless Assistance Grants, established in 1987 under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, are administered by HUD to fund housing and services for homeless individuals. The grants consist of three programs: Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG), Continuum of Care (CoC), and Rural Housing Stability (RHS) grants, each serving different purposes such as emergency shelter, transitional and permanent housing. The RHS program, which allows rural communities to apply separately for funds, has not been implemented by HUD. The ESG program distributes formula grants to state and local governments for providing assistance to homeless individuals. The distribution of CDBG funds is based on factors like poverty rates, population, housing conditions, and population growth lag. Local governments need a dollar-for-dollar match, while states require a match for funds over $100,000. Recipients can use up to 7.5% of grants for administrative costs. ESG funds can be used for emergency shelter, homelessness prevention, and rapid rehousing. ESG funds can be used for emergency shelter, renovation, rehabilitation, and conversion of buildings, as well as providing services like employment, health, education, family support, substance abuse, victim, and mental health services. Funds can also cover maintenance, operation, insurance, utilities, and furnishing costs for emergency shelters. Additionally, funds can be used for homelessness prevention, rental assistance, and quickly finding housing for the homeless. The CoC program provides funds for transitional housing, permanent housing, and Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS) for data collection. HUD considers permanent housing to include permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing. CoC funds are distributed through a community process known as the \"Continuum of Care.\" The Continuum of Care program involves local communities establishing advisory boards to address homelessness. A Collaborative Applicant applies for funds on behalf of eligible recipients, including state and local governments, Public Housing Authorities, and nonprofit organizations. Funds can be used for acquiring, rehabilitating, or constructing properties, leasing properties, providing rental assistance, and covering operating costs. HUD's Continuum of Care program allows funds to be used for various purposes, including operating costs. Grantees and Collaborative Applicants can use funds for administrative purposes, with specific percentages allocated for each. Recipient communities must match grant funds with 25% from other sources. Rural communities have a reserved 5% of funds and can apply separately for Continuum of Care Program funds. As of the report date, HUD had not yet distributed funds to rural communities through the RHS program. The RHS program allows grants to be awarded to rural communities for rehousing homeless individuals, stabilizing housing situations, and improving housing for low-income residents. Unlike the Continuum of Care program, rural communities can serve individuals who may not meet HUD's definition of homelessness. No metropolitan city in the state can be the sole beneficiary of RHS grants. The RHS program provides grants to rural communities for rehousing homeless individuals and improving housing for low-income residents. Grantees can use funds for transitional housing, permanent housing, rapid rehousing, supportive services, and homelessness prevention activities. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program aims to reintegrate homeless veterans into the workforce through employment programs. Services include outreach, resume assistance, and job placement. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) provides various services to help homeless veterans find employment and stability, including job search assistance, job training, and supportive services like housing assistance and mental health treatment. The program was expanded in 2010 to include women veterans and veterans with children, with child care services also offered. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) was authorized at $50 million through FY2020 under the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018. The program provides job training and placement services to veterans at risk of homelessness, with authority shared between the VA and the Department of Labor. The program was extended through FY2012 under the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008, expanding the number of service sites to 12. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) was expanded to 12 service sites, authorized through FY2020. Funding has been provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2018. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program offers outreach, health exams, treatment, and referrals for homeless veterans with mental health and substance use issues. Long-term treatment is provided in community-based facilities. The Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program, authorized through FY2020, offers housing through residential treatment facilities or organizations receiving Grant and Per Diem funding for transitional housing. The program focuses on providing capital grants for building or rehabilitating facilities for transitional housing and service centers for homeless veterans, with a goal of transitioning veterans to permanent housing quickly. The Grant and Per Diem program provides capital grants for housing interventions for homeless veterans, including building purchase, expansion, and van procurement. Service centers offer various support services like health care, counseling, meals, and job training. The program funds up to 65% of facility costs, with grantees covering the remaining 35%. Recipients and eligible organizations can apply for per diem funds, with priority given to grant recipients. The program is authorized at $258 million. The Grant and Per Diem program provides capital grants for housing interventions for homeless veterans, including building purchase, expansion, and van procurement. There is a special purpose program within the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program that provides grants to health care facilities and providers for homeless veterans who are women, veterans with children, frail elderly, and those with terminal illnesses or chronic mental illnesses. The program was most recently authorized at $5 million per year through FY2020. The Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program is a residential rehabilitation program specifically intended to meet the clinical needs of homeless veterans. The Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans program provides tailored treatment for veterans with mental illness or substance use disorders to stabilize their clinical status and address the underlying causes of homelessness. Services include community outreach, assessment, evaluation, treatment, rehabilitation, and post-discharge support. Veterans can receive housing assistance and employment training through the program. The Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) program, established under the Veterans Omnibus Health Care Act of 1976, aims to prepare veterans for competitive employment and independent living through remunerative work assignments at VA medical centers. Veterans with severe physical or mental conditions engage in structured daily activities to enhance their functioning and facilitate successful re-entry into the community. The CWT program provides temporary staffing services to companies, funded by the VA's Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund. The program includes a Therapeutic Transitional Housing component for participants with mental illnesses or substance use disorders who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The VA now exclusively owns and operates transitional housing for veterans, providing supportive services for up to 12 months. The HUD-VASH program offers Section 8 rental assistance vouchers to homeless veterans, with VA support services. Originally a HUD-VA partnership, HUD-VASH now serves homeless veterans with or without chronic mental illnesses or substance use disorders. Each veteran receiving a housing voucher is assigned a VA case manager for supportive services. The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001 authorized additional HUD-VASH vouchers for homeless veterans. Funding for new vouchers was allocated starting in the 110th Congress, with a total of $715 million appropriated through FY2018. This funding is expected to support over 90,000 vouchers for one-year terms. Funding for HUD-VASH vouchers is expected to increase to over 90,000 vouchers over time. In FY2015, funds were allocated for a tribal HUD-VASH program supporting around 500 vouchers. Supportive services funding is provided through the VA medical services appropriation. The Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008 authorized a program for very low-income veterans and their families transitioning from homelessness to housing. The Supportive Services for Veteran Families program was authorized at $380 million for FY2019. The Authorities Act of 2018 prioritizes funding for organizations assisting families transitioning from homelessness to permanent housing. Eligible services include outreach, case management, rent/utility assistance, and help with VA benefits. The VA also has an Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans to provide consultation and advice on VA services for homeless veterans. The Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans, authorized through FY2022, consists of 15 members from various backgrounds. The VA's Veterans Benefits Administration can sell foreclosed properties at a discount to house homeless veterans. This program, Acquired Property Sales for Homeless Veterans, was authorized through FY2017. The VA Excess Property for Homeless Veterans Initiative distributes federal excess personal property to homeless veterans. The Veterans Justice Outreach Program helps veterans involved in the justice system connect with VA health services. Dental care is provided for homeless veterans to aid in gaining employment or treating conditions. Enhanced Use Leasing authority allows the VA to lease properties to outside entities. Through Enhanced Use Leasing authority, the VA can lease properties for supportive housing for homeless veterans. Stand Downs organized by local communities provide services like food, shelter, and clothing for homeless veterans. Efforts to end homelessness among specific populations, including veterans, have been ongoing for nearly 10 years. The National Alliance to End Homelessness introduced a strategy almost 20 years ago to end homelessness in 10 years, focusing on developing local plans, utilizing mainstream programs, and implementing a housing first strategy. The National Alliance to End Homelessness introduced a strategy to prevent homelessness by employing a housing first approach and developing a national infrastructure of support. The focus was on ending homelessness among chronically homeless individuals, which was later updated to include families with a head of household who has a disability. In response to the NAEH report, HUD and President Bush committed to ending chronic homelessness within a decade. The Millennial Housing Commission also recommended this goal in 2002. USICH was re-engaged in 2003 to pursue the 10-year plan, leading to federal initiatives focusing on this objective. However, concerns were raised about allocating resources mainly to chronically homeless individuals. The HEARTH Act mandated the USICH to draft a Federal Strategic Plan to End Homelessness among various groups, including families with children, homeless youth, veterans, and chronically homeless individuals. In addition, the VA announced a plan to end homelessness among veterans within five years. Plans to end chronic homelessness, homelessness generally, and veterans' homelessness are described, along with statistics on homeless populations. The George W. Bush Administration set a goal in 2002 to end chronic homelessness by 2012, with a focus on individuals using a disproportionate amount of shelter days. Permanent supportive housing, which includes housing and social services, is considered a solution for chronic homelessness. Services provided can include case management, substance abuse counseling, mental health services, income management, and life skills services. The \"housing first\" model of permanent supportive housing offers immediate housing to homeless individuals with addictions and mental health issues, without requiring sobriety or psychiatric medication adherence. It emphasizes resident choice in services and housing location. Research in the late 1990s showed that providing housing for homeless individuals with severe mental illnesses reduced temporary stays in public accommodations like hospitals, jails, or prisons, leading to increased resources for housing first initiatives. The Administration initiated projects in the mid-2000s to end chronic homelessness within 10 years. These projects included collaborations with HUD, HHS, and VA to fund housing and treatment, a project with HUD and DOL for permanent supportive housing and employment assistance, and a pilot program providing supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals addicted to alcohol. HUD has also encouraged the development of housing for chronically homeless individuals through its Homeless Assistance Grants distribution since FY2005. HUD distributes Homeless Assistance Grants through an annual competition, with additional funding for projects serving those experiencing chronic homelessness. The Continuum of Care program requires 30% of funds to be used for permanent supportive housing for individuals with disabilities or families with a disabled head of household. The requirement for permanent supportive housing will decrease as communities increase permanent housing units, ending when HUD reaches 150,000 units. The HEARTH Act, part of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, mandated the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness to develop a National Strategic Plan to End Homelessness. The plan, titled Opening Doors, aimed to end chronic homelessness and homelessness among veterans within five years, and for families, youth, and children within 10 years. The plan was updated in 2015 to further define the goal of ending homelessness. The 2018 update to the USICH plan, titled Home, Together, aims to make homelessness rare, brief, and non-recurring. It focuses on identifying and helping people at risk of homelessness, providing immediate shelter and services, and connecting individuals to permanent housing. The plan includes increased focus on affordable housing, prevention, unsheltered homelessness, rural communities, employment, and learning from those who have experienced homelessness. The VA announced a plan in 2009 to end veteran homelessness by 2015, but did not meet the goal. They continue to work towards reducing veteran homelessness, stating in 2017 that it may be a multi-year process. The plan includes identifying homeless veterans, providing immediate shelter, assisting with permanent housing, and preventing future homelessness. The VA has not released a formal written plan but has outlined strategies in budget documents since 2011. According to HUD's point-in-time counts, there have been reductions in homelessness, especially among specific populations like families with children, veterans, and chronically homeless individuals. However, some urban areas with rising housing costs have seen an increase in homelessness. Cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, and Honolulu have experienced significant spikes in homelessness. See Table 1 for point-in-time counts since 2007. Table 2 displays funding levels for targeted homelessness programs from FY2008 to FY2019, excluding VA programs. FY2019 funding numbers are only available for select departments. Table 3 shows actual obligations for VA homeless programs from FY2005 to FY2017, with FY2018 data not yet finalized."
