It initiated a boycott against Zionist goods in Palestine in 1945, which later expanded to include Israel and its supporters. The boycott is managed by the Central Boycott Office in Damascus. The U.S. government has been actively working to end the Arab League's boycott, with legislative actions dating back to 1959. Congress passed laws in 1977 making it illegal for U.S. companies to cooperate with the boycott, imposing penalties on violators. The Department of Commerce defines participation in the boycott as agreements or actual refusal to do business with certain entities. The Arab League's boycott includes agreements to refuse or discriminate against Israel or blacklisted companies, furnish information about business relationships, and disclose personal information. U.S. taxpayers who cooperate with the boycott risk losing tax benefits. The boycott has three tiers, with the primary tier prohibiting citizens of Arab League members from engaging in business with certain entities. The Arab League boycott prohibits members from engaging in business with Israel or blacklisted companies. It includes primary, secondary, and tertiary tiers, with the tertiary tier extending the boycott to companies with ties to blacklisted entities. The boycott is not enforced by the Arab League. The Arab League boycott of Israel includes regulations that serve as a model for member countries' laws, recommending certificates of origin for goods to ensure compliance. Enforcement varies among member states, with some having limited trade relations with Israel. The Arab League does not publicly disclose which countries enforce the boycott. Individual adherence to the boycott is determined by each member state, with some publicly supporting it while trading with Israel quietly. Some Arab League countries publicly support the boycott of Israel but quietly trade with Israel. The Arab boycott is seen as mostly symbolic, with enforcement depending on the Israeli-Palestinian issue's intensity. U.S. pressure has weakened the Arab League's ability to maintain the boycott. Some Arab countries are evading the boycott of Israel, particularly the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia, due to U.S. pressures towards normalization with Israel. Several countries have formally ended their adherence to the boycott, such as Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, and Mauritania. Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia do not enforce the boycott, while the Gulf Cooperation Council countries only enforce the primary boycott. In 1996, GCC states recognized the need to eliminate the boycott for peace and economic development. U.S. companies still receive boycott requests from GCC countries. Lebanon enforces primary, secondary, and tertiary boycotts. Some OIC member states enforce a boycott against Israel, while others like Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan have no boycott and even encourage trade with Israel. The impact of the sporadically applied boycott is hard to measure in terms of denied capital or revenue to Israel. The impact of the Arab boycott on Israel's economy is difficult to measure, with limited trade between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Enforcement of the secondary and tertiary boycotts has decreased over time, reducing their effect. A 1996 study by researchers at Tel Aviv University focused on the automobile market, showing that a relaxation of boycott enforcement led to Asian countries exporting cars to Israel, preventing a 12% decrease in the Israeli car market. The Arab boycott's impact on the Israeli economy is hard to measure due to limited trade. A study showed that a relaxation of boycott enforcement prevented a 12% decrease in the Israeli car market, leading to a $790 price increase per car. Despite limited economic impact, the boycott holds symbolic importance. Arab countries link normalization with Israel to resolving the Palestinian conflict, while Israel seeks acceptance and foreign investment. The U.S. government opposes the boycott and works to end its enforcement. The U.S. government officially opposes the Arab League boycott of Israel and works to end its enforcement. Legislation states that the boycott is an impediment to peace and U.S. investment in the region. It calls for the boycott to be terminated, normalization of relations with Israel, and continued opposition to the boycott by the President and Secretary of State. The United States opposes the Arab League boycott of Israel and urges for concrete steps to demonstrate this opposition, such as considering participation in the boycott when selling weapons to recipient countries. The President should report annually to Congress on efforts to encourage Arab League states to normalize relations with Israel and end the boycott. Antiboycott legislation was passed in the late 1970s to discourage cooperation with the boycott. The U.S. legislation and practices were enacted to counteract the Arab League boycott of Israel and apply to all non-sanctioned boycotts. They aim to prevent U.S. firms from participating in foreign policies that go against U.S. policy, such as refusing to do business in Israel or with blacklisted companies. The U.S. antiboycott laws prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, or nationality, furnishing information about business relationships in Israel or with blacklisted companies, and disclosing personal information about another person. These laws are part of the Export Administration Act of 1979 and the Ribicoff Amendment to the Tax Reform Act of 1976. The Department of Commerce enforces export-related antiboycott provisions, while the IRS administers tax-related regulations to penalize U.S. taxpayers participating in boycotts. The Export Administration Act (EAA) prohibits compliance with unsanctioned foreign boycotts and mandates reporting of such requests to the Department of Commerce. Violations can result in criminal penalties of up to $50,000 fine or imprisonment for up to five years, or up to 10 years during periods of continued emergency powers. Violations of the Export Administration Act (EAA) can result in fines of up to $50,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. Penalties for violations of the EAR include denial of export privileges, fines of up to $11,000 per violation, and exclusion from practice. Violations of antiboycott regulations under IEEPA can result in fines of up to $250,000 per violation or twice the value of the transaction for administrative violations, and up to $1 million and 20 years imprisonment per violation for criminal violations. BIS introduced a voluntary disclosure program in 2007 to reduce fines for exporters who voluntarily disclose violations of U.S. antiboycott laws. The new guidelines for mitigating violations of U.S. antiboycott laws require notification before BIS learns of the violation from other sources. The Ribicoff Amendment added Section 999 to the Internal Revenue Code, denying tax benefits to exporters participating in boycotts. U.S. taxpayers must report operations related to countries on the Treasury's annual list requiring participation in boycotts. The list of countries requesting U.S. companies to participate in prohibited boycotts includes Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Denying tax benefits to firms participating in the boycott is an effective strategy, but its effectiveness may have decreased due to reduced export tax benefits. The BDS movement against Israel, linked to its treatment of Palestinians, has gained support among civil society organizations. The BDS movement against Israel, related to its treatment of Palestinians, has gained support among civil society organizations in various countries. Some divestment and boycotts of Israel or Israeli goods have occurred, with actions such as academic boycotts and withdrawal of investments from companies involved in West Bank settlements. Additionally, concerns about connections with settlement activity have led to pension funds and companies in some European countries canceling contracts or withdrawing investments.

Concerns about connections with settlement activity have led to pension funds and companies in some European countries canceling contracts or withdrawing investments. Extending U.S. antiboycott measures to incorporate the BDS movement raises challenges as it is an informal grouping of civil society organizations, originating among Palestinians but expanding into other countries, rather than a direct economic pressure on companies. U.S. legislation similar to the 2011 Israeli \"Anti-Boycott Law\" may face free speech challenges due to civil penalties for organizing or endorsing boycotts against Israel."
