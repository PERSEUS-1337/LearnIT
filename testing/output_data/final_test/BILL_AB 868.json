    "title": "AB 868",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 20588 of the Government Code allows the board to enter into agreements with county retirement systems for termination of participation of public agencies with certain safety members who have transferred to a county, fire authority, or district. The board can enter agreements with county retirement systems to protect interests, determine transfer of cash or securities, address transfer-related issues, and apply only to employees employed on the effective date. The board can enter agreements with county retirement systems to transfer liability for payment of benefits to employees. Transferred members will be subject to the provisions of the county retirement system as if they had been a member from the start. Section 31657 of the Government Code is amended to apply only in Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino Counties. Whenever a person transitions from being employed by a public agency or the state to being employed by a county, fire authority, or district in a county where this law applies, they will become a member of the county retirement system immediately. They will receive service credit in the county system for the service they had in the previous retirement system without needing to make additional contributions. The board of retirement receives certification from the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System for the service credited at the time of cessation of employment. An amount equal to the person's normal contributions to the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System is paid into the county retirement fund, credited to the member's individual account in the county retirement system. (c) An amount equal to all contributions made to the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System on account of service rendered is paid to the county retirement system, along with interest. The board of retirement elects to apply this section to mitigate potential financial impact from disability retirements in the future. This section applies to certain classes of counties as defined by specific statutes."
