    "content": "Following high-profile train incidents, Congress passed the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA08; P.L. 110-432), mandating positive train control (PTC) on railroads by December 31, 2015. PTC is a system to prevent train incidents by automatically stopping trains in emergencies. The deadline was extended to December 31, 2018, with the possibility of further extensions for certain railroads. Implementation of PTC involves significant costs and policy-related issues. The United States railroad network comprises freight and passenger operations, with the seven largest operators being Class I freight railroads. Other operators include Class II or regional freight railroads, Class III or short-line railroads, state and local government agencies, and Amtrak. Various policy-related issues such as interoperability, radio spectrum access, market entry barriers, and suitability of PTC in passenger terminals are being addressed. Passenger and freight railroad companies operate on tracks owned by other railroads under federal orders or voluntary agreements. Amtrak can also use its own equipment on freight lines. Most freight lines have a single track with passing sidings, while high-volume corridors may have multiple tracks for increased capacity and safety. Train dispatchers and signals provide authority for safe travel, with some remote areas operating without signalization in \"dark territory.\" In \"dark territory,\" railroads rely on dispatchers for authority and priority assignment. Signaled tracks use automatic block signals to indicate to engineers whether to proceed or stop before entering the next block. This system is required for freight trains traveling 50+ mph and passenger trains traveling 60+ mph. Railroads have different operating rules for freight and passenger trains traveling at high speeds. Passenger trains often use a \"cab signal\" system to relay signal information to the engineer, helping in situations where visibility is poor. An \"automatic train stop\" system can override the engineer's control if a signal is not acknowledged. Passenger trains use cab signals to relay signal information to the engineer, and an automatic train stop system can override the engineer's control if a signal is not acknowledged. These safety devices have been required by federal regulations since 1947 for passenger trains traveling over 79 mph. Most rail-related fatalities are caused by pedestrians trespassing on tracks or vehicles being hit at grade crossings, with train derailments and collisions causing relatively few fatalities. Passenger deaths from train derailments or collisions led Congress to mandate Positive Train Control (PTC) technology. While PTC focuses on preventing train collisions, installing sensors at crossings could enhance safety by engaging brakes if issues are detected. Congress has requested a study on PTC's effectiveness in preventing grade-crossing incidents, which have caused high-profile accidents in the past. A train collision caused by a manual switch error released chlorine gas, killing nine people and leading to the evacuation of 5,400 individuals. This incident prompted the introduction of the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2007. Another fatal collision in Chatsworth, CA in 2008 highlighted the importance of implementing safety systems like Positive Train Control (PTC) to prevent accidents. The Chatsworth train accident in 2008 was caused by negligence of the engineer who missed a red signal while texting. This incident led to the implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) technology, mandated by the Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2008. The Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated Positive Train Control (PTC) technology on railroad tracks carrying passenger service or over 5 million tons of freight, including toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials. Efforts were made to exempt certain track segments from PTC requirements, resulting in changes to the final rule by the FRA in 2012. The Regional Railroad Association proposed changes to the FRA final rule, including eliminating the PTC requirement for short-distance trains and extending the deadline for smaller railroads to implement PTC until 2020. The FRA approved these changes. In the 112th Congress, bills were considered to delay the PTC deadline, with the Senate approving the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act to allow extensions until 2018 if full implementation was deemed infeasible. The American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act of 2012 proposed extending the deadline for Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation to December 31, 2020, allowing railroads to adjust routes and implement alternative safety measures for tracks not transporting passengers. The 2012 surface transportation bill did not change existing law concerning Positive Train Control (PTC). A Metro-North commuter train derailment in 2013 renewed calls for PTC implementation after four passengers died and many were injured due to excessive speed on the tracks. The FRA ordered Metro-North to add speed control to its signal system and station a second crew member with train control duties at certain locations until it did so, following incidents at Chatsworth, CA, and the Bronx, NY, which revealed disparities in signal system capabilities among commuter operators. Calls for PTC installation were intensified after these incidents. Calls for PTC installation were intensified after incidents in Chatsworth, CA, and the Bronx, NY. An Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia in 2015, killing eight passengers due to the lack of PTC technology. The NTSB found that PTC could have prevented the accident. Amtrak has since installed PTC on all segments of the Northeast Corridor. The NTSB forum on Positive Train Control (PTC) discussed the challenges railroads faced in meeting the original December 31, 2015 deadline. Only a few railroads were on track to meet the deadline, prompting Congress to extend it to December 31, 2018 with the Positive Train Control Enforcement and Implementation Act of 2015. This extension was necessary as most freight and commuter railroads were unable to implement PTC by the initial deadline. The Positive Train Control (PTC) deadline was extended to December 31, 2018, with the requirement for railroads to have installed all necessary hardware and acquired radio spectrum. Two accidents occurred in locations where PTC installation was in progress but the system was not yet operational. PTC is a system designed to prevent train collisions and derailments. Most U.S. railroads are implementing an \"overlay-type\" Positive Train Control (PTC) system, using radio communication to provide signals to train engineers and allowing dispatchers to stop trains in emergencies. The system integrates sensors, signals, and transponders over existing tracks, with the network operating center sending speed restrictions and authorities to trains passing over transponders. The network office does not track real-time train location but receives notifications. The network operating office receives notifications when a train passes wayside infrastructure, using analog radio signals for communication. Equipment on the train receives information from transponders to alert the operator of signals, movements, and work zones. The PTC system can override engineer authority to slow or stop the train in case of human error. Communications-based train control (CBTC) is a more advanced dispatching framework. CBTC is a sophisticated computer-aided dispatching framework that uses GPS to track train location and speed, with additional components for precision and system redundancy. It allows for automatic tracking of train movements, sending speed restrictions and movement authorities, and ensuring interoperability among different railroads. The CBTC system sends speed restrictions and movement authorities to trains, using location and speed data to prevent potential incidents like derailments and collisions. It incorporates various factors like train speed, reaction time, and track conditions to calculate braking distance and ensure an emergency stop without excessive speed restrictions. CBTC is suitable for high-speed passenger lines and is being implemented in European rail lines, New York City Transit, and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) is a system adopted by various transportation authorities, including New York City Transit and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. It has the potential for driverless trains but requires seamless communication coverage along PTC-equipped tracks to avoid safety risks. The system also necessitates significant investment in communication infrastructure, making it more expensive than overlay-type systems. Despite the higher cost, CBTC offers benefits such as real-time communication for efficient scheduling, increased capacity, and fuel savings for railroad operators. However, U.S. railroads have deemed the advantages of CBTC not worth the additional cost. The advantages of communication-based train control are not worth the additional cost of installing it at the present time. Both overlay-type systems and CBTC systems aim to reduce collisions between trains but do not address intrusion into railroad right-of-way. Only four railroads are expected to have fully installed the necessary PTC equipment by the end of 2018, with potential extensions needed for full compliance. As of June 30, 2018, Positive Train Control (PTC) was operational on 66% of required freight route miles and 2% of the passenger network. PTC was installed on 93% of freight locomotives and 73% of passenger locomotives. Some commuter railroads like Caltrain, Maryland Area Regional Commuter, and New Jersey Transit were at risk of missing deadline extensions due to incomplete PTC hardware installation. Most PTC projects use fixed transponders and GPS for one-way communication to trains, with only a few involving two-way communication and real-time information. Smaller railroad companies and commuter lines often rely on Class I railroads for PTC implementation. The development of Positive Train Control (PTC) systems in the United States began with radio-based CBTC systems in 1983, but early systems were not economically viable for nationwide deployment. Amtrak adopted an automatic train control (ATC) system in the Northeast Corridor in 1991. Smaller railroad companies and commuter lines often rely on Class I railroads for PTC implementation. The development of Positive Train Control (PTC) systems in the United States began with radio-based CBTC systems in 1983. Amtrak adopted an automatic train control (ATC) system in the Northeast Corridor in 1991. CSX Transportation developed a PTC system using GPS and fixed infrastructure for track location information. Other railroads like BNSF, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, and Chicago's Metra commuter line are planning similar PTC systems. Norfolk Southern is implementing a computer-aided dispatch system for small track segments. Lessons from overseas incidents highlight the importance of proper testing and functioning of train control systems to prevent accidents. The train control system was turned off on a German commuter locomotive to make up time, contributing to a collision with another train in February 2016. The estimated cost of implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) on all affected railroads is over $10 billion, with annual maintenance costs projected at $850 million. The four largest railroad companies, covering almost all of the 60,000 miles of Class I track under the PTC mandate, face significant costs for PTC installation. CSX estimated its cost for installing PTC at $2.4 billion in 2017. In 2017, CSX estimated the cost of installing PTC at $2.4 billion, with $1.8 billion already spent by 2016. Union Pacific estimated their total cost for PTC at $2.9 billion, with $2.3 billion spent by the end of 2016. Smaller freight companies share tracks with larger railroads, presenting interoperability challenges but also cost-saving opportunities. The infrastructure cost for Metro-North and Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority on the Northeast Corridor is estimated at $350 million and $100 million, respectively. The expense of PTC could limit commuter rail development, as stated by the FRA. The cost of implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) for commuter railroads is primarily borne by state or local governments, with some federal assistance provided. This includes loans and grants totaling over $1.8 billion for PTC implementation. In March 2018, the DOT Inspector General reviewed how railroads had utilized federal funding for PTC. Some believe that the expense of PTC could hinder commuter rail development. Some shippers fear that railroad companies will pass on the costs of implementing Positive Train Control (PTC) to customers, potentially leading to price increases. The Chlorine Institute expects higher costs for shipments of toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials due to safety concerns driving the PTC mandate. The Federal Railroad Administration estimated $90 million in annual safety benefits from PTC implementation, based on past incidents. The implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) is estimated to prevent various incidents such as fatalities, injuries, equipment damage, and hazardous material releases. A 1999 FRA estimate suggested that PTC could have prevented an average of 7 fatalities, 22 injuries, $20 million in property damages, and evacuations of 150 people annually between 1987 and 1997. While PTC can prevent many serious incidents caused by human error, it is expected to only prevent less than 2% of the 2,000 railroad collisions and derailments that occur each year, with the majority of incidents being less severe and occurring in rail yards. There is uncertainty surrounding the potential business and social benefits of PTC. The potential business and social benefits of Positive Train Control (PTC) are uncertain due to disagreements. Benefits may come from increased railroad efficiency, reduced logistical costs, and freight diversion from trucks to rail. Full computer-based train control, not just PTC alone, is necessary for these benefits. Computer-aided dispatch can increase capacity, reduce fuel consumption, lower operating costs, and lead to faster delivery. The FRA projects $4 billion in potential annual business benefits a decade after full PTC implementation. The overlay system without CBTC capability planned by railroads may offer little to no business benefit. The Class I freight railroads generally run trains with two-person crews, but Positive Train Control (PTC) might facilitate one-person crews. However, the FRA has proposed a rule requiring two-person crews. The social benefits of the overlay system are likely to come largely from the anticipated reduction in incidents. Freight operators trade trackage or haulage rights and share revenue from the shipper, as shippers' needs do not always correspond to railroads' track ownership. FRA regulations require railroads' PTC systems to be interoperable for any train operating on PTC-equipped track. The federal mandate requires railroads' PTC systems to be interoperable so that any train on PTC-equipped track can communicate with the host railroad's system. UP, CSXT, and NS have received FRA \"type approvals\" for Interoperable Electronic Train Management Systems (I-ETMS), ensuring compatibility. BNSF is updating its precursor ETMS to I-ETMS for interoperability. Passenger service interoperability is also a concern, especially in the Northeast Corridor where Amtrak operates on both Amtrak-owned and other tracks. Amtrak operates on Amtrak-owned and regional transit authorities' tracks in the Northeast Corridor, with a focus on achieving interoperability in train control systems. The PTC mandate may increase costs for railroads due to the need for PTC wayside equipment, adding $50,000 per mile for track installation and $55,000 per locomotive for on-board PTC equipment. The cost of on-board PTC equipment for new rail lines is around $55,000 per locomotive, which is a minor increase in the cost of a new locomotive but substantial compared to used locomotives. Passenger rail operators may need to pay for installing PTC on freight locomotives if using freight-owned tracks. Operating and maintenance costs will also increase, potentially acting as a barrier to railroad expansion and startup services. Interoperability and spectrum compatibility issues could further hinder market entry for new rail services. The cost of implementing a new service over existing rail lines may be prohibitive due to potential upgrades or modifications to PTC systems. Ownership of radio spectrum licenses by certain railroads could dictate leasing prices for PTC systems, potentially impeding competition and preventing new services. This could particularly impact short line and regional railroads operating on Class I tracks. The president of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association testified about how differential pricing by class I carriers can put small railroads out of business. Concerns about PTC creating barriers to railroad competition are hypothetical as no specific complaints have been presented. The crash of a New Jersey Transit train in 2016 is mentioned. The derailment of a New Jersey Transit train in Hoboken, N.J., resulted in one death and over 100 injuries, sparking discussions on PTC requirements in passenger terminals. The train's driver reportedly fell asleep as the train approached the end of the platform. Current FRA regulations exempt PTC installation in terminals with a maximum speed of 20 mph. The NTSB suggested exploring alternative technologies for speed checks in terminals due to the challenges of PTC in such environments."
