    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Science Education Incentive Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that the United States must maintain its position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Over half of the US economic growth is attributed to research and development in science and technology. The United States must maintain its position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Applied research applies answers from basic science to everyday problems, promoting economic growth. Education is critical for developing intellectual capital, including scientists and engineers for research and development. The United States needs technologically proficient workers and scientifically literate voters to excel in a high-tech workplace and make informed decisions. Student performance in math and science shows the need for improved K-12 education with better teaching methods and curricula. Science goes beyond facts and theories. Science is a process of inquiry based on observations and data, leading to understanding through concepts and theories. Students should learn science by doing experiments, starting at an early age. Teachers play a crucial role in connecting students to the content. High-quality teachers should be recruited to promote a respected career in science education. Teachers play a crucial role in presenting a respected and rewarding career in education, with incentives for improvement and essential training. They need to be knowledgeable in their content area, curriculum, research in teaching, and techniques to connect with students effectively. Section 3 introduces a refundable credit for undergraduate education tuition for certain teachers under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A 10% tax credit is allowed for eligible teachers for qualified undergraduate tuition paid, with a maximum credit of $1,000 per year and limited to 10 years. Eligible teachers are defined as full-time teachers in kindergarten through grade 12. The tax credit is available for substitute teachers in grades K-12 who teach math, science, engineering, or technology courses and hold a degree in these subjects from a qualified institution. They must also be highly qualified as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Education Act of 1965 specifies that school administrative functions can be considered teaching courses if they relate to such courses or are for a school focusing on them. A qualified educational institution must have a high percentage of graduates certified as teachers and an advisory committee including practicing educators.

The Education Act of 1965 specifies that school administrative functions can be considered teaching courses if they relate to such courses or are for a school focusing on them. Qualified undergraduate tuition for certain teachers and credits for contributions benefiting science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at the elementary and secondary school level are addressed in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this section. The Education Act of 1965 allows school administrative functions related to teaching courses. Contributions benefiting science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education at the elementary and secondary school level are addressed in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Education Act of 1965 allows school administrative functions related to teaching courses. The elementary and secondary science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) contributions credit under section 38 is determined as 100 percent of qualified SMET contributions, including school contributions, teacher externship expenses, and teacher training expenses. Qualified SMET school contributions consist of property and service contributions. The term 'SMET property contributions' refers to the deductible amount for charitable contributions of SMET inventory property to elementary or secondary schools in the U.S. for educational purposes in grades K-12. The property must align with the school's education plan and not be transferred by the school. The term 'SMET service contributions' refer to the amount paid for SMET services provided in the U.S. for the benefit of students at elementary or secondary schools, in accordance with specific provisions. Deductions are determined as if the limitation under section 170(e)(3)(B) applied to all SMET inventory property. The term 'SMET services' refers to services provided by taxpayers engaged in the business of providing education in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology to K-12 schools without charge. SMET inventory property includes property needed by schools for education in these areas, as determined by the school. The term 'SMET services' encompasses services needed by schools for K-12 education in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology, including teaching courses in these areas. 'SMET teacher externship expenses' refer to amounts paid for a taxpayer's externship program, specifically for eligible SMET teachers participating in the program. The term 'SMET externship program' refers to programs established by taxpayers in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology areas, where eligible teachers receive training to enhance their teaching skills or improve their knowledge. Eligible SMET teachers are individuals teaching in grades K-12 at educational organizations in the United States or on a U.S. military base. The term 'SMET teacher training expenses' refers to amounts paid by taxpayers in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology for eligible teachers' participation in training programs to enhance their teaching skills. No double benefit deduction is allowed. No deduction allowed for double benefit under this chapter. Section 38(b) of the Code is amended to include the SMET contributions credit. No carryback of section 45g credit before enactment. No portion of the unused business credit for any taxable year attributable to the credit under section 45G cannot be carried back to a taxable year before the enactment of this provision. SEC. 45G allows contributions to benefit science, math, engineering, and technology education at the elementary and secondary school level. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5 ensures that no part of the unused business credit under section 45G can be carried back to a year before this provision. Additionally, it prohibits any federal entity from controlling the curriculum, program, or personnel of educational institutions."
