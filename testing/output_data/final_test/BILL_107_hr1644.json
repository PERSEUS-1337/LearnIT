    "content": "The \"Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001\" may be cited as such. It includes findings related to human cloning. Congress finds that there is a risk of attempting to clone human beings using somatic cell nuclear transfer, which is considered unethical and irresponsible. Cloning for human reproduction could lead to stillborn, unhealthy, or disabled children, turning reproduction into a manufacturing process. Cloning for human reproduction raises ethical concerns as it blurs parental roles and could be done without consent. The process involves creating cloned human embryos for research or as sources of cells for treatment. The prospect of creating new human life solely for exploitation and destruction has been condemned on moral grounds. Recent scientific advances with adult stem cells offer morally unproblematic alternatives to human cloning. A ban on human cloning must stop the process at the beginning to be effective, as it involves privacy, simple embryo transfer, and government prevention efforts. The use of cloning for reproductive purposes raises moral, legal, and practical issues. Cloning for DNA fragments and somatic cells is considered appropriate medical technology. The Council of Europe prohibits cloning human beings due to the instrumentalization of human beings. The Council of Europe prohibits human cloning as it goes against human dignity and is a misuse of biology and medicine. Collaborative efforts in human cloning impact interstate and international commerce, influencing biotechnology companies' research and development resources. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING. Title 18, United States Code, amended to include CHAPTER 16--HUMAN CLONING. Sec. 301 defines human cloning as a form of asexual reproduction using human somatic cells. Sec. 302 prohibits human cloning in interstate commerce. The legislation prohibits human cloning in interstate commerce, including performing or attempting human cloning, participating in such attempts, or importing cloned products. Violators may face fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or civil penalties for pecuniary gain. The legislation prohibits human cloning in interstate commerce, with penalties including a civil penalty of not less than $1,000,000 and not more than double the gross gain. Scientific research areas not prohibited by this section are exempt, such as research in cloning techniques for non-human entities. SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS: Human cloning is prohibited in interstate commerce with penalties including a civil penalty of not less than $1,000,000 and not more than double the gross gain. The sense of Congress is to advocate for an international effort to prohibit human cloning and to commission a study on the use of cloning to produce human embryos for research, including ethical, legal, and medical aspects. The legislation on human cloning prohibits the asexual production of genetically identical human organisms and requires a review of cloning technology every 5 years to maintain effectiveness."
