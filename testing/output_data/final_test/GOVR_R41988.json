    "content": "The Section 199 domestic production activities deduction was created in 2004 to replace an export subsidy found to violate trade agreements. It aimed to reduce U.S. corporate tax rates and support manufacturing. The Section 199 deduction, created in 2004 to replace an export subsidy, aimed to reduce U.S. corporate tax rates and support manufacturing. The deduction helped address challenges in the manufacturing sector during the early 2000s economic slowdown and promote international competitiveness. Despite generating additional revenues, the deduction resulted in a net revenue loss of $27.3 billion over the 2005-2014 budget window. Various modifications have been made to the deduction since its enactment, including clarifications on wage limits and temporary benefits for Puerto Rico. The Section 199 deduction, created in 2004 to replace an export subsidy, aimed to reduce U.S. corporate tax rates and support manufacturing. Temporary provisions for Puerto Rico were added in 2006 and extended as part of \"tax extenders.\" Changes in 2008 limited oil-related activities to a 6% deduction and modified the deduction for the domestic film industry. Additionally, crude oil refiners not part of major integrated oil companies saw enhancements to the Section 199 deduction. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 limited transportation costs for crude oil refiners not part of major integrated oil companies to 25% for the Section 199 deduction, resulting in a larger deduction. This provision was temporary to support independent refiners after changes in crude oil export policy and is set to expire in 2021. The production activities deduction allows taxpayers to deduct taxable income derived from qualified production activities or taxable income, based on domestic production gross receipts. The Section 199 production activities deduction allows taxpayers to deduct eligible income derived from production property manufactured, grown, or extracted within the United States. This deduction also applies to film production, construction, engineering, and architectural services performed domestically. The full deduction rate of 9% was reached in 2010, with eligible taxpayers able to claim a 3% deduction in 2005 and 2006. Taxpayers can claim a tax deduction equal to 3% of taxable income or QPAI, with a 6% deduction rate for tax years 2007-2009. The Treasury defined qualified activities as including minerals mining, oil refining, and construction activities related to drilling oil and gas wells for the Section 199 deduction. The deduction is permanently limited to 6% for oil-related production activities. EESA defined oil-related production activities as those related to production, refining, and processing. The Section 199 production activities deduction allows taxpayers to deduct 3% of taxable income or QPAI, with a 6% rate for certain years. It is limited to 6% for oil-related production activities, which are defined as activities related to the production, refining, processing, transportation, or distribution of oil, gas, or any primary product thereof. The deduction is capped at 50% of W-2 wages paid by the taxpayer and is only applicable to wages for qualifying domestic production activities. This deduction helps reduce the effective tax rate on qualified activities. Tax liability is calculated based on income and expenses, with the production activities deduction rate affecting the equation. Businesses generate income from various sources like goods sales, investments, and royalties. Deductible expenses include salaries, materials, advertising, legal fees, and depreciation. Taxes are levied on profits, not gross income, and the production activities deduction can lower the tax rate. The production activities deduction affects the tax rate by reducing it based on a percentage (p). For example, with p = 0.09, the effective tax rate is 31.85%. In 2016, this deduction led to $20.0 billion in foregone federal revenues. The deduction rate has steadily increased since its enactment in 2005, with significant increases observed when the rate went up. Since 2010, the tax expenditure associated with this provision has doubled. The tax expenditure estimate for the Section 199 deduction has doubled, possibly due to more qualifying activities and firms benefiting from the incentive. The Great Recession and corporate losses in 2010 may have limited firms from claiming the deduction. JCT estimates show that 72% of revenue losses from the deduction between 2016 and 2020 are from the corporate sector, with the rest from S corporations, partnerships, and sole proprietorships. The Section 199 deduction benefits various types of businesses, with the majority of revenue losses coming from the corporate sector. Repealing the deduction could generate additional revenue to offset tax rate reductions, aiming for economic efficiency by maximizing resource productivity. Tax policy plays a crucial role in maximizing economic efficiency by ensuring resources are allocated to their most productive uses. In a well-functioning free market, capital flows to sectors with higher returns until equalized. However, tax incentives can distort resource allocation, leading to suboptimal economic output. The Section 199 deduction benefits businesses but repealing it could generate revenue to offset tax rate reductions and enhance economic efficiency. The Section 199 production activities deduction may distort capital allocation and reduce economic efficiency by directing resources away from their most productive uses. A 2017 Treasury report questioned the justification for this deduction without clear evidence of offsetting social benefits, potentially inefficiently encouraging certain industries over others. The deduction was originally intended to support the manufacturing sector. The decline in manufacturing employment since 2000 can be attributed to increased productivity rather than competition from foreign producers. Tax policies aimed at promoting manufacturing employment may not be correcting for market failures, but the manufacturing sector remains crucial for innovation and export growth. The Section 199 deduction could help counter economic inefficiencies in the tax code. The Section 199 deduction aims to reduce debt-equity distortions in investments financed with debt. It could be more effective if applied to all sectors rather than specific ones. Eliminating the preference for debt over equity in the tax code could also help reduce economic distortions. Using an effective tax rate approach can evaluate tax-induced distortions. The effective tax rate is the percentage increase in the pretax return to capital due to taxation. It influences investment preferences and economic efficiency. Various tax provisions, like the production activities deduction, impact effective tax rates. Depreciation rules also play a role in sector-specific differences in effective tax rates. While the effective tax rate influences investment preferences and economic efficiency, the Section 199 deduction can further distort sectors benefiting from favorable depreciation schedules or tax incentives. Moving towards neutral taxation requires evaluating tax-induced distortions, which may not be fully assessed in isolation. The targeted nature of the Section 199 deduction, instead of a universal rate reduction, may be preferred by certain industries for specific reasons. The Section 199 deduction benefits eligible industries and noncorporate entities by providing a revenue-neutral rate cut. This deduction allows pass-through entities to benefit, unlike a corporate tax rate cut. However, the deduction adds complexity to the tax code, increasing administrative burdens for both taxpayers and the government. Taxpayers must allocate costs and jobs to claim the deduction, leading to increased record-keeping and accounting burdens for firms. The Section 199 deduction may favor larger firms over smaller ones due to increased record-keeping and accounting burdens. There is an incentive for firms to shift profits and claim income related to domestic production activities, potentially straining IRS enforcement resources. The deduction was intended to support the domestic manufacturing sector, with the majority of benefits going to manufacturing industries. In 2013, 66% of corporate claims for the Section 199 deduction were made by firms in the manufacturing sector, which generated 27% of corporate profits and 30% of corporate receipts. Other industries also benefit from the deduction, with the manufacturing sector holding 14% of corporate assets. Shares of Section 199 claims exceed shares of corporate profits, receipts, and assets. Information sector claims 16% of deductions but only contributes 5% of profits. Mining sector claims 3% of deductions but earns 1% of profits. Finance and insurance sector, along with other service-oriented sectors, receive little benefit from the deduction. Finance and insurance sector earns 29% of profits but claims less than 2% of deductions. The Section 199 deduction claims are small for education, health care, and social assistance sectors. Legislative activity related to the deduction and the oil and gas sector has been seen in past Congresses. IRS data provides insight into oil and gas sector deduction claims, which may vary with fluctuating oil prices. Oil and gas activities likely qualify for the deduction in sectors like extraction and refineries. The oil and gas sector is limited to a 6% reduced rate. In 2013, C corporations claimed $33.9 billion in Section 199 deductions, with 1% claimed by oil and gas extracting firms and 5% by petroleum refineries. The manufacturing and mining sectors claimed more deductions than their share of profits, but this was not the case for oil and gas extraction and refining. These sectors reported 6% of corporate profits and claimed roughly 6% of Section 199 deductions. The share of Section 199 deductions in the oil and gas extracting and petroleum refining sectors exceeds their respective shares of corporate assets. However, the petroleum refining sector's share of business receipts surpasses its share of Section 199 deductions. In 2016, 73% of the revenue loss from the production activities deduction was claimed by the corporate sector, with the rest claimed by pass-through businesses on individual tax returns. In 2012, 66% of business receipts across all industrial sectors were received by C corporations, with manufacturing sector having 75% of receipts earned by C corporations. Other sectors like finance, insurance, information, mining, and management also show concentration of business receipts in C corporations. Some sectors benefiting from Section 199 deduction have higher proportion of business activity in S corporations. The construction sector has 36% of business receipts earned by C corporations, with most taxable income flowing through to individuals. Repealing the Section 199 deduction could potentially disadvantage the construction sector compared to other sectors, as their effective corporate tax rates would rise without benefiting from a lower corporate tax rate. Repealing the Section 199 deduction in the construction sector could disadvantage them compared to other sectors. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 and the House Republican 2016 \"Better Way\" Tax Reform Blueprint proposed repealing Section 199 to enhance economic efficiency and remove existing distortions in the tax system. The tax code provisions favoring specific activities may slow economic growth, add complexity, and create unfairness perceptions. The Blueprint suggests that repealing Section 199 deduction, with a reduction in tax rates, could increase effective tax rates for some taxpayers. Repealing the deduction for all businesses but using the revenues to reduce corporate tax rates could raise effective tax rates on pass-through entities. The Section 199 deduction could be modified to address economic efficiency concerns by focusing on activities with positive externalities. The Obama Administration proposed increasing the deduction for manufacturing to lower the effective tax rate in that sector. Others suggest increasing the deduction for research and development activities. The Section 199 deduction could be modified to focus on activities with positive externalities, such as research and development (R&D). However, adding a deduction for R&D may not enhance efficiency if current tax incentives already exist. There are concerns that the deduction could distort economic activity if not limited to industries with positive external effects. Additionally, the deduction could be adjusted to address issues with cross-border capital flows. Limiting the Section 199 deduction to industries with high cross-border capital flows, such as corporate manufacturing, could attract mobile capital to the United States and reduce revenue losses. Repealing the deduction for sectors like fossil fuels may eliminate tax-induced distortions and generate additional revenues. The Obama Administration proposed repealing the deduction for fossil-fuels-related activities as part of a broader objective. The Obama Administration proposed repealing the Section 199 deduction for fossil fuels to phase out subsidies and encourage more investment in other sectors. However, simply repealing the deduction for certain sectors does not address all economic distortions. The deduction was intended to support domestic manufacturing, but there may be other policy motivations for favoring this sector in tax policies. Congress may need to reevaluate the current tax treatment of the U.S. manufacturing sector. The current tax treatment of the U.S. manufacturing sector, including incentives like depreciation schedules, investment tax policies, and R&D incentives, is being reevaluated. Legislation in the 110th Congress limited the Section 199 deduction for oil and gas activities to 6%. Various measures have been considered to modify or repeal this deduction for the oil and gas sector. In the early 110th Congress, the \"Energy Independence Day\" initiative included a provision to repeal the Section 199 deduction for oil and gas in the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act. The Senate Finance Committee-approved energy tax package aimed to repeal the Section 199 deduction for oil and gas, but the Senate did not pass the broader energy bills including this provision. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 did not modify the deduction, and legislative efforts to repeal it continued in 2008 with the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act proposing to limit the deduction for major integrated oil companies. Legislation in 2008 aimed to limit the Section 199 deduction for oil and gas activities, with the House approving the provision. The Senate also considered similar legislation, ultimately approving a 6% deduction for oil-related activities. This limitation was signed into law as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act during the 111th Congress. S.Amdt. 4318 to H.R. 4213 aimed to repeal the Section 199 deduction for oil and gas but was defeated on June 15, 2010. Another measure in 2010, S.Amdt. 4595 to H.R. 5297, sought to eliminate the deduction for major integrated oil companies but was withdrawn on September 15, 2010. In the 112th Congress, the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act (S. 940) proposed repealing the deduction for major integrated oil companies, but cloture was not invoked on May 17, 2011. In late 2015, the Section 199 deduction for the oil and gas sector was modified to address concerns about U.S. refiners being disadvantaged by changes in crude export policy. A temporary provision increasing the tax benefit for independent oil refiners was signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 114-113) in the 114th Congress."
