The trustee of the Manufacturing Reinvestment Account must be an eligible institution and the trust assets cannot be invested in life insurance contracts or collectibles. The assets of the trust cannot be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund. An MRA is exempt from taxation unless it has ceased to be an MRA, but may be subject to taxes on unrelated business income.
