    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5272.2 of the Business and Professions Code exempts certain advertising displays in specific areas of Los Angeles from the regulations outlined in the chapter, as long as specific conditions are met. The advertising display in Los Angeles must comply with an ordinance regulating signage, including details on number of signs, size, spacing, illumination, and operating hours. The owner must submit the ordinance to the department for certification. The Los Angeles advertising display ordinance prohibits advertising tobacco, firearms, or sexually explicit material. It also mandates a minimum distance of 500 feet between advertising displays on the same side of the freeway, unless separated by buildings or obstructions. Compliance is measured along the nearest edge of pavement between the displays. The Los Angeles advertising display ordinance prohibits certain types of advertising and requires a minimum distance of 500 feet between displays on the same side of the freeway. A message center display can be exempt from this requirement for public service messages. The department can receive funding for a message center display for public service messages, subject to federal law compliance. The department may request the FHWA to determine if an advertising display can be placed if they are unable to make the required determination. The City of Los Angeles is responsible for ensuring that authorized displays comply with the ordinance. If they fail to do so after 30 days of notice, they must cover all costs incurred by the department for compliance or legal defense. The Legislature finds it necessary to provide an exemption from some provisions of the Outdoor Advertising Act for certain advertising displays due to unique circumstances and the need for advertising in those locations."
