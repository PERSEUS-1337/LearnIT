    "content": "The Act is known as the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act. Congress finds that the Bureau of Land Management has authority to sell or exchange land identified for disposal, acquire non-Federal land, and conduct land use planning in the public interest. The acquisition of non-Federal land from willing landowners would allow for reconfiguration of land ownership patterns, contribute to administrative efficiency, and improve resource allocation within Federal land management agencies. A more efficient process for land disposal and acquisition would benefit the public interest, especially as many private individuals within Federal land management units desire to sell their land to the government. Federal land management agencies are facing increased workloads due to growing public demand for public land use. In many cases, both inholders and the Federal Government would benefit from Federal acquisition of land. Proceeds from public land disposal could be used to acquire inholdings and improve resource management abilities. The Federal land management agencies and adjoining landowners can benefit from using proceeds from public land disposal to purchase inholdings and other land. This would enhance cooperation with private landowners and promote consolidation of land ownership for better resource management. Additionally, selling public land identified for disposal can ensure fair market value for the land. The Bureau of Land Management may sell public land to minimize disruption to existing land and resource management programs. The Bureau of Land Management may utilize non-Federal entities to prepare appraisal documents for agency review and approval in resource management programs, following the Uniform Standards for Federal Land Acquisition. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"exceptional resource\" refers to a resource of scientific, historic, cultural, or recreational value that requires extraordinary conservation and protection for the benefit of the public. \"Federally designated area\" includes land in Alaska and eleven Western States within specific boundaries. The curr_chunk discusses various types of protected areas managed by different federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management, National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, and designated wilderness areas. The term \"inholding\" is defined as any right within these protected areas. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to federally designated areas, including \"inholding\" as rights held by non-Federal entities within these areas, \"public land\" as defined by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. The curr_chunk focuses on the identification of inholdings within federally designated areas. The Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture will establish a procedure to identify inholdings for potential sale to the Federal Government and provide periodic notice of this policy to the public. Inholdings will only be considered for identification if specified criteria are met. The identification of inholdings for potential sale to the Federal Government under this section does not create any obligation for the landowner to sell or for the United States to acquire the inholding. SEC. 5. DISPOSAL OF PUBLIC LAND. The Secretary will establish a program to complete appraisals and legal requirements for the sale of public land identified for disposal under approved land use plans. The sale will be conducted in accordance with specific sections of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, with exceptions to competitive bidding requirements in certain cases. The Secretary will provide a report of activities under this section in the annual publication of Public Land Statistics. The authority provided under this section shall terminate 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. FEDERAL LAND DISPOSAL ACCOUNT. The gross proceeds from the sale of public land will be deposited into the Federal Land Disposal Account in the Treasury. The funds in this account can be used by the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture without needing further appropriation. These funds will be used for the purchase of land, subject to certain conditions. The Federal Land Disposal Account funds can be used to purchase inholdings, adjacent land with exceptional resources, and for administrative expenses. At least 80% of funds for land purchase in each state must be used for inholdings. Up to 20% of funds can be used for administrative expenses. The Federal Land Disposal Account funds must be used for inholdings and adjacent land with exceptional resources. 80% of funds for land purchase in each state must be used within that state. Priority for acquisition is based on various criteria, and land acquisition must be from a willing seller with acceptable title conveyance. The Federal Land Disposal Account funds can only be used to purchase land with exceptional resources, following specific criteria. The purchased land must have acceptable title conveyance and be priced at fair market value. Additionally, the funds cannot be used to acquire land that is contaminated or difficult to manage as Federal land. The Federal Land Disposal Account funds are supplemental to the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. Upon termination of activities, the account will be closed, and any remaining balance will be available for appropriation under the Act. SEC. 7. SPECIAL PROVISIONS. This Act does not exempt any limitations on land acquisition under Federal Law. It does not apply to land eligible for sale under specific laws. It also does not limit land exchanges under certain authorities. No new rights or benefits are created by this Act that can be enforced against the United States or its agencies."
