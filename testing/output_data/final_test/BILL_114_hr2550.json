The Medical Imaging Modernization Act of 2015 incentivizes transitioning from traditional x-ray imaging to digital radiography through a special payment rule in the Physician Fee Schedule. This rule limits payment for film x-ray imaging services starting in 2017 to encourage the adoption of digital technology. The payment amount for computed radiography imaging services will be reduced by 20 percent for services furnished during 2018-2022, as part of a phased-in limitation. The payment amount for computed radiography imaging services will be reduced by 7 percent for services furnished during 2023 or a subsequent year, and by 10 percent for the technical component. The term 'computed radiography technology' is defined for this purpose. The term 'computed radiography technology' refers to cassette-based imaging using an imaging plate. The Secretary will adopt mechanisms for implementation, including modifiers. An exemption from budget neutrality is granted for reduced expenditures related to transitioning to digital radiography. Effective for fee schedules established in 2017, reduced expenditures related to subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(9) and for fee schedules established in 2018, reduced expenditures related to subparagraph (B) of the same subsection. Additionally, the application of multiple procedure payment reduction under Section 1848(b)(4) of the Social Security Act is eliminated. The Secretary will not apply a multiple procedure payment reduction policy to the professional component of imaging services before conducting an empirical analysis of the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale data. The Data Manager information is used to determine efficiencies in the professional component of imaging services when multiple studies are done on the same patient on the same day, including work sheets detailing reduction percentages and clinical aspects. The assignment of reduction percentages for pre-, intra, and post-service work is explained, along with how they were determined and calculated. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services consulted with radiologists to understand how they interpret studies of multiple body parts on the same individual on the same day. Payment incentive for transitioning from traditional x-ray imaging to digital radiography is introduced under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. This includes a limitation on payment for film x-ray imaging services provided in 2017 or later. The payment amount for computed radiography imaging services using X-rays will be reduced by 20 percent for services provided in 2018-2022. In 2021 or 2022, the payment amount for the technical component of services will be reduced by 7 percent. For services in 2023 or later, the reduction will still apply. In 2021 or 2022, the technical component payment for services will be reduced by 7 percent, and for services in 2023 or later, the reduction will still apply. Additionally, the technical component portion of a global fee for services will be reduced by 10 percent without budget neutrality adjustments. The technical component payment for services will be reduced by 7 percent in 2021 or 2022, and by 10 percent for services in 2023 or later, without budget neutrality adjustments."
