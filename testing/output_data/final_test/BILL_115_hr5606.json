    "content": "The \"Climate Change Education Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings of Congress emphasize the urgent need to address human-induced climate change through conservation, renewable energy sources, and energy efficiency measures to reduce environmental impact. Providing clear information and promoting new technologies will empower individuals and communities to take action. More than 3,000,000 students graduate annually with knowledge about climate change, which has a lasting impact. They must be prepared to implement changes in various aspects of life to address climate challenges and opportunities. The majority of Americans support teaching students about climate change causes, consequences, and solutions. Only 30% of middle school and 45% of high school science teachers understand the scientific consensus on climate change. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"climate change education\" refers to learning about climate change, adaptation, mitigation, and resilience at all age levels. \"Green collar job\" is a job that benefits the environment or conserves natural resources. The term \"green economy\" refers to an economy that improves human well-being by reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. The definitions of \"institution of higher education,\" \"local educational agency,\" \"state educational agency,\" and \"nonprofit organization\" are also provided in the Act. A nonprofit organization is defined as an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 4. CLIMATE CHANGE EDUCATION PROGRAM. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish a Climate Change Education Program to increase climate literacy, utilize scientific advancements for learning opportunities, and promote actionable information on new technologies and programs related to climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish a program to provide grants to States for K-12 climate change education, focusing on high climate literacy and interdisciplinary studies. The program aims to advance climate change education by funding State and local educational agencies to integrate key principles into academic standards, create model curricula, provide teacher training, and support secondary school preparation. The program aims to support secondary school preparation and work-based experiences in green collar jobs. It also provides funding to institutions of higher education to improve training and access to certification for future green economy jobs, with a focus on interdisciplinary teaching of climate change education. The Climate Change Education Office, under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, administers a grant program for applied climate research and services to local communities impacted by climate change. Funding is also provided to professional associations for projects that enhance education in green economy fields at the State and national levels. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will submit an annual report to Congress evaluating activities under the Act. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2019 to 2024 for NOAA to implement the Act."
