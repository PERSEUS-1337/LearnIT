The \"Winding Down ObamaCare Act\" includes a provision for continuation coverage in qualified health plans for enrollees facing qualifying events. This coverage must mirror the plan in place at the time of the event. The \"Winding Down ObamaCare Act\" provides continuation coverage in qualified health plans for enrollees after qualifying events. The coverage must match the plan in place at the time of the event, with premium requirements not exceeding 100% of the previous premium and remaining constant throughout the continuation period. The \"Winding Down ObamaCare Act\" offers continuation coverage for enrollees in qualified health plans after qualifying events, with premiums not exceeding 100% of the previous premium. Qualifying events include losing coverage under the plan or becoming ineligible for tax credits. Coverage extends from the date of the event. The continuation coverage provided under the \"Winding Down ObamaCare Act\" terminates 18 months after the qualifying event. Coverage ends if the issuer stops providing qualified health plans or if the enrollee fails to pay premiums. The election period starts on the qualifying event date and lasts for 60 days. The Secretary ensures that a health insurance issuer must provide written notice to enrollees within 10 days of a qualifying event, stating their rights and deadlines. Enrollees have 45 days to notify the issuer of their intent to continue coverage under this section. SEC. 3. PREVENTING BUREAUCRATIC WORKAROUNDS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services cannot contract with a State to provide technology used in the Federal health insurance exchange. States can still establish their own exchanges. SEC. 4. TRANSITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. A new tax credit for transitional coverage is allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. The text discusses a tax credit for eligible individuals who retain continuation coverage under the Public Health Service Act. The credit is a percentage of the amount paid for coverage for the taxpayer and qualifying family members. The applicable percentage decreases after the sixth coverage month. Eligible individuals are those who elect to retain continuation coverage. The term 'eligible individual' excludes those without policy number and TIN on tax return. 'Coverage month' is when taxpayer lacks other specified coverage. The term 'eligible individual' refers to someone covered under employer-provided health insurance, entitled to specific benefits under certain acts, enrolled in specific programs, or entitled to benefits under a particular code. Continuation coverage is defined as coverage under a specific section of the Public Health Service Act, and a 'qualifying family member' is defined as per another section. Special Rules for Tax Credit:\n- The credit amount under subsection (a) is reduced by payments made on behalf of the taxpayer under section 7527A.\n- Payments for insurance under subsection (a) cannot be used to calculate the credit or deduction under this chapter.\n- Dependents eligible for a deduction under section 151 cannot claim the credit. The tax credit is allowed for married couples filing a joint return, with verification of coverage eligibility required by the Secretary. The eligibility of the individual is verified for insurance coverage. Rules similar to section 35(g) apply for advance payment of the credit. The Secretary will establish a program for advance payments to providers of continuation coverage for eligible individuals. Payments are limited to not exceed the applicable percentage for the taxpayer. Information reporting requirements are also outlined. Every person receiving payments under section 7527A must submit a return for each individual, including their name, address, TIN, months of payments, payment amounts, and insurance coverage details. The person required to make a return must provide information such as the policy number, spouse and dependent details, and other prescribed information. They must also furnish a written statement to individuals with their name, address, and contact information, along with the required information for each individual. The written statement must be provided to individuals with their name, address, and contact information, along with required details by January 31 of the following year. Assessable penalties for non-compliance with reporting requirements are outlined in the Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new subparagraph related to qualified health insurance credit returns. Additionally, there are conforming amendments made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include new sections related to continuation coverage credit and advance payment. These amendments apply to coverage months after a qualifying event under the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, measures are taken to prevent bureaucrats from misusing taxpayer dollars. The Social Security Act is amended to require spending limits for experimental projects promoting Medicaid objectives, based on benchmark growth rates determined by the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget. The amendment requires spending limits for Medicaid waivers approved, renewed, or extended under section 1115 of the Social Security Act. The review and certification of the project's establishment and estimated savings must be done by a qualified individual who is not a Federal officer or employee."
