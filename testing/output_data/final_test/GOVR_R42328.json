    "content": "Section 9401 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act grants the Secretary of Education broad waiver authority for various ESEA requirements, including academic accountability. This authority was initially included in the ESEA through the Improving America's Schools Act and retained in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The Secretary has used this authority to grant numerous waivers over time. The Secretary has used the authority under Section 9401 to grant waivers of ESEA requirements, including accountability and administrative rules. President Obama directed the Secretary to provide flexibility to states, leading to the announcement of an ESEA flexibility package with 11 waivers and four additional waivers. The ESEA flexibility package for states includes 11 waivers of ESEA requirements and four principles for improving student academic achievement. States must meet these principles to receive the waivers for the school years 2011-2014, with an option for a one-year extension in 2015. The Administration argues that this package is necessary due to Congress's failure to reauthorize the ESEA. The lack of congressional action on the ESEA has led to difficulties in implementing academic accountability requirements, with states seeking waivers. Schools are struggling to meet proficiency levels on assessments, causing concerns about meeting adequate yearly progress. States and LEAs may face increasing challenges as performance expectations rise. The report discusses concerns about states and LEAs being overwhelmed by requirements to help schools failing to make AYP under the ESEA flexibility package. It includes updates on state applications for waivers and examines the Secretary's waiver authority under Section 9401, past use of waivers, and legal analysis of the Secretary's authority. The report focuses on waivers and principles in the Administration's ESEA flexibility package, allowing for a redesign of key elements. The package alters existing accountability requirements under Title I-A, including the adoption of college- and career-ready standards not in current law. The ESEA flexibility package introduces new accountability requirements for states, including the adoption of college- and career-ready standards. This condition would be placed on SEAs by the Administration, requiring alignment of content and performance standards in reading, math, and science with assessments administered at various grade levels. States currently have the flexibility to choose their own standards and assessments without the need for approval from a state network of IHEs. The ESEA flexibility package introduces new accountability requirements for states, focusing on college- and career-ready standards. Schools receiving Title I-A funds would no longer be required to implement outcome accountability measures if they fail to make AYP for two consecutive years. Instead, interventions would be limited to the lowest performing 5% of schools (priority schools) and some intervention in the next lowest performing 10% (focus schools). Identification of schools in need of intervention would no longer be solely based on AYP, but other measures could be considered. The ESEA flexibility package would change accountability requirements for schools, focusing on student performance and teacher effectiveness. It shifts from solely relying on AYP to consider other measures for identifying priority schools. The 112th Congress is working on ESEA reauthorization, with a focus on evaluating teachers and school leaders based on student achievement. The Senate HELP Committee has ordered reported an ESEA reauthorization bill that may include changes from the ESEA flexibility package. The House Education and Workforce Committee has released two draft ESEA reauthorization bills. It is uncertain if the 112th Congress will pass a bill to reauthorize the ESEA with provisions similar to the flexibility package. Most states have applied for or intend to apply for the ESEA flexibility package. If approved, it could be in effect in many states by the end of the current school year if ESEA reauthorization does not happen before then. If the ESEA flexibility package is implemented by numerous states prior to reauthorization, it may complicate an eventual reauthorization process. States and LEAs may need to adjust their accountability systems to comply with new federal requirements. This could result in two different systems of accountability for states operating under waivers from the ESEA flexibility package. States and territories intended to apply for the ESEA flexibility package, with 37 submitting applications by various deadlines. Ten states were granted flexibility in the first round, while New Mexico was not approved. Florida, Georgia, and Oklahoma received conditional approval and must make additional amendments to their requests. New Mexico received approval for the ESEA flexibility package in 2012. Eight states, including Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Rhode Island, were approved in the second round. New York received short-term approval for its growth model, while Ohio received conditional approval and must refine its grading system. The ESEA flexibility package was granted to New Mexico in 2012, with eight more states approved in the second round. Congressional interest in waiver provisions has increased since the announcement. The report examines the history and broad waiver authority provided to the Secretary under Section 9401 of the ESEA. It also analyzes waivers granted and the Secretary's authority prior to the 1994 reauthorization. The Secretary had limited waiver authority under the ESEA, but Congress aimed to broaden it with the IASA. Both the House and Senate supported greater flexibility for improving education programs through waivers, emphasizing that administrative ease alone was not a sufficient reason for waivers. The reauthorization process of the ESEA included broad waiver authority for the Secretary with specified prohibitions. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 retained this authority but added new prohibitions. Section 9401 grants the Secretary waiver authority under the ESEA. The current waiver authority under Section 9401 of the ESEA grants the Secretary the power to issue waivers for statutory or regulatory requirements for entities receiving ESEA funds. Waiver requests must detail the affected federal programs, describe how waiving requirements will enhance student instruction and academic achievement, outline specific education goals, and explain how the waiver will benefit the entities involved. The Secretary can issue waivers for ESEA funds recipients, detailing affected programs, how waivers enhance student achievement, state goals, and assistance to populations served. Waivers cannot be granted for fund allocation, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, supplanting funds, private school participation, parental involvement, civil rights, or charter requirements. The Secretary can issue waivers for ESEA funds recipients, detailing affected programs and how waivers enhance student achievement. Waivers cannot be granted for fund allocation, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, supplanting funds, private school participation, parental involvement, civil rights, or charter requirements. Waivers granted under Section 9401 may not exceed four years, can be extended if beneficial, but will be terminated if student performance is inadequate. The Secretary must publish a notice of the decision. The Secretary is required to publish a notice of the decision to grant a waiver in the Federal Register and submit annual reports to Congress on the effects of waivers granted. From 2002 to 2009, 634 waivers of ESEA requirements were granted, with only 5 specifying conditions to receive the waivers. From 2002 to 2009, 634 waivers of ESEA requirements were granted, with only 5 specifying conditions to receive the waivers. The states granted waivers were not required to take any additional actions beyond what was already mandated by law. Examples of waivers and their conditions include North Carolina needing full approval of its state accountability system, Arkansas and Florida needing approval of their standards and assessments system, and Ohio needing to adopt a uniform minimum group size for all students. Missouri and Ohio have adopted a uniform minimum group size for all students, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency. Waivers have been requested based on specific needs, including Administration priorities like growth models and accountability systems under Title I-A. The Secretary has broad waiver authority under the ESEA, but it is discretionary, not mandatory. This discretionary authority was upheld by a federal district court in a 2006 case. The federal district court upheld the Secretary's broad waiver authority under the ESEA in a 2006 case, rejecting a state's challenge to the denial of its waiver request. The court emphasized the Secretary's discretion in granting waivers based on the plain language of the statute. This suggests that the Secretary may have the authority to waive various requirements of the ESEA as outlined in its flexibility proposal. The No Child Left Behind Act's waiver provisions signal Congress's intent for the Department of Education to waive requirements when appropriate. Legal challenges may arise due to the conditional nature of the waiver proposal, but so far, there have been no challenges to the Secretary's authority. Examining similar cases involving statutory waiver authority by other federal agencies can provide insight into potential limits on the Secretary's authority. In a prominent case, environmental groups challenged the constitutionality of the REAL ID Act of 2005, specifically Section 102 granting the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to waive legal requirements for border barrier construction. The federal district court upheld the waiver provision, citing Congress's ability to delegate legislative authority with sufficient guidance. Similar challenges to waiver authorities under other federal statutes have been unsuccessful. Section 9401 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act provide examples of statutory waiver authority with clear guidance for agencies. The \"intelligible principle\" requirement is met by specifying how waivers will benefit students or serve the public interest. This suggests that waiver authority is likely to withstand constitutional challenges based on the nondelegation doctrine. The regulation allowing coordination of employer-provided retiree health coverage with Medicare eligibility was initially challenged in court. A federal district court initially struck down the exemption but later reversed its decision based on a Supreme Court ruling on agency interpretations. The court of appeals affirmed that the regulation fell within the EEOC's waiver authority, allowing limited practices not otherwise permitted under the statute. The EEOC prevailed in court, indicating agencies like ED may have few restrictions on using statutory waiver authority if they comply with requirements. Legal challenges to Section 1115 of the Social Security Act show courts reluctant to limit the Secretary's authority for experimental projects. The Secretary has broad authority to approve experimental projects under Section 1115, with judicial limits under the Administrative Procedure Act. Courts can invalidate waivers if found to be arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with the law, or based on factors Congress did not intend. The Secretary has broad authority to approve experimental projects under Section 1115, with judicial limits under the Administrative Procedure Act. Courts can invalidate waivers if found to be arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with the law, or based on factors Congress did not intend. In successful challenges to Section 1115 waivers, courts have ruled that the Secretary violated the APA and Section 1115 by not conducting sufficient review or making adequate findings. Despite potential legal challenges, agencies' waiver authority is generally upheld if an adequate record is developed and the waiver is granted in line with statutory purposes and procedures. This suggests that the Department of Education has the authority to waive ESEA statutory requirements related to academic issues. The Department of Education (ED) has the authority to waive ESEA statutory requirements related to academic standards, assessments, accountability, school improvement, corrective action, and public school choice. Waivers in ED's flexibility plan are granted on the condition that states meet new standards set by the department. Agency waivers may include new conditions, and courts have upheld waivers with agency-imposed requirements. The Department of Education (ED) can waive ESEA statutory requirements with new conditions. Courts have upheld waivers with agency-imposed requirements. President Obama announced 10 waivers and one optional waiver of ESEA requirements for states on September 23, 2011. The Department of Education can waive ESEA statutory requirements with new conditions. President Obama announced 10 waivers and one optional waiver of ESEA requirements for states on September 23, 2011, including flexibility in accountability provisions and the use of federal funds for school improvement. The Department of Education announced waivers of ESEA requirements for states, including flexibility in accountability provisions and the use of federal funds for school improvement. States can apply for waivers to support new accountability provisions, teacher-related provisions, and the use of federal funds. Two application deadlines were set for states to apply for the ESEA flexibility package. States can apply for waivers of ESEA requirements to receive flexibility in accountability provisions and federal fund usage. Applications are reviewed in December with decisions made by mid-January 2012. The next deadline for applications is February 21, 2012, for peer review in spring 2012. SEAs must apply for all 10 waivers and implement all related principles. If an SEA chooses not to implement a waiver, it must continue to meet current law requirements. The report discusses the 10 waivers and one optional waiver available to states. The Education Department is offering states waivers related to academic accountability, teacher, and funding flexibility provisions. The waivers are thematically examined based on current law provisions they would affect. Each waiver discussion includes the flexibility offered by the Administration compared to current law requirements. The waivers and principles reflect the priorities in the Administration's ESEA reauthorization blueprint. The report focuses on state-level actions related to waivers offered by the Education Department for academic accountability, teacher, and funding flexibility provisions. States can apply for waivers, with SEAs currently permitted to apply for the ESEA flexibility package. LEAs in states receiving waivers will have increased flexibility but also increased responsibilities. The waivers align with the Administration's ESEA reauthorization blueprint. Under NCLB, SEAs must adopt specific accountability requirements for ESEA funding. This includes standards, assessments, and consequences for schools failing to meet academic performance levels. LEAs can also apply for waivers separately under ESEA Section 9401. This section discusses six waivers related to accountability. The section discusses six waivers related to accountability under ESEA, providing alternative approaches to meeting academic accountability requirements. These waivers aim to align accountability determinations with support efforts and interventions for low-performing schools and achievement gaps. States are already developing new accountability systems that include student growth and school progress. The waivers proposed by the Department of Education would allow states and local education agencies to implement new accountability systems without being restricted by current improvement requirements. This includes removing the need for annual measurable objectives for student performance on state assessments to determine Adequate Yearly Progress. Under the waiver, states can set new ambitious but achievable Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) in reading/language arts and mathematics to guide improvement at various levels. States have three options for establishing these new AMOs, including setting goals to reduce the percentage of students not proficient by half within six years. The waiver allows states to set new AMOs in reading/language arts and mathematics to improve student proficiency. States have three options for setting these goals, including basing them on 2010-2011 proficiency rates or an \"educationally sound rationale.\" This flexibility is similar to the Administration's Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization, which aimed for all students to be \"college- and career-ready\" by 2020. Under the ESEA flexibility package, states have the option to set different Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) for each LEA, school, or subgroup. This allows for varying performance targets based on current school performance, with greater gains required for schools further behind. This differentiation of targets is not typically allowed under current law, where AMOs must be the same for all LEAs. Under the ESEA flexibility package, states can set different Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) for each LEA, school, or subgroup. SEAs receiving the flexibility package can reset their AMOs twice, first based on specific requirements and then based on college- and career-ready standards. This allows for more tailored performance standards and removes the requirement for Title I-A schools to undergo improvement actions for consecutive years of not meeting AYP. Under the ESEA flexibility package, states can set different Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) for each LEA, school, or subgroup. This allows for more tailored performance standards and removes the requirement for Title I-A schools to undergo improvement actions for consecutive years of not meeting AYP. The restructuring based on assessment results from the 2010-2011 school year would no longer have to be implemented, but the SEA could still require or permit an LEA to take such actions. LEAs would be exempt from administrative and reporting requirements related to school improvement, focusing only on \"priority\" and \"focus\" schools under the waiver provisions. This shift acknowledges that a one-size-fits-all system of outcome accountability is no longer suitable for addressing the needs of low-performing schools. Priority schools are among the lowest-performing schools in the state, identified as the lowest 5% of Title I-A schools or high schools with a graduation rate below 60%. Focus schools are Title I schools contributing to the achievement gap in the state. Focus schools are Title I schools identified as contributing to the achievement gap in the state, with criteria including large within-school gaps in achievement or graduation rates. These schools must make up at least 10% of Title I schools in the state and are subject to interventions based on assessment results. The Education Department expects significant weight to be given to reading/language arts and math assessments for identifying schools for improvement or rewards. AMOs must be used to determine incentives and support for Title I schools not identified for specific actions based on assessment results. The elimination of school identification for improvement, corrective action, and restructuring changes the criteria for taking action based on performance. Under current law, LEAs will no longer have to reserve 20% of their Title I-A funds for public school choice and supplemental educational services. These services, like tutoring, can be provided outside of regular school hours to enhance educational services. Funds reserved for these purposes are not subject to equitable participation requirements for private school students if used for interventions in priority and focus schools. Under the proposed changes, LEAs would no longer be required to reserve 20% of Title I-A funds for public school choice and supplemental educational services. If funds are used for professional development, equitable participation requirements would apply to support eligible students in private schools. SEAs and LEAs would no longer need to identify schools or LEAs for improvement or corrective action, exempting them from related administrative and reporting requirements. The ESEA flexibility package would eliminate the need for identifying schools for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. The ESEA flexibility package includes a waiver for SEAs to allocate Title I-A funds for school improvement to priority or focus schools in need of additional support. States must reserve 4% of their total Title I-A LEA grants for school improvement activities, with at least 95% allocated to schools identified for improvement, corrective action, and restructuring. The ESEA flexibility package allows SEAs to allocate Title I-A funds to priority or focus schools in need of support. States must reserve 4% of their Title I-A LEA grants for school improvement activities, prioritizing the lowest-achieving schools. The Blueprint also permits states and LEAs to reserve funds to build capacity for supporting schools, leaders, teachers, and students. The specifics of this provision are not detailed in the Blueprint. The waiver in the ESEA flexibility package changes the focus of school improvement funds to target priority and focus schools, while still requiring 95% of funds to be provided to the local level. This waiver eliminates the need for schools to be identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring, allowing funds to be used in schools meeting the priority of serving the lowest performing schools. Under ESEA Section 1117, states must establish an Academic Achievement Awards Program to reward schools closing achievement gaps or exceeding AYP requirements. The ESEA flexibility package allows funds to be used for financial rewards to any reward school, regardless of meeting specific criteria. The Administration defines a \"reward school\" as a Title I school that is either a \"highest-performing school\" or a \"high-progress school.\" A highest-performing school must have the highest absolute performance over a number of years for all students and subgroups, combined with high graduation rates. It must also be making AYP for all students and subgroups, without significant achievement gaps that are not closing. The Administration's Blueprint aims to reward schools, LEAs, and states that meet performance targets, significantly improve student performance, close achievement gaps, and turnaround low-performing schools. This includes high-progress schools that show significant progress in improving performance and graduation rates, but cannot have significant achievement gaps that are not closing. Under the Blueprint, states would receive funds to design innovative programs to reward schools and LEAs, including providing financial rewards and flexibility in the use of ESEA funds. Competitive preference in federal grant competitions could have been provided to specific schools, LEAs, and states identified for rewards. LEAs identified as reward LEAs would be provided with flexibility in implementing interventions in their lowest-performing schools. States may reserve up to 5% of any Title I-A funding that is in excess of the state's prior year allocation. The increase in appropriations for Title I-A from FY2011 to FY2012 was $73.5 million, with 5% of the funds being about $3.7 million. In FY2011 to FY2012, Title I-A funding increased by $73.5 million, with 5% of the funds amounting to about $3.7 million. Not all LEAs receiving Title I-A funds will see increased funding in FY2012, and those that do may not receive substantial increases. The Administration's FY2012 budget requested $300 million for \"reward schools,\" but this was not included in the enacted appropriations. The discussion also covers the current allocation and use of funds under Title I-A, as well as the waiver being offered for School Improvement Grants. States can apply for formula grants under Section 1003(g) for School Improvement Grants, with at least 95% of funds used for subgrants to LEAs. Subgrants range from $50,000 to $500,000 per school for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring, renewable for up to two years if goals are met. Priority is given to LEAs with lowest-achieving schools. Modifications to program requirements have been made through appropriations acts and regulations. The program requirements have been modified by the Department of Education (ED) to define Tier I and Tier II schools as the lowest-performing schools. Tier I schools are Title I-A schools identified for improvement with low achievement or graduation rates, while Tier II schools are secondary schools eligible for Title I-A funding but not receiving it. Schools must choose from four intervention models for improvement. The Department of Education has defined Tier I and Tier II schools as the lowest-performing schools. Schools must choose from four intervention models for improvement, including the Turnaround model which involves replacing the principal and providing flexibility in staffing and budget, and the Restart model which requires converting or closing and reopening a school under a charter operator. The operator or organization taking over a school must go through a rigorous review process. There are two main models for school closure and transformation. The closure model involves transferring students to higher-achieving schools, including charter schools. The transformation model requires implementing various strategies such as improving teacher effectiveness, using data for instruction, increasing learning time, and creating community-oriented schools. SIG funds can be awarded under the ESEA flexibility package. Under the ESEA flexibility package, SIG funds can be awarded to an LEA to implement one of the four current SIG models in any priority school, regardless of its improvement status. The waiver focuses on eligibility for SIG funding, retaining the four school improvement models specified in regulations. SIG grants and models would have been retained under the Administration's Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization. There are three tiers of schools eligible for SIG funding, with most schools on an SEA's persistently lowest-achieving list anticipated to qualify. Most schools on an SEA's persistently lowest-achieving list are expected to qualify for SIG grants. Priority schools receiving SIG funds must implement a school improvement model, while those not receiving funds must follow turnaround principles. These principles differ from the SIG models, as they include a review of the current principal's performance. The performance of the current principal must be reviewed for schools following turnaround principles. If necessary, the principal must be changed to ensure effective leadership or demonstrate the ability to lead the turnaround to the SEA. This differs from the models used under the SIG program, which require principal replacement. Priority schools under SIG may have more resources but less flexibility in implementing models compared to those not receiving SIG funding. SEAs receiving ESEA funds must ensure all teachers in core subjects are highly qualified, with only one waiver related to teachers in the ESEA flexibility package. The ESEA flexibility package includes a waiver related to teachers, but it would have little impact on current implementation of highly qualified teacher provisions. States must comply with principles emphasizing teacher performance over qualifications to receive the package. Teachers must be highly qualified with full state certification and subject matter expertise. The ESEA flexibility package includes a waiver related to teachers, emphasizing teacher performance over qualifications. States must ensure all teachers teaching core academic subjects are highly qualified by 2005-2006, with annual measurable objectives for increasing the percentage of highly qualified teachers and providing professional development. SEAs provide technical assistance and require improvement plans for LEAs not meeting objectives after the second year of implementation. In the third year of the HQT plan, if an LEA fails to make progress towards its objectives and AYP for three years, the SEA must work with the LEA to develop strategies to meet objectives. The LEA cannot use Title I-A funds for new paraprofessionals. ESEA flexibility allows LEAs failing HQT targets to retain flexibility in fund usage. The Education Department allows State Education Agencies (SEAs) to have flexibility in using Title I and Title II funds, exempting them from certain requirements related to improvement plans. SEAs are still responsible for ensuring equitable distribution of qualified teachers, especially for disadvantaged students. Under the Education Department's flexibility package, SEAs can use performance evaluation systems aligned with ED's principles for reform to meet requirements. The Administration shifted focus from highly qualified to highly effective teachers, awarding additional points to states with evaluation systems based on student performance. Prior to this flexibility offer, all but one state had their revised HQT plans approved. The Education Department's flexibility package allows states to use evaluation systems aligned with ED's reform principles. Most states had their revised HQT plans approved, with no penalties for those making efforts to reach 100% HQT goal. Waivers aim to shift focus towards effective teaching and away from HQT requirements. Funding flexibility waivers are also included in the ESEA package. The Rural and Low-Income School Program (Title VI-B-2) would have more flexibility to use funds for any authorized purpose regardless of AYP status. This waiver eliminates restrictions on fund use based on AYP status, providing rural LEAs more flexibility. The waiver included in the package would waive eligibility requirements for schoolwide programs under Title I-A to support new accountability measures. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can currently participate in schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund use. Federal funds can be combined with state and local funds without separate accounting in schoolwide programs, allowing for improved services to all students. Schoolwide programs under Title I-A can be exempt from regulations if they meet program goals and serve intended beneficiaries. The ESEA flexibility package allows for waivers of the 40% poverty threshold for schoolwide programs in priority or focus schools implementing turnaround interventions. The ESEA flexibility package allows waivers for schoolwide programs in high poverty schools to enhance the educational program for all students, not just the lowest-achieving individuals. The waiver could also extend to schools with lower poverty levels to operate a schoolwide program. The ESEA flexibility package allows waivers for schoolwide programs in schools with lower poverty levels to enhance the educational program for all students. The waiver allows for flexibility in transferring funds among selected ESEA programs and into Title I-A without prior notification to the Department of Education. Under the ESEA flexibility package, LEAs no longer need to notify ED or their SEA before transferring funds between ESEA programs. LEAs can transfer up to 50% of their formula grants between Title II-A and Ed-Tech programs, with restrictions for LEAs failing to meet AYP. LEAs under corrective actions for Title I-A cannot transfer funds. Under ESEA flexibility, LEAs can transfer funds between programs without prior approval. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds, excluding certain allocations. LEAs must inform their SEA of transfers, and program requirements apply to transferred funds. States must also inform ED of transfers but have limited authority due to restrictions on fund types. Under ESEA flexibility, LEAs can transfer funds between programs without prior approval. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds, excluding certain allocations. LEAs must inform their SEA of transfers, and program requirements apply to transferred funds. States must also inform ED of transfers but have limited authority due to restrictions on fund types. Additionally, the Blueprint provides states and LEAs with flexibility in using federal dollars to improve student outcomes, allowing them to use administrative funds and reservations to support reform and improvement. LEAs also have flexibility in spending ESEA program funds as long as they comply with requirements and improve student outcomes, similar to the waiver included in the current ESEA flexibility package. The waiver allows LEAs and SEAs to transfer all funds received for specific purposes, providing more flexibility in fund usage. However, the flexibility may be limited due to the lack of funding for referenced programs. LEAs and SEAs can transfer funds into Title I-A for increased flexibility, but SEAs have limited authority over program funds. The ESEA flexibility package offers waivers to LEAs and SEAs, allowing more flexibility in fund usage. One waiver eliminates the need for designating LEAs as needing improvement or corrective action. Another optional waiver provides flexibility in using 21st CCLC funds for expanded learning time programs. The 21st CCLC program provides formula grants to states for after-school activities that promote student academic achievement. Currently, the focus is on after-school activities for children and literacy-related activities for their families. Expanded learning time programs during the school day are not currently authorized under the program. The optional waiver allows community learning centers to use funds for expanded learning time during the school day, in addition to activities outside of school hours. Implementing expanded learning time programs can be costly, potentially leading to a reduction in funds for out-of-school activities originally authorized by the ESEA. To receive the ESEA flexibility package, SEAs must meet the Administration's four principles for improving student academic achievement: college- and career-ready expectations for all students, state-developed recognition and support, effective instruction and leadership, and reducing duplication. This includes adopting college- and career-ready standards. The Administration's Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization includes adopting college- and career-ready standards in reading/language arts and mathematics, implementing annual assessments, developing English language proficiency standards, and reporting on college-going rates. The Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization allows states to develop new accountability systems with additional assessments, focusing on student growth and school progress over time. This aligns with the Administration's ESEA flexibility package, emphasizing the importance of English language proficiency standards. The NCLB requires states to align English language proficiency standards with college- and career-readiness standards. Concerns about diverse accountability systems led to the development of common core standards for reading and math, with optional adoption and implementation. Currently, 44 states and the District of Columbia have adopted common core standards for reading and math, with optional implementation. Additionally, these states have joined groups working on developing common assessments for the 2014-2015 school year, supported by the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration incentivized states to adopt common standards for education through Race to the Top grants. States had to adopt common standards or have their standards vetted by a local university system to receive the grants. This requirement may have led to more states agreeing to adopt the standards. States that agreed to adopt the standards but did not win a grant are still moving forward with implementation to receive the ESEA flexibility package. States have two options for adopting college- and career-ready standards when completing the application. States have two options for adopting college- and career-ready standards when completing the ESEA flexibility package application. They can choose common standards or standards approved by a state network of IHEs, with a requirement to implement the new standards by the 2013-2014 school year. \"College- and career-ready standards\" are defined as content standards from kindergarten to 12th grade that lead to readiness by high school graduation. College- and career-ready standards must be common to a significant number of States or approved by a State network of institutions of higher education. Common core standards, adopted by 44 states and the District of Columbia, are an example. College ready means students do not need remedial coursework at the postsecondary level. There is no clear definition of \"career ready.\" Despite efforts by the Obama Administration, there will not be a single set of national standards. The Obama Administration supports common core standards, but there will not be a single set of national standards in reading/language arts and mathematics. States adopting common core standards can add their own additional standards, resulting in each state having a unique set of standards. There will be at least two different assessments linked to the common core standards, and it is unclear how these assessments will accommodate any additional standards added by states. The common core standards movement allows states to add their own standards, resulting in each state having a unique set. Assessments linked to the standards may vary in proficiency levels set by different states. The movement does not propose a common curriculum, leaving teaching methods and preparation decisions to state and local authorities. Collaboration among states in implementing the standards could lead to shared resources for classroom materials. Textbook publishers and organizations developing classroom materials aligned with common core standards could contribute to a de facto national curriculum. States seeking waivers must conduct annual high-quality assessments measuring student growth in grades 3-8 and high school, including English Learners and students with disabilities. Assessments must provide data on student achievement and growth towards college and career readiness. The ESEA flexibility request requires states to conduct high-quality assessments to measure student growth and achievement, including for students with disabilities. States have three options to demonstrate compliance with the assessment requirements. The ESEA flexibility request mandates high-quality assessments to measure student growth and achievement, including for students with disabilities. States must demonstrate compliance with assessment requirements by measuring college and career readiness, including English Learners and students with disabilities. Demonstrating \"career readiness\" poses a challenge as there is no clear definition provided by ED or the common core standards initiative. The common core standards initiative has not developed alternate achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. It is unclear if common alternate achievement standards will be developed under this initiative. SEAs may still use alternate achievement standards developed under current law, but they would not be common across states. Common assessments funded by RTTT are not developing alternate assessments for students with disabilities. ED has supported the development of alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The grant program requires the development of alternate achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities, but it is unclear if these standards need to be common across states. High-quality assessments must be used in various new ways, including evaluating principal and teacher effectiveness using student achievement data, which poses logistical and measurement challenges. The ESEA flexibility request raises concerns about measuring teacher effectiveness and ensuring high-quality assessments for all subjects and grade levels. There are uncertainties regarding the definition of \"career ready\" and the ability to measure it accurately. SEAs must implement assessments that measure student growth effectively. The ESEA flexibility package requires high-quality assessments to measure student growth, defined as the change in achievement over time. Student achievement is determined by scores on required assessments or alternative measures for non-required grades/subjects. Student achievement can be measured using various methods such as pre-tests, end-of-course tests, and performance-based assessments. Some states have waivers to use growth models for Title I-A accountability, but these models may not align with college- and career-ready standards. The Education Department will only approve growth models for Title I-A accountability that include aggressive growth targets for all students to meet college- and career-ready standards within four years or by high school graduation. Models that consider student background characteristics like socioeconomic status will not be approved. Additional guidance on growth models will be provided closer to the 2014-2015 school year. The Education Department will only approve growth models for Title I-A accountability that include aggressive growth targets for all students to meet college- and career-ready standards within four years or by high school graduation. Growth models implemented in compliance with the four principles are not limited to only measuring test scores but can also consider alternative measures of student achievement. Each state's plans for implementing growth models will determine the rigor of their accountability system. States must report annually on college-going and college-credit accumulation rates by the 2014-2015 school year. They should use statewide data systems to collect this information. All states are expected to have systems in place to track students from secondary education. The SEA must track students from secondary to postsecondary education and implement a system of differentiated recognition, accountability, and support for LEAs and Title I-A schools to receive ESEA flexibility. The system must assess student achievement in reading, math, graduation rates, and school performance over time. High-quality assessments aligned with standards must be adopted to measure student growth and provide interventions and supports. The new system must set ambitious but achievable goals for student achievement, graduation rates, and closing achievement gaps. It must provide incentives for success and publicly recognize schools making progress. Priority schools must be identified for targeted support and improvement efforts. The system must identify priority schools for targeted interventions aligned with turnaround principles. Schools must show significant progress to exit priority status. Additionally, Title I schools with achievement gaps or subgroups falling behind must be identified as focus schools, with interventions based on needs assessments. Incentives and supports are provided for continuous improvement in schools not identified as priority or focus schools. The SEA's system must ensure continuous improvement in Title I schools not identified as priority or focus schools, particularly in low-performing schools and those with achievement gaps. It must provide monitoring, technical assistance, and accountability for improving student learning, including interventions in priority schools. LEAs must receive sufficient support for implementing interventions in all identified schools. This may involve leveraging funds previously reserved for public school choice. SEAs must describe their recognition, accountability, and support system by 2012-2013. They must specify if only reading and math achievement will be considered or if other assessments will be included. SEAs must provide data on student performance and explain how assessments will be weighted for all schools. The SEA must explain how assessments will be weighted to hold schools accountable for students meeting standards. States have three options for setting new AMOs: incremental reductions in non-proficient students, incremental increases towards 100% proficiency, or setting AMOs based on an \"educationally sound rationale.\" Baselines are based on 2010-2011 proficiency rates. The SEA must provide information on average statewide proficiency in reading and math for the 2010-2011 school year. They must also describe how reward, priority, and focus schools are identified, without considering grade spans. SEAs are encouraged to include a mix of schools in each grade span for each type of identified school. Additionally, the SEA must specify how reward schools will be publicly recognized and possibly rewarded, and describe the methodology for priority schools. The SEA must outline interventions for priority and focus schools, including timelines for implementation by 2014-2015. Criteria for exiting priority or focus status must be provided, along with plans for continuous improvement in other Title I schools not identified as focus or priority schools. The SEA must outline interventions for priority and focus schools, including timelines for implementation by 2014-2015. Criteria for exiting priority or focus status must be provided, along with plans for continuous improvement in other Title I schools not identified as focus or priority schools. The SEA must discuss its process for building capacity to improve student learning, similar to proposals in the Administration's Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization. States would have had to set up a new accountability system identifying lowest-performing schools and schools with achievement gaps, with outcome accountability requirements for the lowest-performing schools. Public school choice and SES would be optional, and states would have to identify highest performing schools and provide rewards. The ESEA flexibility package eliminates the use of AYP as the sole determinant of school improvement. LEAs no longer have to be identified based on school performance, only the lowest performing schools are labeled as priority or focus schools. Rewards are provided to highest performing schools. The ESEA flexibility package changes the system of identifying schools for interventions, with only the lowest performing schools labeled as priority or focus schools. State and local report cards will now identify schools as reward, priority, or focus schools, providing information on achievement gains and low-performing schools. The report cards may not indicate how long a school has been identified as a priority or focus school. The ESEA flexibility package changes how schools are identified for interventions, with only the lowest performing schools labeled as priority or focus schools. State and local report cards will now identify schools as reward, priority, or focus schools based on achievement gains and performance. Assessments used for recognition must be valid, reliable, and inclusive of all students. The ESEA flexibility package requires state and local educational agencies to develop teacher and principal evaluation systems that differentiate performance levels and support instructional improvement. The weight given to reading/language arts and mathematics assessments in identifying reward, focus, and priority schools may vary among SEAs. The ESEA flexibility package mandates the development of teacher and principal evaluation systems that differentiate performance levels and support instructional improvement. State educational agencies must establish guidelines for these systems, including using multiple valid measures, providing feedback for professional development, and informing personnel decisions. Additionally, SEAs must provide student growth data to teachers of reading/language arts and mathematics. The ESEA flexibility package requires states to develop guidelines for teacher and principal evaluation systems. States must choose one of three options for adoption of guidelines by the end of the 2011-2012 school year. The ESEA flexibility package requires states to develop guidelines for teacher and principal evaluation systems by the end of the 2011-2012 school year. States must involve teachers and principals in the development process, and ensure that each LEA implements evaluation systems consistent with the guidelines. This represents a significant change from current law, which focuses on teacher qualifications. To be deemed highly qualified, teachers must possess a baccalaureate degree, be fully certified, and demonstrate subject-matter knowledge. Veteran teachers can achieve this status by demonstrating competency in all subjects taught. States were required to ensure that all core academic teachers met the HQT definition by the end of the 2005-2006 school year, with additional flexibility announced in October 2005. States that do not meet the highly qualified teacher (HQT) goal in NCLB will not lose federal funds if they are making a good-faith effort. They will be given an additional year to reach the 100% goal by submitting a revised plan. The latest statement from the Department of Education (ED) announced that no penalties would be imposed on states making efforts to reach the HQT goal. The Administration's Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization and RTTT propose new policies for states and LEAs, including statewide definitions of effective teachers and principals, state-level data systems linking teacher preparation programs to outcomes, and district-level evaluation systems. These changes differ from current law but align with efforts to improve teacher quality and effectiveness. The Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization and RTTT propose reforms for teacher and principal evaluation systems, collaboration opportunities, and professional development aligned with student learning improvements. These changes aim to ensure effective teachers and principals are equitably distributed. The Blueprint for ESEA reauthorization and RTTT propose reforms for teacher and principal evaluation systems, including setting annual targets for student growth, implementing rigorous evaluation systems, conducting annual evaluations with feedback, and using results for decision-making on compensation, promotion, and tenure. The ESEA flexibility package requires LEAs to implement new teacher evaluation systems by 2013-2014 or 2014-2015. Some states have established guidelines like multiple performance levels and use of student growth data, but it's unclear if school districts can meet the deadlines for full implementation. Some school districts may struggle to implement new teacher evaluation systems by the deadlines set by the ESEA flexibility package. Tenure decisions, which are mostly governed at the state level, may not have enough evaluation information to be impactful due to the short time frame for evaluation results. Without tenure reform, it may be impractical to expect evaluation systems to inform tenure decisions. States seeking ESEA flexibility must ensure high-quality implementation of evaluation systems, including monitoring inter-rater reliability. Small districts with limited staff may struggle to meet this requirement. The ESEA flexibility package maintains the mandate to prevent poor and minority children from being taught by inexperienced or unqualified teachers but removes enforcement mechanisms for the Highly Qualified Teacher requirement. The latest HQT report shows that while 97% of core academic classes nationwide are taught by HQTs, high-poverty schools have lower HQT staffing compared to low-poverty schools. SEAs are required to evaluate reporting requirements and reduce unnecessary burdens on schools. SEAs should eliminate duplicative and burdensome reporting requirements that do not affect student outcomes. States are required to provide the \"least restrictive and burdensome regulations\" for LEAs receiving Title I-A funds. SEAs can take actions to reduce burden, such as reviewing record-keeping requirements, streamlining data collection timelines, and identifying barriers to flexible fund use. Changes should be evaluated based on their impact on student outcomes. The ESEA flexibility package allows states to apply for waivers for school years 2011-2014, with an option for a one-year extension. States must follow a detailed timeline for implementation, including piloting teacher and principal evaluation systems in 2013-2014. If states do not apply for the extension, they may not have to implement certain requirements. Full implementation of teacher and principal evaluation and support systems under the ESEA flexibility package is not required until the 2014-2015 school year. States that do not apply for the one-year waiver extension may have to comply with current law requirements if Congress does not reauthorize the ESEA by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. The Secretary has the authority to terminate waivers if SEAs or LEAs fail to comply. The implementation timeline specifies deadlines for meeting principles associated with the waivers and the waivers themselves. The dates for implementing waivers are the earliest time an SEA or LEA can use them. An SEA can choose not to implement a waiver but must follow ED's principles. CEP analyzed state applications and approved accountability plans. CEP analyzed the first round of approved state applications for waivers, noting that the new accountability provisions would lead to more complexity in state systems. States are integrating federal accountability requirements with their own systems, most have adopted Common Core State Standards, and will continue to establish Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) for accountability determinations. Most states will use new, multifaceted measures to identify schools for interventions or rewards, with multiple performance levels and decisions based on two student groups. Only 2 out of 11 states will require public school choice or SES. CEP noted that these changes will lead to more diverse and complicated accountability systems across states. Key findings from the comparison between the first and second round applicants' accountability plans include closer integration of federal and state requirements, adoption of Common Core State Standards by 26 out of 27 applicants, replacement of 100% proficiency goal by most states, and the use of new state-specific primary accountability indicators by at least 24 applicants. Multiple performance levels will be used to identify schools for consequences or rewards, and changes in the use of subgroups are expected by at least 19 applicants. At least 19 applicants plan to change their use of subgroups for major accountability determinations, with none indicating a continuation of school choice requirements or reserving the full 20% for school choice transportation or SES."
