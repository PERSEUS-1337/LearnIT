Improvement categories include 'likely,' 'possible,' and 'not expected' based on the potential for medical improvement within certain periods. The Social Security Act is amended to classify individuals entitled to disability benefits based on expected medical improvement within specific time frames. The Commissioner of Social Security shall not classify an individual as 'medical improvement not expected' solely based on age. There shall be no review or right to appeal a classification made under this system. SEC. 3. REQUIRING PERIODIC CONTINUING DISABILITY REVIEWS FOR CERTAIN BENEFICIARIES. Section 221(i) of the Social Security Act is amended to require periodic continuing disability reviews for individuals under a disability classified as 'medical improvement possible' or 'medical improvement not expected'. The Social Security Act requires periodic reviews for individuals classified as 'medical improvement possible' or 'medical improvement not expected' to determine if they remain disabled. The Commissioner may review cases if there is reason to believe the individual is no longer disabled, except based on income earned through certain programs. The Social Security Act mandates periodic reviews for individuals classified as 'medical improvement possible' or 'medical improvement not expected' to assess their disability status. Reviews required under this paragraph are additional and not a substitute for any other reviews specified in the Act.

Section 223(d)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended to allow individuals to be found disabled even if they are working during a continuing disability review under section 221(i). The Commissioner of Social Security will update regulations regarding disability classifications and reviews for individuals receiving disability insurance benefits. Additionally, time-limiting disability benefits for certain individuals will be implemented under Section 223 of the Social Security Act. The Social Security Disability Insurance Return to Work Act of 2016 establishes termination months for individuals classified as 'medical improvement expected' or 'medical improvement likely' after filing for disability benefits. The termination month is either the 23rd or 59th month following the first month after the waiting period. The term 'timely reapplication' refers to an application for disability benefits submitted by a current recipient within a specific timeframe before the termination month. The Commissioner of Social Security has the authority to consider applications for disability benefits. Security may consider a disability insurance benefits application as a timely reapplication if the individual can show good cause for the delay and submits it within 6 months before the termination month. If approved, the waiting period is waived. If the Commissioner of Social Security fails to make an initial determination on a timely reapplication for disability benefits, the individual will continue to receive benefits until a decision is made. If an initial adverse determination is made, the individual can request a hearing under section 221(d). If an individual elects to have benefits continue under section 221(d) or title XVIII, the process for reviewing a reapplication for disability benefits may consider past disability findings and participation in the review process under subsection (l). The individual may elect to continue benefits under section 221(d) or title XVIII, with the review process for reapplication considering past disability findings and participation in the review process under subsection (l). Additionally, subsection (f) shall not apply if the individual is under a disability. SEC. 6. ENCOURAGING WORK BY MIE AND MIL INDIVIDUALS. Amends Section 223 of the Social Security Act to address the treatment of work performed by certain disabled individuals. The Commissioner of Social Security establishes a process for eligible individuals entitled to disability insurance benefits to return to employment and receive adjusted benefits.

The adjusted benefit amount is determined based on the individual's return to employment. The Commissioner of Social Security establishes a process for eligible individuals entitled to disability insurance benefits to return to employment and receive adjusted benefits. The amount of benefits for those returning to work is based on their average monthly earnings compared to the level set by the Commissioner for substantial gainful activity. The Commissioner of Social Security allows eligible individuals receiving disability insurance benefits to work and receive adjusted benefits. The amount of benefits is determined by comparing their average monthly earnings to the level set for substantial gainful activity. Earnings are calculated based on wages and self-employment income in the two calendar quarters before the most recent quarter, divided by the total number of eligible months during that period. Eligible months are those after the individual became entitled to disability insurance benefits. For an eligible individual returning to work under this subsection, any earnings during participation are not considered for substantial gainful activity. Disability insurance benefits received do not affect benefits payable to others under this title. The amendments made to the Social Security Act apply to benefits payable for months starting after October 1, 2017, and do not affect benefits payable to others under this title. SEC. 7. INCREASED FUNDING FOR CONTINUING DISABILITY REVIEWS. The Commissioner of Social Security will determine the reduction in expenditures from the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund due to this Act. 10 percent of this amount will be allocated for continuing disability reviews."
