    "content": "The victims of federal crimes are granted rights under 18 U.S.C. 3771, including protection from the accused, timely notice of court proceedings, the right to attend court proceedings, the right to be heard at certain proceedings, the right to confer with the government's attorney, and the right to restitution. Section 3771 grants victims of federal crimes various rights, including restitution, proceedings free from delay, fair treatment, and timely information about plea bargains. It aims to give victims more deference in the criminal justice process, similar to state laws on victims' rights. Section 3771 grants victims of federal crimes rights such as restitution, fair treatment, and timely information. It borrows language from federal restitution statutes and has been in effect since 2004. Additional rights were added in 2015 by the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, resolving a split among federal appellate courts. Legal reform in the name of crime victims began in the 1960s with victim restitution and compensation laws, as well as reforms in rape, drunk driving, and bail laws. By the end of the 20th century, 33 states had added victims' rights amendments to their constitutions, and Congress had enacted various victims' rights provisions. The Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Right Act was introduced in the Senate on April 21, 2004, and passed the following day. It was merged with DNA proposals in the Justice for All Act, which was passed by the House on October 6, 2004. The Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Right Act was merged with DNA proposals in the Justice for All Act, passed on October 6, 2004. The implementing amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, including victims' rights, became effective on December 1, 2008. The term \"crime victim\" is defined as a person directly harmed by a Federal offense. Legal guardians or representatives may assume the rights of a crime victim under this chapter. The definition of \"victim\" in the context of amending the U.S. Constitution has been a topic of debate. The 108th Congress amendment proposals did not specifically define victim, focusing on victims of violent crimes only. Section 3771, however, defines a victim as a person directly harmed by an offense, without limitations. Section 3771 defines a victim as a person directly harmed by an offense, encompassing all federal crimes and those of the District of Columbia. Unlike the restitution statutes, it lacks explicit provisions for schemes or conspiracies. Despite differences, courts refer to experience under restitution statutes when interpreting the definition of victim. The term \"person\" in Section 3771 and restitution statutes is broadly interpreted to include corporations. The term \"person\" in Section 3771 and restitution statutes is broadly interpreted to include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies as well as individuals. Restitution has been found appropriate for legal entities without commenting on their lack of human status, and governmental entities may also be eligible for restitution under certain circumstances. The 2011 AG Guidelines suggest that governmental entities are not eligible for court enforceable rights but may still be entitled to restitution. The term \"person\" in Section 3771 and restitution statutes is broadly interpreted to include corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies as well as individuals. Restitution may be available for legal entities and governmental entities under certain circumstances, although governmental entities may not have court enforceable rights but could be entitled to restitution. Restitution is tied to the loss caused by the offense of conviction, with the loss needing to be directly and proximately caused by the offense. Restitution statutes require that the loss be directly and proximately caused by the offense. Restitution should not be ordered for losses that would not have occurred regardless of the defendant's conduct. The offense must be closely related to the loss, and restitution may be available for those directly harmed by offenses involving a \"scheme, conspiracy, or pattern.\" Section 3771 focuses on restitution for victims of offenses, emphasizing direct and proximate harm without the need for a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. Restitution is only available for harm caused by the crime of conviction, except for victims of crimes related to a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern. This differs from the victims' rights statute, which centers on activities and proceedings related to the victimizing offense. The victims' rights statute focuses on activities and proceedings related to the victimizing offense before and after conviction. Section 3771 and restitution statutes are similar in that individuals may lose victim status if charges related to the crimes are dropped or never filed. The CVRA guarantees rights identified in section 3771(a) from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. The CVRA guarantees rights from the time criminal proceedings start and end if charges are dismissed. Congress amended the law in 2015 to ensure victims are notified of plea agreements. Section 3771 allows family members or legal guardians to assume the rights of a deceased or incapacitated crime victim. This does not diminish the status of family members as victims themselves. The 2011 AG Guidelines do not address the issue of extending rights to victims of state crimes. Section 3771 applies to victims of Federal offenses or offenses in the District of Columbia, not state crimes or offenses under territorial codes. Congress likely did not intend to cover victims of offenses under territorial codes or the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Section 3771 covers victims of Federal offenses or offenses in the District of Columbia, including victims of juvenile delinquency. Rights in juvenile proceedings may vary depending on the openness of the proceedings. The 2011 AG Guidelines restrict information disclosure to victims regarding juvenile offenders unless certain conditions are met. Accused individuals cannot seek relief under this chapter. The provision in Section 3771 aims to protect victims of Federal offenses or offenses in the District of Columbia. It clarifies that accused individuals cannot seek relief under this chapter, and outlines the rights of victims, including the right to be reasonably protected from the accused. Additionally, it addresses the issue of corporations not being able to claim restitution for losses incurred due to the misconduct of their executives. The new language in Section 3771 establishes a right for victims to be protected from the accused, with no limitation on the type of decisions that need to consider victim safety. The term \"accused\" implies the right may expire upon conviction, but further clarification is needed. The term \"accused\" in Section 3771 may imply that the right to be protected from the accused expires upon conviction. Some courts have interpreted this term to mean that the right does not attach until a person has been formally accused by criminal complaint, information, or indictment. This right does not add new substance to the protection of crime victims already provided by the Bail Reform Act. The protection clause in Section 3771 grants victims the right to notice and to be heard regarding the release of an accused. This clause led to amendments in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure related to disclosure of information about government witnesses and victims. Crime victims are entitled to timely notice of court proceedings, parole hearings, and the release or escape of the accused. Officers and employees involved in crime detection, investigation, or prosecution must make efforts to ensure that victims are informed of their rights. The rights granted to crime victims under Section 3771 include the right to notice of release, with exceptions for cases where notification may endanger safety. Courts must find reasonable procedures to ensure victims can assert their rights, participate in proceedings, and take protective measures. Notification rights are subject to limitations, such as excusing failure to notify if it poses a danger. The courts can seek accommodations when the number of victims makes strict compliance with Section 3771 difficult. Notice provision may infringe on the accused's rights, leading to the victim's rights yielding. Section 3771 imposes an obligation on officials to notify crime victims of their rights, not granting victims the right to notification. This was initially proposed as a victim's equivalent to Miranda warnings for the accused. The notice clause in Section 3771(a)(2) is similar to its predecessor in the 108th Congress resolutions, with special provisions for parole proceedings and the requirement for accurate, reasonable, and timely notice. The clause also includes language obligating the government to inform victims of their rights and the option to consult an attorney. The notice clause in Section 3771(a)(2) informs victims of their rights in public court and parole proceedings, ensuring they receive accurate and timely notice. Victims are entitled to notice of the release or escape of the accused. The clause limits victims' rights to public proceedings only. The amendment recognizes that some court proceedings may be closed in certain circumstances, such as plea proceedings involving organized crime or national security cases. Victims do not have a special right to attend closed hearings, but may be notified of their existence and outcome. Congress abolished parole for federal crimes committed after November. Congress abolished parole for federal crimes committed after November 1, 1987, and for felonies under the laws of the District of Columbia effective August 5, 2000. The phrase \"involving the crime\" in the notification right covers more than just trial proceedings, including pretrial and post-trial hearings related to motions and appellate proceedings. The release proceedings for defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity may involve victim notice rights in a wide range of civil and quasi-civil proceedings. The change from \"proceedings related to the crime\" to \"proceedings involving the crime\" may not necessarily repudiate notice rights for victims of past crimes or acquitted charges. The Senate Judiciary Committee clarified that the proposed constitutional amendment does not intend to repudiate these rights. The Senate Judiciary Committee clarified that the proposed constitutional amendment does not intend to repudiate victim notice rights in release proceedings for defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity. Section 3771 confirms that notice is due in appellate proceedings and limits the rights to \"court\" and parole proceedings, excluding administrative contexts like immigration proceedings. The proposed constitutional amendment clarifies victim notice rights in court and parole proceedings, excluding immigration proceedings. A \"timeliness\" requirement for notice is added to ensure effective notification. The purpose of the notice right is to provide access to other rights in the amendment. The Senate reports explained that notice by publication might be reasonable in rare circumstances, but timely and accurate notification is crucial to prevent exclusion from proceedings or the right to make a victim impact statement. Timeliness and accuracy requirements reduce the risk of ineffective notice that could hinder a victim's rights. The accuracy modification in release notifications aims to keep victims informed of schedule changes. Section 3771 may require notification of previously unidentified victims, posing challenges in bail situations. Victims have rights to safety consideration, notice, attendance, and comment. The section 3771 may allow for postponement of the accused's initial judicial appearance to provide victims with timely notice. Early constitutional amendment proposals suggested that a failure of timely notice in a bail context could be rectified by revisiting the bail decision at the victim's request. The section does not explicitly provide for this, but it does not preclude it either. Notice of the release or escape of the accused is mentioned in section 3771, implying that there may not be a right to notice following conviction. The section 3771 implies there may not be a right to notice of release following conviction, as the terms \"accused\" and \"convicted\" are considered interchangeable. The administrative burdens of notifying victims every time an inmate is released are significant, especially for prisoners convicted of crimes prior to the effective date of the section. The section 3771 implies that there may not be a right to notice of release following conviction, as the terms \"accused\" and \"convicted\" are considered interchangeable. This includes releases after a criminal conviction, a defendant found not guilty by reason of insanity, or pursuant to a habitual sex offender statute. The rights established apply throughout the criminal justice system, even after a guilty verdict. The rights granted to victims under Section 3771 include explicit rights at sentencing and parole proceedings, with limitations on notification when it could be dangerous. Victims also have the right not to be excluded from public court proceedings unless their testimony would be materially altered. Unlike the accused, victims do not have the same prerogatives in the Constitution. Section 3771 grants victims explicit rights at sentencing and parole proceedings, with limitations on notification for safety. Victims do not have the same prerogatives as the accused in the Constitution, and may be excluded from public court proceedings unless their testimony would be affected. Sequestration of witnesses is a common practice to prevent influence from hearing others' testimony. Section 3771 grants victims the right to attend public proceedings involving the crime, balancing the interests of victim, defendant, and government. It operates in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. 3510 in federal capital cases, allowing victims to attend trial and subsequent sentencing hearings unless there is a danger of unfair prejudice or jury confusion. Section 3771 grants victims the right to attend public proceedings involving the crime, balancing the interests of victim, defendant, and government. It operates in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. 3510 in federal capital cases, allowing victims to attend trial and subsequent sentencing hearings unless there is a danger of unfair prejudice or jury confusion. Victims may be excluded from trial only as constitutionally required, with limitations compared to constitutional amendment proposals. The phrase \"not to be excluded\" in the proposals aims to prevent claims of entitlement to transportation, scheduling convenience, or freedom from imprisonment for victims. Exclusion of victims for disruptive behavior or impropriety is permitted, similar to a defendant's right to attend. The legislative history of constitutional amendment proposals indicates that Section 3771 grants victims the right to attend public proceedings involving the crime, with limitations compared to proposals. Victims may be excluded for disruptive behavior or impropriety, similar to a defendant's right to attend. The section requires victim attendance unless there is clear and convincing evidence that their presence may alter testimony. Section 3771(a)(3) grants victims the right to be reasonably heard at public proceedings in district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or parole. This right allows for reasonable participation in court and parole proceedings, but does not extend to closed proceedings, pretrial motions, trial, appeal, or related forfeiture proceedings. The section does not specify the form in which victims can be heard. The right to be reasonably heard in court proceedings raises questions about whether it is a right to comment or command, the method of communication, and limitations on the information victims can convey. The evolution of the language complicates the issue, as it is not specified in Section 3771(a)(3) how victims can be heard. The right to be \"reasonably heard\" in court proceedings may lead to concerns about interpreting the new language as granting an absolute right to make an oral statement. This could result in victims being allowed to make oral statements with reasonable time and subject matter restrictions, potentially burdening prison officials with transporting incarcerated victims to court. The Amendment's new language may imply that victims have the right to be \"heard\" in court, potentially requiring affirmative steps to ensure this right, which could burden prison officials with transporting incarcerated victims. The Senate Committee report denied that the proposed amendment created a right to transportation for victims to attend proceedings. Judicial opinions vary on whether victims have the right to make oral statements, with some courts limiting it to written presentations. The sponsors of Section 3771 believed the right to be heard should not be confined to a written statement. The sponsors of Section 3771 believed in the right of crime victims to be heard in person at any public proceeding involving release, plea, or sentencing, without needing permission. This right allows victims to address the court independently and act as participants in the proceedings. The legislative history on the content of the victim's communication is limited. The legislative history on victim communication is sparse, but the proposed amendments aim to give victims the right to recommend sentences and provide impact statements. The Senate colloquy clarifies that victims should be allowed to provide character details, impact of the crime, and sentencing recommendations. The term \"release\" proceedings in Section 3771 includes the right to be heard at bail proceedings. The term \"release\" proceedings in Section 3771 includes the right to be heard at bail proceedings, with past proposals surrounding the release-related right being complicated by qualifiers. Later versions conveyed a right to be heard at public release proceedings, potentially expanding victim allocution opportunities. There was ambiguity over whether conditional release proceedings included situations where release could be granted based on certain conditions. The term \"conditional release from custody\" in Section 3771 includes proceedings where release may be granted based on certain conditions, such as acquittal at trial or bail. The Senate Judiciary Committee interpreted \"conditional\" as limiting the right to be heard in such proceedings, which encompass pretrial or post-trial releases on bail, personal recognizance, or under other conditions like work release or home detention. This also includes parole hearings or their equivalent. The amendment includes parole hearings or their equivalent, releases from prison with conditions, and releases from secure mental facilities for criminal defendants. Victims do not have the right to speak at hearings for \"unconditional\" release. There is no right to be heard when a prisoner is released after serving the maximum penalty or full sentence. The proposal allows victims the right to be heard on pretrial motions and post-trial petitions that could result in the release of the accused or convicted offender from jeopardy. This includes the right to be heard at trial on whether the defendant should be convicted on any charges. The right to be heard in release proceedings may extend to motions to dismiss charges, allowing victims to have a say in decisions that could lead to the defendant's release. This includes considering the victim's views before ruling on such motions, ensuring fairness in the process. The victim's right to be heard in legal proceedings involving the defendant's release extends to suppression hearings and pretrial motions. This right applies to public proceedings in the district court but may not extend to closed proceedings like grand jury hearings. Victims also have the right to seek appellate review and be heard in habeas proceedings. Some courts may hesitate to delay initial appearance or release hearings to accommodate the right to be heard in plea agreements. Negotiated guilty pleas are common, offering the government convictions without the need for a trial. Defendants may receive less severe charges or sentences in exchange for cooperation. Prosecutors may also offer advantages like immunity or concessions to family members. A plea bargain can involve serious charges, forfeiture concessions, testimonial immunity, witness protection, and informant rewards. Victims may be surprised by plea bargains, affecting their restitution prospects and legal standing. Section 3771 allows victims to be heard in court when a plea bargain is accepted, but not in negotiations between the defendant and prosecutor. The right of victims to be heard in court, particularly through victim impact statements, has been a contentious issue. While victims must be given a voice, their views do not necessarily determine the outcome. The Supreme Court has addressed the use of victim impact statements in capital punishment cases, clarifying that they do not infringe upon the rights of the accused. This right for victims to address the court was a key goal of victims' rights efforts. The Supreme Court has ruled in cases like Booth v. Maryland and South Carolina v. Gathers that victim impact statements at capital sentencing hearings cannot include opinions about the crime, the defendant, or the appropriate sentence. This is based on Eighth Amendment considerations in capital cases. The right of victims to be heard in court, particularly through victim impact statements, has been a contentious issue, but their views do not determine the outcome. In noncapital cases, the right to be heard at sentencing does not necessarily include the victim's impact statement in the presentence report. Victims have the right to be heard at parole proceedings under Section 3771, but parole is not part of the federal criminal justice process for crimes committed after November 1, 1987. The parole laws for federal offenses and felonies in the District of Columbia vary depending on the date of the crime. Victims have the right to be notified and heard at parole hearings for certain offenders. Constitutional amendments have proposed victims' rights in public pardons proceedings, but Section 3771 does not include this provision. The pardoning power lies with the President and is separate from the federal criminal justice process. Section 3771(a)(2) entitles victims to notice of the release of the prisoner through the President's pardoning power. Victims have limited rights to be heard on appeal, with the government entrusted to represent their interests. The statute also grants victims the right to confer with the Government's attorney, a provision not found in proposed constitutional amendments. The Senate sponsors described an extensive right for crime victims to confer with the Government's attorney in the case, allowing them to discuss critical stages or case dispositions. This right does not give victims the power to direct the prosecution but ensures that prosecutors are available to address victims' concerns related to the case. The right for crime victims to confer with the Government's attorney allows them to discuss case proceedings and dispositions. This right does not grant victims access to investigative files or pre-sentencing reports, but it does include the right to full and timely restitution as provided by law. Section 3771's restitution language, reminiscent of constitutional amendment proposals in previous Congresses, introduces the concept of just and timely claims to restitution, making restitution orders mandatory as a matter of right. The proposed legislation aimed to make restitution orders mandatory for convicted offenders, but there was ambiguity regarding the scope of this right. The early proposals did not specify a specific amount of restitution, leaving it up to the court to decide. The focus was on granting victims the right to an order of restitution, with enforcement and priority left to the court's discretion. The proposed legislation aimed to make restitution orders mandatory for convicted offenders, with enforcement and priority left to applicable Federal and State law. The right to restitution also included the possibility of a pretrial restraining order to prevent asset dissipation by the accused. The amendment proposals shifted the focus to considering victims' claims justly and timely, weighed against the interests of others, and applicable during proceedings on other matters. The proposed legislation aimed to make restitution orders mandatory for convicted offenders, with enforcement and priority left to applicable Federal and State law. One commentator illustrated a case where a victim was denied restitution, emphasizing the need for timely and just restitution without any other factors considered. The proposed legislation aimed to make restitution orders mandatory for convicted offenders, with enforcement and priority left to applicable Federal and State law. The insertion of the word \"just\" in the restitution component of the amendment proposal called for consideration of factors when appropriate, precluding restitution claims by victims of illegal conduct. Historical proposals allowed victims to reopen final proceedings for restitution, but this language was replaced with a reference to \"timely\" claims. Section 3771 adds the phrase \"as provided in law\" to the right and substitutes \"full and timely\" restitution for \"just and timely\" restitution. The proposed legislation makes restitution orders mandatory for convicted offenders, with a focus on ensuring full and timely restitution for victims. The section also guarantees the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay, in line with constitutional protections for those accused of federal crimes. The constitutional right to a speedy trial is reinforced by laws at both federal and state levels. Delay in proceedings can benefit the defendant, as witnesses may become unavailable and evidence may be lost over time. Victims now also have rights to prompt disposition, with some states enacting laws to address their interests. Some states have enacted laws establishing a victim's right to prompt disposition of their case. The federal victims' bill of rights does not include a speedy trial provision, but encourages states to provide victims with a reasonably expeditious trial. Despite evolving language, the right has been described similarly over the years, with comparisons to the defendant's constitutional speedy trial right. In the 105th and 108th Congress, proposals focused on victims' right to a prompt trial, emphasizing the need for proceedings to be resolved in a timely manner. The right was seen as relevant only in a trial and pretrial context, with implications that it could only be claimed in conjunction with other proceedings. In the 108th Congress, the formulation regarding victims' rights to adjudicative decisions emphasized avoiding unreasonable delays. The new wording introduced concepts like \"adjudicative decisions\" and \"duly consider,\" while still following the principle of reasonable delays being acceptable. However, questions remained about whether victims should be heard before decisions affecting delays are made. The amendment's language did not necessarily create a right to assert the interest, but rather triggered a right to consideration of delay avoidance. The right to be heard related to specific matters like public release, plea, sentencing, reprieve, and pardon proceedings, not scheduling or trial proceedings. Section 3771(a)(7) describes the right to delay avoidance in limiting terms, but apparently more expansively than before. The sponsors of the amendment aimed to provide crime victims with the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay, without infringing on the defendant's due process rights. Delays in criminal proceedings often occur for the convenience of parties, causing victims continued stress and victimization. The provision aims to prevent holding crime victims under stress due to court delays. It emphasizes the right to fair treatment, respect for dignity, and privacy of victims. This right is crucial but not explicitly stated in proposed constitutional amendments. The right to fair treatment and respect for a victim's dignity and privacy is a key aspect of various amendments and victims' rights provisions. This right applies throughout the criminal justice process and does not prevent legitimate arguments from being made. Sealing court records without allowing victims to verify if their rights were upheld goes against the victim's right to fair treatment and respect, while redacting identifying information may be warranted in some cases. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act added the right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement to victims' rights. The provision aims to clarify that victims should be notified before such agreements are finalized, not after. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act added the right for victims to be informed of plea bargains or deferred prosecution agreements in a timely manner, ensuring notification before finalization. This supplements existing rights for crime victims under section 3771(a)(10). Section 3771(a)(10) now provides an explicit right for crime victims. Federal courts have responsibilities in ensuring victims' rights under US and DC laws, as well as in federal habeas corpus proceedings for state crimes. In court proceedings involving a crime victim, the court must ensure the victim's rights are upheld as described in subsection (a). The court should make efforts to allow the victim's attendance and consider alternatives before excluding them from the proceeding. The provision in the criminal proceeding ensures that victims' rights are upheld, with the court obligated to state reasons for any denial of relief. It sets a higher standard than the previous \"best efforts\" provision, requiring proactive measures to protect victims' rights. In Federal habeas corpus proceedings, crime victims are entitled to specific rights, but the scope of the provision remains unclear due to changes in the proposed constitutional amendments. Section 3771(b)(2) under the Adam Walsh Act provides limited rights to victims of state offenses seeking federal habeas corpus relief. These rights include attendance, the right to be heard, protection from delays, fair treatment, and enforcement of these rights. The provision aims to define \"crime victim\" and ensure their rights are upheld in federal courts. The right to be heard in habeas proceedings includes the right to argue points of law, with victims treated as amicus rather than interveners. Enforcement authority lies with the victim or their representative, not government officials. Section 3771(b)(2) lacks a right to notice for federal habeas proceedings, absolving federal executive branch officials of obligations under the provision. The Department of Justice and other US agencies must ensure crime victims are notified of their rights. Prosecutors should inform victims about seeking legal advice. Section 3771(c)(2) acknowledges potential conflicts between government and victim interests. Regulations establish a complaint procedure for enforcement. Proposed constitutional amendments lack similar provisions. Section 3771(d)(1) grants standing to victims and their representatives, allowing the government to assert rights on behalf of the victim. The legislative history confirms that representatives include victims' attorneys and those standing in for unavailable victims. Prosecutors have been noted to assert victims' rights in some cases. The rights of victims can be asserted in the district court where the defendant is being prosecuted or where the crime occurred. If relief is denied, a writ of mandamus can be requested from the court of appeals, which must decide within 72 hours. The court of appeals will use ordinary appellate review standards in making its decision. The court of appeals will use ordinary standards of appellate review in cases involving the denial of crime victims' rights. Proceedings cannot be delayed for more than five days to enforce this chapter. If relief is denied, the reasons must be clearly stated in a written opinion. The provision allows for interlocutory appeals with short stays or continuances in criminal proceedings. Senate sponsors viewed mandamus as a means of appellate review. The availability of mandamus as a means of appellate review for victims' rights cases was a point of contention among federal appellate courts. The Second Circuit outlined the criteria for a mandamus petitioner, but felt that Congress intended for victims to have easier access to review. The Court settled on an abuse of discretion standard for attorneys' fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Different Circuits had varying opinions on the use of mandamus as an avenue of review for victims of governmental overreaching. Congress resolved the dispute in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, allowing the usual appellate standard to apply. The government can assert the rights of a victim, including the right to appeal and petition for mandamus relief on a victim's behalf. In cases with numerous crime victims, the court may create a practical procedure to uphold victims' rights without complicating proceedings. The right to notice in Section 3771(a) may be limited due to the large number of victims. The amendments allow courts flexibility in cases involving multiple victims. The amendments provide courts flexibility in cases with multiple victims, allowing alternative procedures to uphold victims' rights. Failure to afford a right under this chapter does not warrant a new trial. Victims can motion to re-open a plea or sentence if their right to be heard was denied, petitioning the court of appeals within 14 days. The amendment addressed reopening criminal proceedings to correct a denial of a victim's rights. Initially, relief was only granted prospectively, with exceptions for bail and restitution proceedings. The question was ultimately left for legislative resolution, with a prohibition on new trials. Section 3771(d)(5) prevents double jeopardy from barring a new trial for a victim's statutory right, limiting revisiting plea and sentencing proceedings. The statute limits revisiting plea and sentencing proceedings, with exceptions for bail and restitution. It allows for a plea agreement when the accused pleads to the highest crime charged, but reopening the agreement only gives the victim the right to advise the court. The chapter does not authorize a cause of action for damages or create any duty or obligation for the breach of which the United States or its officers could be held liable. It also does not impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General. Section 3771(d)(6) denies intent to create a cause of action for damages against the United States or its officers, and impairs prosecutorial discretion. Constitutional amendment proposals also ban damages and requests for counsel for indigent victims. Some Members regret the lack of provision for counsel for indigent victims. The statute Section 3771(d)(6) limits remedies for victims' rights violations by denying damages against the United States or its officials and restricting prosecutorial discretion. The addition of prosecutorial discretion language was made late in the legislative process by the House Judiciary Committee, possibly influenced by the Justice Department. The Attorney General is required to enforce crime victims' rights and ensure compliance by officials within a year of the chapter's enactment. Regulations will be promulgated for receiving victim complaints, training Justice Department employees, and imposing sanctions for violations. The Department of Justice issued victim assistance guidelines in 2005 and 2011, including regulations for crime victims' rights. These rights include protection from the accused, notice of court proceedings, the right to be heard, and confer with officials. The Department of Justice issued victim assistance guidelines in 2005 and 2011, including regulations for crime victims' rights such as protection from the accused, notice of court proceedings, the right to be heard, confer with officials, full restitution, proceedings free from delay, fair treatment, and timely information on plea bargains. The court must ensure that crime victims are given their rights during Federal habeas corpus proceedings arising from State convictions, including attendance at proceedings and consideration of alternatives to exclusion. Victims or their representatives can enforce these rights as described in the regulations. In Federal habeas corpus proceedings arising from State convictions, the court must ensure that crime victims are notified of and given their rights. Officers and employees of the Department of Justice and other agencies must make their best efforts to notify and accord crime victims their rights. The term \"crime victim\" is defined as the person against whom the State offense is committed or their family member or lawful representative. In Federal habeas corpus proceedings arising from State convictions, crime victims must be notified of and given their rights. The prosecutor should advise crime victims to seek legal advice regarding their rights. Notice of release may be withheld if it endangers anyone's safety. Crime victims, their representatives, and the Government's attorney can assert these rights. If there are multiple crime victims, the court must establish a fair procedure to uphold these rights. The court must establish a fair procedure to uphold crime victims' rights in Federal habeas corpus proceedings arising from State convictions, allowing for a motion for relief and writ of mandamus to be asserted in the district court where the defendant is being prosecuted or where the crime occurred. If relief is denied, the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus, which must be decided within 72 hours unless a different time period is stipulated. In criminal cases, the court of appeals must decide on applications for relief within a specified time frame, with no stay or continuance exceeding five days. The Government can challenge the denial of a crime victim's rights, but this does not warrant a new trial. Victims can only seek to re-open a plea or sentence if their right to be heard was denied during the proceeding. The court of appeals must decide on relief applications in criminal cases within a set time frame, with no stay exceeding five days. Victims can petition for a writ of mandamus if their right to be heard was denied during the proceeding, but this does not allow for a new trial. No cause of action for damages is authorized under this chapter, and it does not affect the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General. The term \"court of appeals\" refers to the relevant court based on the jurisdiction of the prosecution. A \"crime victim\" is defined as someone directly harmed by a federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia. Minors and certain other victims have designated representatives to uphold their rights. Procedures are in place to ensure compliance with regulations within a specified timeframe. The Attorney General of the United States will establish regulations within a year to enforce crime victims' rights and ensure compliance by officials. The regulations will designate an authority to handle complaints, mandate training for Department of Justice employees, and include disciplinary measures for non-compliance. The Attorney General will establish regulations to enforce crime victims' rights, including disciplinary sanctions for non-compliance by Department of Justice employees. Victims must be notified of court proceedings and allowed to attend, with limited exceptions. The Attorney General's decision on complaints is final and not subject to judicial review. The court must make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and consider reasonable alternatives to exclusion. Victims have the right to be heard at public proceedings concerning release, plea, or sentencing. Victim's rights must be promptly decided upon, can be asserted by various parties, and apply to multiple victims. The court must ensure victims' rights are upheld, even in cases with multiple victims. Victims can assert their rights in the district where the defendant is being prosecuted. A victim may only move to reopen a plea or sentence under specific conditions. Failure to afford a victim any right described in these rules is not grounds for a new trial. No New Trial if victim's rights are not upheld according to the rules."
