The Congress acknowledges the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Movement, highlighting the bravery of the Foot Soldiers who were assaulted during the march from Selma to Montgomery. Efforts to register African-Americans to vote in Alabama were aimed at ensuring every citizen's right to vote and be heard. Despite initial challenges, leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. continued to work towards this goal. On March 7, 1965, over 500 voting rights marchers gathered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama in peaceful protest of the denial of their right to vote. Led by John Lewis and Rev. Hosea Williams, they were brutally attacked by Alabama state troopers. On March 9, 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King led nearly 2,500 Foot Soldiers in a second peaceful march at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, known as \"Turnaround Tuesday.\" Despite receiving no protection, Dr. King kneeled in prayer at the bridge before turning back to ensure the safety of the marchers. President Lyndon B. Johnson was inspired by their bravery. President Lyndon B. Johnson announced a voting rights bill after being inspired by the bravery of Foot Soldiers who endured atrocities. U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled in favor of the Foot Soldiers' right to peaceful protest, overturning Governor George Wallace's prohibition. Federal agents were ordered to protect the Foot Soldiers during the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March. On March 21, 1965, federalized forces escorted 8,000 Foot Soldiers from Selma to Alabama State Capitol, leading to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 2015, Congress honored Foot Soldiers who participated in the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March in 1965 with the Congressional Gold Medal. In 2015, Congress honored Foot Soldiers who participated in the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March in 1965 with the Congressional Gold Medal. SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.
