Congress finds that the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe filed claims for an accounting of funds received under the Nelson Act and other statutes and treaties. On May 17, 1999, a joint motion for findings in aid of settlement of claims in Docket No. 19 and 188 was filed in the Court of Federal Claims. The settlement terms were approved, and final judgment was entered on May 26, 1999. $20,000,000 was transferred to the Department of the Interior on June 22, 1999, for beneficiaries of the amounts awarded. Congress must authorize the use or distribution of the judgment funds under the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. On October 1, 2009, the Minnesota Chippewa Tribal Executive Committee passed Resolution 146-09 approving a plan. Resolution 146-09 was passed by the Executive Committee, approving a plan to distribute judgment funds and requesting Congress to authorize the distribution as described in the plan. SEC. 3.
