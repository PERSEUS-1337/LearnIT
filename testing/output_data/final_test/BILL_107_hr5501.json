    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Higher Education Accrediting Agency Responsibility Act of 2002\" and references to the Higher Education Act of 1965 are included. The findings and purposes of the Act are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that accrediting agencies were originally meant for voluntary oversight of higher education institutions, but they now control over $40 billion in Federal student aid. However, there are already more effective and less costly mechanisms in place to protect students and parents, as institutions must be certified by the Department of Education before receiving Federal funds. Additionally, there is now more public information available on the quality of academic institutions. The quality of academic institutions has significantly increased information available, surpassing accreditation standards. Concerns arise about graduates lacking necessary skills for civic life. The accreditation process imposes costs on institutions, ultimately affecting students and parents. The Act aims to shift accreditation focus to providing comparative information on higher education quality rather than determining student aid eligibility. The Act aims to shift accreditation focus to providing comparative information on higher education quality and end the monopoly of accrediting agencies.
