    "content": "The \"Main Street Growth Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for venture exchanges. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows national securities exchanges to elect to be treated as venture exchanges by notifying the Commission. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows national securities exchanges to elect to be treated as venture exchanges by notifying the Commission. Such election shall be deemed approved by the Commission within a 6-month period unless denied. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 allows national securities exchanges to elect to be treated as venture exchanges by notifying the Commission. A venture exchange may only provide a market for venture securities, determine trading increments, disseminate information fairly, conduct auctions, and cannot offer unlisted trading privileges. A venture exchange, under certain exemptions, is not required to comply with specific national security exchange regulations, submit data to a securities information processor, or use decimal pricing. Additionally, securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 are also exempt from certain trading regulations on a venture exchange. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of an early-stage, growth company as an issuer that has not conducted an initial public offering and has a market capitalization of $1,000,000,000. The Commission adjusts the threshold for early-stage, growth companies based on the Consumer Price Index, setting it at the nearest $1,000,000. If an issuer's market capitalization exceeds the threshold but is traded on a venture exchange, it will still be considered an early-stage, growth company. The market capitalization threshold for early-stage, growth companies is set at $2,000,000,000, adjusted for inflation every 5 years based on the Consumer Price Index. If an issuer's market capitalization exceeds this threshold for 24 consecutive months, it will no longer be considered an early-stage, growth company. The venture exchange may exempt an issuer from market capitalization requirements for up to 1 year if they cease to be an early-stage, growth company. The exemption can be extended for an additional year upon request. The Securities Act of 1933 is amended to include venture securities as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Congress believes the SEC should consider these changes. The Securities and Exchange Commission may utilize its exemptive authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for new provisions and establish an Office of Venture Exchanges. This section does not affect antifraud provisions or SEC's authority. Effective date for tiers of existing national securities. Effective Date for Tiers of Existing National Securities Exchanges: For securities exchanges already registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any election to be treated as a venture exchange will take effect 180 days after the enactment of this Act."
