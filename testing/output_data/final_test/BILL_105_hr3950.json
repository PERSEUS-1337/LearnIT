    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Otay Mountain Wilderness Act of 1998\". The Congress declares the Otay Mountain region in California as a pristine location known for its unique plants. It is crucial for San Diego's conservation plan and law enforcement efforts to curb illegal immigration and protect wilderness values. The rugged topography in the Otay Mountain region presents unique fire management challenges for protecting lives and resources. Certain public lands in the California Desert District are designated as wilderness, comprising approximately 18,500 acres known as the Otay Mountain Wilderness. This designation is in line with the Wilderness Act and is a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System. A map and legal description are provided for reference. The Secretary must file a map and legal description for the Wilderness Area with specified committees. The map and legal description will be available for public inspection and any errors may be corrected. The southern boundary of the Wilderness Area must be 100 feet north of a designated trail. The Wilderness Area boundary is 100 feet north of the trail on the map and at least 100 feet from the US-Mexico border. SEC. 5. Wilderness areas in Southern Otay Mountain and Western Otay Mountain have been adequately studied for designation. They are no longer subject to management requirements that could impair their suitability for preservation as wilderness. SEC. 6. Administration of wilderness area. The Wilderness Area shall be administered by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act, with adjustments for effective dates and agency references. Border enforcement, drug interdiction, and wildland fire protection activities are allowed within the Wilderness Area under specified conditions.

FURTHER ACQUISITIONS: Any lands acquired by the United States within the Wilderness Area boundaries after the enactment of this Act will become part of the Wilderness Area and be managed accordingly.\n\nSEC. 8. NO BUFFER ZONES: The designation of the Wilderness Area by this Act will not create protective perimeters or buffer zones. Nonwilderness activities visible or audible from the Wilderness Area will not automatically be prohibited up to the boundary.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. The term \"public lands\" refers to lands as defined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior.
