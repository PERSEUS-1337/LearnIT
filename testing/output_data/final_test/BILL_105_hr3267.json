Additionally, emergency actions are outlined to improve water quality in the Alamo River and New River through irrigation drainage water management. The \"Salton Sea Reclamation Act of 1998\" authorizes a feasibility study on the Salton Sea, concurrent wildlife studies, and renaming the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. It also outlines emergency actions to improve water quality in the Alamo River and New River through irrigation drainage water management. The Act defines key terms such as \"Committees,\" \"Salton Sea Authority,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Secretary must complete feasibility studies and cost analyses by January 1, 2000, for Congress to evaluate options regarding the Salton Sea's use as a reservoir. This includes reducing salinity, stabilizing elevation, restoring wildlife habitats, and enhancing recreational and economic potential. The Secretary will identify feasible options for the Salton Sea's recreational and economic development by January 1, 2000, based on available information. A feasibility study will be conducted in collaboration with the Salton Sea Authority and the Governor of California to establish criteria for evaluating and selecting options. The feasibility study will establish criteria for evaluating and selecting options for the Salton Sea, including impoundments, pumping water out, augmented flows, and other economically feasible remediation options. The Secretary will evaluate economically feasible remediation options for the Salton Sea, limited to proven technologies and not relying on new water imports from the Colorado River. Assumptions will be made regarding water inflows encouraging conservation and accounting for transfers out of the basin, with a maximum likely reduction of 800,000 acre-feet per year. The Secretary will evaluate feasible remediation options for the Salton Sea, considering funding sources and cost sharing. Activities authorized by this Act will not be subject to certain reclamation laws. The Act provides additional benefits under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 and does not affect any existing treaties, laws, contracts, or agreements related to water use from the Colorado River. All activities must comply with the rights and obligations outlined in those agreements. SEC. 102. CONCURRENT WILDLIFE RESOURCES STUDIES. The Secretary will conduct studies on hydrology, wildlife pathology, and toxicology at the Salton Sea concurrently with the feasibility study. A committee called the \"Salton Sea Research Management Committee\" will select study topics and manage the research, consisting of five members including the Secretary, Governor of California, Executive Director of the Salton Sea Authority, Chairman of the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla Tribal Government, and Director of the California Water Resources Center. The Secretary will coordinate studies on hydrology, wildlife pathology, and toxicology at the Salton Sea through the Science Subcommittee. Representatives from various institutions will be invited to participate in the research. Studies will undergo peer review, and $5,000,000 is authorized for wildlife resources studies. The committee's activities are subject to the Advisory Committee Act. The committee, with activities not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, is authorized for wildlife resources studies with $5,000,000 exclusively allocated. The Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge in California is renamed as the Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. Any references to the old name in official documents now refer to the new name. Additionally, emergency action is being taken to improve water quality in the Alamo River and New River through irrigation drainage water management. The Secretary is authorized to conduct research and construct projects to improve water quality in the Alamo River and New River, California, by treating water and irrigation drainage. Acquisition of equipment and real property may be done if agreements are in place with the State of California, political subdivisions, or Desert Wildlife Unlimited. The Secretary is authorized to acquire equipment and property for operational systems, transferring title within a year. A monitoring program will be established for wetlands development, with additional actions to improve effectiveness. The Secretary will implement subsection (a) in cooperation with Desert Wildlife Unlimited, the Imperial Irrigation District, California, and other interested parties. Water withdrawn for wetlands projects under subsection (a)(1) and returned to the Alamo River or New River is exempt from meeting water quality standards under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. $3,000,000 is authorized for river reclamation and irrigation drainage water treatment actions. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
