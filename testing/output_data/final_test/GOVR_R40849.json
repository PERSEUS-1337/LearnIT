    "content": "Iran's neighbors are reevaluating their policies towards Iran in light of regional concerns such as the Arab-Israeli peace process, stability in Lebanon and Iraq, terrorism, and the war in Afghanistan. Understanding their perspectives on Iran's regional influence, nuclear program, energy production, and support for terrorism is crucial for shaping overall U.S. policy towards Iran. Iran's regional influence is a concern for the United States and Iran's neighbors due to its ambitions, ability to influence domestic politics, and role as a spoiler in the peace process. Analysts view the region as a power struggle between Sunni-ruled Arab states and Iran and its allies like Syria, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Some argue that Iran's size and resources naturally give it influence, while others believe its soft power has waned since the 2009 election. Iran's neighbors view its regional influence as a domestic political issue. Iran's regional influence is a concern for Iran's neighbors, with countries like Bahrain and Kuwait expressing fears of Iran's influence among Shiite populations. Iran's use of proxies, like Hezbollah in Lebanon, is seen as destabilizing. Saudi Arabia criticizes Iran's interference in Arab causes and supports Sunni political parties in Lebanon. The primary goal of U.S. and international engagement with Iran is to monitor its nuclear activities and limit uranium enrichment capacity. Iran's nuclear program raises concerns about its weaponization, with uncertainty over Iran's political will to develop a nuclear weapon. The disclosure of a second uranium enrichment facility near Qom in 2009 heightened these concerns. Iran's intentions are unclear, but analysts agree that if Iran was seeking enriched fuel for civilian purposes, it would not need to conceal facilities or restrict access to inspectors. Iran's neighbors, including the United States and the international community, are concerned about Iran's nuclear program. The uncertainty surrounding Iran's nuclear activities could lead to a regional arms race or war, affecting neighboring countries' relationships with the US and economies. Iran's energy resources fund its nuclear program and support terrorism, giving it leverage over international players. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), Iran holds an estimated 10% of proven reserves. Iran holds 10% of global oil reserves and 15% of natural gas reserves, making it a key player in the energy market. Its strategic location at the Strait of Hormuz adds to its importance as a major exporter of oil. With potential for growth through investment, Iran's energy resources are becoming increasingly relevant for regional and global energy partnerships. Iran's neighbors weigh economic benefits against security concerns in their relationships with Iran. While most oppose a nuclear Iran due to fears of regional conflict, some hesitate to challenge Iran publicly due to economic ties. The US and neighboring countries are worried about Iran's support for terrorism, backing various designated terrorist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Taliban fighters. Iran's support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Taliban poses direct military threats to Iran's neighbors, undermines political stability, and challenges U.S. efforts to promote regional stability. The presence of these groups limits options for addressing regional concerns and perpetuates conflict in the Middle East and Central Asia. Iran uses Arab-Israeli conflict to justify militant rhetoric at home and maintain domestic support. Saudi Arabia and Iran compete for power in the Gulf region, leveraging economic resources and political influence. During the Cold War, they were key US allies despite their rivalry. Iran's Islamic revolution heightened tensions with Saudi Arabia, leading to sectarian clashes and Saudi support for Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia played a key role in implementing the U.S. \"dual containment\" strategy against Iran and Iraq. The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 shifted the security balance in the Gulf, benefiting Iran in Saudi Arabia's view. The potential for proxy warfare between Saudi Arabia and Iran has decreased, but competition in Iraq continues to shape their regional dynamics. The outcome of Iraq's national elections will impact the interests of both countries. Saudi Arabia and Iran are engaged in a direct competition for influence, with Saudi Arabia focusing on strengthening national and pan-Arab solidarity to counter domestic extremist threats and contain Iran. The dynamic between the two governments has shifted to basic strategic competition, despite sectarian rhetoric inflaming relations. Saudi authorities are asserting a leadership role in the Arab world and have asked Iranian leaders for mutual respect and periodic consultation. Saudi Arabia is asserting a leadership role in the Arab world and has asked Iran not to interfere in what they consider to be strictly \"Arab causes.\" Concerns over Iran's nuclear program and potential regional conflict persist. Saudi Arabia's military campaign in Yemen against the Al Houthi rebel group has raised fears of proxy conflict. Iran's alleged support for the Houthis has further strained relations. Iranian politicians continue to support actors opposing Saudi policy, despite no longer overtly destabilizing neighboring governments. The Saudi government has adopted a cautious policy approach to counter Iranian influence in the region by coordinating with other Arab governments and the United States. Saudi officials have engaged with Iranian counterparts while avoiding exacerbating sectarian tensions publicly. Saudi media outlets have taken a critical stance towards Tehran, using controversies like the Bahrain flare-up and the conflict with Al Houthi rebels in Yemen to fuel opposition to perceived Iranian influence. Saudi Arabia has adopted a cautious policy to counter Iranian influence by coordinating with Arab governments and the US. Saudi officials support diplomatic solutions to the Iranian nuclear crisis and hope for a peaceful resolution. Prince Saud linked Israel's nuclear program to Iran's at the UN General Assembly in 2009. The community's response to Israel's presumed nuclear capabilities has led some states to develop their own nuclear capabilities, citing double standards as justification for non-compliance with international resolutions. Saudi-Iranian trade is relatively limited, with the value estimated at $1.42 billion in 2007 and $1.87 billion in 2008. Iran's oil sector is constrained by sanctions, benefiting Saudi Arabia by helping to maintain its global market share. Saudi Arabia, as an oil producer with excess capacity, can influence global oil prices and impact Iran's oil export revenue. Economic and security concerns are intertwined for both countries due to regional security disruptions. Economic and security concerns are intertwined for Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia has a more advanced military with higher spending, but Iran's missile capabilities and relationships with non-state actors pose a credible threat. Saudi Arabia, a US ally, could be seen as a potential threat by Iran due to its oil exports dependency. The rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran is fueled by their status as emerging powers in a volatile region. Despite economic competition and sectarian tensions, the vulnerability of their energy assets and religious constraints may prevent direct conflict. Previous tensions have led to limited military engagements, but leaders have consistently found ways to de-escalate. Saudi and Iranian leaders have consistently defused disagreements before escalating into broader conflict. Saudi Arabia resists Iranian influence in the region, depending on political developments in Iran. Saudi's response to Iran's nuclear ambitions remains a topic of debate. Saudi Arabia's response to Iran's nuclear ambitions is a topic of intense debate. If Saudi leaders believe an Iranian nuclear weapon would threaten their national interests, they would take decisive action, potentially in cooperation with other governments. This response could influence other regional actors' decisions regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. Despite historical tensions, Qatar has maintained positive relations with Iran. Qatari officials have engaged in frequent meetings with Iranian government officials in both Iran and Qatar, advocating for increased dialogue between GCC states, other Arab states, and Iran. The Qatari Emir has hosted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad at summits and visited Iran for consultations on bilateral and regional issues. Qatar's stance on Iran is one of neutrality, stating they will not be an enemy to anyone but will not allow themselves to be used against others. Qatar's neutral stance on Iran, advocating for dialogue between Arab states and Iran, has led to speculation that it is aligning with Iran against the United States. Qatari officials reject this analysis, emphasizing the importance of engagement and collective approaches to regional security issues. Qatar's independent policies reflect its growing economic influence, despite its small population. Qatar's foreign policy priorities reflect its leaders' desire to maintain independence, security, and freedom of action among competing regional and international actors. Qatar views potential conflict in the Gulf region as undesirable and prioritizes engagement with Iran and its adversaries. Recent diplomatic activities include mediation in Lebanon's political deadlock and advocacy for Hamas. Qatar's foreign policy priorities include maintaining independence and engaging with Iran and its adversaries. Qatar opposed a UN Security Council resolution on Iran in 2006 and has a significant trade relationship with Iran. They share the North Field/South Pars gas deposit. Qatar's significant natural gas reserves from the North Field/South Pars deposit contribute to its status as the third-largest holder of natural gas reserves globally. The country heavily relies on U.S. military presence for defense, which could potentially lead to tensions with Iran. In 2009, Qatari Armed Forces' Chief of Staff visited Iran for security talks with Iranian defense officials. Qatar's enduring economic and security linkage to Iran is due to shared energy resources in contiguous waters. Qatar has maintained engagement with Iran and strengthened bilateral ties as Iran's influence in the region has grown. Political changes among Iran's elected leadership are unlikely to significantly alter Iranian-Qatari relations. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr Al Thani views Iran's post-election disputes as an internal matter, respecting each state's right to solve its own problems. Qatar aims for GCC engagement to prevent conflict, pursuing rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Qatar's policy of not being an enemy to anyone is sustainable unless security conditions change. Bahrain's Sunni Arab monarchy relies on good relations with external actors for stability and security. The government seeks security through alliances with Arab states, engagement with Iran, and support from the United States. Economic success is tied to being a secure environment for investment. Concerns include regional conflict and the Shiite majority. The ruling elite in Bahrain, the Al Khalifa family, established control over the predominantly Shiite population in the 1780s. They sought alliances to protect themselves from regional powers, including Persia, and made Bahrain a British protectorate in 1861. Iran contested Bahrain's sovereignty multiple times, including in the early 1930s and 1957. Iran reasserted its claim to Bahrain before its independence in 1971. The United Nations Secretary General dispatched a representative to determine the views of Bahrainis, who overwhelmingly favored independence from all outside powers, including Iran. Iran relinquished all claims to Bahrain in Resolution 278, but concerns of revived claims have surfaced over the years. In 2009, comments by Iranian officials sparked controversy by referring to Bahrain as Iran's 14th province. Iran's Foreign Ministry reiterated respect for Bahrain's sovereignty. Iran's respect for Bahrain's sovereignty has been reiterated by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, despite concerns from Arab states about perceived interference. Bahrain's leaders are cautious about Iran's nuclear program and sectarian tensions in the region due to their limited resources and large Shiite population. The past accusations of Iran by Bahrain's rulers have added to the complexity of their relationship with Iran. Bahrain has accused Iran of supporting pro-Iranian proxy groups, leading to concerns about Iranian interference. Recent unrest in Bahrain is driven by domestic grievances, not widespread pro-Iranian sentiment. The leading Shiite opposition party, Al Wefaq, remains engaged in politics but expressed concern about Iranian comments on Bahrain's sovereignty in 2009. In December 2008, Shiite activists were arrested in Bahrain for plotting bombing attacks. Al Wefaq played a role in securing the release of rival Shiite leader Hassan Mushaima. In November 2009, Sunni politicians criticized Al Wefaq for not supporting a resolution endorsing Saudi Arabia's military campaign against Al Houthi fighters from Yemen. This controversy reignited concerns about sectarian divisions in Bahrain. Al Wefaq and Al Haq movement will compete for influence among Bahrain's Shiite majority in the upcoming parliamentary elections in 2010. Al Wefaq is hesitant to confirm participation in the election due to concerns about the parliamentary system and sectarian discrimination. Bahrain's monarchy and Sunni community are monitoring Shiite leaders for signs of Iranian influence. Iranian-Bahraini trade is limited, with negotiations for a gas agreement temporarily on hold in 2009. Bahrain relies on the US and Saudi Arabia for external security, hosting major US military facilities. Suspicions of Iran are deeply ingrained, amplified by perceived hegemonic or sectarian policies. Political changes in Iran post-2009 election could alleviate some concerns. Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapon could deepen Bahrain's reliance on the United States, while trends among Gulf Cooperation Council states would also influence Bahrain's response. Iran aims to strengthen relations with nations in the Persian Gulf, including Bahrain, to prevent collective GCC action against its interests. The UAE has had complex relationships with Iran, viewing it as both a potential threat and an important commercial partner since its formation in 1971. The UAE's relations with Iran have been complex since its formation in 1971. Different emirates have varying views on Iran, with some being more negative while others are more accommodating based on shared ties. Iran's interactions with the Arab Trucial States before the formation of the UAE were critical in shaping their development. Iran seized islands from the emirates in 1971 and established a military outpost on another island in 1992. The dispute over the sovereignty of Abu Musa island has persisted for nearly 40 years, causing tensions between the UAE, Arab states, and Iran. In 2008, the UAE and Iran signed an agreement to resolve the issue, following Iran's establishment of offices on the island. The United States is concerned about Iran's control over the islands but does not take a position on sovereignty. UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan emphasized the UAE's stance against using force to settle international disputes. The UAE does not support using force to resolve international disputes, especially when it involves neighboring countries like Iran. They emphasize the importance of peaceful means in resolving issues, such as Iran's nuclear program. The UAE hopes for a peaceful resolution and urges Iran to hand over the disputed islands. They seek to regain sovereignty over the islands through dialogue and a peaceful approach. The UAE emphasizes peaceful resolution of disputes with Iran, including the islands issue. They support ICJ ruling and dialogue for sovereignty over the islands, despite Iran's claim of ownership. UAE seeks to develop economic ties with Iran to potentially resolve the dispute. The UAE seeks to avoid regional conflict with Iran by engaging in dialogue and cooperating with international partners to limit Iranian influence. They prioritize security and regional stability for economic growth, supporting peaceful resolutions to disputes while preparing to defend against security threats. UAE also backs initiatives for peaceful resolutions, such as supporting the Obama Administration's outreach to Iran and endorsing the Arab League peace proposal to Israel. The UAE supports peaceful resolutions and regional stability, endorsing the Arab League peace proposal to Israel. Iran-UAE economic relations are strong, with Dubai serving as a key commercial center for Iranian traders. Iranian banks operate branches in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, facilitating access to international financial markets amid banking sanctions. Dubai's debt challenges and financial bailouts by Abu Dhabi may impact political dynamics. The UAE, under Abu Dhabi's leadership, is moving forward with plans to build nuclear power stations, positioning itself as a counterexample to Iran by forgoing uranium enrichment. However, international support for the UAE's nuclear program has been undermined by concerns over Iran's use of the UAE as a transit hub. Abu Dhabi is also wary of the large Iranian-origin community in Dubai potentially posing a threat to UAE stability. Military cooperation and arms sales are key aspects of UAE's security strategy. The UAE's military cooperation with the U.S. includes hosting naval vessels and using Al Dhafra air base. Arms sales play a crucial role in U.S.-UAE relations, with potential sales of over $19.4 billion in 2007 and 2008. The UAE's relationship with Iran is complex, influenced by economic interdependence, territorial disputes, ethnic differences, and sectarian tensions. The UAE's relationship with Iran is influenced by economic interdependence, territorial disputes, ethnic differences, and sectarian tensions. Emirati authorities allowed public protests at the Iranian consulate in Dubai related to post-election disputes in Iran. The UAE strongly opposes the militarization of Iran's nuclear program and may seek greater security coordination with the Gulf Cooperation Council or the United States for protection. There is a possibility that the UAE could reconsider its decision to forego domestic uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing technology in the future, potentially impacting UAE-U.S. relations. The pending petroleum product sanctions legislation in the U.S. Congress could impact firms in the UAE and U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperation. Kuwait's relationship with Iran has been influenced by concerns about Iraq, with Kuwait viewing Iran as a counterweight to Iraqi power in the Gulf region. Some Gulf neighbors criticized Kuwait for using Iran to weaken Saddam Hussein in the past. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI), formerly known as SCIRI, is a major Shiite party in Iraqi politics. Iran-Kuwait relations are relatively normal, with high-level visits and a joint committee established in 2008. Kuwait supplies gasoline to Iran and is working on resolving their maritime border for joint oil field development. Kuwait has a moderate stance on Iran's nuclear program, committing to comply with UN Security Council Resolutions. Security Council Resolutions, including resolution 1801 with sanctions on Iran, Kuwait's concerns about escalating conflict with Iran, historical tensions with pro-Iranian Iraqi Shiite groups, and past attacks attributed to Iraqi Da'wa Party. During the 1980s, Iran used Iraqi allies to pressure Kuwait to end its support of Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. The United States protected Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attacks in 1987-88. Kuwait's perception changed when Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1990. In 2001, Kuwait publicly apologized for supporting Iraq. Iran and Kuwait have limited trade. Some Kuwaiti strategists question Kuwait's stance towards Iran, believing Iran is seeking Gulf hegemony. Iran is believed to be seeking Gulf hegemony, with some speculating that they are trying to strengthen Shiites in Kuwait. Kuwait named its first ambassador to Iraq since the 1990 invasion, signaling acceptance of Iraq's Shiite dominance. Oman is seen as politically close to Iran and the least critical among Gulf states. Oman, perceived as politically close to Iran, maintains a friendship with Iran while also being allied with the United States. Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said has pursued foreign policies independent of Arab or Gulf consensus. Oman's relationship with Iran has been beneficial to the United States in the past, serving as an intermediary during U.S.-Iran conflicts. However, Oman faced challenges in 1980 when the U.S. used Omani air bases for a mission without prior notification. Observers question why Oman is not as wary of Iran as other Gulf states. Oman's relationship with Iran is unique compared to other GCC states. Oman lacks a sizable Shiite community, reducing fears of Iranian interference. Positive sentiments from the Shah of Iran's military assistance in the past also contribute to Oman's stance. Additionally, Oman sees Iran as a potential counterweight to Saudi Arabia's influence. Oman is reportedly discussing a security pact with Iran and turns a blind eye to smuggling goods to Iran from its Musandam Peninsula. Oman's unique relationship with Iran includes discussions of a security pact and turning a blind eye to smuggling goods to Iran from its Musandam Peninsula. Bilateral trade between Oman and Iran was approximately $1.45 billion in 2008, mostly consisting of natural gas exports from Iran to Oman. Oman's position on Iran's nuclear program aligns with a call for a peaceful solution and opposes any U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran has exerted influence in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein, shaping the post-Saddam political structure to its advantage. However, as Iraq stabilized, Iraqi nationalism grew stronger, leading many Iraqis to view Iran as contributing to sectarian conflict. Iraqi leaders now consider Iran's interests but no longer blindly support Iranian positions. This influence was evident when Iraq announced in December 2009 that it would relocate Iranian oppositionists from \"Camp Ashraf\" near the Iran border. Iraq announced plans to relocate 3,000 Iranian oppositionists from \"Camp Ashraf\" near the Iran border to a detention center in southern Iraq. Iran's attempts to derail a U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement were unsuccessful, with Iranian leaders criticizing the pact as a threat to Iraq's sovereignty. However, the final agreement included provisions to address Iran's concerns. Iran's concerns were addressed in the final agreement between the U.S. and Iraq, which prohibited U.S. forces from using Iraqi territory for attacks on other nations. Iraqi officials acknowledged responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war and signed agreements on military cooperation, but clarified that Iranian training of Iraqi forces would not be included. Iraq's Foreign Minister supported Iran's right to pursue a \"peaceful\" nuclear program. In 2006, Iraq's Foreign Minister supported Iran's right to pursue \"peaceful\" nuclear technology. Iran has not returned 153 Iraqi aircraft taken during the Gulf War. Iraqi officials have refused to expel an Iranian Kurdish separatist group. Territorial disputes were resolved in 2000 regarding the Shatt al Arab waterway border. The water border between Iran and Iraq is subject to interpretation, with efforts to renovate border posts in 2008. Iraq has concerns about Iran's relationship with Shiite factions and militias, particularly Moqtada Al Sadr's ties to Iran. The Sadr clan in Iraq has ties to Iran, with Moqtada Al Sadr's faction having a large following and a militia armed by Iran's Revolutionary Guard. The faction was involved in sectarian killings of Sunnis during the height of conflict in 2005-2006. The sectarian conflict in Iraq escalated after the 2006 bombing of the Al Askari Mosque in Samarra, leading to a backlash against Shiite militias like the JAM and Iran. The 2009 provincial elections saw a setback for Iran as Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's slate, which ran on a platform of rule of law, came in first in most Shiite provinces, while the Sadrist faction and ISCI performed poorly. The Sadrist faction and ISCI have formed a coalition to compete against Maliki in the 2010 national elections. The Defense Department's report expresses concern about Iran's support for Shiite militias in Iraq, stating that Iran poses a significant challenge to Iraq's stability and political independence. The Iraqi government maintains a close relationship with Iran, with multiple high-level visits and agreements signed between the two countries. Iran has provided financial assistance for various projects in Iraq, leading to a significant increase in bilateral trade. Iran's influence in Iraq remains substantial, but could be decreasing as Shiite militias weaken. If Maliki's coalition wins the upcoming election, Iraq may assert independence from both U.S. and Iranian influences. Experts predict Iran's influence will diminish as Iraq asserts its nationhood and security improves. The security situation in Iraq is relatively stable, but concerns arise as U.S. forces draw down. There are fears that Shiite militias and Sunni insurgent groups may challenge stability. If the U.S. withdraws and security deteriorates, Iranian influence could increase. Turkey and Iran have a long border with a history of conflict and collaboration. After Iran declared itself an Islamic Republic in 1979, Turkey's pragmatic policy of recognizing the new regime and focusing on economic relations improved relations between the two countries. The ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey, with Islamist roots, follows a foreign policy of seeking good relations with all neighbors, including Iran, based on self-interest and economic benefits. Since AKP came to power in 2002, Turkish-Iranian relations have expanded markedly with numerous visits exchanged between officials. The AKP government hosted Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad in Istanbul in August 2008, bypassing his antipathy to Turkish secularism. Turkish President Abdullah Gul reciprocated by visiting Iran for a regional summit in March 2009. Turkey's pragmatism was evident in their reactions to Iran's 2009 presidential election. President Gul and Prime Minister Erdogan congratulated Ahmadinejad on his re-election, with Foreign Minister Davutoglu stating that controversies were an internal Iranian affair. Critics within Turkey expressed concerns that these actions may have undermined Turkey's credibility. Erdogan emphasized the strong friendship between Turkey and Iran, with both countries working together to preserve regional stability and prevent the division of Iraq into ethnic states. Turkey and Iran are working together to prevent the division of Iraq into ethnic states and combat separatist threats from groups like the PKK and PJAK. Turkish officials are encouraging Iraqi Kurds to have a greater role in Baghdad to counter Iranian influence and moderate separatist inclinations. Ankara supports Iran's right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes but calls for cooperation with the IAEA to ensure peaceful intentions. Prime Minister Erdogan has criticized Iran's nuclear program. Prime Minister Erdogan criticizes the international community for targeting Iran's nuclear program while ignoring Israel's nuclear arsenal. He advocates for a diplomatic solution to the Iran dispute and warns against a military attack, calling it \"an insanity.\" Erdogan also warns Israel of a strong response if it uses Turkish airspace for aggression. Turkey's decision to cancel Israel's participation in a NATO military exercise was influenced by public anti-Israel sentiment and concerns about Israel rehearsing near the Iranian border. Turkey opposes sanctions on Iran due to economic interests and abstained from voting on sanctions in November 2009. Despite disagreements on how to address Iran's nuclear ambitions, Turkey maintains its stance. Turkey prioritizes access to Iran's energy resources to reduce dependence on Russia. Economic ties between Turkey and Iran are strong, with trade reaching $10 billion annually in 2008. Plans to increase trade to $30 billion a year are in place, with a gas pipeline already in operation. In 2007, Turkey and Iran signed an MOU for TPAO to develop natural gas fields in South Pars and transport gas via a new pipeline to Turkey. The pipeline is part of the Nabucco project to carry gas from the Caspian/Central Asian region to Austria, bypassing Russia. Iran's gas could make Nabucco more viable if Russia dissuades Central Asian states from using it. Turkey and Iran have formed a joint company to transfer gas to Europe, but European partners in Nabucco have stated they won't accept Iranian gas until the nuclear issue is resolved. The US does not support Iran's participation in the project. Turkey opposes energy-related sanctions on Iran due to its energy needs and has signed an MOU to build power plants in Iran and import electricity. They also plan to establish a transportation network and a free industrial zone on their border. Turkish officials have expressed security concerns. Turkey has security concerns about a nuclear-armed Iran due to its proximity and missile range. This has led to the possible purchase of U.S. Patriot air defense missiles. Prime Minister Erdogan and President Gul criticize the West's policy on Iran, citing double standards compared to Israel. Erdogan has called for all countries with nuclear weapons to disarm. Turkey and Iran have common security concerns about Kurdish separatists, leading to joint military operations. President Gul emphasizes the need for Western understanding of Iran's security fears and Iran's peaceful nuclear research. Cooperation in counterterrorism between Turkey and Iran is expected to continue. Turkey may consult with Arab Sunni powers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions. As a NATO member, Turkey could rely on defense guarantees or develop its own nuclear program. Ankara aims to maintain good relations with Tehran while pursuing nuclear power plants. The Obama Administration sees Iran as potentially helpful in stabilizing Afghanistan. The Obama Administration views Iran as potentially helpful in stabilizing Afghanistan, with a focus on regional cooperation. Iran's key interests in Afghanistan include exerting influence in western Afghanistan and protecting the Shiite minority. Iran has provided significant assistance to Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban. Iran is a top financial donor to Afghanistan, supporting economic development. Iran did not oppose Karzai's decision to fire Ismail Khan in 2004. However, Iran is concerned about the US using the Shindand air base in Herat Province. Karzai emphasized that Afghanistan should not be a battleground for US-Iran competition. Karzai has referred to Iran as a \"friend\" of Afghanistan due to economic development work by Iranian firms. In 2009, Karzai and Ahmadinejad exchanged congratulations for their respective controversial re-elections. They have also collaborated on regional issues through a tripartite summit process with Pakistan. Disputes have arisen over Iran's expulsion of Afghan refugees, with tensions escalating in 2007 when 50,000 were expelled. About 300,000 Afghan refugees have returned from Iran since the fall of the Taliban. Iran has been providing weapons to selected Taliban members in Afghanistan, including mortars, rockets, grenades, and explosives. The United States has expressed strong objections to Iran's actions, fearing that Iran is trying to build influence with armed opposition factions in Afghanistan to retaliate against the U.S. in case of conflict. Iran has been providing weapons to selected Taliban members in Afghanistan, including mortars, rockets, grenades, and explosives. U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry stated that Iran has provided training assistance and weapons to the Taliban, despite Iran's historical support for non-Pashtun factions in Afghanistan. This aid puzzles experts as it could strain Iran's relations with the Afghan government. Iran drew closer to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan after Taliban forces captured Herat in 1995, providing fuel, funds, and ammunition. Tensions escalated in 1998 when Iranian diplomats were killed by the Taliban, leading to a potential conflict that was averted. Iran offered assistance during the U.S.-led war against the Taliban but is viewed as a marginal player due to its links to non-Pashtuns and Taliban fighters. Iran's links to Taliban fighters in Afghanistan are seen as tenuous and sporadic, with doubts on whether engaging with Iran would solve core issues. Talks with Iran could potentially lead to broader discussions or using Iran as a supply line for NATO forces. Secretary of State Clinton invited Iran to a meeting on Afghanistan in 2009, but the Obama Administration may reconsider engagement due to Iran's internal opposition and nuclear program concerns. Egypt and Iran have a history of rivalry, with Egypt aligning with the Soviet Union during the Cold War and Iran with the US. However, after the Camp David Peace Accords and the Iranian revolution, their regional allegiances shifted. Egypt's peace treaty with Israel strengthened its relationship with the US, while Iran developed closer ties with Russia. This dynamic has persisted for over 30 years. The rivalry between Egypt and Iran dates back over 30 years, with new dimensions added in recent years. Iran severed diplomatic ties with Egypt in 1980 due to objections over Egypt's peace treaty with Israel and support for Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war. Egypt is currently concerned about Iran's support for Palestinian militants, Hamas's control of the Gaza Strip, and Iran's nuclear program. Egypt's foreign policy is challenged by Hamas's armed resistance against Israel and alleged Iranian support. Egypt opposes Iran's nuclear ambitions and calls for a \"nuclear-free zone\" in the Middle East. Despite announcing plans for a civilian nuclear energy program in 2006, progress has been slow. Egypt's slow progress in developing a nuclear energy program is suspected to be driven by concerns over Iran's nuclear weapons quest. Egypt and Iran engaged in dialogue between 2007 and 2008, possibly to improve bilateral relations and draw attention from the Bush Administration. Iran's charm offensive towards Sunni Arab states may have influenced Egypt's initiative. In 2007-2008, Egypt and Iran engaged in dialogue to improve relations and draw attention from the Bush Administration. High-level talks were held between Egyptian and Iranian officials, but the rapprochement was short-lived due to unresolved differences. An Iranian group re-edited a documentary on the murder of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in July 2008. In 2008, an old Al Jazeera documentary on the murder of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was re-edited and released as \"Execution of a Pharaoh,\" portraying Sadat's assassin positively. This led to tensions between Egypt and Iran, with warnings from Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmad Abu-al Ghayt against Iranian interference in internal affairs. Despite cool relations, the countries had limited economic ties, but tensions escalated in 2009 with the discovery of an alleged Hezbollah military cell in Egypt. On April 8, 2009, Egypt uncovered a Hezbollah \"cell\" planning terrorist attacks in Sinai tourist resorts frequented by Israelis. The cell was also accused of smuggling weapons to Hamas and spreading \"Shi'ite ideology\" in Egypt. Hezbollah's chief confirmed one of the plotters was sent for reconnaissance. This revelation serves Egypt's interests by highlighting Iran's regional meddling and potentially rallying other moderate Arab states against it. Egypt hopes to rally moderate Arab states against Iran's regional meddling, targeting Iran's Arab allies. Tensions with Iran eased by the end of 2009, with positive economic relations discussed between Iranian and Egyptian leaders. Iran and Egypt shared the view that Israel was the main enemy in the Islamic world. Iran and Egypt have different ways of implementing their strategy regarding the Palestinian cause. During a meeting, Larijani proposed to improve Iranian-Arab relations with a new approach. Analysts are skeptical of Iran's proposal, suggesting it may be a charm offensive. Egypt feels threatened by Iran's nuclear program and support for Hamas and Hezbollah but a direct confrontation is unlikely. Egypt will work to counterbalance Iranian policy using non-state actors, while rallying Sunni Arab states to keep Iran in check. Iran and Egypt have different approaches to the Palestinian cause. Egypt aims to counterbalance Iran's influence by rallying Sunni Arab states, while Iran builds its alliance with Syria to strengthen its \"axis of resistance\" against Israel and the United States. The Syrian-Iranian partnership has evolved over the years, with Syria now playing a subordinate role in the alliance. The \"axis of resistance\" led by non-state proxies Hezbollah and Hamas is gaining power in the region. Analysts debate the permanence of the Syrian-Iranian alliance, with some suggesting Syria may shift towards peace if a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict arises. However, others argue that the alliance is deeply rooted in shared geopolitical interests and may not easily change. Despite Syria's military and economic weaknesses, its support for militant groups gives it a significant regional role. Syria's regional role is significant due to its alliances with Iran and Hezbollah. The Asad regime's main focus is to control Lebanon, viewing it as an extension of a greater Syrian nation. Without Hezbollah, Syria would struggle to exert influence in Lebanese politics. Syria's partnership with Hezbollah is crucial for influencing Lebanese politics and valuable to Iran as well. Syria allows Iran to use its territory for weapons shipments to Hezbollah, giving Iran power in the Levant and a proxy to threaten Israel. Israeli accusations in 2009 highlighted Syria's role as an Iranian conduit for weapons to Hezbollah. Iran has expanded its trade and investment in Syria, including the establishment of a joint Iranian-Syrian bank and car assembly plants. Iranian companies have also invested in concrete production, power generation, and urban transportation in Syria. Iran, Syria, Iran, Venezuela, and Malaysia established a joint petroleum refinery in Homs, Syria, and reached a new natural gas deal. Despite low overall trade volume, Syrian-Iranian relations are expected to remain strong, with enduring ties and a defense cooperation agreement signed in December 2009. In October 2009, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia visited Syria, signaling a potential improvement in Saudi-Syrian relations. This visit could lead to increased Saudi investment in Syria. Tensions may have arisen between Iran and Syria over Syrian peace talks with Israel. Syria's attendance at the 2007 Annapolis peace conference was seen as a move to pursue its own interests. According to a report by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Iranian officials have warned the Assad regime about peace talks with Israel. The Saudi media has highlighted tensions in Iranian-Syrian relations, with Syrian President Bashar al Asad's visit to Tehran in 2008 being seen as a failure in reassuring Iran. The Iranian concerns during Syrian-Israeli negotiations led to a failed visit by Syrian President al Asad. The future of the Syrian-Iranian alliance may hinge on Hezbollah's ability to balance its anti-Israel agenda with Lebanese national interests and Shiite constituents' interests. Critics have accused Hezbollah of causing chaos in Lebanon, especially after the 2006 war with Israel. Hezbollah's ties to Iran and Syria are a subject of debate, with some suggesting the group seeks more independence. Despite being a hybrid organization with various capabilities, for Hezbollah to become non-violent, a Lebanese-Israeli peace treaty would be necessary. Since 1982, Lebanon's Shiite population has relied on Iran for support and backing. Iran's involvement in Lebanon dates back to the civil war, with Ayatollah Khomeini reaching out to Lebanon's Shiites during the Israeli invasion in 1982. Iran's support for Lebanese Shiites during the civil war in 1982 led to the formation of Hezbollah, a terrorist organization. This partnership between Iran and Hezbollah continues to be mutually beneficial, with Iran providing funding and military support to pressure Israel and the United States. Despite changes in Lebanon's politics after the Syrian withdrawal in 2005, Iranian support for Shiites in Lebanon remains consistent. Iran's policy towards Iran has remained unchanged, with Iranian support for Shiites in Lebanon, particularly Hezbollah, countering Saudi Arabian support for Sunni groups. Lebanon's consensus government necessitates maintaining friendly relations with all regional actors to preserve political balance. Some argue that Iran filled the power vacuum left by Syria's withdrawal, while others believe Hezbollah's influence waned after the 2009 elections. Regardless, as long as Shiites, especially Hezbollah, have a stake in Lebanese politics, the government will likely remain friendly. The Lebanese government, regardless of its composition, is expected to maintain a friendly orientation towards Iran. Trade between Iran and Lebanon is limited, with an estimated value of $192 million in 2007 and $247 million in 2008. Both countries have established a joint economic commission to enhance economic cooperation. Iranian support for Hezbollah, although not officially included in trade statistics, is believed to be substantial. Former Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora emphasized the potential for growth in various sectors of cooperation between the two countries. Iran's support for Hezbollah is substantial, with $600 million in aid announced before Lebanon's 2009 elections. Iran aims to increase influence among non-Shiites in Lebanon. Many Lebanese view Hezbollah as the best defense against Israel. Iran offered arms and financial support to the Lebanese Armed Forces before the elections, but no official agreement was reached. Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has expanded its role in Lebanese politics since the civil war ended in 1990. Analysts fear Hezbollah's growing strength and its ability to disrupt Western interests in the region. Concerns arise about stability in Lebanon and the region if Hezbollah gains access to an Iranian nuclear device. Sunnis and some Christians in Lebanon share similar fears. The national memory of the civil war shapes Lebanese politics, with worries that any shift in power balance could lead to conflict. The power shift in Lebanon raises concerns of potential regional conflict, especially if international efforts to curb Iran's nuclear program fail or if Israel takes military action against Iran. Iran's support for the Palestinian cause since the 1979 Islamic Revolution is seen as a strategic move to establish itself as a leader in Islamic principles. Iran's support for the Palestinian cause is strategic, aiming to establish itself as a leader in Islamic principles. The Palestinians have historically been ambivalent about openly accepting Iranian support, preferring to engage with Sunni Arab leaders and the West. Iran refocused its efforts on influencing Palestinian groups that rejected engagement with Israel after Arafat's engagement with Israel through the Oslo \"peace process.\" Iran refocused its efforts on influencing Palestinian groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, seeking to disrupt peace efforts with Israel. Hamas has gained significant influence, challenging Arafat's Fatah movement. Mahmoud Abbas opposes Iranian interference in Palestinian politics, seeing it as divisive. Iran's support for militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah complicates Abbas's task of uniting Palestinians against Israel. Iran's support for militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah complicates Abbas's task of uniting Palestinians against Israel. Some Palestinians see Iranian support as leverage with Israel that the US and Europe cannot provide. Hamas welcomes Iranian assistance, but many believe that Hamas and Iran's anti-Western and anti-Israel positions may not align with Palestinian interests. Iran's support for Hamas is complex due to their anti-Western and anti-Israel positions. Despite differences, Hamas and Iran maintain ties, with Iran's influence over Palestinian politics linked to Hamas's success since the late 1980s. Hamas seeks popular support through resistance to Israel while balancing its image as a Palestinian offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood rather than an Iranian proxy. Hamas seeks legitimacy by establishing its indispensability in Arab-Israeli politics, aiming for leadership in the PA and PLO. Despite a decline in popularity post-Gaza takeover, Hamas aims to maintain its image as a resistance movement. Palestinians are questioning Hamas's integrity and commitment to their best interests due to governance realities and controversial practices. Abbas and Fatah aim to regain influence in Gaza and neutralize Hamas as a peace process spoiler through international support for a Palestinian state and unity discussions with Hamas. Various U.S. and international policymakers, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, suggest potential organizational fissures within Hamas, particularly between its Gaza-based and exiled leadership in Damascus, Syria. Some believe exploiting these fissures by offering incentives for moderation could reduce Hamas's dependence on Iran. Others argue that Hamas benefits from the perception of division, allowing flexibility in dealing with Western actors and Syrian/Iranian allies. The Gaza Strip remains a focal point for concerns over Iranian influence. The Gaza Strip is a key area of concern for Iranian influence due to possible smuggling of weapons and cash, along with training for Hamas militants. Iran contributes $20-30 million annually to Hamas, supplementing funds from other sources. The leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon stated in 2009 that they have been providing military assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. Hezbollah has also influenced Hamas, with Hamas acknowledging Iran's significant support. The conflict in Gaza in 2008-2009 resulted in civilian casualties, displacement, and infrastructure destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict in Gaza in 2008-2009, there are dilemmas over reconstruction, supporting the people, weakening Hamas's control, and ending smuggling. Various proposals include opening border crossings for commerce, coordinated anti-smuggling operations, and Iranian involvement in smuggling. Iran has suggested its own reconstruction plans and claims to be providing funds to Gazans. Iran has proposed its own reconstruction plans and claims to be distributing funds to Gazans affected by the conflict, reflecting Iranian ambition to compete for patronage and support among Palestinians and other Arabs. The outcome of Iranian influence on the Palestinians may hinge on events in the coming months, including popular unrest in Iran post the 2009 elections. The strategic approach towards the Iranian-Palestinian linkage by the United States and Israel remains uncertain, with the Obama Administration suggesting progress in the Arab-Israeli peace process could help counter Iran's influence. The United States' focus on advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process could intensify due to Iran's internal political discord complicating direct U.S.-Iran diplomacy. Concerns about Iran's unpredictability may lead to a \"wait-and-see\" attitude, potentially ceding the initiative to Palestinian militants or Hezbollah. Hamas may be adopting a conciliatory tone, possibly influenced by Barack Obama's presidency. Since Barack Obama became President, Hamas may be cultivating an image of reasonableness due to diplomatic changes and Israeli deterrence. Some skeptics believe Hamas's positions remain unchanged, viewing their statements as a ploy for moderation. Israel had good relations with Iran until 1979, providing weapons and training to the Shah. Israel had good relations with Iran until 1979, providing weapons and training to the Shah. Iran later rejected Israel's right to exist and ended bilateral cooperation, leading to tensions between the two countries. Israel initially viewed Iraq as a greater threat but later perceived Iran as a threat due to its support for Hezbollah, which targeted Americans, Israelis, and Jews. Hezbollah, supported by Iran, poses a threat to Americans, Israelis, and Jews. Israel sees Iran as an existential threat due to its anti-Israel rhetoric, nuclear ambitions, and potential to provide nuclear weapons to terrorists. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear capabilities. Binyamin Netanyahu expressed concerns about Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, stating that it poses a threat to security, peace in the Middle East, and global stability. He emphasized that thwarting Iran's nuclear ambitions would strengthen peace efforts and weaken extremist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. The fate of Iran's nuclear program is crucial for achieving peace in the Middle East. Israel's top priority is to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Netanyahu aims to build an international coalition to increase sanctions on Iran and protect Israel's security interests. Israel is pushing for harsher measures, including military action, if Iran refuses to stop uranium enrichment. Additionally, Israel is working to persuade Russia and China to support tougher U.N. sanctions and prevent Russia from selling advanced anti-aircraft missiles to Iran. Netanyahu endorsed a U.S. proposal for Iran to move enriched uranium outside of the country as a first step in addressing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Israel's Defense Minister expressed concerns about the agreement, stating that it only delays Iran's progress in uranium enrichment. Israelis viewed the agreement as a retreat from their demand for Iran to halt all uranium enrichment activities. Israeli officials, skeptical of the Obama Administration's outreach to Iran, prioritize the Iranian threat over the Arab-Israeli peace process. They emphasize the need for a short, well-defined engagement with Iran followed by sanctions, keeping military action as an option. Concerns about a potential Palestinian state vulnerable to Iranian influence lead to fears of \"Hamastan\" on Israel's borders. Israel views Iran as a threat due to its support of Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah, which poses a security risk. Israel wants Egypt and the United Nations to stop the smuggling of Iranian arms into Gaza and Lebanon. Israel has seized ships smuggling Iranian weapons multiple times to prevent this threat. Israel believes that an Iran possessing nuclear arms would threaten its security and existence. It is willing to engage in dialogue with Tehran to halt uranium enrichment, but if unsuccessful, expects rapid sanctions. President Obama's deadline for Iran to comply with nuclear demands has passed without action. Israel is prepared to take armed action against Iran's nuclear program if diplomacy fails, as shown by past military actions and exercises. In June and July 2009, Israel deployed a submarine and warships through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea, possibly in preparation for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Israel has also strengthened its defenses against an Iranian attack by developing and testing the Arrow anti-ballistic missile. In October 2009, Israel and the United States conducted a large joint military exercise called Juniper Cobra to integrate their weapons and air-defense systems. Juniper Cobra was a joint military exercise between the U.S. and Israel to test their air-defense systems and interoperability. Experts believe that an Israeli strike on Iran would be complex and risky due to potential asymmetric retaliation and logistical challenges. Some analysts doubt the effectiveness of a strike in significantly setting back Iran's nuclear program. Experts believe that an Israeli strike on Iran would be complex and risky due to potential asymmetric retaliation and logistical challenges. Some doubt the effectiveness of a strike in significantly setting back Iran's nuclear program. Israel would likely inform and consult with the U.S. before attacking Iran, considering the close relations between the two countries. There are differing opinions on the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran to Israel, with some suggesting that Israel should accept the possibility and focus on other concerns. Iran's neighbors in the Caspian Sea region include Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, with Russia being the dominant player in relations with Iran. Russia is the dominant player in relations with Iran, with Armenia and Kazakhstan aligning themselves with Russian policy. Iran has a significant population of Azerbaijanis and Armenians. Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan leaders embrace Islam but are hostile towards Islamic fundamentalism. The majority of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan's population are Sunni Muslims, while Azerbaijan has a Shiia majority. Most Russian citizens in the Caspian region are Russian Orthodox Christians, with some being Sunni or Sufi Muslims. Iran has traditionally had friendly relations with Armenia. Iran has friendly relations with Armenia and opposes Turkish and Azerbaijani interests in the region. Armenia's trade with Iran is crucial due to closed borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan. Iran remains neutral in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno Karabakh but Shiite fundamentalists urge solidarity with Shiites in Azerbaijan. Armenia's energy security is a concern due to reliance on gas shipments from Russia through Georgia. Iran's relations with Azerbaijan have been complicated by issues such as border disputes, security ties with the United States, and trade relations with Armenia. Some in Azerbaijan question Iran's support for their sovereignty, as Azerbaijan's independence stirs aspirations for greater rights among ethnic cohorts in Iran. Iran's efforts to improve relations with Azerbaijan may be influenced by its acrimony with the United States. Iran limits trans-Azerbaijani contacts to discourage ethnic consciousness among \"Southern Azerbaijanis.\" Some Azerbaijanis advocate for greater rights inspired by Kurdish ethnic rights in post-Saddam Iraq. Azerbaijan accuses Iran of fostering Islamic fundamentalism among Shiia population. Tensions rise over Iran's arrests of Azerbaijani civil rights advocates and separatists. Azerbaijani-Iranian relations strained by convictions in Azerbaijan for collaborating with Iran. In 2007, fifteen individuals in Azerbaijan were convicted of collaborating with the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps for planning a coup and carrying out terror operations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry denied involvement, blaming Israel and the United States for harming Azerbaijani-Iranian relations. In 2008, six individuals were arrested for collaborating with Iran and Hizballah to attack the Israeli embassy in Baku, further straining relations. Azerbaijan made efforts to improve relations with Iran in 2009, possibly influenced by Armenia-Turkey rapprochement. Azerbaijan agreed to boost gas exports to Iran in November 2009, possibly influenced by Armenia-Turkey rapprochement. Russia's ties with Iran involve cooperation and competition, driven by Russia's desire for international prominence, trade links to the Persian Gulf, and countering U.S. influence in the Middle East. Russia's arms sales and nuclear technology transfers to Iran have raised regional and international concerns. Russia's cooperation with Iran's civilian nuclear program has been influenced by various factors. Despite concerns about Iran's nuclear activities, Russia signed an agreement in 1995 to assist with a nuclear power plant in Bushehr. However, after Iran's clandestine nuclear program was revealed in 2002, Russia withheld nuclear fuel for the Bushehr reactor until an agreement was reached in 2005. This cooperation is seen as a way for Russia to maintain its international prominence and counter U.S. influence in the region. In 2005, Russia agreed to return spent reactor fuel to Iran for reprocessing. Russia also supported limited U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran's nuclear activities. Iran disclosed a second uranium enrichment plant near Qom in 2009, raising concerns about nuclear weapon intentions. Iran agreed to an IAEA inspection of the Qom plant in late October 2009. In late October 2009, Iran agreed to an IAEA inspection of the Qom enrichment site. The IAEA found the plant in an advanced stage of completion, raising concerns about hidden nuclear facilities. Russia mediated with Iran to accept a fuel deal for the Tehran Research Reactor, but Iran rejected it in November 2009. Russia delayed the start-up of the Bushehr reactor, possibly pressuring Iran. In December 2009, Russia opposed additional U.N. sanctions on Iran. Russia opposed additional U.N. sanctions on Iran, citing lack of evidence of Iran's intention to produce nuclear weapons. Iran and Russia have clashed over the Caspian Sea's status, with Iran isolated in its call for common ownership or 20% control by each littoral state. Iran also disagreed with Russia on joint naval task forces and objected to Russia's offer to the U.S. to use a radar site in Azerbaijan for tracking missile launches from Iran. In 2007, the Gabala radar site in Azerbaijan was made available for tracking missile launches from Iran. Iran's opposition to settling the legal status of the Caspian Sea is linked to its resistance to trans-Caspian oil and gas pipelines from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan. Kazakhstan proposes a median-line delineation of Caspian Sea borders to Iran, offering energy pipelines and enhanced trade as incentives. Turkmenistan shows interest in settling sea borders for a potential trans-Caspian gas pipeline. Iran expressed strong opposition to the exclusion from energy cooperation talks among Caspian littoral states, warning against energy exploration in disputed areas. Iran has significant trade relations with its Caspian neighbors, particularly with Russia. In 2007, a gas pipeline was inaugurated between Iran and Armenia. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad inaugurated an 88-mile gas pipeline from Tabriz in Iran to Kadjaran in Armenia. The second section, a 123-mile pipeline from Kadjaran to Ararat, was completed in December 2008 by the Russian-controlled ArmRosGazprom joint venture. Initial gas deliveries are 10.6-14.1 billion cubic feet per year, with plans for more in the future. Some gas will be used for electricity in Iran and Georgia, potentially meeting all of Armenia's needs and reducing dependence on Russian gas. Iran has advocated for Azerbaijan to cooperate in building energy pipelines. In 2009, Azerbaijan and Iran signed agreements to boost Azerbaijani gas exports. Azerbaijan's SOCOR energy firm held talks with Gazprom on refurbishing a gas pipeline to facilitate a Russian gas swap with Iran. Turkmenistan opened a gas pipeline to Iran in 1997, providing 282.5 bcf of gas. Russia and Iran agreed to build a second gas pipeline in July 2009 to increase gas shipments. Iran resumed gas shipments from Turkmenistan in late April 2008 after agreeing to a price boost. Observers believe Iran will continue to build good relations with Caspian regional states and prevent the export of Islamic extremism. All Caspian littoral states have pledged not to allow the establishment of airbases for operations against each other. Iran's relations with Azerbaijan may become strained if civil dissent among ethnic Azerbaijanis increases. Analysts predict continued uneasy cooperation between Iran and Russia as long as they both see the US as a major opponent. Russia is aiming to reduce US influence in the Caspian region, potentially leading to increased tension with Iran over various issues. The security situation in Afghanistan could also worsen, contributing to further instability in the region. The Obama Administration pursued engagement with Iran through the P5+1 framework to address concerns about its nuclear program. Initial talks were seen as positive, but prospects for an agreement diminished over time. The United States, Israel, and the EU set a deadline for Iran to demonstrate cooperation by the end of 2009. The Obama Administration set a deadline for Iran to cooperate on the nuclear issue by the end of 2009. With no progress made, the Administration is now considering pursuing a fourth round of sanctions through the U.N. Security Council, targeting the ruling elite in Tehran. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of targeting decision-makers in Iran with sanctions. The final course of action is still under discussion. The U.S. is interested in engaging with Iran while considering sanctions. Actions by the Obama Administration, Congress, and international community, as well as Iran's reactions, will impact U.S. interests in the region. Questions remain about U.S. and international efforts to address Iran's uranium enrichment program and the effectiveness of sanctions in deterring Iran's nuclear ambitions. Most analysts agree that sanctions are the logical next step in addressing Iran's nuclear program. If sanctions fail, the U.S. and international community may need to consider the costs of a preemptive strike. The policies pursued by the U.S. and international community will impact regional approaches towards Iran and other interests in the Middle East. Attention is focused on European countries' response to sanctions and the possibility of Russia and China joining international efforts. Iran's strong economic relations with neighbors could be affected by international sanctions. Neighbors like UAE, Turkey, and Armenia rely on Iran for energy resources, which could force them to choose between cooperation with the international community and their own economic interests. Engagement and sanctions are aimed at easing tensions over Iran's nuclear program, seen as crucial for preventing a new war in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Obama Administration have not ruled out military action. The deadline for Iran to cooperate with the international community on the nuclear issue is approaching, causing nervousness among Iran's Arab neighbors, who weigh the risks of a regional war against a nuclear Iran. Some fear that a conflict between Iran and Israel could lead to regional instability and a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which goes against the Obama Administration's vision of a world without nuclear weapons. Regional states are concerned about avoiding conflicts with Iran and the potential for military action. The Obama Administration aims for a world without nuclear weapons and seeks to reduce strategic warheads and missiles. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's mention of a \"defense umbrella\" for Gulf states raised concerns about a nuclear Iran and the risk of a regional arms race. Iran's neighbors are upgrading their military forces as a deterrent, while Iraq is reequipping its military."
