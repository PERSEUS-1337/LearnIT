    "content": "Over the past few decades, attention to \"emerging contaminants\" in surface water and groundwater has been increasing. These contaminants, which include manmade and naturally occurring substances, can enter the environment through various sources like wastewater discharges and storm runoff. The presence of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) in waterways is a growing concern as treatment facilities may not effectively remove them. Limited data on CECs' concentration, pervasiveness, and toxicity hinders risk assessment. Detection of CECs has prompted government action, especially regarding per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This has sparked discussions on identifying, detecting, and regulating CECs to protect human health and the environment. Several statutes, including the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, are involved in addressing this issue. In the 116th Congress, over 40 bills have been introduced to address PFAS contamination through various means, including directing the EPA to take regulatory actions under environmental statutes like the Clean Water Act. Global concern is also rising over microplastics as Contaminants of Emerging Concern in waterways. Recent studies have shown that wastewater treatment plants and agricultural sites are key sources of microplastics, which are not typically screened for in treatment facilities. Congress has taken steps to address plastic pollution, such as banning plastic microbeads in rinse-off personal care products. Some stakeholders believe that the EPA could do more to address the issue. The EPA has various authorities under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to address Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs), but faces challenges in doing so. The CWA aims to maintain water quality by prohibiting pollutant discharge without a permit. One method to protect water quality is through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes EPA and states to set limits on pollutants in NPDES permits through technology-based effluent limitations and water-quality-based effluent limitations. Technology-based limits are minimum control levels, while water-quality-based limits aim to achieve water quality standards in receiving waters. The Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes EPA to set technology-based effluent limitations for point sources to achieve water quality standards in receiving waters. EPA can designate contaminants as toxic pollutants or hazardous substances, triggering additional actions under the CWA and CERCLA. The Clean Water Act (CWA) allows EPA to set technology-based effluent limitations for point sources based on specific pollutant levels. NPDES permittees are classified as either publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) or non-POTWs. POTWs must meet secondary treatment standards, while non-POTWs must achieve specified control levels. The Clean Water Act (CWA) requires non-POTW dischargers to meet control levels based on whether they directly or indirectly discharge into water of the United States. EPA publishes Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards (ELGs) for non-POTW dischargers, setting minimum standards for pollutants in industrial wastewater. ELGs have been developed for 59 industrial categories since 1972. States or EPA incorporate ELG limits into NPDES permits for direct dischargers, while pretreatment standards are established for indirect dischargers to prevent pass through and interference. The Clean Water Act requires EPA to review existing Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) annually for possible revisions. EPA's 2002 draft Strategy for National Clean Water Industrial Regulations outlines a process for identifying ELGs that may need revision and developing new ELGs for industrial categories discharging toxic pollutants. EPA considers factors like pollutant type and amount when prioritizing ELGs for revision. The EPA considers factors such as pollutant type, discharge amount, availability of treatment technology, cost, and opportunity for innovation when revising Effluent Limitation Guidelines for industrial categories. EPA uses screening-level analyses to rank categories based on these factors. The EPA uses various data sources to rank industrial categories based on wastewater toxicity. Additional sources are used to identify new pollutants, industrial process changes, and potential contaminants of emerging concern. Detailed reviews may lead to new guidelines. EPA's most recent Effluent Guidelines Program Plan was published in April 2018, identifying a new rulemaking for the Steam Electric Power industry. The EPA's Effluent Guidelines Program Plan, published in April 2018, identified a new rulemaking for the Steam Electric Power industry. It also announced three new studies on oil and gas extraction wastewater, nutrients, and PFAS. EPA and states have authority to address contaminants through technology-based effluent limitations or NPDES permits. EPA can add contaminants to the Toxic Pollutant List when developing ELGs for industrial categories. EPA may conduct a cross-industry review of pollutants like PFAS and nutrients to prioritize further study for developing or revising Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs). If new ELGs are needed, EPA can initiate a rulemaking process. The Clean Water Act allows EPA and states to impose technology-based effluent limits in NPDES permits on a case-by-case basis when ELGs are not applicable. The Clean Water Act allows EPA to impose technology-based effluent limits in NPDES permits on a case-by-case basis when ELGs are not applicable. EPA can designate contaminants as toxic pollutants, triggering other actions under the CWA and CERCLA. EPA is authorized to designate toxic pollutants and establish requirements for them through ELGs. EPA is directed by the Clean Water Act to establish requirements for toxic pollutants based on their properties. The initial list of 65 toxic pollutants was adopted in 1978 and has generally remained unchanged. EPA must consider various factors when revising the list, and is authorized to develop effluent limitations for listed pollutants using the best available technology. The EPA has the authority to develop effluent limitations for any pollutant, regardless of whether it is on the Toxic Pollutant List. Adding a pollutant to the list triggers additional requirements for states when reviewing water quality standards. EPA and states face challenges in addressing Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) through technology-based effluent limitations, requiring extensive supporting information for developing or updating ELGs. When developing or updating ELGs, the EPA needs extensive supporting information, including identifying pollutants of concern, evaluating their levels and sources, and determining treatability and available treatment technologies. The agency struggles to keep pace with new chemicals in commerce, leading to a reactive approach in addressing CECs. Identifying and documenting efficient treatment technologies is challenging, especially in terms of economic feasibility for industries. The EPA faces challenges in collecting data and determining the need for new or revised ELGs due to limited resources and staffing levels. Analytical methods for measuring emerging contaminants are often lacking, and data on contaminant levels in dischargers' effluent and receiving waters is limited. The agency's capacity to collect data is constrained, impacting the time it takes to issue regulations. The EPA faces challenges in issuing effluent guidelines due to limited resources and staffing levels. The time to issue regulations varies, with some taking up to six years. Water quality standards are set to protect or improve water quality in the United States. States must adopt these standards, subject to EPA approval. Water quality standards for surface waters in the United States consist of designated uses, criteria, and an antidegradation policy. States have the authority to adopt, review, and revise these standards, with EPA oversight. Criteria prescribe limits on pollutants to support designated uses. States must review their standards every three years, and EPA also reviews them. The EPA and states have roles in establishing water quality criteria under the Clean Water Act. EPA develops criteria reflecting scientific knowledge for states to use in developing their own standards. Criteria include human health, aquatic life, and recreational criteria, with guidelines for deriving them. States must review their standards every three years. EPA also reviews them. The EPA provides guidelines for states to adjust water quality criteria to local conditions or develop their own criteria. The human health criteria were last updated in 2015, with revisions to 94 out of 122 criteria. The methodology for deriving human health criteria was last updated in 2000. The national recommended aquatic life criteria table includes 58 criteria, with two new criteria published in the past 10 years. The guidelines for deriving aquatic life criteria have not been updated since 1985, but allow for best professional judgment in recent criteria development. EPA initiated the guidelines revision process in 2015 but has shifted focus to determine if available data support developing human health criteria for PFAS. They plan to use gathered information for the revision and are not bound by the 1985 guidelines due to the best professional judgment clause. EPA's recreational water quality criteria are national recommendations for all waters with primary contact recreation, aiming to protect against illness. EPA establishes recreational water quality criteria to protect against illness caused by organisms in water bodies. In 2012, EPA updated its criteria, and in 2019, published criteria for algal toxins. States use EPA's criteria as guidance for developing their own water quality standards. EPA is also developing criteria for coliphage. States must establish water quality criteria based on sound scientific rationale and sufficient parameters to protect designated uses. Numeric criteria should be based on CWA Section 304(a) guidance or other scientifically defensible methods. If numeric criteria cannot be established, states should use narrative criteria or biomonitoring methods. States can adopt more stringent criteria than EPA recommends, including for pollutants without 304(a) criteria. EPA and states can establish criteria for CECs under CWA Section 304(a). EPA can establish criteria for CECs under CWA Section 304(a), but states are not necessarily required to adopt them. States must adopt criteria for a contaminant if EPA designates it as a toxic pollutant under CWA Section 307 and publishes criteria for that contaminant under Section 304(a. Once adopted, states have tools available to achieve water quality standards. CWA tools, including NPDES permits and TMDLs, are used to achieve water quality standards by limiting or prohibiting contaminant discharges. TMDLs act as a \"pollution diet\" for water bodies, setting the maximum pollutant levels allowed while considering both point and nonpoint sources. Nonpoint sources are typically addressed through best management practices under CWA Section 319. The challenge of addressing Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) in the environment is often due to a lack of data on their occurrence and effects on human health and aquatic life. Developing new water quality criteria can be time-consuming, requiring data gathering, analysis, and a rigorous review process. This information is essential for making regulatory decisions to protect human health and the environment. Developing or updating water quality criteria can be a time-consuming process, involving data gathering, analysis, and a rigorous review process. The time it takes is often dependent on the availability of data, with some updates taking several years to complete. For example, the 2016 update for aquatic life water quality criteria for selenium took 10 years to finalize. In contrast, developing criteria for contaminants with existing EPA values may take less time. The Contaminants of Emerging Concern Workgroup report highlighted challenges in establishing new criteria or standards for CECs under the CWA and Safe Drinking Water Act. State agencies lack resources and expertise to set their own standards, leading to delays in addressing public concerns. The CEC workgroup recommended that EPA collaborate with states to create a list of priority contaminants. EPA is developing a formalized process for prioritizing contaminants for criteria development, incorporating input from stakeholders and data from the Safe Drinking Water Act. Sections 307 and 311 of the CWA authorize EPA to designate contaminants as toxic pollutants and hazardous substances, impacting how they are treated under CERCLA. EPA has the authority to designate contaminants as toxic pollutants and hazardous substances under CWA Sections 307 and 311. The list of hazardous substances has been revised multiple times since its initial creation in 1978. EPA can designate any element or compound as a hazardous substance if it poses a significant danger to public health or the environment. The EPA revised the list of hazardous substances in 1978 and subsequent years. Section 311 of the CWA establishes reporting requirements for discharges of these substances, with liability for removal costs and enforcement orders under Sections 311(c), 311(f), and 311(e) respectively. Section 311(e) allows enforcement orders to address imminent threats from hazardous substance discharges. CERCLA authorizes federal response actions for hazardous substances and other pollutants posing health risks. Liability for response costs and damages applies only to hazardous substances under CERCLA. Designating a CEC as a toxic pollutant or hazardous substance under the CWA would establish liability for their release under CERCLA. CERCLA has broader enforcement mechanisms than the CWA for responding to hazardous substance discharges into surface waters. Compliance with a CWA permit exempts from CERCLA liability as a \"federally permitted release.\" Recent congressional interest in addressing certain groups of Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) has focused on PFAS, with proposed legislation in the 116th Congress aiming to address PFAS using Clean Water Act (CWA) authorities. H.R. 3616 and Section 330A of H.R. 2500 would direct EPA to add PFAS to the CWA Toxic Pollutant List and establish standards for PFAS within specified time frames. Several bills in the 116th Congress focus on addressing PFAS contamination, with proposed legislation directing the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct nationwide sampling to determine PFAS concentrations in water and soil. The data collected would inform exposure assessments, health impacts, and remediation priorities. Additionally, some Members have introduced legislation for comprehensive PFAS toxicity testing. Bills in the 116th Congress aim to address CECs by improving federal coordination, research, and supporting states. S. 1507, S. 1251, and Sections 6741-6742 of S. 1790 propose establishing a National Emerging Contaminant Research Initiative and directing EPA to provide technical assistance to states for testing. Efforts focus on CECs in drinking water, with provisions for a database of resources available to assist states with testing. The EPA is directed to ensure the database is accessible to groups interested in emerging contaminants, including wastewater utilities. Observers note that as Congress debates how to address PFAS concerns, attention to other emerging contaminants like microplastics and algal toxins has increased. Calls for proactive federal actions to assess the toxicity of chemical substances before introduction into commerce are being made. Legislation is being considered to improve federal coordination and responses to emerging contaminants. Some advocates suggest oversight to identify and address potential gaps in authorities and processes under the Clean Water Act. Some observers believe there are gaps in Clean Water Act authorities hindering quick responses to emerging contaminants. They suggest EPA update ELGs and prioritize CECs based on new science and technology. Congress may need to evaluate EPA appropriations for CWA programs addressing CEC discharges. Congress may need to oversee the Administration's implementation of programs addressing emerging contaminants."
