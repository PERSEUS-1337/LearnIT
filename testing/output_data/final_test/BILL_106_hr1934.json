    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act of 1999\" establishes the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. This program aims to provide assistance for the rescue of marine mammals. The John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program provides grants to eligible stranding network participants for marine mammal recovery, data collection for research, and facility operation costs. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of funds among designated stranding regions, considering priorities based on stranding events in the previous year. To receive a grant under the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program, a stranding network participant must submit an application as prescribed by the Secretary. An advisory group, including representatives from designated stranding regions and other relevant organizations, will advise the Secretary on grant awards and program implementation. The advisory group consists of representatives from organizations involved in marine mammal rescue, rehabilitation, research, conservation, and forensic science. Meetings are open to the public with opportunities for input, and the Secretary provides timely notice and keeps minutes of each meeting. The advisory group consists of representatives from organizations involved in marine mammal activities. The Secretary keeps minutes of each meeting, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the group.

The Secretary may expend up to 6 percent of available funds for administrative expenses. Definitions include 'designated stranding region' and 'Secretary'. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2001 through 2003.
