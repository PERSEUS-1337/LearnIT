    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Military Personnel War Zone Toxic Exposure Prevention Act.\" It aims to identify health effects related to hazardous disposal sites. The Secretary of Defense will establish a system to identify Armed Forces members potentially exposed to hazardous disposal sites and related health effects. If exposure is confirmed, notifications will be given to the member, commanding officer, and Adjutant General if applicable. The Secretary of Defense will establish a system to identify Armed Forces members potentially exposed to hazardous disposal sites. Members will be notified of potential exposure and required to provide information such as deployment locations, distance from disposal sites, materials disposed of, length of exposure, symptoms experienced, and current symptoms. The Secretary of Defense will provide physical examinations and counseling to Armed Forces members potentially exposed to hazardous disposal sites. Documentation of exposure will be placed in the member's medical record. The Secretary will assess if current medical surveillance systems are sufficient for identifying all potential exposures. The Secretary of Defense will assess if current medical surveillance systems are adequate for identifying negative health effects from exposure to hazardous disposal sites. A report with recommendations for improving these systems must be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment. An annual report on the implementation status and illness incidences among Armed Forces members will also be provided to the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services within one year. In this section, the term \"existing medical surveillance systems\" refers to medical data possessed by the Secretary before the Act's enactment. \"Exposure to a hazardous disposal site\" includes being exposed to fumes from such sites for over a year, especially if the individual was stationed at a military base using open pits for waste burning. A hazardous disposal site refers to a location where mass amounts of waste were disposed of using hazardous methods during Operation Enduring Freedom or Operations Iraqi Freedom, including burning waste in open pits. This definition also includes significant exposure to fumes from such sites by members of the Armed Forces with service-related health problems. Former members of the Armed Forces are also included in this definition. PROHIBITION ON DISPOSAL OF WASTES IN A MANNER THAT PRODUCES DANGEROUS TOXINS. The Secretary of Defense must prohibit waste disposal during long contingency operations to prevent exposure to harmful environmental toxins and ensure compliance with military exposure guidelines. Regulations must be established within 60 days, and a report on waste disposal techniques must be submitted to Congress within 180 days. The Secretary of Defense must assess waste disposal techniques used by the Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan to ensure compliance with regulations."
