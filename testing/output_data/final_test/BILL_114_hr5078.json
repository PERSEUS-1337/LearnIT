    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Pipeline Safety Act of 2016\". The Great Lakes are crucial national resources, with one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water and 95% of the US freshwater supply. Over 40 million people rely on the Great Lakes for drinking water, which also supports various industries and ecosystems. Millions of gallons of hazardous liquids are transported daily through pipelines along the Great Lakes, impacting the environment and economy. The University of Michigan conducted modeling studies in 2014 and 2016, showing that an oil spill from a pipeline under the Straits of Mackinac could severely impact over 700 miles of Great Lakes shoreline. A joint NOAA-U.S. Coast Guard guidebook states that most oil spills in marine environments become difficult to recover, burn, or disperse chemically within the first 24 to 48 hours. Swift currents in the straits and connecting waterways could rapidly spread oil spill contaminants. Certain pipelines on the Great Lakes are at risk due to their location. Certain pipelines on the Great Lakes are located near municipal drinking water intakes, posing a risk to millions of people. The United States should protect the Great Lakes from environmental and economic harm. The United States should conduct a study on economic and environmental risks to the Great Lakes. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with relevant agencies, must conduct a study within 18 months to assess economic and environmental risks of oil spills in the Straits of Mackinac. The Secretary of Transportation must meet environmental impact statement requirements, describe potential impacts of spills, assess spill responses, and conduct a supplemental study on the condition of pipeline facilities. The Secretary of Transportation must conduct a supplemental study on the structural integrity of onshore and underwater pipeline facilities in the Straits of Mackinac, considering various factors like age, construction materials, corrosion, weld integrity, pressure, and possible external damage. The study should utilize internal inspection technology, pipeline route surveys, depth of cover surveys, pressure tests, and other relevant technologies to assess the condition of the pipeline facility. Additionally, the Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration must terminate the operations of an onshore, underwater pipeline facility within 18 months of the enactment of this Act. The Administrator may terminate operations of an onshore, underwater pipeline facility in the Straits of Mackinac if it poses a sufficient risk of hazard to life, property, or the environment."
