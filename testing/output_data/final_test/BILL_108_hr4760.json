Congress finds that over 158 million Americans use dietary supplements, with consumer spending reaching $17.1 billion in 2000. The FDA predicts continued growth in supplement use due to factors like aging populations and scientific advancements. The DSHEA was enacted in 1994 to regulate dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 balanced consumer access to supplements, increased research, public education, and consumer protections. DSHEA requires truthful, non-misleading claims on labels, sets manufacturing standards, and mandates safety information for new ingredients. The FDA has updated its system for reporting adverse events related to dietary supplements. DSHEA provides authorities to remove unsafe supplements and created the Office of Dietary Supplements for research and consumer information. The FDA has not effectively enforced DSHEA and requires more resources for implementation. The FDA has allocated additional funds beyond the President's budget to enforce DSHEA, totaling $9,700,000 in fiscal year 2003. However, the FDA states that full implementation of DSHEA would require between $24,000,000 and $65,000,000 annually. SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION AND APPROPRIATION OF RESOURCES.

The Food and Drug Administration is authorized to use funds to regulate dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. $30,000,000 is allocated for expanded research and development of consumer information on dietary supplements for fiscal year 2005, with additional funding for subsequent years.
