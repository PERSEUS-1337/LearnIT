It amends the Public Health Service Act to address this issue. The \"Prescription Drug Benefit Equity Act of 1997\" mandates equitable provision of prescription drug coverage in group health plans, requiring non-mail-order coverage to be consistent with mail-order coverage for all drugs and circumstances without additional cost-sharing.

A 'local pharmacy' is defined as an establishment authorized to dispense drugs within a specified distance from the participant's residence. Urban areas have a 5-mile limit, while non-urban areas have a 10-mile limit, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Plans can restrict drug benefits and impose limitations as long as they align with the minimum protections. Compliance with notice requirements is mandatory for group health plans. The group health plan must comply with notice requirements under ERISA regarding the provisions of this section. Amendments to ERISA include adding new sections related to health plan regulations. \"SEC. 713.
