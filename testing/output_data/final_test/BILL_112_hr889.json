    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fulfilling the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering Act of 2011\". Key findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that it is crucial for the nation's economic leadership to educate and train more scientists and engineers, including women. Research shows a decline in the number of women interested in STEM careers at every educational level. According to data from the National Science Foundation in 2006, women earn about half of all science and engineering bachelor's degrees, but only receive 20 percent of engineering and physics degrees. Women are underrepresented in university faculty positions, even in fields where they have higher representation like social and behavioral sciences. Women are underrepresented in science and engineering faculty positions at major research universities, with only 14.8 percent in the life sciences and social and behavioral sciences. Studies show no biological differences between men and women in science and math performance, yet women receive fewer resources for research activities. Implicit biases play a significant role in this disparity. Unintentional biases and outmoded institutional structures hinder women's access and advancement in science and engineering. Workshops educating faculty about biases have raised awareness. The Federal Government's research funding influences higher education policies, including institutional culture and structure. SEC. 3. FULFILLING THE POTENTIAL OF WOMEN IN ACADEMIC SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"Federal science agency,\" \"institution of higher education,\" \"STEM,\" and \"United States.\" The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will develop a uniform policy for Federal science agencies to conduct workshops on minimizing gender bias in research grant evaluation and academic advancement. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will coordinate workshops among Federal science agencies, ensuring at least one workshop every 2 years in major science and engineering disciplines. Federal science agencies can make grants to eligible organizations to carry out the workshops. Eligible organizations for grants include nonprofit scientific and professional societies, organizations representing STEM disciplines, and nonprofits focused on advancing women in STEM. Workshops must invite department chairs from the top 50 institutions of higher education in relevant disciplines. The curr_chunk discusses eligibility criteria for individuals involved in grant review panels and science disciplines supported by the Department of Energy. The curr_chunk focuses on workshops for Federal science agency program officers to address gender bias in the grant-making process and academic recognition. The curr_chunk discusses strategies to overcome bias in workshops for Federal science agency program officers, including addressing challenges faced by women in underrepresented groups and promoting mentoring for women in STEM education. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is required to report on these efforts to Congress within 5 years of the Act's enactment. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy is mandated to report to Congress on the effectiveness of the program to reduce gender bias in research funded by the Federal Government, including recommendations for improvement. Criteria for evaluation include participation rates in workshops authorized under the program. The report to Congress must include results of attitudinal surveys, institutional policy changes, and trends in data for workshop participants, specifically focusing on gender-related faculty data. Institutional attendance at workshops is also a key evaluation criterion for reducing gender bias in federally funded research. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will include a list of higher education institutions whose representatives attended workshops. Workshops should be held with national or regional meetings to reduce travel costs. Additionally, a uniform policy for extended research grant support and interim technical support for caregivers will be developed within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Office of Science and Technology Policy will develop a uniform policy to extend grant support for federally funded researchers with caregiving responsibilities and provide funding for interim technical staff support. The Director will report the policy to relevant committees once developed. Each Federal science agency will collect data on federal research grants. Each Federal science agency must collect standardized annual composite information on demographics, field, award type, budget request, review score, and funding outcome for research and development grants to higher education institutions. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will establish a policy for uniform data collection, and agencies will submit this data to the National Science Foundation annually. The National Science Foundation will store and publish grant data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and gender. The Office of Science and Technology Policy will annually publish a list of institutions represented in workshops to enhance gender equity in academic science and engineering. The Office of Science and Technology Policy will publish a list of institutions participating in workshops to promote gender equity in academic science and engineering. Institutions on the list can publicize their recognition on their websites and other platforms. SEC. 4. COLLECTION OF DATA ON DEMOGRAPHICS OF FACULTY. The Director of the National Science Foundation is required to report statistical data on the demographics of STEM faculty at US higher education institutions, including gender, race, and age breakdowns. This data must cover faculty numbers, ranks, tenure-track positions, and promotion reviews. The Director of the National Science Foundation is mandated to report demographic data on STEM faculty at US higher education institutions, including details on tenure, promotions, faculty years in rank, attrition, hiring, and leadership positions by gender, race, and age. Recommendations include seeking input on data collection and standard definitions from relevant stakeholders. The Director of the National Science Foundation is required to report demographic data on STEM faculty at US higher education institutions, including details on tenure, promotions, faculty years in rank, attrition, hiring, and leadership positions by gender, race, and age. The report to Congress will include a description of the data sources, justification for data exclusions, and definitions for terms and categories to be used in reporting the data."
