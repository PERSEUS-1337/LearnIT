The Congress recognizes that family offices are not of national concern as they provide services exclusively to members of a particular family and do not hold themselves out as investment advisers. They offer a wide range of services, including investment advice, for which they may receive compensation. The Securities and Exchange Commission regularly exempts family offices from the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as per Section 409 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Congress intended for this exemption to cover all current and future family offices. SEC. 2. FAMILY OFFICE DEFINITION. Section 202(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is amended to define the term \"family office\" as a company and its members acting in their respective capacities. The term \"family office\" is defined as a company owned, controlled, or operated primarily for the benefit of family clients, with no public investment adviser services offered. Grandfathering provisions apply to certain individuals meeting these criteria. The term \"family office\" is defined as a company primarily benefiting family clients, with specific control and client definitions provided. Any trust, estate, or entity majority-owned or controlled by family members for the benefit of family clients. The family office provides investment advice to entities operated for the benefit of family clients, with no ownership by non-family clients or former family members. Upon termination of employment by the family office or family client, a former key employee cannot receive investment advice from them, except for assets advised prior to termination. The former key employee can receive investment advice from the family office for additional investments they were obligated to make before becoming a former key employee. The term 'family office' includes any entity described under subclause (V). The term 'family member' includes natural persons whose economic activities contributed to family wealth, their spouses, siblings, parents, grandparents, and spouses of siblings. The term 'family member' includes siblings, spouses, lineal descendants, and spouses of lineal descendants. The term 'descendant' includes natural, adopted, and stepchildren; 'spouse' includes spousal equivalents; and 'siblings', 'parents', and 'grandparents' include step-siblings, step-parents, and step-grandparents. 'Former family member' refers to a spouse or descendant who was previously a family member. The term 'key employee' in a family office refers to a natural person who holds an executive position or is involved in investment activities, excluding clerical staff. The term 'spousal equivalent' refers to a cohabitant in a relationship similar to that of a spouse. Involuntary events may lead to a non-family client becoming a client of the family office. If a family member, key employee, or person ceases to be a family client, they will be considered a family client for up to 1 year until assets can be transferred, but not before it is legally feasible unless it becomes practical sooner."
