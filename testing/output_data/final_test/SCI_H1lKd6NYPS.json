    "content": "Off-Policy Actor-Critic (Off-PAC) methods have been successful in continuous control tasks. A novel meta-critic is introduced in this paper to accelerate actor-critic learning by providing an additional loss for the actor. The meta-critic is designed for off-policy learners and is rapidly learned online for a single task, leading to improvements in reinforcement learning efficiency. Online meta-critic learning improves sample efficiency in continuous control environments when combined with Off-PAC methods like DDPG, TD3, and SAC. Off-PAC methods are more sample efficient than on-policy alternatives like TRPO, PPO, and A3C due to their ability to learn from historical transitions without a time sequence requirement. Meta-learning, or \"learning-to-learn,\" has gained popularity as a way to accelerate reinforcement learning by learning aspects of the learning strategy, such as fast adaptation strategies, exploration strategies, optimization strategies, and losses. The critic estimates the action-value function using a differentiable function approximator, guiding the actor through policy parameter updates in the direction of the approximate action-value gradient. This approach improves sample efficiency in continuous control environments when combined with Off-PAC methods like DDPG, TD3, and SAC. In this paper, a novel meta-critic network is introduced to enhance existing Off-PAC learning frameworks. The meta-critic is trained to accelerate the learning process and guide the actor's learning alongside the vanilla critic. The actor is trained using gradients from both critic and meta-critic losses, while the critic is trained using temporal-difference. The meta-critic aims to generate maximum learning efficiency. In this framework, a meta-critic is introduced to enhance Off-PAC learning by guiding the actor's learning process. It uses off-policy transitions for efficient learning and can be successfully learned online within a single task. The meta-critic meta-learns an auxiliary loss function to optimize learning progress. Our loss-learning approach is a bi-level optimization problem with meta-critic learning at the upper level and conventional learning at the lower level. We update the metacritic and base learner iteratively online while solving a single task. Our method is similar to metaloss learning in EPG but is learned online and integrated with Off-PAC. Compared to prior work like LIRPG, our meta-critic provides a loss for direct actor optimization based on sampled transitions, leading to significantly better sample efficiency. Online meta-critic learning improves Off-PAC algorithms like DDPG, TD3, and SAC by providing a loss for direct actor optimization based on sampled transitions. Off-policy methods are more sample-efficient than on-policy methods due to the use of off-policy transitions. Off-policy actor-critic architectures like DDPG, TD3, and SAC aim to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. DDPG borrows ideas from Deep Q Networks, TD3 implements Double Q-learning, and SAC proposes a maximum entropy RL framework. Meta-learning is also explored for RL. Meta-learning has gained interest for improving learning performance and sample efficiency in RL. Studies have explored learning optimizers, hyperparameters, loss functions, and rewards to enhance standard optimizers. The meta-critic framework focuses on online meta-learning of loss functions parallel to learning a single task, eliminating the need for costly offline learning on a task family. The Meta-Critic framework enhances Off-PAC RL with single-task online meta-learning, focusing on loss learning parallel to learning a single task. Loss learning has been utilized in various studies such as 'learning to teach' and surrogate loss learning. Our meta-critic is a differentiable loss designed for reinforcement learning, optimizing auxiliary loss parameters to assist actor learning. The vanilla critic and meta-critic losses train the actor off-policy via stochastic gradient descent in the agent-environment interaction of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with the environment to find the optimal policy that maximizes expected cumulative return. In off-policy RL, parameterized policies can be updated directly by defining the actor loss. In off-policy reinforcement learning, parameterized policies can be updated directly by defining the actor loss in terms of the expected return and taking its gradient. The main loss is calculated using a mini-batch of transitions randomly sampled from the replay buffer. The actor's policy network is updated by following the critic's gradient to increase the likelihood of actions with higher Q-values. Additionally, a meta-critic network is trained to enhance actor learning and improve performance on the main task. In off-policy reinforcement learning, the actor is trained to improve performance on the main task by following gradients from both the meta-critic and the main task. This involves bi-level optimization where the actor minimizes losses from both critics on training samples. The meta-critic aims to produce an actor that minimizes a meta-loss measuring main task performance on a separate validation set. The policy is updated based on the transition stored in the replay buffer. The critic parameters are updated through gradient steps, with a focus on optimizing the actor and meta-critic for improved learning stability and speed. The meta-critic neural network aims to enhance the actor's performance on the main task, measured by meta-loss. The meta-critic is a neural network that takes actor featurisation and states/actions as input, producing a scalar output as loss. The optimization flow involves updating meta-critic and actor/critic parameters iteratively. Meta-train involves updating policy based on transitions, optimizing for improved learning stability and speed. During meta-training, the meta-critic is updated online alongside the actor by maximizing performance on a validation batch. Actor parameters are updated using both main and meta-critic losses, with the goal of improving learning stability and speed. During meta-training, the meta-critic is updated online alongside the actor to maximize performance on a validation batch. The meta-critic parameters are updated using a meta loss \u03c9, optimizing the difference between updates with and without the meta-critic's input for efficiency. The updated actor \u03c6 new depends on the feedback provided. During meta-training, the meta-critic is updated online alongside the actor to maximize performance on a validation batch. The meta-critic parameters are updated using a meta loss \u03c9, optimizing the difference between updates with and without the meta-critic's input for efficiency. The updated actor \u03c6 new depends on the feedback provided, with the main focus on optimizing the first term for \u03c9. The use of tanh ensures a nicely distributed meta-loss range, allowing the agent to adjust the parameters of the meta-critic based on performance improvement. The design of the meta-critic network h \u03c9 must meet several requirements, including input dependency on policy parameters \u03c6 for implementing the auxiliary loss for the actor. The design of the meta-critic network h \u03c9 must meet requirements such as input dependency on policy parameters \u03c6 for implementing the auxiliary loss for the actor. This involves ensuring permutation invariance to transitions in d trn and extracting information from states for decision-making in a more efficient and effective manner compared to previous methods like MetaReg. The meta-critic network h \u03c9 is designed to work with the policy parameters \u03c6 for implementing the auxiliary loss for the actor. It ensures permutation invariance to transitions in d trn and efficiently extracts information from states for decision-making. The network uses a three-layer MLP with input from the extracted feature of the policy network. The meta-critic network h \u03c9 is designed to work with the policy parameters \u03c6 for implementing the auxiliary loss for the actor. It ensures permutation invariance to transitions in d trn and efficiently extracts information from states for decision-making. The transitions are inputted to the h \u03c9 network in a permutation invariant way, obtaining the auxiliary loss for this batch d trn. The design includes cues features in LIRPG and EPG, with a softplus activation in the final layer of h \u03c9. The actor auxiliary loss helps mitigate over-estimation in the vanilla critic. The meta-critic module can be incorporated in DDPG, TD3, and SAC algorithms, differing only in their definitions of L main. The meta-critic module can be integrated with various Off-PAC algorithms, such as TD3 and SAC, with differences in their definitions of L main. SAC focuses on maximizing policy entropy and automatic temperature regulation for the actor, while TD3 uses the Double Q-learning idea to make unbiased value estimations. The experimental evaluation aims to showcase the versatility of the meta-critic module in different algorithms. The meta-critic module enhances Off-PAC algorithms like DDPG, TD3, and SAC. The meta-critic architecture is a three-layer neural network, evaluated on MuJoCo tasks through OpenAI Gym and rllab. In this study, the meta-critic module is applied to enhance Off-PAC algorithms such as DDPG, TD3, and SAC. The experiments are conducted on MuJoCo tasks using Gym and rllab environments. The implementation details include using the latest V2 tasks for HalfCheetah and Ant, re-tuned versions of DDPG, and open-source implementations of TD3 and SAC with a meta-critic integrated with a learning rate of 0.001. The learning curves of DDPG and DDPG-MC are compared, showing results averaged over 5 random seeds with confidence intervals represented as shaded regions. In this study, DDPG-MC outperforms DDPG in terms of learning speed and performance. Results are evaluated over 10 episodes every 1000 steps. DDPG-MC shows smaller variance and higher average return in nine tasks. Selected tasks are plotted due to similar environmental reward upper bounds. In this study, DDPG-MC outperforms DDPG in terms of learning speed and performance, showing smaller variance and higher average return in nine tasks with similar environmental reward upper bounds. Table 1 and Figure 3 demonstrate the superior performance of DDPG-MC, while Figure 4 compares SAC and SAC+TD3 methods. SAC-MC also shows a clear boost in asymptotic performance compared to SAC+TD3. Intrinsic Reward Learning for PPO (Zheng et al., 2018) is a method related to online single-task meta-learning of an auxiliary reward/loss via a neural network. Results show that PPO-LIRPG worsens basic PPO performance in standard tasks. Off-PAC methods generally outperform on-policy PPO, highlighting the importance of meta-learning in the off-policy setting. Meta-Critic is preferred over PPO-LIRPG as it provides a direct loss. Summary Table 1 and Figure 5 present the results in terms of max average return. Loss Analysis was conducted to analyze the learning dynamics of the algorithm, using Walker2d as an example. SAC-MC showed faster convergence to a lower value of the main loss, demonstrating the auxiliary loss's ability to accelerate learning. The meta-loss also played a role in the success of the algorithm. The meta-loss fluctuates during exploration in RL, generally improving actor learning. The auxiliary loss converges smoothly under meta-loss supervision. Ablation experiments on h \u03c9 design show the default design attains the highest mean average return. Meta-Critic is an auxiliary critic module for Off-PAC methods that can be meta-learned online during single task learning. It is trained to generate gradients improving the actor's learning performance, leading to long-term gains in continuous control. The module can enhance various Off-PAC methods for better performance. Future work includes applying the meta-critic to conventional offline meta-learning. The Meta-Critic is an auxiliary critic module for Off-PAC methods that can be meta-learned online during single task learning to improve actor performance in continuous control. Future work involves applying the meta-critic to conventional offline meta-learning with multi-task and multi-domain RL. The TD3-MC algorithm initializes critics, actors, and auxiliary loss networks, updates weights, and target networks, and samples transitions for meta-optimization. The Meta-Critic is an auxiliary critic module for Off-PAC methods that can be meta-learned online during single task learning to improve actor performance in continuous control. The computation requirement for meta-critic is around 15-30% more time per iteration, primarily due to evaluating the meta-loss. An experiment was conducted to investigate the benefit of meta-critic compared to baseline methods by increasing the compute applied by the baselines. Increasing the number of update steps does not consistently improve performance in various environments. Meta-Critic outperforms DDPG in Walker2d-v2, and adding more iterations worsens HalfCheetah's performance. Simply increasing gradient steps does not replicate Meta-Critic's success. SAC and SAC-MC show significant performance improvement in challenging environments like TORCS and Humanoid(rllab) with Meta-Critic."
