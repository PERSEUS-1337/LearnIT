    "content": "Since September 11, 2001, Congress has passed legislation to improve emergency communications, addressing issues like interoperability for first responders, emergency alerts, and 911 call centers. With technological convergence, emergency response areas are sharing common technologies, providing better tools for first responders and emergency workers. Advances in information technology have led to the need for rethinking internal organizational structures and communication methods in emergency response. Core technologies like two-way radio, telephone switches, and broadcasting are being connected through the use of digital broadcasting and Internet Protocols, allowing for better communication between emergency responders, 911 call centers, and public alerts. The use of Internet Protocols (IP) in emergency communications allows for interoperable radio networks for first responders and real-time participation in 911 call centers. Federal policy and congressional action address emergency communications through different agencies and committees, with a need for better coordination at both levels. Local, state, and regional participation is crucial in federal solutions for emergency incidents involving workers. Congress aims to balance cooperative policy and federal leadership for emergency response, blending advanced technology with organizational changes. The convergence of communications technology may lead to new policy approaches. Congressional interest in interoperable emergency communications has grown since 9/11 due to inadequate support for responders. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 addressed interoperability issues in radio communications systems for emergency responders. Congress also set deadlines for the release of radio frequency spectrum for public safety radios in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. These laws aim to improve coordination and communication among local, state, and federal responders during emergencies. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 addressed interoperability issues in radio communications systems for emergency responders. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 set deadlines for releasing radio frequency spectrum for public safety radios. The 21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006 created the position of Director of Emergency Communications within the Department of Homeland Security to address public safety communication issues. The DHS focused on technology for interoperability, placing responsibility within the Directorate for Science and Technology. Project SAFECOM was moved to the Science and Technology directorate to coordinate federal programs for interoperability. The Office of Interoperability and Compatibility was tasked with preparing a national strategy for communications interoperability. SAFECOM was moved to the Office of Interoperability and Compatibility within DHS, following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. Congress ratified this move in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which included improvements in communications capacity. The Commission's analysis of communication difficulties on September 11, 2001 led to a recommendation for expedited and increased assignment of radio spectrum. Pending legislation aims to expedite and increase radio spectrum assignment for public safety, especially in high-risk urban areas like New York City and Washington, D.C. Signal corps units are recommended to ensure communication connectivity among civilian authorities, first responders, and the National Guard, with federal funding being a priority for Congress. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act amended the Homeland Security Act to prioritize the rapid establishment of interoperable capacity in high-risk areas, requiring collaboration between DHS, FCC, Defense Department, and state/local authorities for technical guidance. The Homeland Security Act required collaboration between DHS, FCC, Defense Department, and state/local authorities to establish minimum capabilities for government agencies and first responders. It mandated the creation of pilot programs in high-threat areas to improve interagency communications and develop a national strategic plan. The Secretary of Homeland Security was directed to consult with the Secretary of Defense in the development of these projects. The Homeland Security Act mandated the development of pilot projects to improve interagency communications and establish minimum capabilities for government agencies and first responders. Congress set program goals for the Department of Homeland Security, including the establishment of a national approach for achieving interoperability, coordination with other federal agencies, and the development of voluntary standards. The Homeland Security Act required funding requests for interoperable communications to be accompanied by an approved Interoperable Communications Plan. It emphasized the deployment of interoperable emergency communications systems and radios for first responders, meeting national standards. Spectrum allocation for radio communications was highlighted, with studies on spectrum and communication networks for public safety and homeland security mandated by the act. The FCC was tasked with leading a study on spectrum. The FCC led a study on spectrum needs for emergency response providers, with a report released in December 2005. Public safety and homeland security needs for first responders were addressed in a study prepared by the Secretary of Homeland Security, FCC, and NTIA. Comments from the public safety community supported the need for additional spectrum, including the 700 MHz band. The FCC did not make a specific recommendation for short-term spectrum allocations but agreed that public safety could benefit from it in the long-term. The FCC led a study on spectrum needs for emergency response providers, with a report released in December 2005. Public safety could benefit from long-term spectrum allocation for broadband services. The DHS, FCC, and NTIA are working on a study to modify the band plan for the 24 MHz at 700 MHz designated for public safety. The Secretary of Homeland Security is also participating in a national study of spectrum policy as part of the Presidential Spectrum Policy Initiative. The 109th Congress passed legislation to expedite the release of spectrum at 700 MHz for public safety, as urged by the 9/11 Commission. This spectrum was allocated for public safety but not yet released, aiming to enhance interoperable network capability and communications capacity. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 planned to release spectrum by February 18, 2009, creating a fund to receive auction proceeds for various purposes. The fund transferred $7.363 billion to the Treasury to reduce the budget deficit, with disbursements including assistance for digital TV transition and grants for public safety agencies. NTIA administered the fund's disbursements for communications interoperability grants, with projected amounts for public safety grants in FY2007 to FY2010. The 109th Congress passed a bill requiring a grants program to receive at least $1 billion by September 30, 2007. The FCC established auction rules for a new communications network for public safety users to share with commercial users. A national license for 10 MHz was put up for auction under service rules that required collaboration with a Public Safety Licensee. The FCC is reconsidering options for the D Block auction, seeking comments on various partnership possibilities to provide public safety users access to private-sector capital and expertise for building the network. Proponents argue that costs will be lower with a partnership due to economies of scale. In February 2007, the NTIA and DHS signed an MOU to administer a $1 billion grant program for public safety communications. The MOU with the Office of Grants and Training at DHS outlines the administration of funds for the Public Safety Interoperable Communications Grant Program. Priority is given to funding needs identified in Tactical Interoperable Communications Plans and Statewide Interoperable Plans developed with SAFECOM, particularly for urban areas. The grants program announced $968,385,000 in funding for all states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories, with specific funding for seven urban areas under the Urban Area Security Initiative. The Urban Area Security Initiative provides funding for designated urban areas, with New York City receiving over half of the allocated amount for New York State. Other urban areas include San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, Newark-Jersey City, Los Angeles-Long Beach, and Washington, DC. States have until FY2010 to submit detailed requests for funds, with modifications to the funding program to comply with P.L. 110-53. Grant requests must now align with new guidelines established by the law. The new law provides grants for strategic technology reserves for emergency communications, with $75 million to be distributed based on funds already set aside. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 highlighted the need for interoperable communications systems for public safety. Hearings post-hurricanes revealed minimal response from DHS to congressional mandates, leading to proposed bills in Congress to strengthen emergency communications leadership. The Senate proposed strengthening emergency communications leadership and expanding efforts for improvement, included in Title VI of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007. The Act reorganized FEMA, gave new powers, and created an Office of Emergency Communications. The Director is required to coordinate emergency communications planning at state and regional levels, working with Regional Administrators appointed by the FEMA Administrator. Regional Administrators appointed by the FEMA Administrator oversee regional emergency communications capabilities, including programs like SAFECOM and Integrated Wireless Network (IWN). IWN was a joint law enforcement network for multiple departments, with DHS represented through the Wireless Management Office. The Director of Emergency Communications must also coordinate with the National Communications System for establishing effective communication systems. The National Communications System (NCS) works with the Director of Emergency Communications to establish a national response capability. NCS is designated as the Primary Agency for the Communications Annex of the Federal Response Plan and plays a role in state and local response. The Office of Interoperability and Compatibility is responsible for standards development, research, technology assessment, coordination with the private sector, and other tasks. A comprehensive research and development program is required. The Director of Emergency Communications is responsible for assisting the Secretary for Homeland Security in program responsibilities required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act. Other duties include conducting outreach programs, coordinating regional working groups, developing standard operating procedures, and establishing non-proprietary standards for interoperability. The National Emergency Communications Plan includes requirements for assessments, reports, and evaluating the feasibility of developing a mobile communications system. The National Emergency Communications Plan includes provisions for coordination of emergency communication grants, establishing a Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Group, and forming an Emergency Communications Preparedness Center. The RECC working groups include non-federal members such as first responders, state and local officials, emergency managers, and 911 call centers. The National Emergency Communications Plan involves coordination with various communication providers, hospitals, utilities, and emergency services. Congress responded to the 9/11 Commission recommendation by addressing emergency communication capabilities, including spectrum release and better connectivity in high-risk areas. The Commission report highlighted concerns about emergency response capacity and the need for teamwork, collaboration, and joint training sessions. It emphasized the importance of developing a regional focus for public safety organizations and addressing communication issues at all levels. Congress has taken steps to address these concerns, including providing authorities and funds to improve emergency communication capabilities. The passage of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) fulfilled a Democratic campaign promise to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. This Act aimed to improve interoperable communications for public safety, including the establishment of an Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program. Additionally, Title XXII of the Act revised provisions related to the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund, allowing funds for planning and system design. The bill requires funding for interoperable communications and emergency backup systems. It reaffirms the billion-dollar program funding in FY2007 and sets new guidelines for achieving interoperable communications by a deadline. The Department of Homeland Security issued the National Emergency Communications Plan in July 2008. Homeland Security issued the National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) in July 2008, setting goals for interoperability levels by 2010 and 2011. Members of Congress expressed concern about the plan's timing for releasing grant funds. The NECP aims for 90% of UASI areas to demonstrate response-level emergency communications within one hour by 2010. The National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) aims to improve emergency communications for first responders through three goals and seven objectives. FEMA's Regional Emergency Communications Coordination (RECC) Working Group is working towards a national communications capability. The plan includes milestones and deadlines for FEMA to deliver products, with oversight from Congress. The Homeland Security Trust Fund Act of 2007 would establish and fund a Homeland Security and Neighborhood Safety Trust. Senator Biden introduced a bill (S. 345) to establish a Homeland Security and Neighborhood Safety Trust Fund for grants supporting 9/11 Commission recommendations. The bill includes $1 billion annually for state and local communications grants from 2007 to 2011. Senator Schumer also introduced a bill (S. 74) for funding high-threat areas, building on previous legislation in the 108th Congress. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 proposes pilot programs in high-threat areas to purchase interoperable radios for the new public safety network. It creates a Trust Fund using proceeds from the D Block Auction and future auctions to ensure funding for emergency responders. The Smarter Funding for All of America's Homeland Security Act of 2007 proposes additional funding formulas but does not address interoperability. H.R. 130 would create an Advisory Council on First Responders and require a study on assigning additional spectrum for public safety. H.R. 1788 aims to provide a band plan for public safety channels at 700 MHz. H.R. 3116 would establish a separate fund for public safety communications grants within the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund. The Safety Communications Grants program would receive proceeds from auctions required by the Deficit Reduction Act, with up to $1.5 billion authorized for appropriations over three years. Administered by the NTIA, grants would support critical communications for public safety, with a preference for programs promoting interoperability."
