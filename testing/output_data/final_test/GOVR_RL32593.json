    "content": "Thailand, an American treaty ally since 1954, has been praised as an economic and democratic success story. The U.S.-Thai relationship is based on shared economic and security interests, with Thailand being an important trade and investment partner for the United States. U.S. access to Thai military facilities and military cooperation make Thailand a key element of the U.S. strategic presence in the Asia-Pacific region. However, political turmoil in Bangkok over the past decade has strained the bilateral relationship, with two military coups in 2006 and 2014 leading to the suspension of some U.S. assistance. Thailand's ability to assist with regional initiatives, including those supported by the United States, is limited due to domestic political crises. Despite its central geographical location and advanced infrastructure, Thailand lacks the capacity to play a larger role in the Obama Administration's strategic rebalance to Asia. While it has been helpful in encouraging Myanmar's democratic transition and coordinating talks between ASEAN and China, Thailand's struggles hinder its potential as a productive force in the region. Thailand's political instability may hinder its ability to take on a leadership role in ASEAN. The country is facing a historic transition with the impending royal succession, which could reshape its political structure. The U.S. must consider how to promote democratic principles while engaging with Thailand's military-led government. Thailand's political instability raises questions about the country's future, including the response of the disenfranchised majority, the possibility of civil war, succession scenarios, and the role of Thaksin and his supporters. Uncertainties may deter foreign investors, impact regional initiatives, and challenge U.S. relations with Thailand. The military government's control since May 2014 has thrown Thai politics into turmoil. The Royal Thai military declared martial law in May 2014, ousting the civilian government and seizing power. The military dissolved Parliament, detained political leaders, and imposed restrictions. Former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was placed under house arrest. After seizing power, Prayuth Chan-ocha announced governance by the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) and was elected as Prime Minister in August 2014. There has been sporadic violence, but no widespread bloodshed associated with the coup. Prayuth has not set a date for a transition to civilian rule. After the 2014 coup in Thailand, Prayuth Chan-ocha has delayed elections multiple times, with the latest date set for August or September 2016. The NCPO established a Constitution Drafting Committee that grants immunity to coup participants and allows the prime minister to be selected rather than elected. Prayuth lifted martial law in April 2015 but invoked Article 44, granting his government broad powers to maintain national peace. This move has been criticized as a further descent into dictatorship by human rights groups. Thailand faced criticism from the United States for its descent into dictatorship following the 2014 coup. The US suspended $4.7 million in foreign assistance, cancelled military exercises, and urged a quick return to civilian rule and early elections. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the need for restoring civilian government, democracy, and human rights. The US warned of negative implications for the relationship with the Thai military and reviewed military assistance in line with US law. The United States suspended military assistance to Thailand following the 2014 coup, cutting off $3.5 million in Foreign Military Financing and $85,000 in International Military Education and Training funds. Despite this, the US still participated in the Cobra Gold military exercise in 2015, with fewer troops than in previous years. U.S. participation in the exercise will remain limited in 2016. The United States suspended military assistance to Thailand after the 2014 coup, cutting off funding for development and military programs. Despite this, U.S. assistance for other programs like law enforcement training and global health remained in place. Thailand, a constitutional monarchy, is unique in Southeast Asia for never being colonized by Europeans and avoiding communist revolutions in the 1960s and 1970s. Thailand's path to democracy was troubled, with military dictatorships ruling until the early 1990s. Brief periods of democracy in the 1970s and 1980s were followed by military rule. After a wave of protests in 1992, the military ceded control, allowing elections to take place. The 2006 coup marked the first in 15 years. Thailand's government consists of an executive branch, a bicameral National Assembly, and a constitutional monarchy. Thailand's political landscape saw the Democrat Party dominating before Thaksin's tenure as Prime Minister from 2001-2006, characterized by centralization of power and populist economic policies. This led to his ousting by the military in 2006, highlighting the divide between the rural poor and urban middle class. The current political turmoil in Thailand reflects this growing divide. Thaksin's populist movement in Thailand, centered in Bangkok, galvanized support through nationalism and providing healthcare to rural communities. Despite being banned, his parties continued to win elections, challenging the traditional governance model. Thaksin's influence exposed and deepened regional and class divides in Thai politics, going beyond just rural-urban disparities to include regional rivalries. The political divisions in Thailand are driven by regional rivalries and self-interest among politicians aligned with Thaksin. Demonstrations typically involve the \"yellow shirts\" and \"red shirts,\" representing different factions of society. The red shirts, Thaksin loyalists, support populist policies benefiting rural regions. Yellow shirts prioritize ethical imperatives over polls. Both groups have engaged in violent protests. In 2010, Red Shirts occupied Bangkok, leading to urban warfare. In May 2010, urban warfare erupted as armored vehicles and troops attacked protestors' encampments in Bangkok, resulting in 90 deaths and 2,000 injuries. Splinter groups emerged within major institutions, with rogue elements from both sides possibly responsible for the violence. King Bhumiphol Adulyadej, previously a stabilizing figure, has remained detached from the political crisis. The King's failing health has worsened political tensions in Thailand, with uncertainty surrounding the succession process. Different factions are vying for power amidst strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws that prohibit criticism of the royal family. The use of these laws has increased, leading to arrests and website blocks, causing further instability in the country. The U.S.-Thai military relationship, a key pillar of their alliance, faces challenges due to recent coups in Thailand. After the 2014 coup, the U.S. suspended military aid and training exercises with Thailand, straining relations. This comes after years of cooperation and a Joint Vision Statement signed in 2012 to enhance regional security partnerships. The 2014 coup in Thailand put the Thai army at the center of politics, contradicting years of U.S. training on civilian control of the military. Despite this, the strategic value of the U.S.-Thai alliance remains high, with access to Thailand's Utapao airbase considered vital for military operations. Thailand's Utapao airbase was used for refueling during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as for relief efforts after the 2004 tsunami and 2015 earthquake. The U.S.-Thai security relationship dates back to the Manila Pact in 1954 and the Thanat-Rusk communiqu\u00e9 in 1962, despite the dissolution of SEATO. The annual Cobra Gold exercises, the largest military exercise in Asia, continued with U.S. participation even after the 2014 coup in Thailand. The U.S.-Thai security relationship is strong, with Thailand being a major ally in East Asia. Bilateral ties were strengthened through joint efforts in the Korean War, Vietnam War, and Iraq wars. Thailand sent troops to support the United States in various conflicts, and the close security ties continued throughout the Cold War. Thailand has been a solid anti-Communist ally of the United States, providing crucial support in various conflicts including the Iraq wars. In 2003, Thailand was designated as a \"major non-NATO ally,\" allowing for increased U.S. foreign aid and military assistance. This includes funds for weapons purchases and participation in programs like Foreign Military Financing and Excess Defense Articles. Thailand is a key ally of the United States, participating in joint military exercises and purchasing military equipment. Despite facing stiff competition in the foreign military sales market, Thailand agreed to buy UH-72 Lakotas and upgrade their F-16 fighter aircraft fleet. The 2014 coup temporarily suspended FMF funds, but the two countries continue to strengthen their military relationship through exercises like Cobra Gold. Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia, along with observers from other Asian nations, including military officials from Burma, participated in military exercises. China also took part in non-combat exercises. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program has trained thousands of Thai military officers, enhancing professionalism and defense cooperation with the United States. IMET funding was suspended after the 2006 and 2014 coups. Intelligence cooperation between the United States and Thailand increased after 9/11, leading to the establishment of the Counter Terrorism Intelligence Center (CTIC) in 2001. The CTIC allows CIA personnel to work closely with Thai counterparts, resulting in the arrest of suspected terrorists like Hambali in 2003. The CIA also operated at least one black site for holding terrorist suspects. In 2003, the CIA maintained a black site in Thailand for terrorist suspects beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok provides training for government officials from Southeast Asian countries on law enforcement and cross-border issues like human trafficking. U.S. and Thai law enforcement coordination was highlighted by the 2008 arrest of Victor Bout, an international arms dealer, in Bangkok. The 2008 arrest of Victor Bout, an arms dealer in Bangkok, showcased U.S. and Thai law enforcement coordination. Counter-narcotics cooperation between the two countries has led to the arrests of international drug traffickers. Thailand's economy is one of the region's largest and most developed, attracting foreign direct investment. Thailand's economy became an upper-middle income economy in 2011, with strong performance despite political turmoil. Following the 2014 coup, economic growth slowed to 0.7%, but is expected to reach 3.5% in 2015. The U.S. Trade Representative notes Thailand as the 25th largest market for U.S. goods exports, with two-way trade totaling $47.4 billion in 2014. Major exports from the U.S. to Thailand include integrated circuits, computer parts, and soybeans, while major imports include electronics, jewelry, and rice. U.S. companies have significant investments in Thailand, with substantial foreign direct investment. Thailand receives substantial foreign direct investment, with U.S. FDI reaching $14.4 billion in 2013. The country also attracts investments from Japan, China, and South Korea. Trade barriers include high tariff rates, lack of transparency in customs policy, price controls, and poor protection of intellectual property rights. Concerns also exist about Thailand's education system and human capital. Thailand's education system lags behind other Southeast Asian nations despite high GDP spending. The country has not joined the TPP trade negotiations, and FTA talks with the US were suspended after a military coup in 2006. Thailand has pursued various FTAs with countries like Bahrain, China, Peru, Australia, Japan, India, and New Zealand. Possible deals are also being considered with South Korea, Chile, and the European Union. The country supports ASEAN regionalism through AFTA and the planned AEC for investment-driven integration. Economic policy debates in Thailand reflect political divisions, with past populist measures by Thaksin including subsidizing healthcare and transferring revenues to states. Thailand's former Prime Minister, Yingluck, implemented populist policies including a rice-subsidy plan that critics deemed fiscally unsustainable. The country's public debt increased during her tenure, leading to economic slowdown. Yingluck faced impeachment over the policy before being ousted by the Constitutional Court. Her successor, Prayuth, ended the subsidy upon taking office. Thailand's economy is significant in the region due to its size and working relationships. Thailand's importance in the region lies in its large economy, relationships with neighboring countries like Burma and China, and its previous democratic rule. Political turmoil in Thailand has raised concerns among neighbors about its ability to lead regional initiatives, impacting issues such as ASEAN's diplomacy with China, efforts to combat human trafficking, and regional economic integration. Analysts view Southeast Asia as a key area of competition between the US and China, with worries about China's increasing influence in Thailand and the US's strategic rebalancing to Asia. The Obama Administration's \"pivot\" to Asia relies on a strong U.S.-Thai relationship to strengthen treaty alliances and regional organizations like ASEAN. Analysts debate the necessity of this relationship, with some arguing that Thailand's ties with the U.S. are enduring and that Thailand is wary of relying too heavily on China. Sino-Thai relations have historically been close, with Thailand aligning strategically with China in the past. Sino-Thai relations have strengthened, with a significant Chinese population in Thailand integrating well into society. Thailand has no territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea and has played a role in coordinating discussions between ASEAN and China. Bilateral trade between Thailand and China has flourished under the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement. Thai-China trade has grown significantly under the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, with China becoming Thailand's largest trading partner in 2010. Trade between the two countries increased by 42% between 2010 and 2014, surpassing Thai-U.S. trade by 66% in 2014. Additionally, Thailand and China have signed agreements on infrastructure development, environmental protection, and strategic cooperation, including military ties with joint exercises and patrols. In October 2011, a Burmese minority group killed 13 Chinese soldiers in a Thai-controlled portion of the Mekong River, leading to increased Sino-Thai military cooperation. Joint patrols were initiated along the Mekong River involving Thailand, China, Laos, and Burma. The border between Thailand and Burma spans 1,120 miles, with ethnic-minority militias controlling much of the territory on the Burmese side. This lack of government control allows for the movement of narcotics, militants, and migrants across the border. Thailand aims to enhance border protections as refugees and human trafficking victims cross the border freely. The country's foreign policy priorities shifted after the Obama Administration's engagement with the Burmese military regime in 2011. Thailand's approach towards Burma conflicted with the US policy, favoring ASEAN's engagement strategy. Thai investments in Burma's natural gas sector increased, leading to significant trade between the two countries. In 2013, Thailand had more access to the Burmese government compared to other nations. Thai assistance was allowed after Cyclone Nargis in 2008 when international groups were not permitted. Thailand is evaluating the sustainability of Burmese reforms and seeking to build relationships in the country. Some analysts suggest Thailand could play a role in involving the Burmese military in regional security initiatives. U.S. congressional leaders have criticized Bangkok for its treatment of Burmese refugees, migrant workers, and political dissidents. Thailand's treatment of Burmese refugees, migrant workers, and political dissidents has been criticized by U.S. lawmakers and human rights groups. Thai security forces have been accused of arresting and intimidating Burmese political activists, as well as repatriating Burmese migrants seeking asylum. Thailand's foreign policy within ASEAN is complex, with the country being a leader in the region. Bangkok has strong relations with fellow ASEAN members and has promoted the group's significance in global affairs to enhance its own international influence. Thailand has strong relations with its Southeast Asian neighbors, providing aid and receiving raw materials and markets in return. Tensions with Cambodia over territorial claims to Preah Vihear temple led to shelling in 2011, but a peaceful resolution was reached in 2013 with the International Court of Justice ruling in Cambodia's favor. Thailand has faced a persistent separatist insurgency in its Muslim-majority southern provinces since January 2004, resulting in around 6,000 deaths and over 11,000 wounded. The insurgency has strained relations with Malaysia, as many Thai Muslims are ethnically Malay and speak Yawi, a Malay dialect. Despite periodic cooperation between Thailand and Malaysia on talks with separatist groups, the presence of separatist leaders in northern Malaysia remains a point of contention between the two countries. The insurgency in Thailand's Muslim-majority southern provinces has resulted in around 6,000 deaths and over 11,000 wounded. Violence has declined since 2013 due to enhanced counter-insurgency measures by the NCPO. The groups fighting the government have various motives, including local autonomy, and are a mix of local separatists, Islamic radicals, organized crime, and corrupt police forces. There is no convincing evidence of serious Jemaah Islamiyah involvement in the attacks. The insurgency in Thailand's Muslim-majority southern provinces has resulted in thousands of deaths and injuries. The movement aims to create an independent state with Islamic governance, with some groups receiving support from foreign Islamic organizations. Tensions with Malaysia have been heightened, but foreign elements have not played a significant role in the violence. Thai Muslims have long complained about discrimination and economic disparities. The separatist insurgency has been active since the 1960s, with leaders trained in camps in Libya and Afghanistan. The insurgency in southern Thailand has resulted in numerous casualties, with the majority being civilians. The conflict involves attacks by insurgents and counterattacks by security forces, leading to a pattern of violence. The insurgency, ongoing for 11 years, is the deadliest conflict in East Asia, with security forces resorting to extra-judicial killings and insurgents using various tactics including IEDs and beheadings. The region remains under martial law. Since 2007, a counter-insurgency campaign called \"Operation Southern Protection\" has led to more arrests in southern Thailand. However, mass detentions are fueling local resentment, with human rights groups criticizing the military for mistreating Muslim suspects. Following the 2014 coup, the military implemented new measures, deploying more troops, creating self-defense units, and installing security cameras and alarm systems around targeted educational facilities. Violence in the region has since declined. The government's struggle to negotiate with insurgent groups in southern Thailand, including failed peace talks with BRN in 2013. The NCPO has also expressed willingness to negotiate, but no official talks have taken place yet. International observers are monitoring the situation closely. Thailand's human rights record has been criticized for alleged abuses, including extra-judicial killings and suppression of civilian demonstrations. The government also faces accusations of human rights violations in the southern provinces. Concerns about Thailand's democracy have been raised since the drafting of a new constitution after the 2006 coup, which some believe moved away from the ideals of the 1997 constitution. The drafting of a new constitution after the 2006 coup in Thailand raised concerns about the acceptance of democratic ideals by established power centers. Economic migrants, including those from neighboring Burma, often illegally cross into Thailand and face exploitation as forced laborers in various industries. Some migrants, including children, become victims of sex trafficking and are involved in the country's sex tourism industry. In the south, insurgent groups recruit children as foot soldiers to carry out attacks against Thai government facilities. Thailand was downgraded to \"Tier 3\" in 2014. In 2014, Thailand was downgraded to \"Tier 3\" status in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons report due to lack of compliance with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking. Observers debated whether the downgrade should have happened earlier, with some attributing delays to political considerations. Observers noted that Thailand faced challenges in collecting trafficking data, especially due to regional differences. Despite efforts to prevent a downgrade in 2014, NGOs criticized the government for understating trafficking of non-Thai citizens. Reports also alleged military involvement in trafficking Rohingya migrants. Thailand faces challenges in collecting trafficking data, with reports of military involvement in trafficking Rohingya refugees. Over half a million stateless people from 40 nationalities live in Thailand, seeking refuge due to discrimination in their home countries. Immigration controls are loose, and North Korean asylum-seekers have recently sought refuge in Thailand. Thailand is known for its lenient reputation, attracting North Korean asylum-seekers due to relative tolerance and crackdowns in other countries. A strong network of humanitarian organizations in Thailand assists refugees, with the largest group being Burmese. Around 120,000 Burmese refugees live in camps along the Thai-Burmese border, with some not registered with the Thai government. Thai authorities have accommodated these refugees, but are increasingly frustrated with the number of asylum seekers. The United States has resettled over 73,000 Burmese refugees to alleviate pressure on Thailand. The United States has resettled more than 73,000 Burmese refugees since 2005 to alleviate pressure on Thailand. These programs were suspended in 2006 and resumed in 2008."
