    "content": "The \"Community Integration Act of 2014\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress finds that under the Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Olmstead v. L.C., individuals with disabilities have the right to receive supports and services in home and community-based settings. The goal is to end forced segregation in institutions and provide appropriate long-term services to individuals with disabilities. Progress has been made in rebalancing State spending on individuals in institutions. As of June 2013, over 200,000 individuals under 65 were in nursing homes, comprising almost 16% of the total nursing home population. Studies from 2005 to 2012 show that providing services in home and community-based settings is more cost-effective than institutional care. There is a lack of centralized reporting to compare how well states are meeting the Olmstead decision to support individuals with disabilities in community settings. States are not effectively meeting the Olmstead mandate to support individuals with disabilities in community settings. SEC. 3. ENSURING MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES CAN RECEIVE CARE IN A HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SETTING. Section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to provide individuals requiring nursing facility care the option to receive care in a home and community-based setting. The provision ensures individuals have equal opportunity to receive care in a home and community-based setting, in addition to nursing facility services, to support daily living activities and skills enhancement. The provision in Title XIX of the Social Security Act ensures equal opportunity for care in a home and community-based setting, in addition to nursing facility services, to support daily living activities and skills enhancement. The provision in Title XIX of the Social Security Act ensures equal opportunity for home and community-based care. Sec. 1904A defines activities of daily living and health-related tasks that can be delegated to attendants in a home and community-based setting. In a community-based setting, individuals requiring care live in private housing that ensures privacy, dignity, respect, and autonomy. In a community-based setting, individuals with disabilities have access to the general community, opportunities for employment, and necessary services to live independently. In a community-based setting, individuals with disabilities have access to the general community, opportunities for employment, and necessary services to live independently. The term 'instrumental activities of daily living' refers to activities related to independent living, such as meal planning, managing finances, and household chores. 'Public entity' is defined as per the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Requirements for providing services in home and community-based settings are outlined in the State plan. State plan requirements in a home and community-based setting prohibit public entities from imposing policies that limit services for individuals with disabilities who need them. The curr_chunk prohibits policies that limit services for individuals with disabilities in a home and community-based setting based on their specific disability, restrict participation in community life, delay or restrict service provision, and fail to establish adequate payment. The curr_chunk outlines requirements for maintaining a workforce to provide services in home and community-based settings, ensuring individuals understand their right to choose care in these settings, and providing information to individuals requiring care in restrictive institutional settings. The curr_chunk discusses the development of a statewide plan to increase affordable and accessible housing for individuals with disabilities, including those with physical disabilities and mobility devices. It also mentions the availability of remedies and procedures under the Americans with Disabilities Act for individuals aggrieved by the failure to provide care in home and community-based settings. The curr_chunk discusses remedies available to individuals aggrieved by non-compliance with ADA requirements, including potential reduction in federal assistance to states. The curr_chunk outlines reporting requirements for States regarding individuals enrolled in restrictive care settings, to be submitted annually to the Administrator of the Administration for Community Living. The curr_chunk details reporting requirements for States on individuals in restrictive care settings, including transitions to home-based care. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Social Security Act regarding mandatory services in home and community-based settings. It also mentions waivers for individuals eligible for certain services. The amendments made to the Social Security Act regarding mandatory services in home and community-based settings do not apply to individuals eligible for medical assistance under specific waivers. The effective date for these amendments is October 1, 2014, with a delay permitted if state legislation is required. The State plan is not considered non-compliant with section 1902 requirements due to additional requirements imposed by amendments. Failure to meet these requirements before a specified deadline is allowed for states with a 2-year legislative session."
