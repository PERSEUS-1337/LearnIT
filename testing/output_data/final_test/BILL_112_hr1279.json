    "content": "The \"Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011\" restricts the use of advanced imaging technology and enhanced pat-down searches for aircraft passenger screening. The \"Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011\" amends Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code to restrict the use of advanced imaging technology for passenger screening, requiring technology to be deemed safe by the National Academy of Sciences and equipped with privacy protection features. The \"Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011\" restricts the use of advanced imaging technology for passenger screening unless other screening methods show reasonable cause for its use to detect potential threats to aviation security. Enhanced pat-down searches are only allowed if other screening methods indicate a need for advanced imaging technology. The \"Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011\" mandates that passengers eligible for screening by advanced imaging technology must be informed about its operation, generated image, privacy policies, and the option to request an advanced pat-down search instead. Additionally, the Act prohibits the use of images generated by the technology. The \"Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011\" prohibits storing, transferring, sharing, or copying images of passengers generated by advanced imaging technology after the boarding determination. The Assistant Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation of this subsection and the number of passengers screened using advanced imaging technology. The \"Aircraft Passenger Whole-Body Imaging Limitations Act of 2011\" prohibits storing, transferring, sharing, or copying images of passengers generated by advanced imaging technology. The Assistant Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress on the implementation of this subsection and the number of passengers screened using advanced imaging technology. The report must include details on the number of passengers who chose an advanced pat-down search, privacy protection measures, privacy violations, and the effectiveness and safety of the technology. Advanced imaging technology refers to devices that create a visual image of the individual's full body to detect objects carried on individuals. SEC. 3. PENALTY RELATING TO VIOLATION OF PROHIBITION ON IMAGE STORING. This section adds a penalty for officers or employees of the United States who knowingly store, transfer, share, or copy images in violation of the prohibition on storing images related to aircraft passenger screening. SEC. 4. PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary must establish performance measures and conduct cost-benefit analysis before using any security technology for screening under Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code. This ensures that the technology is cost-effective, reliable, safe, and the best option available. The Secretary must establish performance measures and conduct cost-benefit analysis before using any security technology for screening under Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code to ensure cost-effective, reliable, safe technology is used. An emergency exception allows temporary use of technology or methodology. The amendment applies to security technology or methodology use post-enactment, including advanced imaging technology and pat-down searches. The amendment applies to security technology or methodology use post-enactment, including advanced imaging technology and pat-down searches, for passenger screening under Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code. The effective date for Sections 2 and 3 of this Act is 30 days after enactment."
