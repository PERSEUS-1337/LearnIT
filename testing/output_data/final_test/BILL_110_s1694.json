    "content": "The \"Pollinator Protection Act of 2007\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Act includes findings related to pollinator protection. Congress finds that crops rely on pollinators for healthy growth, with honey and native bees adding over $18 billion annually to US crops. 1/3 of the US food supply depends on bee pollination, making pollinator management crucial for food security. Colony collapse disorder is causing a decline in pollinators, with honey bee colonies in over 23 states affected. If the decline continues, it will have serious consequences for the United States. Enhanced funding for research on bees and pollination will help address colony collapse disorder and other factors causing the decline of pollinators in North America. If the current rate of decline continues, the United States will rely more on imported foods, destabilizing food security through adverse effects on availability, price, and quality of fruits and vegetables. Enhanced funding for research on bees and pollination is crucial to address the decline of pollinators in North America, including colony collapse disorder. If the decline continues, the United States may face food security issues due to reliance on imported foods. The Agricultural Research Service is authorized funding for new personnel, facilities improvement, and research at Department of Agriculture Bee Research Laboratories. Additional funding is allocated for research on honey and native bee physiology, insect pathology, insect chemical ecology, and toxicology at various Department of Agriculture facilities. Moreover, funding is designated for an area-wide research program to address colony collapse disorder in affected States. The Agricultural Research Service is authorized funding for bee research laboratories in Maryland and Arizona. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service is allocated $10,000,000 annually for honey bee biology, immunology, and ecology research grants. The Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service receive funding for bee research. Research areas include honey bee biology, genomics, bioinformatics, native bee pollination, pollination biology, effects of pesticides on bees, genetically-modified crops interaction with bees, and bee parasites and pathogens. $2,250,000 is authorized for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. $2,250,000 is allocated for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to conduct a nationwide honey bee pest and pathogen surveillance program from 2008 to 2012. The Secretary of Agriculture must provide annual reports to the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture regarding the status and progress of bee research projects."
