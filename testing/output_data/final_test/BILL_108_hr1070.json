    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Securing Consumers' Assurance in Moving Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to consumer protection in moving services. Congress finds that there are approximately 1,500,000 interstate household moves every year, with increasing consumer complaints since the Interstate Commerce Commission was abolished in 1996. There is a concern about a growing criminal element exploiting enforcement gaps and preying on consumers during household goods moves. Federal regulations currently do not provide consumers with a remedy for harm caused by fraudulent household goods movers. Courts have interpreted the \"Carmack\" amendment to prevent states from taking action against interstate movers for deceptive practices. Limited federal resources make it difficult to effectively police nationwide fraudulent movers. To combat fraudulent moving companies and protect consumers, a Federal-State partnership should be established to enforce regulations in the household goods industry. The Department of Transportation should provide more information to consumers and review current consumer protection regulations to recommend necessary modifications to Federal law. Federal-State relations regarding transportation of household goods are addressed in Section 3. The amendment allows for the enforcement of consumer protection laws by individuals, states, or political subdivisions in relation to interstate transportation of household goods. Before enforcing consumer protection laws related to interstate transportation of household goods, a State or political subdivision must notify the Secretary of Transportation in writing. If prior notification is not feasible, written notification must be provided immediately upon taking action. This does not grant authority for a State or political subdivision to initiate enforcement actions under consumer protection laws. The subdivision of a State can enforce consumer protection laws regarding interstate transportation of household goods if it conflicts with Federal laws. A conforming amendment is made to the analysis for chapter 145 of the title. Enforcement of consumer protection for interstate household goods carriers is addressed through a working group to enhance federal-state relations. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a working group to enhance the Federal-State partnership in enforcing interstate transportation of household goods. The group will consult with industries involved in this transportation. Additionally, there will be civil and criminal penalties for holding household goods hostage. Chapter 149 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include a definition of 'holding household goods hostage' as the failure to deliver or unload goods subject to transportation regulations. A civil penalty of at least $10,000 is imposed on those found holding household goods hostage. The Secretary of Transportation may suspend the registration of carriers or brokers for at least 6 months if found holding household goods hostage. Criminal penalty includes a fine or imprisonment up to 2 years. The Secretary of Transportation must ensure that a consumer handbook on moving rights is prominently displayed on the DOT website within a year of this Act. Additionally, information on household goods transportation must be displayed on related websites. The Secretary of Transportation must modify regulations to require motor carriers and brokers to display specific information on their websites related to household goods transportation. This includes displaying DOT numbers, OCE 100 publication, and for brokers, a list of motor carriers used and a disclaimer that they are not carriers. Additionally, a consumer complaint database must be established. The Secretary of Transportation must establish a system for filing consumer complaints about household goods transportation, including a database accessible to the public and regulations for carriers to submit reports on complaints and claims. The Secretary of Transportation uses information from a database to determine which motor carriers of household goods should undergo a commercial investigation. This includes details on the number of claims resolved and the amount paid by the carrier. SEC. 9. INSURANCE REGULATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary of Transportation will review current regulations on insurance coverage for motor carriers of household goods within a year of this Act's enactment to enhance protection for shippers in case of loss or damage. The review will determine if current regulations adequately protect shippers, whether individual shippers should buy insurance, and if there are any abuses leaving shippers unprotected in claims.\n\nSEC. 10. CIVIL PENALTIES RELATING TO HOUSEHOLD GOODS BROKERS. Section 14901(d) of title 49, United States Code is amended to include provisions for brokers estimating transportation costs of household goods without carrier agreements, imposing a civil penalty of at least $10,000 for each violation. Unauthorized transportation of household goods also incurs penalties under subchapter I of chapter 135. If a person provides transportation services without proper registration under chapter 139, they are liable to the United States for a civil penalty of at least $25,000 per violation. The Secretary of Transportation must provide a progress report to Congress on the implementation of the Act within 1 year of its enactment."
