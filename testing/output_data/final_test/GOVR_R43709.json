    "content": "The EPA was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities. Its responsibilities include regulating air and water quality, pesticides, toxic substances, and waste management. The agency also awards grants to assist states and local governments in pollution control. Congress has funded EPA programs through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. EPA's funding has been requested and appropriated under nine statutory accounts. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) provided $8.14 billion for the EPA in FY2015, which was $249.9 million above the President's request but $60.1 million less than the FY2014 enacted level. No regular appropriations bills for FY2015 were passed by Congress. The House Committee on Appropriations reported H.R. 5171 and the Senate subcommittee released a chairman's draft that formed the basis for negotiating the enacted levels in P.L. 113-235. This report summarizes actions on the FY2015 appropriations for EPA and presents a breakout of the FY2015 enacted appropriations for the agency by each of the nine appropriations accounts and selected programs and activities within those accounts. Comparisons are made to the President's FY2015 budget request, the House committee reported bill and Senate subcommittee draft, and the FY2014 enacted appropriations. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 is the primary source of information. The primary source of information for the FY2015 enacted appropriations is the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. The House Appropriations Committee completed its markup of the FY2015 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill on July 15, 2014. Title II of the bill would have provided $7.48 billion for EPA, $407.3 million less than the President's FY2015 request and $717.3 million less than the FY2014 enacted appropriation. The Senate did not introduce an Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bill for FY2015. However, a chairman's draft proposed $8.18 billion for EPA, $699.3 million more than the House committee reported bill for FY2015. This amount was $292.1 million more than the FY2015 request but $17.9 million less than the FY2014 enacted level of $8.20 billion. H.R. 5171 included provisions that would restrict or prohibit the use of FY2015 funds. The House committee markup for FY2015 appropriations included funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, which were not removed. Some provisions from the House committee bill were retained in P.L. 113-235. President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 into law on September 19, 2014. The Appropriations Resolution, 2015 (P.L. 113-164, H.J.Res. 124) continued funding for federal departments and agencies at FY2014 levels with a 0.0554% rescission. The CR was authorized until December 11, 2014, or until FY2015 appropriations were enacted. Funding for EPA was subject to conditions from the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014. Continuing funding under the CR could not be used for new projects. H.J.Res. 130 and H.J.Res. 131 extended the provisions of P.L. 113-164 through December 17, 2014. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 extended funding for EPA through September 30, 2015. FY2015 enacted appropriations included changes compared to FY2014 levels for various EPA programs and activities. The explanatory statement in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 provided direction to EPA on implementing programs and activities. It included a rescission of $40.0 million from unobligated balances in the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account, with restrictions on emergency requirements. This differed from the President's FY2015 request for a $5.0 million rescission. The FY2014 enacted appropriations did not include rescissions of unobligated balances of EPA prior fiscal years' appropriations, whereas EPA appropriations beginning in FY2006 through FY2013 did include them. Concerns regarding EPA's FY2015 funding focused on prioritization and adequacy of funding for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, categorical grants for pollution control laws, air quality and climate change regulations, research, Superfund and Brownfields sites cleanup, and geographic-specific water quality initiatives. The EPA has proposed and promulgated regulations to implement federal pollution control statutes, sparking debate in Congress over concerns of agency overreach and economic impacts of the rules. The EPA has faced criticism for its regulations under federal pollution control statutes, with some arguing for stronger regulations to protect public health and the environment. Congressional attention has focused on recent actions under the Clean Air Act, including controls on greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA has faced criticism for its regulations under federal pollution control statutes, with recent actions under the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and other environmental laws receiving attention in Congress. Provisions in P.L. 113-235 restrict EPA actions and funding, continuing provisions from previous appropriations. Section 420 and Section 424 of the appropriations bills prohibit the use of funds to implement regulations requiring permits for emissions from livestock production and mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from manure management systems. Section 424 prohibits the use of funds from the Safe Drinking Water Act for projects unless all iron and steel used are produced in the United States. Section 425 prohibits funds from being used to regulate lead content in ammunition or fishing tackle. The STAG account provides grants to states and territories for Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs), representing a significant portion of EPA funding. In FY2015, $2.36 billion was allocated for SRFs, exceeding the budget request by $580.9 million. P.L. 113-235 appropriated $1.45 billion for Clean Water SRFs and $906.9 million for Drinking Water SRFs, surpassing the President's request and House-reported bill amounts. The Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs) receive funding from the STAG account, with $2.36 billion allocated in FY2015. Congress has debated the need for federal assistance to maintain capital in the SRFs for water infrastructure projects. Some members argue that funding through regular appropriations is unsustainable, leading to discussions on sustainable funding mechanisms during the 113th Congress. The SRFs receive funding from the STAG account, with $2.36 billion allocated in FY2015. Congress has debated sustainable funding mechanisms for water infrastructure projects. Advocates argue for federal financial assistance citing long-term needs and expanding water quality requirements. Others call for more self-reliance among state and local governments. P.L. 113-235 included funding for water infrastructure projects in Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico Border region. The FY2015 enacted appropriations included $5.0 million within the STAG account for wastewater infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border, matching the President's request and the House committee reported bill, but less than the Senate subcommittee chairman's draft recommendation of $7.5 million. P.L. 113-235 allocated $1.05 billion for the STAG account in FY2015 to support state and tribal grant programs. The FY2015 enacted appropriations included $5.0 million within the STAG account for wastewater infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border, matching the President's request and the House committee reported bill. These funds are allocated among multiple grants generally to states and tribes to support the day-to-day implementation of federal environmental laws and regulations and to support various activities that address particular environmental media. The FY2015 enacted appropriations included funding for EPA categorical grant programs compared to the President's request and FY2014 enacted appropriations. EPA's air quality and climate change activities, particularly related to regulations under the Clean Air Act addressing GHGs, were prominent issues. EPA's response to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision on GHGs inclusion in the CAA definition remains a key issue in climate change activities. EPA proposed rules on GHG emission standards for new facilities in January and June 2014. The EPA's proposed rules on GHG emission standards for fossil fueled power plants have attracted attention. The impacts of these actions on the economy have been discussed in hearings. The FY2015 appropriations debate also focused on air quality issues related to livestock operations. P.L. 113-235 included provisions preventing EPA from funding specific air quality regulatory activities. Section 420 addressed regulations for GHG emissions from livestock production. The Act governing GHG emissions from livestock production includes reporting requirements for manure management systems. Section 435 restricts funding for certain aspects of GHG NSPS for fossil-fuel-fired electricity units. Section 418 requires the President to submit a report on federal obligations for climate change programs. EPA's funding for climate change programs and activities is relatively small compared to other agencies, but its policy and regulatory roles are significant. Appropriated funds are distributed across various program activities, making it challenging to compare with the President's request and prior-year appropriations. Congress specifies line-items for certain activities in the appropriations process. The EPA's \"clean air and climate\" activities are the largest air quality program funded within the Environmental Programs and Management and Science and Technology accounts. The FY2015 enacted appropriation for State and Local Air Quality Management grants was $228.2 million, the same as FY2014 enacted but $15.0 million less than the President's FY2015 request. States use these grants to operate air pollution control programs. The State and Local Air Quality Management grants are used by states to operate air pollution control programs. The FY2015 enacted appropriation for these grants was $228.2 million. In the STAG account, the FY2015 enacted appropriation included $30.0 million for the Diesel Emission Reduction Grants program, $10.0 million more than the FY2014 enacted level. The FY2015 President's budget request had proposed no funding. The FY2013 post-sequestration funding level was $18.9 million, and the FY2012 enacted level was $30.0 million. Additional funds were provided in FY2009 and FY2010 through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The FY2015 enacted appropriations included funding for \"Targeted Airshed Grants\" within the STAG account to reduce air pollution in nonattainment areas. These grants are distributed on a competitive basis to the top five most polluted areas for ozone or particulate matter 2.5 standards. No funding was requested for these grants in FY2014. P.L. 113-235 included $8.1 million for state indoor radon grants within the STAG account. The FY2015 enacted appropriations included $8.1 million for state indoor radon grants within the STAG account, matching the FY2014 amount. The President did not request funding for this program in FY2015, proposing its elimination due to states and local agencies having the necessary expertise and funding. However, the proposal to eliminate the radon program was rejected in the explanatory statement accompanying H.R. 83. No specific funding was allocated for the radon program within the total appropriated for the Indoor Air and Radiation program area. The Superfund account, established under CERCLA, received $1.09 billion for FY2015, slightly lower than the President's request. Funding levels have been decreasing since FY2010, with annual appropriations previously around $1.25 billion. The Superfund program receives funding from the Hazardous Substance Superfund Trust Fund, with debates focusing on the pace and adequacy of cleanup at sites on the National Priorities List. There is interest in reinstating Superfund taxes on industry to support the program, with a proposal in the President's FY2015 budget to do so. Legislation for Superfund tax reauthorization has been introduced in each Congress since 1995. Reauthorization legislation for Superfund taxes has been introduced in each Congress since 1995, but has not been enacted. P.L. 113-235 did not include language to reauthorize Superfund taxes. EPA also administers a Brownfields program to provide financial assistance for cleaning up sites not covered by Superfund. Funding for EPA's Brownfields program includes competitive and formula-based grants for assessment, remediation, job training, and technical assistance at eligible brownfields sites. EPA's Brownfields program receives funding through formula-based grants under Section 128 to help states and tribes enhance their cleanup programs. In FY2015, the program was allocated $153.3 million, with $25.6 million from the Environmental Programs and Management account and $80.0 million for Section 104(k) and Section 128 grants from the STAG account. This funding represented a decrease from the President's request but an increase from the House committee reported bill. The EPA's Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) account received a $153.3 million allocation in FY2015, including funding for ecosystem restoration and wetlands protection programs. This funding addresses water quality and pollution sources, focusing on specific geographic areas like the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. Collaboration among EPA, federal agencies, and local entities is common in these programs. Table 4 compares FY2015 enacted appropriations for EPA's ecosystem restoration and geographic programs with proposed funding levels. $16.8 million was allocated for \"National Priorities\" in S&T and EPM accounts, similar to FY2014. The President's FY2015 request did not include funding for these priorities. $4.1 million was designated for \"Research: National Priorities\" in the S&T account for water quality research grants. The EPA allocated $12.7 million in FY2015 for grants to not-for-profit organizations to improve water quality and safe drinking water. These grants require a 10% matching funds requirement and aim to provide technical assistance to rural and urban communities. $11.0 million is for national or multi-state training and technical assistance, while $1.7 million is for individual private well owners. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have adhered to an earmark moratorium during the 112th and 113th Congresses, precluding earmarks in annual appropriations bills for FY2011-2014. Definitions of earmarks were adopted in House and Senate rules, with funding awarded on a competitive basis. In 2007, the House and Senate adopted separate definitions for earmarks in their appropriations process. The House refers to it as a congressional earmark, while the Senate calls it a congressionally directed spending item. The EPA's authorized FTE employment ceiling has decreased since FY2001, with the FY2015 level being the lowest since FY1989. EPA FTEs increased by 18% from FY1990 to FY1999 according to a GAO report in March 2000. The EPA's FTEs increased by about 18% from FY1990 to FY1999, with the largest increase occurring from FY1990 to FY1993. However, from FY1993 to FY1999, the growth rate was less than 1% per year. The trend has been downward since FY2001, with funding prohibitions proposed in H.R. 5171 for EPA's FY2015 appropriations. The House committee reported bill proposed funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, but few provisions were retained in the Consolidated and Further Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235). The proposed restrictions would have impacted EPA activities such as reducing GHG emissions and clarifying jurisdictional issues under the Clean Water Act. The House committee reported bill proposed funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, including limitations on addressing lead-based paint removal and defining terms under the Clean Water Act. An amendment prohibited EPA from finalizing a rule on \"Administrative Wage Garnishment.\" Selected provisions in H.R. 5171 were not retained in the Consolidated and Further Appropriations Act, 2015. The bill proposed funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, including limitations on addressing lead-based paint removal and defining terms under the Clean Water Act. It also prohibited the use of funds for developing, adopting, or enforcing changes to rules related to the definition of waters under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The bill proposed funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, including limitations on addressing lead-based paint removal and defining terms under the Clean Water Act. It also prohibited the use of funds for developing, adopting, or enforcing changes to rules related to financial responsibility requirements and standards of performance for fossil-fuel-fired electricity utility generating units. The bill proposed funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, including limitations on addressing lead-based paint removal and defining terms under the Clean Water Act. It also prohibited the use of funds for developing, adopting, or enforcing changes to rules related to financial responsibility requirements and standards of performance for fossil-fuel-fired electricity utility generating units. Section 436 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and regulations under the Clean Air Act would have restricted the EPA administrator from disclosing personally identifiable information of livestock, poultry, or dairy operations owners, operators, and employees. The bill proposed funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, including limitations on addressing lead-based paint removal and defining terms under the Clean Water Act. It also prohibited the use of funds for developing, adopting, or enforcing changes to rules related to financial responsibility requirements and standards of performance for fossil-fuel-fired electricity utility generating units. Section 436 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and regulations under the Clean Air Act would have restricted the EPA administrator from disclosing personally identifiable information of livestock, poultry, or dairy operations owners, operators, and employees. Section 439 would have prohibited changes to regulations regarding \"fill material\" or \"discharge of fill material\" under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Section 441 would have prohibited the identification of certain scrap metals or shredded circuit boards as hazardous wastes. Section 443 would have prohibited the use of funds for wage garnishment. The bill proposed funding restrictions on EPA regulatory actions, including limitations on addressing lead-based paint removal and defining terms under the Clean Water Act. It also prohibited the use of funds for developing, adopting, or enforcing changes to rules related to financial responsibility requirements and standards of performance for fossil-fuel-fired electricity utility generating units. Additionally, it would have prohibited the use of funds for finalizing, implementing, administering, or enforcing a proposed rule on wage garnishment by EPA. EPA's historical funding trends show an increase in appropriations to fulfill statutory responsibilities over time. The EPA has been authorized to develop programs for environmental issues. Its funding has grown from $1.0 billion in FY1970 to a peak of $14.86 billion in FY2009, with real dollar values in FY1978 slightly higher than in FY2009. EPA's annual appropriations represent a small portion of the federal budget."
