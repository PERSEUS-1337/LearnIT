    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Radiological Materials Security Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as finding and purposes. The Radiological Materials Security Act aims to secure radiological materials to prevent terrorist use in radiological dispersion devices. This involves cooperative efforts between various government agencies and authorities to establish a security system for domestic sources of radiological materials. SEC. 1908 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 addresses radiological materials security to prevent terrorist use in radiological dispersion devices through cooperative efforts between government agencies. The Secretary must conduct a terrorism risk assessment on the threat, vulnerability, and consequences of radiological materials theft for use in a radiological dispersion device within 180 days of the Radiological Materials Security Act enactment. Collaboration with the Secretary of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is required for this assessment. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must consider relevant studies, focus on high-risk radiological materials, evaluate the dispersion device value, assess vulnerability for theft, and analyze consequences of a successful attack. The Secretary conducts a terrorism risk assessment for radiological dispersion device attacks, consulting with various agencies and experts. Findings are disseminated to participants in the radiological sources security system. The Secretary develops a classification system for information on radiological materials and shares the terrorism risk assessment with participants in the radiological sources security system. Additionally, a terrorism risk self-assessment tool is implemented. The Secretary develops a terrorism risk self-assessment tool for facilities handling high-risk radiological materials, which is distributed to facilities included in the Radiological Materials Security Act. Recommended security practices are also issued. The recommended security practices for securing high-risk radiological materials are tiered based on the type and quantity of material, facility access, physical security, and the risk posed by the material in a radiological dispersion device. The Secretary provides infrastructure protection grants for domestic preparedness and response to terrorism to owners of facilities with approved security plans under the Radiological Materials Security Act. The Secretary provides infrastructure protection grants for domestic preparedness and response to terrorism to owners of facilities with approved security plans under the Radiological Materials Security Act. The agreement with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines high-risk radiological material and participating facilities. Authorization of appropriations is set at $20,000,000, with $10,000,000 allocated for grants in fiscal year 2010. The table of contents in section 1(b) of the Act is amended by adding items relating to title XIX. SEC. 4 outlines the responsibilities of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, including Sec. 1908 on Radiological materials security. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must update regulations for security of radiological materials against terrorism within two years of this Act. Regulations will be tiered based on risk levels of facilities, determined with a risk self-assessment tool. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will conduct site inspections of facilities based on risk tiers, with penalties for non-compliance including license revocation. Additionally, a database will track regulated radiological materials and incidents of lost or stolen materials. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Agreement States require licensees to report radiological material amounts every 6 months and report lost or stolen sources. Participating facilities must use a terrorism risk self-assessment tool provided by the Secretary for conducting risk assessments. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission mandates facilities with high-risk radiological material to create and implement security plans based on risk assessments. The results of these assessments are used to tier facilities and must be reported to the Commission within 30 days. Facilities with high-risk radiological material must submit a security plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Agreement States within 90 days of the risk self-assessment. The plan should detail policies, procedures, personnel, equipment, and implementation costs. The Commission or Agreement States will review the submitted security plan. The facility security plan must be submitted for each facility to ensure it meets the requirements of the facility's risk tier. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission or Agreement State must approve or disapprove the plan within 90 days. If not approved, the shortcomings must be clearly explained, and the facility given 30 days to correct it. If no approvable plan is provided after 30 days, further action will be taken. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission or Agreement State will apply penalties to facilities for non-compliance. They will also conduct site visits to provide guidance on security plan implementation. $10,000,000 is authorized for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2010, with the ability to transfer funds to Agreement States for Act requirements. The Secretary of Energy provides technical assistance for securing radiological materials to various authorities and facilities. The Department of Energy's responsibilities for recovering orphaned radiological sources and conducting response operations remain unaffected by this Act."
