    "content": "The effectiveness of the nation's schools is a concern at all levels of government, with a focus on providing quality public schools for all students to meet academic standards. Federal education policy has shifted towards emphasizing student outcomes, including the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 expanded the federal government's role in education by supporting standards-based instruction and test-based accountability. Congress is considering reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, grappling with issues related to federal versus state control over standards and assessments. The Common Core State Standards Initiative was developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers to establish common standards for math and English/language arts. The Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI) was developed by states to establish standards for math and English/language arts. The federal government did not play a role in developing the standards but has expressed support for them. The report discusses the difference between standards and curriculum, the history and current status of CCSSI, and the Administration's efforts to support states' adoption of the standards. The curr_chunk discusses the Race to the Top State Grants, teacher and school leader evaluation requirements, and criticisms of the Common Core State Standards. It also mentions the NCLB's requirements for content and performance standards in math and reading. The curr_chunk discusses funding for state assessment grants, adoption of content and performance standards in science at three grade levels, and alignment of assessments with academic standards. States are required to adopt and implement academic standards to receive Title I-A funding. The curr_chunk discusses the two types of academic standards required for receiving Title I-A funding: content standards and performance standards. These standards define what students should know and be able to do, with performance standards detailing proficiency requirements. States are not mandated to have their standards approved by the federal government for funding. States have the flexibility to choose their own content and performance standards for Title I-A funding. They must demonstrate to the Department of Education that they have adopted and implemented standards in required subjects and grade levels. Academic content standards should be coherent, rigorous, clear, and specific to guide teaching and learning effectively. Academic content standards should be clear, jargon-free, and accessible for educators and students. They guide what teachers should teach in the classroom but do not dictate how to teach or what materials to use. Performance standards define the requirements for students to meet or exceed in each content area and are expressed in terms of a cut score. Performance standards are expressed as cut scores that denote levels of proficiency within a content area. States must establish standards for basic, proficient, and advanced levels in reading, math, and science assessments. These standards describe competencies and abilities, are linked to the curriculum, and help in planning and modifying instruction. They do not dictate teaching methods or materials. Standards are expectations for student knowledge and skills, while curriculum can vary from lesson plans to textbooks. Curriculum alignment with state standards is crucial for students to demonstrate proficiency on tests. The alignment of standards and curriculum is essential for students to show proficiency on state assessments, which must be in line with the standards. Federal laws have prohibitions to limit the government's role in approving state standards, controlling curriculum, educational materials, and creating a national test. Prohibitions are found in the ESEA and GEPA, with specific restrictions in Section 1905 of the ESEA related to Title I, emphasizing that the federal government cannot mandate or control instructional content, standards, assessments, curriculum, or instruction programs at the state or local level. The Section 1905 provision in the ESEA prohibits the federal government from mandating or controlling state standards, curriculum, or assessments. Section 1111 requires states to demonstrate challenging academic standards and high-quality assessments without submitting them to the Secretary. Section 9527 further limits federal involvement in approving state standards. The ESEA prohibits the federal government from endorsing or mandating specific curricula for elementary and secondary schools. It also restricts federal control over state educational standards and assessments. The ESEA prohibits federal control over state educational standards and assessments, but states can voluntarily establish standards in response to incentives from ED. The statute does not limit the federal government's authority to require states to maintain standards or assessments for funding. ED cannot mandate specific standards or assessments, but can impose requirements for funding or waivers. The ESEA prohibits federal control over state educational standards and assessments, but states can voluntarily establish standards in response to incentives from ED. While ED cannot prescribe specific instructional content, curriculum, or program of instruction, it can impose requirements related to standards. GEPA also prohibits federal government control over curriculum, program of instruction, and personnel of educational institutions. The ESEA and GEPA prohibit federal control over state educational standards, curriculum, and instructional programs. This includes restrictions on the adoption of specific curricula or instructional programs by educational institutions. Additionally, GEPA prohibits the use of federal funds for piloting, field testing, or distributing federally sponsored national tests in subjects not explicitly authorized by law. The Secretary is prohibited from using funds to develop federally sponsored national tests unless Congress acts to support it. However, federal funds can still be used to support non-federally led efforts to develop a common test. States have had flexibility in selecting their own standards, leading to different accountability systems in each state. The development of different accountability systems in each state has raised concerns about consistency, student mobility, and global competitiveness. To address these issues, the Common Core State Standards Initiative was launched by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers to create common standards for ELA and mathematics in grades K-12. These standards aim to define the knowledge and skills students need to succeed in college and the workforce. The Common Core State Standards Initiative was initiated to establish a common set of high standards for ELA and mathematics in grades K-12, benchmarked to college and career readiness. Discussions began in 2007, leading to the recommendation of internationally benchmarked standards in a report published in 2008. By 2009, governors and chief state school officers from 48 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories were involved in the initiative. The Common Core State Standards Initiative involved governors and chief state school officers from 48 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories. The development of the standards was conducted in two phases, with drafts reviewed by content experts and the public before being submitted to the Validation Committee. In September 2009, the CCSSI announced a validation committee to review and verify the standards development process. The K-12 Work Group, with expertise in various education areas, developed drafts of ELA and mathematics standards aligned with college- and career-readiness standards. Multiple drafts were shared with stakeholders for feedback. The Common Core State Standards were developed with input from various stakeholders and underwent revisions based on feedback. The final standards were released in June 2010, with adoption being optional for states. Adoption requires states to implement 100% of the ELA and mathematics standards, with the option to add up to 15% more. As of August 2014, 43 states, the District of Columbia, and 4 outlying areas had adopted the standards. As of August 2014, 43 states, the District of Columbia, 4 outlying areas, and the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) had adopted the Common Core State Standards. Indiana and Oklahoma were the first states to adopt and then discontinue the standards. South Carolina planned to implement the standards for the 2014-2015 school year but will replace them with new standards in 2015-2016. Minnesota adopted ELA standards but not math. Alaska, Nebraska, Texas, Virginia, and Puerto Rico did not adopt either ELA or math standards. The CCSSI did not develop assessments aligned with the standards. The CCSSI did not develop assessments aligned with the Common Core State Standards. Federal funds were made available to states to support the development of assessments aligned with the standards. The movement towards common standards and assessments is supported by the Obama Administration. The Administration has utilized waiver authority to partially achieve goals under Section 9401 of the ESEA. Support for Common Core State Standards Initiative and aligned assessments was shown through Race to the Top grants. RTT state grant competitions awarded points for adopting common standards, and consortia received grants to develop aligned assessments. Race to the Top program was authorized under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund in the ARRA. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) awarded competitive grants to states for implementing reforms in education. About $4 billion was given to 11 states and the District of Columbia in two rounds of competitions. An additional $200 million was awarded in a third round of grants in FY2011. Only states that were finalists in Phase 2 were eligible to apply for Phase 3 grants. The reforms focused on enhancing standards and assessments, improving data collection, increasing teacher effectiveness, and turning around struggling schools. The ED required states to adopt internationally-benchmarked standards and assessments for college and workplace readiness. Points were awarded based on states' commitment to adopting common K-12 standards through consortium participation. States could supplement common standards with additional ones. States adopting the Common Core State Standards were required to adopt the standards in their entirety but could add additional standards not exceeding 15% of the state's total standards for that content area. States were evaluated based on their plans for adopting a common set of K-12 standards by a specified date. Phase 2 and Phase 3 applicants for the Common Core State Standards had to demonstrate progress towards implementing high-quality reform plans and developing common, high-quality assessments aligned with the standards. States were evaluated based on their commitment to improving assessment quality through participation in a consortium working towards common standards. States were evaluated based on their participation in a consortium developing common standards, with points assigned based on the number of states involved. Reviewers were instructed to assign high points for participation in a consortium with a majority of states, and lower points for fewer states involved. States were evaluated based on their participation in a consortium developing common standards. Points were awarded based on the number of states involved and the timeline for adoption. \"High\" points were given for early adoption by August 2, 2010, while \"low\" points were awarded for later commitments. No points were given for adoption after the 2010 calendar year. After the 2010 calendar year, states were incentivized to adopt the Common Core State Standards to earn points in the RTT grant competition. By August 2, 2010, 30 states and the District of Columbia had agreed to adopt the standards, with nine more states following suit later in the year. Six states adopted the standards after 2010, regardless of their RTT grant status. Some states that did not win RTT state grants are reconsidering their adoption of the Common Core State Standards. Indiana and Oklahoma have stopped using the standards, while other states may have continued due to requirements for receiving the ESEA flexibility package. It is unclear how many states would have adopted the standards without the RTT competition or ESEA package incentives. Additionally, ED awarded Race to the Top Assessment grants to two consortia of states to develop high-quality assessments aligned with the standards. The Race to the Top Assessment grants were awarded to two consortia of states to develop high-quality assessments aligned with common college- and career-ready K\u201312 standards. States could indicate their participation in a consortium to develop assessments aligned with common standards in their RTT State Grant applications, making them eligible for extra points. The majority of the funding was targeted at Comprehensive Assessment Systems, but no grants were awarded for High School Course Assessment Programs. To receive a grant under the Comprehensive Assessment Systems category, a consortium of at least 15 states had to commit to adopting common college- and career-ready standards by specific deadlines. The focus was on developing assessments that measured student achievement against these standards in math and ELA. The standards defined what students should know and be able to do at each grade level. The U.S. Department of Education awarded grants to two assessment consortia, PARCC and Smarter Balanced, totaling $361.7 million to support the development of common college- and career-ready standards. The U.S. Department of Education awarded grants totaling $361.7 million to support the development of common college- and career-ready standards. 34 states and the District of Columbia were involved in the consortia, with some states planning to use the assessments developed by Smarter Balanced and PARCC. Some states are considering using a non-consortium test for grades 3-8 or high school, while others are using the PARCC and Smarter Balanced consortia aligned with the Common Core State Standards. States must adopt the assessments developed by their consortium and are incentivized by RTT funding. The federal government did not dictate the common standards used by the consortia. States may have used federal funds for State Assessment Grants to support the development of assessments associated with the Common Core State Standards. President Obama and the Secretary of Education announced ESEA flexibility waivers for states, applicable for school years 2011-2014, with the option for extensions. The ESEA flexibility waivers provide exemptions from academic accountability requirements, teacher qualification-related requirements, and funding flexibility requirements under NCLB. SEAs can also apply for optional waivers related to programs like the 21st Century Community Learning Centers. To receive the waivers, SEAs must agree to meet four principles set by ED for improving student academic achievement and instruction quality. The ESEA flexibility package includes waivers and principles for states to redesign accountability and teacher requirements. As of July 30, 2014, 43 states, DC, and Puerto Rico had approved applications. States must meet four principles, with the first focusing on adopting college- and career-ready standards and aligned assessments. To receive the ESEA flexibility package, an SEA must demonstrate college- and career-ready standards in reading/language arts and mathematics, implement these standards for all students, develop annual assessments measuring student growth, adopt English language proficiency standards, and report on college-going rates for all students. The ESEA flexibility package requires states to adopt college- and career-ready standards in reading/language arts and mathematics, with a deadline of the 2013-2014 school year. These standards aim to prepare students for college and careers by the time of high school graduation. The ESEA flexibility package requires states to adopt college- and career-ready standards in reading/language arts and mathematics by the 2013-2014 school year. These standards aim to prepare students for college and careers by high school graduation. College- and career-ready standards must be common to multiple states or approved by a State network of higher education institutions. The Common Core State Standards are an example of such standards, with over 40 states already adopting them. \"College ready\" means students do not need remedial coursework at the postsecondary level, but there is no clear definition for \"career ready.\" Based on approved state applications for the ESEA flexibility package, most states have chosen to implement the Common Core State Standards for ELA and math, while some states have opted for their own standards. For example, Minnesota uses the Common Core for ELA but not for math, Virginia uses its Standards of Learning, Texas uses the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills Curriculum Standards, and Alaska uses the Alaska Content and Performance Standards. To receive a waiver for assessments, an SEA must develop and administer high-quality assessments that measure student growth in grades 3-8 and high school. These assessments must produce data to determine if students are college and career ready, assess all students including English Learners and students with disabilities, provide alternate assessments for students with significant cognitive disabilities, and produce data to inform school determinations. The ESEA flexibility request requires SEAs to develop and administer high-quality assessments to inform school effectiveness, teacher evaluations, professional development needs, and program improvement. SEAs can demonstrate compliance through participation in a state consortium funded by RTT, independent development of assessments, or planning to develop assessments by 2014-2015. The landscape of state standards and assessments is further complicated by efforts like the RTT State Grants. State standards and assessments, including efforts like the RTT State Grants and the ESEA flexibility package, aim to implement teacher and school leader evaluation systems based on student achievement. The use of student assessments under ESEA Title I-A is crucial for determining student growth in these evaluation systems. Race to the Top State Grant application requires states to establish clear approaches for measuring student growth and implement fair evaluation systems for teachers and principals. The Race to the Top State Grant application requires states to establish evaluation systems for teachers and principals based on student growth. This includes annual evaluations with feedback, using results for development and decision-making on compensation, promotion, and tenure. States' plans for improving teacher and principal effectiveness accounted for 58 points out of 500 on the grant application. The RTT application requires states to establish evaluation systems for teachers and principals based on student growth, using multiple valid measures to determine effectiveness. This includes using assessments aligned with standards like the Common Core State Standards. States must commit to developing, adopting, piloting, and implementing evaluation systems for continual improvement of instruction. The ESEA flexibility package requires states to establish teacher and principal evaluation systems based on student growth and professional practice. These systems must include multiple valid measures, provide regular feedback for professional development, and inform personnel decisions. States must develop guidelines for these systems, and if they fail to meet the requirements, they are ineligible for the ESEA waiver package. States with approved ESEA flexibility packages had to develop evaluation and support systems by specific school years, pilot the systems, and have a plan to use them for improvement by a certain date. States in the third window of approval had similar requirements but with later timelines. The ESEA flexibility package required states to implement evaluation and support systems by specific school years, pilot the systems, and have a plan to use them for improvement. This section examines issues related to the Common Core State Standards but is not exhaustive. The RTT program and ESEA waiver package incentivized states to adopt college- and career-ready standards, with the Common Core State Standards being the most widely available option. Critics argue that the incentives provided were unconstitutionally coercive, making it difficult for states to reject the Common Core State Standards. Initiatives incentivized states to adopt Common Core State Standards, making it challenging for states to reject them. Court views state participation in such programs as voluntary, supported by Supreme Court doctrine on congressional authority. Concerns exist about national standards and assessments resulting from adoption and implementation of the standards. Despite efforts to develop Common Core State Standards and aligned assessments, there will not be a single set of national standards or assessments in reading and math. States adopting Common Core can add their own standards, resulting in unique state standards with common elements. There will be at least two different assessments linked to Common Core, according to a recent survey by Education Week. Based on a recent survey by Education Week, it seems that 17 states plan to use assessments other than those developed by PARCC and Smarter Balanced for Common Core State Standards. Some states using consortium tests may only do so for certain grade levels. The Common Core State Standards do not equate to a national curriculum, as standards dictate what should be taught while curriculum helps implement them. States have the autonomy to decide how to teach standards and prepare students for assessments. If states working with Common Core collaborated on materials, it could benefit implementation. Multiple states may use similar materials in the classroom if textbook publishers align with the Common Core State Standards. While 43 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, debates are ongoing in some states. Indiana initially adopted the standards but later dropped them, passing legislation for new college- and career-readiness standards. Indiana developed new standards similar to Common Core State Standards, leading to a one-year extension of its ESEA flexibility package. Other states, like Oklahoma, have also opted to drop the Common Core State Standards. Oklahoma and South Carolina are making changes to their academic standards. Oklahoma plans to develop more rigorous standards than the Common Core State Standards but has been denied an extension for its ESEA flexibility package. South Carolina will implement Common Core for one more year before adopting new standards due to changes in state law. State officials are considering new standards for the upcoming school year, with some changes resembling the Common Core State Standards. South Carolina received a one-year extension for its ESEA flexibility package, indicating satisfaction with their plans. Some states, like Alabama, are contemplating dropping the Common Core State Standards. The consequences of abandoning these standards vary depending on previous grant approvals. States using Common Core State Standards for ESEA flexibility or Title I-A must comply to grant terms or risk consequences like fund withholding. Hawaii faced repercussions for not meeting grant commitments. Hawaii accessed grant funds on a cost reimbursement basis, submitting receipts for approval before drawing funds. Extensive monitoring and reporting were required by ED, threatening fund withholding if progress was not shown. Georgia had $9.9 million withheld for not implementing a performance-based compensation system. If a state is out of compliance with RTT requirements due to not using Common Core State Standards, ED could withhold funds or revoke ESEA flexibility package. This would result in the state reverting to operating under current ESEA law requirements. The Secretary may take actions in response to a state dropping Common Core State Standards, including discussing the change with the state and considering next steps. There is precedent for rescinding an ESEA flexibility package if a state fails to comply with the requirements. The state's request to extend its ESEA flexibility package for the 2014-2015 school year was denied by the ED due to failure to submit final guidelines for teacher and principal evaluation. This means the state must comply with ESEA current law requirements unless it meets flexibility package requirements before the school year. If a state changes its standards after adopting Common Core, it would need to adopt new standards to meet Title I-A requirements. Failure to adopt and implement new standards could jeopardize the state's Title I-A funding and funding for programs based on Title I-A funding. ED has broad enforcement authority under GEPA, allowing the Secretary to withhold payments if a recipient fails to comply with legal requirements. The Secretary has enforcement options for non-compliance with Title I-A requirements, including withholding payments, issuing complaints, and entering into compliance agreements. Educators are concerned about the rapid implementation of new standards, assessments, and evaluation systems. Various education organizations have criticized the timeline for implementing curriculum and teacher evaluations related to the Common Core State Standards. The National Association of Elementary School Principals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, and National School Boards Association support the Common Core State Standards but express concerns about lack of teacher preparation and principal readiness for implementation. They emphasize the need for time to adjust to the new standards and assessments. The Department of Education may allow states an additional year for teacher implementation. The Department of Education may allow states to delay using new teacher and principal evaluation systems for up to one additional year, based on their approved timeline. This flexibility is granted to states needing to make substantive changes to their implementation of these systems. The Department of Education may provide states with additional flexibility in implementing teacher and principal evaluation systems, offering targeted adjustments to implementation steps, timelines, and sequencing. This flexibility will not be granted to states with laws preventing them from meeting the requirements of the ESEA flexibility package. In August 2014, the Department of Education announced additional flexibilities for states transitioning to new assessments aligned with college- and career-ready standards. States may receive an extra year to incorporate student growth on state assessments into evaluation systems during the transition. During the transition to new assessments, states can incorporate student growth on state assessments into evaluation systems with certain assurances. This includes using multiple measures of student growth and providing teachers and principals with their student growth data for information purposes. Requests for implementation flexibility will be considered on a case-by-case basis. SEAs requesting extension of ESEA flexibility beyond 2014-2015 school year must provide progress updates on implementing evaluation and support systems, reasons for proposed changes, and steps for continuous improvement. Requests must include required assurances for eligibility. The current ESEA flexibility requests include teacher and principal evaluation and support systems. The assessments by PARCC and Smarter Balanced are computer-based, requiring schools to have access to technology. Disparities exist in technology distribution among schools, impacting students' ability to take computer-based tests. Some LEAs faced technical difficulties during online assessments in 2013, raising concerns about administering Common Core aligned tests online. Paper-and-pencil tests may be an alternative for states unable to meet technological requirements. The PARCC and Smarter Balanced assessments are moving away from paper-and-pencil tests in the long term. Paper-and-pencil options will be available for the first few years of testing, but concerns remain about the long-term viability of these tests. The CCSSI plans to work with stakeholders to revise the Common Core State Standards as needed, but it is unclear if all states involved in the development will continue to be involved in making changes. Questions are being raised about the cost of implementing and updating the Common Core State Standards, as well as who will pay for the development of teaching materials and professional development for staff. It is uncertain how the assessments aligned with the standards will be funded over time, with the possibility of states using funds from the State Assessment Grant program if federal funding is not provided. The Common Core State Standards and related assessments were not mandated by the federal government, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of the testing methods. The Administration has encouraged states to adopt Common Core State Standards through RTT grants and ESEA flexibility. 43 states and DC have adopted these standards, which must be aligned with assessments under ESEA Title I-A. ARRA funds supported the development of assessments aligned with Common Core State Standards. Congress may consider amending the ESEA to require states to use Common Core State Standards for assessments, which would be more prescriptive than current law. Alternatively, states could choose to use the Common Core standards but would not be mandated to do so. Congress could choose to amend the ESEA to allow states the option to use the Common Core State Standards for assessments without being required to do so. This could involve eliminating incentives for states to adopt the Common Core standards and making changes to existing accountability requirements. Congress may modify the current statutory language to require the use of \"college- and career-ready standards\" instead of \"challenging\" academic content standards. This change could potentially allow states to use the Common Core State Standards to meet new requirements. Additionally, Congress may amend prohibitions in Title I and Title IX of the ESEA and clarify the Secretary's authority with respect to conditioning the receipt of funds. The curr_chunk discusses the Secretary's authority in conditioning federal aid on compliance with requirements like standards and assessments. It includes state-by-state information on Race to the Top grants, Common Core State Standards adoption, and ESEA flexibility package applications. The prev_chunk mentions the potential use of Common Core State Standards to meet new requirements and possible amendments to Title I and Title IX of the ESEA. The curr_chunk provides a list of acronyms used in the report, including ARRA, AYP, CCSSI, CCSSO, ED, ELA, ESEA, DODEA, GEPA, IHE, LEA, NCLB, NGA, PARCC, SEA, and RTT."
