    "content": "This report provides Congress with official data on transfers of conventional arms to developing nations by major suppliers from 2007 to 2014. It updates a previous report and helps Congress identify supplier-purchaser relationships in weapons acquisitions, aiding in oversight of the international weapons trade's impact on U.S. national interests. Maintaining regional stability and security of allies have long been key elements of U.S. foreign policy. The report provides Congress with data on arms transfers to developing nations by major suppliers from 2007 to 2014. It helps Congress evaluate policy questions related to arms sales and control arrangements, focusing on the potential for regional conflicts in the developing world. During the Cold War, the US and Soviet Union provided conventional weapons to friendly states as part of foreign policy. Post-Cold War, US arms transfer policy focuses on enhancing allies' ability to address regional security threats. Global patterns of arms transfers have shifted, with relationships between suppliers and recipients adapting to changing circumstances. During the Cold War, the US and Soviet Union provided conventional weapons to friendly states as part of foreign policy. Post-Cold War, US arms transfer policy focuses on enhancing allies' ability to address regional security threats. Global patterns of arms transfers continue to evolve in response to changing political, military, and economic circumstances, with economic considerations playing a significant role. Developing nations remain the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity, accounting for a significant percentage of international arms transfer agreements. In 2014, arms deliveries to developing nations accounted for 44% of the global value of all international arms deliveries. The data in this new report for 2007-2014 supersede previous editions and should be used for comparison. U.S. commercial arms export deliveries values are excluded, as well as arms transfers to subnational groups. The report provides a detailed listing of arms transfer agreements worldwide in 2014, with the United States leading at $36.2 billion and Russia ranking second at $10.2 billion. The total value of arms agreements globally increased slightly from 2013 to $71.8 billion. In 2014, the United States and Russia collectively accounted for over $46 billion in international arms transfer agreements, representing 64.6% of all agreements made by suppliers globally. Developing nations accounted for 86% of all arms transfer agreements worldwide in 2014. In 2014, the United States led in global arms deliveries, making $12.2 billion, followed by Russia at $9.2 billion and France at $5.1 billion. These top three suppliers collectively delivered $26.5 billion, accounting for 56.6% of all arms delivered worldwide. The total value of international arms deliveries in 2014 was $46.8 billion, a decrease from the previous year. In 2014, global arms deliveries totaled $46.8 billion, with the United States leading at $12.2 billion, followed by Russia at $9.2 billion and France at $5.1 billion. Developing nations received 44% of all international arms deliveries in 2014, with worldwide weapons orders increasing slightly to $71.8 billion. The United States' arms agreements value rose to $36.2 billion in 2014, giving it a market share of 50%. In 2014, global arms agreements totaled $46.8 billion, with the United States leading at $12.2 billion, followed by Russia at $9.2 billion and France at $5.1 billion. France saw an increase in worldwide agreements from $3.4 billion in 2013 to $4.4 billion in 2014, while Russia had a slight decline from $10.3 billion to $10.2 billion. The collective market share of major West European suppliers was approximately 11% in 2014. The international arms market is not likely growing overall due to constraints like the global economy's weakened state. The Eurozone financial crisis and slow international recovery from the 2008 recession have limited defense purchases. Many nations defer or limit new major weapons systems, focusing on upgrades and support services instead. Despite reduced demand for major weapons, sales of upgrades and support services remain lucrative. Competition among sellers has increased as new arms sales become more challenging. Arms suppliers are targeting new clients in regions where they have not traditionally sold weapons. To stay competitive in a stagnant market, suppliers are offering flexible financing options and guarantees of counter-trade to secure new orders. Competition between European nations, the United States, and consortia is expected to intensify, especially in less affluent developing nations. Competition between European nations, the United States, and consortia for arms sales is intense, especially in regions like the Near East and Asia. Wealthy developing nations demand cost offsets, advanced technology transfer, and domestic production options in their arms contracts. European suppliers use foreign arms sales to support domestic weapons development programs. The intense competition for arms sales between European nations, the United States, and consortia is driven by wealthy developing nations demanding cost offsets, technology transfer, and domestic production options in their contracts. Major arms suppliers are emphasizing joint production with other developed nations to share costs and preserve productive capacity. Some nations focus on niche weapons categories where they have specialized production capabilities for a competitive advantage. Consolidation of domestic defense industries in key weapons-producing nations is also occurring to enhance competitiveness. Consolidation of domestic defense industries in key weapons-producing nations is happening to enhance competitiveness. Some developing nations with significant financial assets are launching new and costly weapons-procurement programs, funded by income from oil sales. Dependency on oil imports has caused difficulties for oil-consuming states, leading to the curtailment or deferral of new weapons acquisitions. The impact of significant oil declines since the end of 2014 on global arms purchases is not covered in this report. Despite international economic volatility, some nations in the Near East and Asia regions have resumed or continued large weapons procurement programs. In the Near East and Asia regions, some developing nations like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and India have resumed or continued large weapons purchases. Economic strength plays a significant role in their decisions. Other regions like Latin America and Africa are also seeking to modernize their military forces through large arms orders. Financial constraints limit the weapons these countries can purchase. In the Near East and Asia regions, developing nations like Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and India are making significant weapons purchases based on economic strength. Other regions such as Latin America and Africa are also looking to modernize their military forces through large arms orders. Financial constraints limit the weapons these countries can purchase, leading to selective military acquisitions. The arms market in developing nations was dominated by the United States and Russia since 2011, with a total arms transfer agreements value of $61.8 billion in 2014. Since 2011, the United States and Russia have been the top players in the arms market for developing nations. The US accounted for $115 billion in arms transfer agreements from 2011 to 2014, while Russia made $41.7 billion during the same period. Together, they made 63.1% of all such agreements. France was the third leading supplier with nearly $14.2 billion in agreements during these years. In the earlier period (2007-2010), Russia ranked second with $35.9 billion in agreements, and the US made $65.9 billion. During the period 2007-2014, the United States and Russia were the top players in arms transfer agreements with developing nations. The US consistently ranked first, while Russia competed closely, especially with high-value agreements with India. Russia also made sales efforts in the Near East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. Russia has increased sales efforts in Latin America, focusing on Venezuela. It offers flexible payment arrangements, including forgiving debts to secure new arms purchases. Russia also improves follow-on support services for its weaponry to attract clients. France and the United Kingdom have been successful in arms sales to developing countries from 2007 to 2014. The United States remains a key arms supplier to developing nations, with a diverse client base and ongoing arms agreements. It provides upgrades, spare parts, and support services for previously sold weapon systems, ensuring a steady stream of orders. Despite competition from other major suppliers, the US is likely to maintain its position due to its ability to cater to nations able to afford major new weapons. The United States remains a key arms supplier to developing nations, with a diverse client base and ongoing arms agreements. Arms transfers to less-affluent developing nations are constrained by budget limitations. The values of arms transfer agreements with developing nations increased from 2007 to 2010 but declined in 2010, reaching a peak in 2011 at nearly $77 billion. The increase in agreements with developing nations was driven by sales to more affluent countries, especially key oil-producing states in the Persian Gulf. The United States remains a major arms supplier to developing nations, with a focus on sales to affluent countries in the Persian Gulf seeking advanced weaponry. Non-major arms suppliers like China have also secured some agreements with developing nations, but at lower levels. These suppliers have occasionally made significant arms deals, such as missile sales and light combat systems, although their individual agreement values are comparatively low. They have been successful in selling older or less-advanced equipment. The United States and other non-major arms suppliers have been successful in selling older or less-advanced equipment to developing nations. The total value of U.S. arms transfer agreements with developing nations increased from $18 billion in 2013 to nearly $29.8 billion in 2014, with the U.S. market share reaching 48.2% in 2014. The U.S. secured major arms agreements with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and South Korea in 2014, totaling nearly $30 billion. These agreements include sales of costly weapon systems, upgrades, and support services globally. The U.S. maintains a strong advantage in defense support arrangements with weapons purchasers worldwide. In 2014, major arms agreements with developing nations included deals with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Qatar, South Korea, and Russia, totaling over $30 billion. Saudi Arabia purchased TOW missiles and other weapons for $4 billion, Iraq for $1.8 billion, Qatar for over $9.6 billion, South Korea for over $7 billion, and Russia for $10.1 billion. In 2014, Russia's arms transfer agreements with developing nations totaled $10.1 billion, a slight decrease from the previous year. Despite the decline, Russia remained the second-largest supplier to developing countries, with notable agreements reaching a peak of $15.5 billion in 2012. This reflects Russia's successful efforts to overcome industrial production issues following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia adapted its selling practices in the developing world post-Soviet era to regain market share. Efforts include creative financing, counter-trade, and licensed production agreements to sell weapons. Russia's willingness to agree to licensed production has been crucial in arms sales to important clients like India and China. Successful sales efforts have been seen in Southeast Asia, with agreements signed with Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia. Russia has also secured major deals with Venezuela and Algeria. Its military equipment remains competitive in the developing world, appealing to less affluent nations with a range from basic to advanced armaments. Missiles and aircraft are significant exports, while naval systems play a lesser role. Funding constraints limit new research and development in military equipment. Funding constraints hinder Russia's military R&D efforts, impacting its foreign arms sales. Russia lags behind other major arms suppliers in developing weaponry, leading to limited expansion of its arms client base. Despite setbacks like the canceled Mistral agreement with France, Russia maintains important arms development and sales programs with India and China, ensuring sustained business for a decade. During the mid-1990s, Russia sold major combat fighter aircraft and main battle tanks to India, providing support services for these weapons systems. However, Russia has lost major contracts to other suppliers, jeopardizing its long-standing relationship with India. The United States is concerned about Russian arms sales in South Asia due to tensions between Pakistan and India. Russia has also been a key arms supplier to China, selling advanced aircraft and naval systems since 1996. Since 1996, Russia has sold China various fighter aircraft, destroyers, and submarines, along with other weapons systems. China's military acquisitions aim to enhance its projection capabilities in Asia. The U.S. is concerned about providing appropriate military equipment to allies in Asia to counter any potential threat from China. There have been no recent large arms agreements between Russia and China, with the focus now on integrating previously obtained weapon systems. In recent years, Russia has sold significant weapon systems to China, including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and submarines. Tension has arisen between Russia and China over China's alleged reverse engineering of combat systems acquired from Russia. Russia has also made arms agreements with developing nations, such as selling submarines and battle tanks to Algeria, air defense systems to China, and anti-tank shells to India. China emerged as an arms supplier during the Iran-Iraq war, providing weaponry to both sides without conditions. China emerged as an arms supplier during the Iran-Iraq war, providing weaponry to both sides without conditions. Subsequently, China's arms sales have been more regional and targeted in the developing world, with the value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations averaging over $3 billion annually from 2011 to 2014. The highest value was in 2013 at $4.2 billion, with a total of $2.2 billion in 2014. China's sales reflect smaller weapons deals in Asia, Africa, and the Near East, with continuing contracts with Pakistan contributing to their totals. Few developing nations with significant financial resources have purchased Chinese military equipment during this period. China has indicated an interest in competing in the foreign arms market, particularly in Asia and Africa, with a focus on small arms and light weapons. Their weapons systems for export are based on designs obtained from Russia, and they have been a source of missiles to some countries. China's weapons for export are less advanced than those from Western suppliers or Russia, but they are increasing promotion of their more advanced aircraft to secure contracts from developing countries. China has supplied missiles to Iran and Pakistan, raising concerns about its commitment to missile transfer restrictions. Chinese entities provide missile-related technology, hindering efforts to prevent proliferation in developing countries. China also exports small arms and light weapons to African states. China exports small arms and light weapons to African states, potentially enhancing its international political power and access to natural resources. Concerns have been raised about the control of arms sales to conflict regions, prompting efforts by the United States and the United Nations to establish an Arms Trade Treaty to regulate international arms sales. The U.N. adopted an Arms Trade Treaty as a resolution on April 2, 2013, with China and Russia abstaining. The treaty came into force on December 24, 2014, with 78 states ratifying it, including the United States. France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy are major arms suppliers in Europe. Potential arms purchasers include nations that the United States chooses not to supply for policy reasons. For example, the United Kingdom sold combat fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia in the 1980s when the U.S. did not. India considered European aircraft suppliers for a major sale, ultimately won by France. France also sold frigates to the Egyptian navy. Saudi Arabia bought Eurofighter Typhoon fighter aircraft from the UK. NATO allies generally supported the U.S. in restricting arms sales during the Cold War, but this changed in the post-Cold War period. In the post-Cold War period, European arms supplying states, especially France, prioritize national decision-making in arms sales over coordination with the United States. Economic factors drive French arms sales more than foreign policy concerns. Policy differences between the U.S. and major West European suppliers over arms transfers have increased, exemplified by France and Germany's push to lift the arms embargo on China in 2004-2005. In 2004-2005, Germany's proposal to lift the arms embargo on China was opposed by the United States, causing tension within the European Union. The major European arms suppliers saw a significant decrease in their share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations from 2013 to 2014. This shift is of interest to U.S. policymakers due to the suppliers' capability to sell advanced military equipment to countries of concern in U.S. national security policy. The major European arms suppliers experienced a decrease in their share of arms transfer agreements with developing nations from 25.4% in 2013 to 9.5% in 2014. France led with $4.3 billion in agreements in 2014, followed by Italy with $800 million. The four major West European suppliers were significant participants in the developing world arms market from 2007 to 2014, with notable years for arms agreements. In West European nations, large arms contracts with major purchasers have led to significant agreement totals. Government support has boosted the competitive position of major suppliers in weapons exports. These suppliers can produce advanced air, ground, and naval weapons systems. They have competed successfully for arms sales contracts with developing nations against the United States. The demand for U.S. weapons remains strong, especially from established clients in the global arms marketplace. The major West European suppliers face challenges in securing large new contracts with developing nations due to strong demand for U.S. defense equipment. To enhance their market share, European Union member states adopted a new code of conduct for defense procurement practices in 2005. The code aims to foster greater cooperation within the European defense equipment sector for awarding contracts. The EU aims to enhance European defense firms' competitiveness globally by promoting intra-European cooperation in defense program planning and contracting. European arms companies are phasing out certain weapons production and engaging in joint ventures to sustain their defense industrial bases. Some suppliers are collaborating with the United States in defense production ventures. The strategy of cooperating in defense production ventures with the United States, like the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), instead of competing directly, allows countries to meet their advanced combat aircraft needs and potentially share in future profits. The main markets for arms in the developing world are in the Near East and Asia, with Latin American and African nations being minor purchasers. U.S. policymakers focus on maintaining stability in these regions through arms sales and transfers that align with this goal. The report highlights significant arms sales by various suppliers to regions with minimal military threats. Different suppliers have varying perspectives on appropriate arms sales, with financial gain sometimes outweighing other considerations. The data on arms transfers can help policymakers identify potential concerns and review available options. The focus is on arms acquisitions in the Near East and Asia, with the United States aiming to maintain stability through strategic arms sales. The Persian Gulf crisis of August 1990-February 1991 led to major arms purchases in the Near East, establishing the U.S. as the guarantor of Gulf security. GCC states, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, bought advanced weapons systems due to concerns over Iran's strategic threat. Their focus has been on air, naval, and missile defense systems. Egypt and Israel have also continued their military acquisitions. The Near East region has been the largest arms market in the developing world, with Saudi Arabia leading in arms purchases from 2007-2014. Egypt, Israel, and India have also increased their military modernization programs by buying advanced weaponry, primarily from the United States. The Near East region, led by Saudi Arabia, has been the largest arms market in the developing world from 2007-2014. The United States dominated arms agreements with the region, followed by Russia. Asia ranked second in arms transfer agreements during 2011-2014, with the United States being the top player. Russia has been a major supplier of advanced conventional weaponry to China and India in Asia, leading to an increase in arms sales in the region. They have also expanded their client base to countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, Burma, and Indonesia. India, while a significant customer of Russian arms, has started diversifying its weapons supplier base. India has diversified its weapons supplier base in recent years, purchasing various defense systems from Israel, France, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy. This shift indicates that Russia may face new competition in the Indian arms market, with India no longer consistently buying its major combat systems. In 2011, India eliminated Russia from a competition to supply combat fighter aircraft, won by France. Asia was the second-largest arms market for developing nations, with Russia leading in arms transfer agreements with the region in 2007-2010. The United States ranked first in arms transfer agreements with Asia in 2011-2014. In 2011-2014, the United States led in Asian arms agreements with 32.9% ($23.8 billion), followed by Russia at 24.9% ($18 billion). Saudi Arabia was the top arms purchaser from 2007-2014 with $86.6 billion in agreements, while India ranked second with $38.1 billion. Saudi Arabia was also the top arms transfer agreement holder in both 2007-2010 and 2011-2014. The total value of arms transfer agreements with developing nations from 2007 to 2014 was $425.6 billion. The United States, Russia, and major West European suppliers dominate weapons deliveries, but other European and non-European suppliers, including China, also play a significant role. Weapons deliveries to the Near East, historically the largest purchasing region, reflect the diverse sources of supply and types of conventional weaponry transferred. From 2011-2014, weapons deliveries to the region included: \n- United States: 80 tanks, 419 APCs, 32 combat aircraft, 147 artillery, 406 surface-to-air missiles\n- Russia: 190 tanks, 40 APCs, 10 combat aircraft, 1 submarine, 40 helicopters, 5,410 surface-to-air missiles\n- China: 50 artillery, 650 surface-to-air missiles\n- Major West European Suppliers: 280 APCs, 5 major surface combatants, 13 minor surface combatants, 20 combat aircraft, 70 helicopters, 50 surface-to-surface missiles, 170 anti-ship missiles\n- All Other European Suppliers: 60 tanks, 240 artillery, 430 APCs, 3 major surface combatants, 33 minor surface combatants, 20 combat aircraft\n- All Other Suppliers: 10 tanks, 140 APCs From 2011-2014, substantial quantities of major combat systems were delivered to the Near East region, including tanks, self-propelled guns, armored vehicles, supersonic combat aircraft, helicopters, air defense, and anti-ship missiles. The United States, Russia, and European suppliers delivered the majority of these systems, with other suppliers providing important naval systems and ground equipment. Aircraft platforms and naval craft are particularly expensive and constitute a large portion of the dollar values of arms deliveries to the region during this period. In the Near East region, significant weapon systems like anti-ship and surface-to-surface missiles were delivered by major suppliers from 2011-2014. Official data on arms transfer agreements with developing nations by major suppliers from 2007-2014 show recent trends in arms contract activity.

Data on actual deliveries of military equipment from 2007 to 2014 by major suppliers like the United States, Russia, and China show trends in weaponry transfers to developing nations. The tables display deliveries of military equipment to developing nations from 2007 to 2014 by major suppliers. It is important to note that the data may not accurately reflect the quality or recipient nations' capabilities to effectively use the weapons. Superior training and logistics can offset quantitative advantages in conflicts. In conventional warfare, having good equipment, tactical proficiency, and sound logistics can be more crucial than the size of a nation's weapons inventory.
