States have the option to participate and design their own versions of Medicaid within federal guidelines. Eligibility historically included low-income individuals, but recent changes will expand coverage to those under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government and states jointly fund Medicaid, providing medical services including long-term care. States can design their own versions within federal guidelines. Coverage now includes individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government pays a share of Medicaid costs, with states contributing the rest to qualify for federal funds. The report explains the FMAP calculation for Medicaid reimbursement, exceptions to the regular FMAP rate, and other related issues like state fiscal conditions and FMAP changes in the ACA. The FMAP rate, varying by state, determines Medicaid costs and is used for federal reimbursement. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate exist for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. An enhanced FMAP rate is provided for services and administration under CHIP, funded by a state's federal allotment. When a state expands Medicaid using CHIP funds, the enhanced FMAP rate applies, calculated by reducing the state share under the regular FMAP rate by 30%. The FMAP rate also determines the clawback for Medicare Part D and federal share of child support enforcement collections. The FMAP formula determines Medicaid costs and federal reimbursement, with higher rates for states with lower incomes. The formula includes a 0.45 factor to ensure states at the U.S. average income receive a 55% FMAP rate. The FMAP formula adjusts rates based on states' income levels, with higher rates for states with below-average incomes. The Department of Health & Human Services publishes FMAP rates in advance, allowing states to prepare for changes. Per capita income data used in the formula is several years old by the time rates take effect. The Department of Health & Human Services uses a three-year average of state per capita personal income data from the Department of Commerce to calculate FMAP rates. BEA revises income estimates annually and undergoes comprehensive data revisions every few years. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) revises income estimates annually, including state per capita personal income data used to calculate FMAP rates. These revisions can result in changes to a state's per capita personal income over time. NIPA definition of personal income used by BEA differs from the definition used for personal income tax purposes, excluding capital gains and including transfer receipts. The FMAP rates for states are influenced by factors such as the state economy's ability to respond to economic changes and the impact of national economic trends on different state sectors. The formula also considers per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average. The national economy is influenced by state economies, with the national response to economic changes being a sum of state responses. The U.S. per capita personal income shows small annual percentage changes due to balancing positive and negative state economies. State FMAP rates can significantly change based on comparisons to U.S. per capita personal income. Regular FMAP rates for FY2013 were calculated and published in the Federal Register, with 14 states having the minimum rate of 50% and Mississippi having the highest rate of 74.43%. Changes in FMAP rates from FY2012 to FY2013 will affect 36 states. In FY2013, regular FMAP rates will change for 36 states, with most changes being less than one percentage point. Seven states will see a slight increase, while 17 states will see a slight decrease. Five states will have an increase of more than one percentage point, and seven states will have a decrease of more than one percentage point. Nevada will have the largest increase at 3.54 percentage points, and North Dakota will have the largest decrease at 3.13 percentage points. In FY2013, FMAP rates will change for 36 states, with most changes being less than one percentage point. Two states, the District of Columbia and Louisiana, will have FMAP rates not calculated by the regular formula. The District of Columbia's rate has been set at 70% since 1998, while Louisiana will receive a disaster-recovery adjustment increase. Exceptions to the regular FMAP formula are listed in Table 1, indicating whether they are current, future, or past exceptions. During economic downturns, state Medicaid programs face increased enrollment and financial pressures. During economic downturns, state Medicaid programs face increased enrollment and financial pressures. Program enrollment increases at a faster rate due to job and income losses, leading more people to become eligible. It can be challenging to finance the state share of Medicaid costs when state revenues fall below expected levels. Researchers estimate that for every 1% increase in national unemployment, Medicaid enrollment increases by 1 million individuals. In the 2007 recession, national unemployment rose from 5.0% to 9.5%, peaking at 10.1% in 2010. Medicaid enrollment increased by 8.7% from 58.8 million in FY2008 to 67.7 million in FY2010. Medicaid enrollment increased from 58.8 million in FY2008 to 67.7 million in FY2010 due to the 2007 recession. Total state tax revenues declined by 10.2% from 2007 to 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included a temporary increase in FMAP rates to help states maintain their Medicaid programs. Medicaid accounted for 22.3% of total state budgets in SFY 2010. Medicaid expenditures were temporarily absorbed by the federal government through increased FMAP rates, moderating the impact on state budgets. State Medicaid expenditures as a percent of state general fund spending decreased from 16.9% in SFY2008 to 15.8% in SFY2010. Despite this, many states still faced budget deficits. The Government Accountability Office highlighted that states' ability to finance Medicaid costs varied based on economic conditions, revenue structure, and program design. State tax revenues have not fully rebounded despite consecutive quarters of growth. Nearly every state implemented new Medicaid cost containment policies in SFY2010, SFY2011, and SFY2012. States focused on reducing provider rates and making changes due to restrictions on eligibility standards. In SFY2012, states faced tough decisions regarding Medicaid funding after the temporary FMAP rate increase ended. To achieve state-share savings, states had to reduce overall Medicaid spending by $2 to $4 for every $1 saved in the state share, depending on the regular FMAP rate. Total federal and state Medicaid spending could be reduced by approximately $40 million, requiring a reduction of about $57 million to achieve state-share savings in a state with a 65% FMAP rate. States may be hesitant to cut nonfederal Medicaid spending due to potential loss of federal funding. Recovery from the recent recession is expected to take longer than previous ones, leading to ongoing fiscal challenges for states. The ACA introduced a disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment for states affected by major disasters. The disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment is available to states that have experienced a major disaster. To qualify, the President must have declared a disaster in the state where every county was eligible for public assistance, and the state's regular FMAP rate must have declined by at least three percentage points from the prior year. The adjusted FMAP rate is equal to the regular FMAP rate plus 50% of the difference between the current year's rate and the previous year's rate for the first year, and remains the same for subsequent years. The FMAP rate adjustment formula increases the state's rate each year if they qualify, resulting in higher assistance than projected. Louisiana met the criteria for the adjustment in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 due to disasters like Hurricane Katrina. The state's FMAP rate for each year is shown in Table 2. Louisiana's FY2011 FMAP rate was at least three percentage points lower than FY2010 due to meeting Stafford Act criteria. Louisiana's FMAP rate for FY2011 was 68.04%, FY2012 was 69.78%, and FY2013 was 61.24%, meeting Stafford Act criteria each year due to disasters like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Gustav. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) included a provision to adjust certain states' regular FMAP rates starting in FY2006. This provision was included to reflect annual updates of state per capita personal income data conducted by BEA. BEA's revisions in 2004 showed upward revisions in employer contributions to pension and welfare funds in every state. The revisions in 2004 showed an increase in employer contributions to pension and welfare funds in every state, with data for 2003 also reflecting a rise in contributions for the auto manufacturing industry. Section 614 of CHIPRA allows for adjustments to a state's regular FMAP rate if there is a significantly disproportionate employer pension and insurance fund contribution since 2003. Employer contributions are considered disproportionate if they exceed 25% of the total increase in personal income in the state for the year involved. The Federal Register notice in October 2010 outlined the process for FMAP adjustments based on significantly disproportionate employer contributions. States have until the end of FY2011 to submit data for employer contributions made between 2003 and 2008. HHS will verify the data and adjust the state's FMAP rate accordingly. If data cannot be verified, no adjustment will be made. Adjustments will involve recalculating the state's regular FMAP rate excluding disproportionate employer contributions. The Federal Register notice in October 2010 outlined the process for FMAP adjustments based on significantly disproportionate employer contributions. States have until the end of FY2011 to submit data for employer contributions made between 2003 and 2008. HHS will verify the data and adjust the state's FMAP rate accordingly, with a hold harmless provision included in CHIPRA to prevent rate reduction due to disregarded contributions exceeding 125% of the previous year's amount. The methodology for this adjustment will be addressed in a future notice. Michigan is the only state with a significantly disproportionate employer contribution in 2003. The temporary FMAP rate increase provided states with additional federal Medicaid payments, totaling $84 billion due to ARRA. The extension of the FMAP rate increase in P.L. 111-226 provided an additional $16 billion in federal payments to states. The temporary FMAP rate increase ran for 11 quarters. The temporary FMAP rate increase under ARRA ran for 11 quarters from October 2008 to June 2011, providing states with additional federal Medicaid payments. The provision included a 6.2 percentage point increase for all states, phased down to 3.2 and then 1.2 in the last two quarters, and allowed qualifying states to receive an unemployment-related increase. Each territory had the option of a 6.2 percentage point FMAP rate increase with a 15% spending cap increase. The temporary FMAP rate increase under ARRA ran for 11 quarters from October 2008 to June 2011, providing states with additional federal Medicaid payments. States had the option of choosing a 6.2 percentage point FMAP rate increase with a 15% spending cap increase or a regular FMAP rate increase with a 30% cap increase. States had to meet certain requirements to receive the ARRA FMAP rate increases. The temporary FMAP rate increase under ARRA from October 2008 to June 2011 provided states with additional federal Medicaid payments. States had to comply with requirements for prompt payment of health care providers, not deposit funds into reserve funds, and ensure local governments did not pay more than required. Table A-2 in the report shows state-by-state FMAP rates, and Table A-3 shows calculations for the third quarter of FY2011. The temporary FMAP rate increase under ARRA from October 2008 to June 2011 provided states with additional federal Medicaid payments, reducing the amount of state funding required for Medicaid services. This enabled states to avoid cuts in Medicaid services and use the savings for various purposes. Providing additional federal aid to states facing fiscal pressures could stimulate the economy, according to CBO. The Medicaid provisions in the ACA represent a significant reform to Medicaid, with the most notable change being the expansion of eligibility to adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. This expansion is expected to increase Medicaid enrollment by 9 million in FY2014, significantly increasing Medicaid expenditures with the federal government covering most of the costs. The ACA Medicaid expansion will cover a majority of costs for newly eligible individuals, defined as nonelderly adults with income below 133% FPL. States will receive a 100% FMAP rate for providing coverage to these individuals from 2014 through 2016. For \"newly eligible\" individuals, the FMAP rate will phase down to 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% afterward. \"Expansion states\" will receive increased FMAP rates for individuals enrolled in the new eligibility group for nonelderly, nonpregnant adults at or below 133% FPL. Expansion states are those that offered health benefits coverage meeting certain criteria statewide to parents and nonpregnant childless adults at least through 100% FPL as of March 23, 2010. The FMAP rates for \"expansion states\" will vary until CY2019, when both \"newly eligible\" and \"expansion state\" FMAP rates will be 90%. 11 states and the District of Columbia may meet the definition of an \"expansion state.\" An FMAP rate increase of 2.2 percentage points is available for \"expansion states\" in CY2014 and CY2015 under certain conditions. The ACA provides increased FMAP rates for certain states, primary care payment rate increases, preventive services, smoking cessation services for pregnant women, home and community-based services, and health home services for people with chronic conditions. Prior to ACA, federal CHIP allotments were provided through FY2013 based on the E-FMAP rate. The ACA increases the E-FMAP rate for CHIP expenditures from FY2016-FY2019 by 23 percentage points, up to 100%. No federal CHIP allotments are provided during this period. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan released the FY2012 House budget resolution, outlining budgetary objectives. H.Con.Res. 34 was introduced in the House on April 11, 2011. The House passed H.Con.Res. 34 on April 15, 2011, with a vote of 235-193. The committee report proposes budget savings through changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and the repeal of ACA provisions. One proposal suggests restructuring Medicaid into a block grant system, leading to significant federal spending reductions. Proponents argue that this model would make Medicaid spending more predictable for states and incentivize cost control. The proposal to restructure Medicaid into a block grant system would shift the burden of Medicaid spending growth to states, potentially leading to reductions in provider reimbursement rates, benefit packages, and eligibility. This could impact access to and quality of medical care for Medicaid enrollees, as states would need to weigh maintaining current Medicaid programs against other spending priorities. Federal Medicaid expenditures account for almost 8% of all federal spending. Medicaid expenditures make up nearly 8% of federal spending, with federal payments to states estimated at $260 billion in FY2012. The ACA's Medicaid expansion will lead to significant growth in federal Medicaid payments starting in FY2014. Efforts to control federal Medicaid spending include proposals like the House Budget Resolution and the National Commission on Fiscal Reform, which aims to save $58 billion over 10 years by eliminating certain funding mechanisms and increasing state fiscal responsibility. The President's FY2013 budget proposed Medicaid provisions to reduce federal expenditures by $55.7 billion over 10 years. This includes limiting states' use of provider taxes, changing the federal financing structure, and expanding state flexibility in benefit packages. Additionally, program integrity proposals were included in the budget. The President's FY2013 budget includes program integrity proposals to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $3.2 billion from FY2013 through FY2022. States may need to increase their share of Medicaid funding to maintain current programs, posing challenges for states already struggling with budget constraints. States would have to prioritize between maintaining Medicaid service levels and other spending priorities. Table A-1, A-2, and A-3 display FMAP rates under ARRA for FY2009 to FY2011. Regular FMAP rates for FY2013 range from 50% to 73%. Rates will decrease for 24 states, increase for 12 states, and remain the same for 14 states and DC. Temporary FMAP rate increases ended in June 2011. In FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011, FMAP rates increased, providing states with additional funds. The temporary increase phased down each quarter in FY2011, ending in June 2011. Mississippi received the highest FMAP rate in FY2011. In FY2011, FMAP rates varied across states, with some receiving the lowest rates consistently. 27 states were protected from rate declines, and 43 states had the highest unemployment adjustment in the third quarter. North Dakota did not receive an adjustment due to its stable unemployment rate."
