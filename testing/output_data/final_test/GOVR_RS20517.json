    "content": "The primary international organization for coordinating restrictions on dual-use exports was COCOM, formed in 1949 to limit military-related transfers to Communist countries. It consisted of 17 industrial countries and operated on the basis of \"consensus,\" giving any member, usually the United States, a veto over exports. Meetings were held in Paris to agree on technical specifications for dual-use items. The COCOM organization controlled the export of dual-use items to Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and China. They created lists of controlled items and member countries incorporated these into their export control laws. Implementation depended on each member's export control laws and enforcement. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, COCOM members agreed to disband COCOM in November 1993 and replace it with a new entity. This new approach, called \"national discretion,\" allowed each country to determine its own export decisions without the need for approval from other countries. The Clinton Administration worked to create a replacement for COCOM, resulting in the establishment of the Wassenaar Arrangement in December 1995. This new agreement focused on conventional weapons exports and sensitive dual-use items with military applications. The Wassenaar Arrangement, established in December 1995, focuses on conventional arms exports and sensitive dual-use items with military applications. It is seen as a key part of the Clinton Administration's efforts to promote multilateral restraint in arms sales and transfers of military technologies. The agreement does not introduce any new concepts in the realm of multilateral conventional arms control. The Wassenaar Arrangement, established in December 1995, focuses on conventional arms exports and sensitive dual-use items with military applications. The agreement faces challenges due to lack of consensus among parties on weapons sales and control areas. Initial negotiations expanded to include new members, and a joint statement was issued at the January 1994 Moscow summit. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev welcomed the decision to establish a new multilateral regime and expressed Russia's desire to join. However, the US opposed Russia's accession due to ongoing weapons sales to Iran. The issue was resolved in June 1995 when Russia agreed to halt new weapons contracts with Iran and refrain from selling nuclear reprocessing equipment. This agreement was in line with the \"agreed membership criteria\" of the Wassenaar Arrangement. China has not been invited to join the new export control regime due to concerns about its weapons exports to Iran and Pakistan. The former Soviet Union countries have been working on developing adequate export controls since 1991. The attention given to developing export controls by newly independent countries varies. There is uncertainty about their capabilities and willingness to support export controls, including the Wassenaar Arrangement. The policy concern includes targeting countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya, and North Korea, but some prefer a general objective of promoting security and stability without targeting specific states. The Wassenaar Arrangement is not directed against any specific state or group of states. France, Germany, and Russia oppose a U.S. proposal for advance notification of arms sales to regions of concern. Under the Wassenaar Arrangement, member states have policies banning arms exports to Iran, Libya, Iraq, and North Korea. The U.S. will insist on new members adhering to these policies. No country in the arrangement is currently transferring arms to Afghanistan. The Wassenaar Arrangement controls exports of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies. Members share information on sensitive items. Arms transfer reporting is limited. Regime organization and operations are debated. National discretion with coordination is favored over strong controls. The U.S. no longer dominates as under COCOM. The Wassenaar Arrangement involves sharing information on potential threats and examining weapons acquisition trends. Members must provide details on global arms transfers and denials, regularly updating lists to reflect advancements. The Arrangement aims for more intensive consultations among major weapons suppliers. The Wassenaar Arrangement involves consultations and information sharing among major weapons suppliers to detect and prevent dangerous acquisition patterns. Participating states report transfers of sensitive dual-use goods and technology, as well as conventional arms deliveries biannually. The Wassenaar Arrangement involves data exchange on arms deliveries and denials of export licenses for sensitive dual-use items among participants. Undercutting is allowed, but participants must notify others within 60 days of approving a similar export that was previously denied. Reporting proposals were made at the December 1999 plenary session. At the December 1999 plenary session of Wassenaar Arrangement members, the U.S. proposed specific export reporting, including all listed items, pre-export reporting, and a \"no undercut rule.\" Russian and Ukrainian delegates blocked these reforms, leading to a joint statement on enforcement. Member states continued to address threats from MANPADS exports in subsequent meetings until 2005. Member states reaffirmed commitment to prevent acquisition of conventional arms by terrorists, agreed to best practice guidelines for small arms exports, and imposed strict controls on arms brokering. Concerns exist about compliance with membership criteria by states with weak export control systems. The United States is exploring ways to induce other states to comply with higher standards for evaluating sensitive technology transfers. This includes considering legislation to sanction nations that transfer weapons and technology to aggressive nations. Additionally, there is a discussion on whether emphasizing oversight mechanisms in U.S. law, such as the Arms Export Control Act, could help achieve the goals of the Wassenaar Arrangement."
