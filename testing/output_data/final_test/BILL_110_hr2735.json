    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Wildlife Refuge System Operations Enhancement Act of 2007\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress finds that the National Wildlife Refuge System is a unique network of Federal lands with 547 refuges covering 96 million acres, providing wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities. The System was established by the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, a landmark law. The National Wildlife Refuge System celebrated its 100th anniversary with the creation of the National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial Commission and increased funding. However, funding for refuge operations has since declined, leading to financial challenges for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is facing challenges with 600 vacant positions out of 9,000 employees, 86 closed refuges, and 188 unstaffed refuges. The National Wildlife Refuge System is in a conservation deficit according to the Cooperative Alliance for Refuge Enhancement. In the Northeast Region, 74 percent of refuges are projected to operate in the red within three years. The National Wildlife Refuge System is facing a funding crisis, with a high percentage of refuges operating in the red or at crisis levels. It is crucial for Congress to appropriate additional funds and establish new funding mechanisms to address operational deficits. The purpose of the Act is to establish new funding mechanisms to cover the unfunded costs of operating and maintaining the Refuge System. SEC. 101. PRICE OF STAMP. The Duck Stamp Act is amended to increase the price of stamps from $20 for hunting years 2008-2010 to $25 for each hunting year after 2010. Additionally, there are limitations on the application of the amendment before July 1, 2008. Additional funds uses are also specified in the Act. The Duck Stamp Act is amended to increase stamp prices to $25 after 2010. Excess funds from stamp sales over $15 will support national wildlife refuge operations. SEC. 102.
