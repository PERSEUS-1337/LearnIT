    "content": "The number of foreign-born people in the US is at a record high of 37 million, making up 12.4% of the population. There are naturalized citizens, legal residents, and unauthorized residents. The immigration system is considered broken, with debates on whether to reform specific elements or comprehensively reform the Immigration and Nationality Act. President George W. Bush has prioritized comprehensive immigration reform in his second term, including increased border security, enforcement of immigration laws, overhaul of temporary worker visas, expansion of permanent legal immigration, and revisions to the immigration preference system. Some in his administration proposed a point system for prospective immigrants based on attributes like education and work experience. The immigration issues in the United States revolve around unauthorized aliens, legal immigration reform, border security, and enforcement of immigration laws. Future debates will focus on addressing the illegal alien population and determining the level of future permanent immigration. Congress faces the challenge of reforming the legal immigration system and ensuring sufficient resources for enforcement. Immigration enforcement involves various legal tools and policies to prevent violations of immigration laws. Enforcement issues in the United States include visa policy, border security, apprehension, detention, and removal of unauthorized aliens. Key issues for the 110th Congress are border security, worksite enforcement, alien smuggling, and the role of state and local law enforcement. Border security involves controlling official ports of entry and patrolling land and maritime borders to prevent illegal entries. Congress has passed provisions to strengthen immigration-related border security, but the need for further changes remains a question. Efforts to strengthen worksite enforcement face opposition due to concerns about increased bureaucratic burdens for employers and potential discrimination against legal workers with foreign appearances. Critics argue that the smuggling of aliens poses a significant risk to national security and public safety, as terrorists may exploit existing smuggling routes to enter undetected. Alien smuggling utilizes existing routes and organizations to enter undetected, generating billions for criminal enterprises and leading to collateral crimes. Efforts to tighten laws on alien smuggling have faced opposition from religious and humanitarian groups. Concerns exist about the adequacy of resources for immigration law enforcement, with increased funding directed to border enforcement over interior enforcement. The debate continues on whether DHS has enough resources for border security, with some suggesting more involvement from state and local law enforcement. Questions arise about the authority of these officers to enforce all immigration laws, including civil violations and criminal punishments. The debate surrounding immigration policy in the U.S. involves issues such as legal status, criminal punishments, resources for law enforcement agencies, and the balance between various stakeholders' interests. Key principles of current U.S. policy on permanent immigration include temporary and permanent admissions, as well as legalization and status adjustment for aliens not currently eligible for legal status. The U.S. immigration policy focuses on principles like family reunification, skilled immigrants, refugee protection, and diversity in admissions by country. Legal permanent residents (LPRs) are foreign nationals living permanently in the U.S., with 57.8% entering based on family ties in FY2005. Other categories include employment-based LPRs and refugees/asylees adjusting to LPR status. Advocates are pushing for increased legal immigration and potential reallocation between visa categories. The desire for higher levels of employment-based immigration is complicated by significant backlogs in family-based immigration due to the sheer volume of eligible aliens. Citizens and LPRs often wait years for relatives' petitions to be processed and visa numbers to become available. Some question whether the U.S. can accommodate higher immigration levels, citing costs borne by local communities due to population growth. The INA allows for temporary admission of nonimmigrants for specific purposes. The United States allows temporary admission of foreign nationals for various purposes, including tourism, education, and work. Temporary worker provisions include visas such as H-1B for professional workers, H-2A for agricultural workers, and H-2B for nonagricultural workers. Other categories for employment-related purposes include B-1 for business visitors, E visa for treaty traders and investors, and L-1 for intracompany transfers. There is a legislative response to skills mismatches and labor shortages by increasing the supply of temporary foreign workers, both skilled and unskilled. Pressure to increase unskilled temporary foreign workers, known as guest workers, is met with opposition citing lack of evidence for labor shortages. Critics argue that rising salaries would indicate a shortage and that employers prefer guest workers for lower wages and less demanding conditions. The debate on immigration reform is complicated by proposals for unauthorized aliens to become legal residents, with requirements such as meeting conditions and paying penalties. Proposed requirements for unauthorized aliens to become legal residents include documenting physical presence, employment history, tax payment, and leaving the US. Options like a point system or guest worker visas are also considered. The DREAM Act could allow unauthorized alien students to become LPRs. The policy challenge is balancing protection of vulnerable people, homeland security, and preventing abuse of humanitarian policies. Topics include refugee admissions. The 110th Congress will focus on refugee admissions, asylum reform, temporary protected status, unaccompanied alien children, victims of trafficking and torture, and other humanitarian relief from removal. The debate revolves around the rights, privileges, benefits, and duties of aliens in the United States, including due process rights, tax liabilities, military service, federal assistance eligibility, educational opportunities, and pathways to citizenship. The 109th Congress passed immigration law overhauls but did not agree on comprehensive reform. In December 2005, the House passed H.R. 4437, focusing on border security, immigration enforcement, employment verification, and worksite enforcement. In May 2006, the Senate passed S. 2611, which included provisions on enforcement, legal immigration reform, expanded guest worker visas, and pathways to legal permanent residency for certain unauthorized aliens in the United States. The Senate's comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2007 aimed to allow unauthorized aliens in the US to become legal permanent residents by meeting requirements and paying penalty fees. The bill included provisions for employment verification, interior immigration enforcement, border security, legal immigration revision, and temporary worker programs. Despite a bipartisan compromise negotiated with the Bush Administration, the bill failed a key cloture vote in June 2007. The Senate's comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2007 failed a key cloture vote on June 28, 2007. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration held multiple hearings in April, May, and June on various aspects of immigration reform."
