    "content": "The VVSG replaced the federal voluntary VSS developed under the FEC in response to concerns about the voting technology industry. The VSS were in effect until 2007, with the first version released in 1990. The NASED certification program improved voting system performance. The FEC approved the second version in May 2002. The FEC updated the VSS in 1997 and approved the second version in May 2002. HAVA provided a statutory basis for the VSS, renamed guidelines, and established an administrative structure under the EAC. The 2005 VVSG focused on usability, accessibility, and security, with major revisions in those areas. HAVA's accessibility requirements took effect in January 2006. The 2005 VVSG focused on usability, accessibility, and security, with major revisions in those areas. HAVA's accessibility requirements took effect in January 2006, leading to new security requirements for voting systems, including paper-audit-trail requirements. The 2007 draft VVSG have been completely rewritten to provide specifications and requirements for computer-assisted voting systems. The guidelines for certification of voting systems provide details of the testing process and suggested practices for election officials. They are aimed at vendors, testing laboratories, and election officials, with many states requiring adherence to them or similar state standards. The guidelines have acquired regulatory force as manufacturers treat them as requirements, although states are exempt from mandatory compliance under HAVA. The VVSG serves as a source of specifications for new voting systems developed by companies and is used by independent laboratories for certification testing. State officials may also use the VVSG for certification tests, while private citizens face restrictions from vendors. HAVA does not specify guidelines for voting systems but requires NIST to support the development of guidelines for security, voter privacy, and fraud prevention. The EAC provides guidance for implementing requirements, but it is not a technical standard. States are responsible for implementing voting system requirements. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) does not provide specific guidelines for voting systems but requires NIST to develop guidelines for security, voter privacy, and fraud prevention. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) offers guidance for implementing requirements, which are voluntary. States must ensure that voting systems meet standards for auditability, accessibility, and error correction by voters. The Voting System Standards (VVSG) cover similar topics as the previous Voting System Standards (VSS), including functional capabilities like security, accuracy, and auditing. The curr_chunk discusses various requirements for voting systems, including security, accuracy, error recovery, system integrity, auditing, election management, human factors, vote tabulation, telecommunications, data retention, ballot preparation, maintenance, transportation, and storage. It also covers performance, design, construction, and maintenance requirements for hardware and software, as well as essential security capabilities and voter-verified paper trails. The curr_chunk discusses new requirements for voter-verified paper trails (VVPAT) in voting systems, quality-assurance programs, best practices for election officials, specifications for vote-verification systems, and the certification testing process. Issues raised about the VVSG include the voluntary nature of the guidelines and the need for congressional attention. The curr_chunk discusses the voluntary nature of voting system standards, with some calling for mandatory adherence or tying it to federal grants. Critics argue that mandatory standards could limit state and local government flexibility. Standards can only address issues considered during development, and the VSS certification process has been criticized for not anticipating security weaknesses in some systems. The 2005 VVSG strengthened security requirements for voting systems, while the 2007 draft aimed to require more realistic testing conditions. The development of VVSG standards can be a lengthy process, with HAVA creating a complex development process. Some suggest a four-year development cycle to allow systems to be used for two federal election cycles without recertification. The development of the VVSG standards has faced criticism for being slow and cumbersome, with funding issues also being a concern. Some suggest a four-year development cycle to allow systems to be used for two federal election cycles without recertification. Funding for the EAC has been a point of contention, with calls for its abolishment. The development of plans for certification testing has raised issues regarding public trust and proprietary vendor information. Critics argue that the selection process for testing laboratories lacks independence and creates conflicts of interest. Despite criticisms, the HAVA process is seen as an improvement over the previous slow and expensive system. However, no voting systems have been certified by the EAC for the 2008 federal election yet. The 2005 VVSG revisions are seen as inadequate by some, who believe more comprehensive changes are needed to address accessibility, language, and security concerns. Others argue that the limited changes are more feasible in the short term. There is debate over whether the guidelines have too many new certification requirements for an interim document, with conflicting opinions on the appropriate balance. The 2007 draft revisions of the VVSG may lead some states to reconsider using them for certification due to concerns about restrictions and costs. The EAC needs to consider this as they revise the draft. The VVSG played a role in the 2006 and 2008 federal elections, with the next version likely to take effect around 2009. State or local jurisdictions may choose to enforce VVSG requirements earlier. Some vendors may need to meet VVSG requirements sooner, especially for jurisdictions requiring a voter-verifiable paper audit trail for DREs. Concerns exist about states not following VVSG and potential non-compliance with HAVA. Uncertainties remain about the adequacy of systems acquired to meet HAVA requirements. HAVA mandates NIST to provide technical support for computerized statewide voter registration lists, but there are no widely accepted standards for these lists, raising implementation concerns. The 2005 VVSG do not cover voter registration, but the 2007 draft addresses electronic pollbooks and proprietary software used in voting systems. Critics argue for inspecting all software, including COTS, during certification for public trust, while others believe it would hinder innovation and increase costs. Vote verification, including VVPAT, is also a key issue. The controversy over the security of DREs has sparked interest in improved vote verification features, including voter-verified paper audit trails (VVPAT). While some believe VVPAT should be required, others question its value and potential problems. State-level trends towards paper ballots raise concerns about reconciling accessibility requirements with current technology constraints. Bills have been introduced to make paper ballots a federal requirement. The 2007 draft VVSG proposes making paper ballots a federal requirement to ensure voting systems are \"software independent\" and prevent undetectable changes to election results. Controversy surrounds the proposal, with uncertainty about potential revisions by the EAC."
