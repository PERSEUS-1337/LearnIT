    "content": "Authority for secret sessions in the House and Senate is found in Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution. Rules and precedents govern the implementation of secret sessions in both chambers. In the House, Rule XVII, clause 9 dictates when a secret session may be held, such as for confidential communications from the President or when a Member requests secrecy. Secret sessions can be initiated by a special rule, a motion, or unanimous consent. In the House, a motion to resolve into a secret session is allowed, but not in the Committee of the Whole. If the motion is approved by a simple majority, the chamber and galleries are cleared, and only Members, authorized officials, and essential staff are present for the secret session. The Member making the motion is then given time for debate. In the House, a motion can be made for a secret session to determine if classified information should be made public. In the Senate, any Senator can move for a closed session, which must be seconded, and the Senate will proceed immediately. The presiding officer has no discretion and the motion is not debatable. Once in a secret session, the Senate follows specific rules. Rule XXIX and Rule XXXI in the Senate govern closed sessions. Rule XXIX outlines who can stay during closed sessions, with the presiding officer having discretion to include additional staff. Rule XXXI allows Senate business to be conducted in open session, but a majority vote can determine certain matters to be discussed in secret. Impeachment trials allow closed-door deliberations, with specific rules in place. Members and staff are prohibited from disclosing information from secret sessions, with Senate staff sworn to secrecy. In the Senate, staff are sworn to secrecy, while in the House, staff must sign an oath not to reveal what happens in secret sessions. Violations of secrecy are punishable by disciplinary rules, with potential consequences including loss of seniority, fines, reprimands, censure, or expulsion. The proceedings of a secret session are not published unless the chamber votes to release them. If the House decides not to release the transcript, it is referred to the appropriate committee(s) for evaluation. The House and Senate have procedures for handling secret session transcripts. If a committee decides not to release the transcript, it becomes part of noncurrent records and is transferred to the Clerk of the House for eventual public release after 30 years. The Senate keeps secret session transcripts in the Office of Senate Security until a vote removes the secrecy injunction. The Senate historically met in secret sessions until 1794, with executive sessions remaining closed until 1929. Since then, 57 secret sessions have been held for national security or impeachment matters. Notable examples include discussions on the New Start Treaty with Russia in 2010 and the impeachment of federal judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. in the same year. Secret sessions were also held during President Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999 and for the consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty in 1997. Since 1929, the Senate has held 57 secret sessions, including discussions on the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty in 1997. The House has met behind closed doors four times since 1830, with secret sessions in 1979, 1980, 1983, and 2008."
