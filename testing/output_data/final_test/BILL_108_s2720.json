    "content": "The \"Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act\" is defined in terms of appropriate congressional committees, JEM, SPLM, and SLA. The Act aims to bring peace to Sudan. Congress finds that a comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan is at risk, with the government engaging in campaigns of attacking civilian populations and restricting assistance, particularly evident in the Darfur region. The United States has supported a peace process to address the civil conflict in Sudan. The Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in Sudan was signed on June 5, 2004, amidst ongoing ethnic cleansing in Darfur by the Government of Sudan and its proxy militia, the Janjaweed, targeting the ethnically African population. United Nations officials have condemned these orchestrated campaigns. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported massive human rights violations in Darfur by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed, potentially constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity. Evidence shows a coordinated effort to target African Sudanese civilians, resulting in genocide with tens of thousands killed, women and girls raped, and villages destroyed. The conflict in Darfur has led to the displacement of 1.2 million people, with 200,000 fleeing to Chad as refugees. The Sudanese government has conducted attacks on civilians seeking refuge in Chad, resulting in violent deaths and destruction of villages. The Government of Sudan's restrictions on humanitarian access in Darfur, due to ongoing Janjaweed attacks, are causing an estimated 500 deaths daily, projected to escalate to 1,200 deaths by August 2004 and 2,400 deaths by December 2004. The Government of Chad facilitated a ceasefire in Darfur in April 2004, allowing entry of 200,000 refugees from Sudan. The SPLM's cooperation is crucial in the crisis. The SPLM's cooperation is crucial for a political settlement between the Government of Sudan, the SLA, and the JEM in Darfur. SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR, SUDAN. The Sudan Peace Act should be extended to include the Darfur region. Congress believes that a countrywide peace in Sudan is only possible if certain principles are applied to all regions, including Darfur. The parties involved in the Darfur Humanitarian Cease-fire must fulfill their obligations to allow humanitarian assistance. The United States and the international community should provide immediate humanitarian assistance in Darfur and work towards a political agreement to end the conflict. The US should continue aid in accessible areas and develop a plan to assist areas with obstructed access. Other nations should also contribute resources to save lives in the Darfur crisis. The United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes should investigate war crimes in Chad and Darfur. The US and international community should assist in deploying African Union monitors and security forces. The President should appoint a new Special Envoy to Sudan. The President should appoint a new Special Envoy to Sudan to lead peace efforts and facilitate a comprehensive solution to the conflict, including condemning the Government of Sudan's actions in Darfur and calling for an end to ethnic cleansing and violence against civilians. The text calls for protection of civilians in Darfur, unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid, release of food reserves by Sudan, and expedited aid provision by countries with economic ties to Sudan. The United Nations should deploy a force to Sudan to ensure an international humanitarian response in Darfur, including endorsing the African Union Observer and Protection Force and establishing an international commission of inquiry to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity. The right of displaced Sudanese to return to their land under safe conditions is confirmed. Sanctions should be imposed on Sudanese government officials involved in ethnic cleansing in Darfur. The US should not normalize relations with Sudan until a comprehensive peace agreement is implemented for all areas of Sudan. SEC. 5. AMENDMENTS TO THE SUDAN PEACE ACT. The Sudan Peace Act is amended to include assistance for the crisis in Darfur and comprehensive peace in Sudan. The President is authorized to provide assistance for Sudan to support a comprehensive peace agreement and address the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. Assistance can only be provided if the President submits a certification for the Government of Sudan. The President must submit a certification to Congress stating that the Government of Sudan has taken specific actions to ensure human rights, disarm militias, allow humanitarian assistance, and cooperate with international investigations. The President must certify that Sudan is cooperating with investigations in Darfur and Khartoum, prosecuting war crimes, and working with the African Union. If Sudan fails to meet these requirements, the President will suspend assistance until compliance is restored. Authorization of $300,000,000 for assistance in Darfur and eastern Chad in response to the ongoing crisis, with $200,000,000 allocated for humanitarian aid. Amounts are authorized to remain available until expended. In this section, the term 'Government of Sudan' is defined. A conforming amendment is made to Section 3(2) of the Act. Reporting requirements under the Sudan Peace Act are amended to include the conflict in the Darfur region. The President must submit a report to Congress within 60 days of the Act's enactment on the planned US response to a peace agreement for Sudan, including a modified peace process for all regions, especially Darfur, and a contingency plan for humanitarian assistance if Sudan obstructs international aid. The report may be classified."
