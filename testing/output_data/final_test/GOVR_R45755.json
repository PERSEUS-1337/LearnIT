Congress has periodically reexamined funding for scientific studies since the closure of the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) in 1996. Members have supported OTA refunding through various means since FY2002. Funding for technology assessments has been provided to GAO since FY2002, with references in appropriations and conference reports. In response to FY2019 Senate and conference reports, GAO formed a new Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics Team. The FY2019 legislative branch appropriations bill required a study on technology assessments available to Congress. Testimony and requests have advocated for restoring funding to the Office of Technology Assessment to equip Congress with technical advice for science and technology policy. The conferees direct the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to work with an external entity to produce a report on resources available to Members of Congress for science and technology policy. The report should assess the need for a separate entity to provide nonpartisan advice on these issues and determine if it duplicates existing services. The study parameters will be developed with Committees, and the final report will be shared with relevant oversight Committees. The FY2020 House-reported bill proposed $6.0 million for restarting the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), with funding available through FY2021. The re-opened OTA would provide unbiased information on technological developments like cryptocurrencies, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence to complement the work of the Government Accountability Office. Since OTA's defunding in 1995, there have been unsuccessful attempts to restore it. Since OTA's defunding in 1995, there have been unsuccessful attempts to restore the office. Congress lacks resources for in-depth technology analysis, and while GAO has increased its tech assessment activities, it cannot fully replicate OTA's capabilities. The bipartisan governance and expert resources of OTA allow for unique policy recommendations to Congress. The Senate-reported bill does not restart OTA, but the Committee looks forward to reviewing recommendations. The Committee anticipates reviewing recommendations from the National Academy of Public Administration study on science and technology options available to Congress. The new GAO Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics Team (STAA) has submitted a plan for staffing needs and services to Congress, demonstrating its value in assessing technological innovations. The STAA is providing Congress with technology assessments, technical assistance, and reports in oversight of Federal technology and science programs. The National Academy of Public Administration study recommended enhancing technology assessment capabilities of CRS and GAO, while also establishing an Office of the Congressional Science and Technology Advisor. The FY2020 act did not provide funding for restarting OTA. The report by the National Academy of Public Administration identified gaps in science and technology expertise in Congress. Funding provided will support GAO in addressing evolving science and technology issues. The National Academy of Public Administration's 2019 report highlighted the need for GAO to focus on technical assessments and short-to-medium term studies for Congress. It recommended GAO to expand outreach to the science and technology community and coordinate with CRS. GAO is encouraged to dedicate experts to its Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics team.

The Senate Appropriations Committee report addresses the centralization of IT funding within the Library of Congress, with $13,556,000 being reallocated to the Office of Chief Information Officer in fiscal year 2020.
