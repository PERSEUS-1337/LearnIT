    "content": "The \"Silent Skies Act of 2015\" aims to address aircraft and airport noise as a common nuisance issue in the United States. It highlights the implementation of stage 5 aircraft noise certification standards for new aircraft designs. The \"Silent Skies Act of 2015\" focuses on reducing aircraft and airport noise in the US by implementing stage 5 aircraft noise certification standards. The Act includes a provision for a cooperative agreement with an institution, entity, or consortium to develop and certify aircraft technology for turbojets exceeding stage 4 noise standards. The cooperative agreement requires recipients to conduct activities on a cost-shared basis and make repayments if aircraft technology developed under the agreement generates revenue. Funding of up to $10,000,000 for each fiscal year 2017-2019 is allocated, with an annual report mandated by the Administrator.

The analysis for such subchapter is amended by adding at the end the following. Aircraft noise reduction technology research, development, and implementation partnership. Prohibition on operating certain aircraft not complying with Stage 4 noise levels. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations by December 31, 2016, in consultation with the International Civil Aviation Organization, to establish minimum noise level standards for civil turbojets. Regulations will ensure that a percentage of civil turbojets with a weight over 75,000 pounds comply with stage 4 noise levels when operating to or from US airports after December 31, 2022. The regulations require that by specific dates, a percentage of turbojets operating to or from US airports must comply with stage 4 noise levels. The Secretary will also request international standards for phasing out non-compliant aircraft. The Secretary will enforce requirements for foreign-flag aircraft in line with international agreements. Air carriers must submit annual progress reports on compliance, and there is no need for recertification of retrofitted turbojets. The Secretary enforces noise level compliance for civil turbojets, with means specified for demonstrating compliance without recertification. Amendments to Section 47529 include updating compliance deadlines for nonaddition rules. Amendments are made to update compliance deadlines in Section 47529, including changing dates from November 5, 1990, to January 1, 2021. Effective date for these changes is December 31, 2020.
