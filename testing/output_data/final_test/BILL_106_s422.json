    "content": "ALASKA STATE JURISDICTION OVER SMALL HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS: Part I of the Federal Power Act is amended to include a new section granting Alaska state jurisdiction over small hydroelectric projects. The Commission will discontinue regulating qualifying project works in Alaska once the state has a regulatory program that meets certain criteria, including protecting the public interest and the environment. The text chunk discusses the requirements for a license for project works, including the protection of fish and wildlife, recreational opportunities, environmental quality, Alaska Natives' interests, and other public uses like irrigation and navigation. It also mandates the construction and maintenance of lights and signals by the licensee as directed by the Secretary of the Department where the Coast Guard operates. The Coast Guard must operate fishways prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce, control navigation facilities under rules by the Secretary of the Army, and protect wildlife based on recommendations from relevant agencies. The term 'qualifying project works' refers to project works that are not part of a licensed or exempted project, have not had a permit or license application accepted, have a power capacity of 5,000 kilowatts or less, and are located within Alaska's boundaries. The State of Alaska excludes projects on Indian reservations, conservation units, or designated river segments. Nonqualifying project works can choose state licensing. Projects on federal lands have specific regulations. The State of Alaska requires approval from the Secretary for projects on reservations, conservation units, or public lands. The Commission consults with relevant agencies before certifying Alaska's regulatory program. Federal laws on environmental protection are not preempted. Alaska must notify the Commission of any significant changes to its regulatory program. The Commission periodically reviews Alaska's regulatory program for compliance. If Alaska fails to comply, the Commission will reassert its authority. Upon the Governor's request, the Commission reviews Alaska's water-power development program to ensure compliance within one year. The Commission will review Alaska's water-power development program within one year of initiation. If the Commission fails to issue a final order within 30 days, Alaska's program will be deemed compliant with regulations. The Senate passed the bill on March 25, 1999."
