    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"David's Sling Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016\". Congress finds that Israel is threatened by missiles and rockets from adversaries in the region, including Hezbollah and Hamas who have increased their stockpile of rockets with the assistance of Iran and Syria. Hezbollah and Syria possess Large Caliber Artillery Rockets (LCARs) and Short Range Ballistic Missiles (SRBMs) that pose a mortal threat to Israeli civilians. In 2014, Hezbollah acquired advanced guided-missile systems from Syria, while Hamas militants obtained long-range M-302 missiles. The David's Sling system, part of Israel's Ballistic Missile Defense architecture, will defend against various missile threats including LCAR, TBM, and Cruise Missiles. Hamas recently acquired long-range M-302 rockets and fired them deeper into Israel. Israel and the US signed an agreement in 2008 to co-develop the system. David's Sling is expected to become operational soon, followed by Arrow 3. Each system is designed to counter specific threats with limited overlap. David's Sling provides versatile defense between Iron Dome and Arrow 2. Rapid deployment is crucial due to immediate missile threat. The fiscal year 2016 budget for these systems is $475,200,000. The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 and the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 reaffirmed the commitment to Israel's security and designated Israel as a Major Strategic Partner. $136,900,000 is needed in fiscal year 2016 for research and development, and $150,000,000 for David's Sling system procurement. Development and production of David's Sling weapons program is authorized. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to carry out activities for the David's Sling weapons program, with appropriations for procurement and research. Congress suggests a production agreement between the US and Israel for coproduction of the program. The production agreement for the David's Sling weapons program should prioritize coproduction of components at an optimal level and schedule, including funds disbursement policy, as seen in other missile defense programs."
