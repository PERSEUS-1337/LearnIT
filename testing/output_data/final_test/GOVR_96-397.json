    "content": "The relationship between the United States and Canada is based on history, proximity, commerce, and shared values. They have collaborated in various wars and continue to work together on international political and security issues. Both countries have mutual security commitments under NATO, cooperate on defense through NORAD, share intelligence through the \"Five Eyes\" group, and coordinate on law enforcement efforts to secure their border. Economic ties have deepened over the past three decades due to trade agreements. The United States and Canada have a strong relationship based on history, proximity, commerce, and shared values. They collaborate on various issues, including mutual security commitments, defense, intelligence sharing, and law enforcement efforts. Economic ties have deepened through trade agreements like the 1989 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA. The two countries have a highly integrated energy market, with Canada being the largest supplier of U.S. energy imports. Their governments have deep relationships to address common interests, and initiatives between provinces and states are common. The relationship between the United States and Canada is strong, with collaboration on various issues such as security, defense, and trade agreements. Bilateral relations have faced strains over individual matters like Canada's decision on the Iraq war and the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline. Disputes have arisen over NAFTA renegotiations and trade tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration, leading to frustration among Canadian officials and citizens. In 2017, 76% of Canadian citizens disapproved of the leadership of the United States, potentially impacting bilateral agreements and Canadian support for U.S. initiatives. Canada has historically maintained its independence from the U.S., with concerns about sovereignty and a desire to chart its own course while maintaining ties to the British Commonwealth. Some in Canada question whether cooperation with the U.S. on investment, regulations, and border issues compromises sovereignty, while others embrace a more North American approach to the relationship. Canada is a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as sovereign, represented by a Governor-General appointed by the prime minister. The government is a parliamentary democracy with a bicameral Parliament. Members of Parliament are elected under a first-past-the-post system, with the winning party forming the government. Provinces and territories have unicameral assemblies. Justin Trudeau became prime minister in 2015. Justin Trudeau became Canada's prime minister in 2015 after his Liberal Party won a majority in the House of Commons, defeating Stephen Harper's Conservative Party. Trudeau's government has implemented measures for economic growth, climate change, and foreign policy. However, his approval rating has declined, and the Liberals are now slightly behind the Conservatives in polls. The next federal election is expected by October 2019. Harper's Conservatives had governed Canada for nearly a decade before the 2015 election. The Conservative Party of Canada, led by Stephen Harper, came to power in 2006 and gained a majority in Parliament in the 2011 election. Harper's initiatives, including economic management and antiterrorism legislation, were controversial. Support for the Conservatives eroded due to the decline in the price of oil and the contraction of the Canadian economy in 2015. Voters were fatigued with Harper and uneasy about the economy. Many voters based their decision on defeating the Conservatives, with the anti-Harper vote split between Trudeau's Liberal Party and the NDP led by Mulcair. The Liberal Party had its worst showing in 2011, losing to the NDP as the main left-of-center party. Trudeau's election as party leader helped the Liberals regain support, while many saw him as lacking experience. The NDP, as the Official Opposition, started the campaign in a stronger position. Trudeau's Liberal Party gained momentum during the campaign with better-than-expected debate performances and a proposal for deficit spending on infrastructure. The Liberals won a historic 184 seats in the House of Commons, dominating in various regions across Canada. The Conservatives won 99 seats and now serve as the Official Opposition, while the NDP won 44 seats. The NDP won 44 seats in the 2015 election, a decline from the 103 seats they won in 2011. The Liberal Party, in power since 2015, implemented policies to improve economic security for the middle class, including tax reforms and a new child benefit. They also negotiated to increase contributions to the Canada Pension Plan. The Trudeau government's 2018 budget proposal aims to enhance paid parental leave benefits for greater flexibility and gender equality. Trudeau's Liberals campaigned on political reforms, including electoral system changes, but abandoned the effort in 2017. They did establish a nonpartisan process for Senate appointments to improve its reputation. However, concerns exist about the Senate's growing independence potentially hindering democracy. The Trudeau government faces challenges with the growing independence of the unelected Senate potentially impacting democracy. The Liberals' efforts to balance policy priorities, such as implementing a national climate change plan and supporting pipeline construction, have drawn criticism. Future plans include legalizing cannabis consumption and amending antiterrorism laws to enhance civil liberties protections. The Trudeau government faces challenges with the growing independence of the unelected Senate potentially impacting democracy. Efforts to balance policy priorities have drawn criticism, including implementing a national climate change plan and supporting pipeline construction. Future plans include legalizing cannabis consumption and amending antiterrorism laws to enhance civil liberties protections. Trudeau's approval rating has declined since early 2017, with policy disagreements and ethics scandals tarnishing his image. The Canadian government under Trudeau is facing scrutiny from the political opposition. The Conservative Party elected Andrew Scheer as its new leader, while the NDP elected Jagmeet Singh. Recent polls show support for Conservatives at 37.2%, Liberals at 34.8%, NDP at 17.4%, Green Party at 6.1%, and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois at 3.4%. Canada values a rules-based international order for security and prosperity, promoting peace through alliances and diplomacy. Trudeau's government has restored Canada's traditional approach to foreign affairs by emphasizing multilateral engagement and asserting its own sovereign course in light of the U.S. withdrawing from global leadership. Concerns about the U.S. commitment to the rules-based system were reinforced at the June 2018 G-7 meeting. Canada also reaffirmed its support for international alliances and diplomacy. The Trudeau government has reaffirmed Canada's support for international security efforts by increasing defense spending by 73% over the next decade. This includes acquiring new aircraft, ships, and expanding the Canadian Armed Forces. Canada has been a member of NATO since 1949 and has maintained a military presence in Western Europe. Canada has been actively involved in NATO operations since the 1990s, supporting collective defense efforts through interventions in Bosnia, Serbia, Libya, and Afghanistan. They have advocated for NATO enlargement and deployed troops to Eastern Europe, including leading a NATO battle group in Latvia in 2017. Canada's defense spending falls short of NATO's recommended level of 2% of GDP but exceeds the target for investing in major equipment. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany are leading forces in Eastern Europe to reassure allies and deter Russian aggression. Canada has deployed a maritime task force to the Eastern Mediterranean in support of NATO activities. Canada has supported the U.S.-led military campaign against the Islamic State since September 2014. Prime Minister Trudeau withdrew six CF-18s from combat missions but continues to provide support through refueling, training Iraqi forces, and operating a medical facility in northern Iraq. In June 2017, the Trudeau government announced continued support for coalition operations until March 2019, deploying up to 850 Canadian Armed Forces personnel. They pledged C$1.6 billion for security, stabilization, and humanitarian efforts in Iraq, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. Canada resettled 53,000 Syrian refugees and nearly 1,000 Yazidis in 2017. The U.S. State Department noted extensive defense arrangements with Canada. The U.S. State Department noted that defense arrangements with Canada are extensive, with over 800 agreements in place. The Permanent Joint Board on Defense, established in 1940, is the highest-level bilateral defense forum between the two countries. NORAD, established in 1958, monitors and defends North America against potential threats. NORAD is responsible for processing intelligence related to aerospace and maritime domains, detecting and warning of attacks against North America, and providing surveillance over U.S. and Canadian airspace. It utilizes satellites, radars, and aircraft for its mission and is the only binational command in the world. The U.S. Commander and Canadian Deputy Commander are appointed by both the U.S. President and Canadian Prime Minister. Headquarters are located at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado. NORAD headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado includes integrated staff from both the United States and Canada, with about 300 Canadian Armed Forces personnel stationed there. This binational structure allows for resource pooling and increased defense capabilities in North America. However, some NORAD responsibilities overlap with U.S. Northern Command and Canadian Joint Operations Command. The Permanent Joint Board on Defense has tasked NORAD with studying North American defense evolution, focusing on air, maritime, cyber, aerospace, outer space, and land threats. Some officials within NORAD suggest expanding its mission to include additional domains and integrating NORAD, NORTHCOM, and CJOC into a single binational command for defense. This proposal aims to improve efficiency and effectiveness in North American defense efforts, but faces opposition due to sovereignty concerns and coordination challenges. President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau agreed to modernize and broaden the NORAD partnership in air, maritime, cyber, and space domains during a meeting in February 2017. Canada continues to debate its participation in the U.S. ballistic missile defense system. Canada debated participating in the U.S. ballistic missile defense system in 2005 but ultimately decided against it due to domestic opposition and concerns about triggering an arms race. Some argue that Canada should reconsider, pointing out that Canada has endorsed NATO's ballistic missile defense system in Europe. However, current U.S. policy does not guarantee defense for Canada in the event of a missile attack. Some suggest that Canadian participation in the system should be a low priority given budget constraints. Canada does not participate in the U.S. ballistic missile defense system directly, but Canadian personnel are involved in detecting ballistic missiles through NORAD. Canada has been part of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program since 1997, with significant investments and contracts secured by Canadian industry. In 2010, Canada announced plans to acquire 65 Lockheed Martin F-35s to replace aging CF-18s. The procurement process was put on hold in 2012 due to controversy over cost and performance. In 2015, Trudeau promised to withdraw from the F-35 program and explore more affordable fighter options. Despite this, Canada continues to make annual payments to remain in the program. Canada's Department of National Defense plans to open a new competitive process in early 2019 for purchasing new aircraft, possibly including F-35s. Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan warns of a growing \"capability gap\" between Canada's commitments and available fighters. After considering Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets and facing trade disputes, Canada opted to buy 18 used F/A-18s from Australia, a decision questioned by defense analysts. Many defense analysts have questioned Canada's decision to purchase 18 used F/A-18s from Australia, citing costly modifications and maintenance requirements. The United States and Canada have a close intelligence partnership focused on border security and law enforcement efforts since 9/11. The Beyond the Border declaration signed in 2011 aims to enhance information sharing, infrastructure investment, cross-border law enforcement operations, and critical infrastructure protection. The Beyond the Border declaration signed in 2011 aims to enhance information sharing, infrastructure investment, cross-border law enforcement operations, and protect critical infrastructure. This led to agreements such as an entry/exit program and expanding preclearance activities. Implementation has been slow due to Canadian concerns about privacy and sovereignty. In 2016, President Obama signed the Northern Border Security Review Act directing a threat analysis along the U.S.-Canadian border. The analysis highlighted potential security risks of individuals entering the US from Canada undetected, but encounters with transnational crime or terrorism are infrequent. Apprehensions of individuals entering from Canada have remained low, with most being Canadian citizens. The Beyond the Border initiative and the Northern Border Strategy aim to address security challenges while facilitating lawful trade and travel. Canada has been an effective partner in preventing foreign terrorist suspects from entering North America. The influx of asylum-seekers crossing from the United States into Canada has significantly increased over the past two years, with nearly 8,000 individuals encountered from January to April 2018. This has overwhelmed Canada's refugee processing system, leading to the allocation of C$173 million in the latest budget for border patrols and asylum application processing. The influx has also strained resources of aid agencies and local governments. The northern flow of asylum-seekers into Canada has increased due to Trump Administration's immigration policies, Canada's refugee-friendly image, and misperceptions about the immigration system. Surges occurred after executive orders in January 2017 and the potential removal of Haitians with Temporary Protected Status in May 2017. While most asylum-seekers may be returned to the US under the Safe Third Country Agreement, those entering between ports of entry can stay in Canada. The Canadian government is considering expanding the Safe Third Country Agreement to cover the entire border, facing pressure from refugee advocates to suspend the agreement for safer entry. Both the US and Canada face cybersecurity threats, with Canada detecting over 2,500 state-sponsored cyber activities on its networks from 2013. The Canadian government detected over 2,500 state-sponsored cyber activities on its networks from 2013 to 2015. In 2014, China was accused of a cyberattack on the National Research Council, costing over C$100 million to mitigate. Canada blocks 600 million daily attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in its systems. The US and Canada have integrated cybersecurity into their bilateral agenda to protect shared infrastructure. The 2012 \"Cybersecurity Action Plan\" between Public Safety Canada and DHS aims to enhance cyber incident management collaboration, improve information sharing with the private sector, and increase cybersecurity public awareness efforts. The United States and Canada also cooperate extensively on cybersecurity through the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and are considering adding cyber defense to NORAD's mission. In 2012, NORAD and U.S. Northern Command established a Joint Cyber Center to support cyberspace activity awareness and planning for operations. The Trudeau government proposed investing C$508 million in cybersecurity in its 2018 budget. In its 2018 budget, the Trudeau government proposed investing C$508 million over five years in cybersecurity efforts. This includes funding for the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) to create a new Canadian Center for Cyber Security, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to establish a National Cybercrime Coordination Unit, and other elements of a new National Cyber Security Strategy. The government also proposed changes to Canada's intelligence laws. Changes to Canada's intelligence laws empower the CSE to engage in offensive cyber operations, raising concerns about potential conflicts with the agency's mandate. The Canadian economy outpaced the United States in growth in 2017, with forecasts predicting continued growth for both countries in 2018. The Canadian economy relies heavily on global exports but has seen growth driven by personal consumption, particularly in the housing sector. Unemployment rates have fluctuated, reaching a low of 5.8% in 2008 and peaking at 8.7% in 2009 before falling to 6.3% in 2018. After years of deficit spending, the government implemented austerity measures in 1995 to address high public debt and government sector spending. The Canadian government implemented austerity measures in 1995, including cutting federal funding for health and education, means testing for Seniors Benefits, and defense cuts. Modest tax increases were also introduced. Despite achieving a balanced budget in 1998, the Conservative government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper ran deficits from 2009 to 2015 due to stimulus spending and tax cuts during the global financial crisis. Efforts to return to fiscal balance included austerity measures and one-off savings, reducing the deficit to 1.9% of GDP by 2015. During the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau campaigned on a targeted budget deficit of C$10 billion a year for three years for infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy. The first budget of the Trudeau government in 2016 pledged to invest C$120 billion over the next 10 years to grow the middle class. The Trudeau government plans to invest C$120 billion over the next 10 years in infrastructure projects, including upgrades to public transport, water systems, green infrastructure, and affordable housing. The funding will also support measures to reduce urban congestion, expand trade corridors, and promote a low-carbon national energy system. Additionally, funds will be allocated for indigenous communities, child and family tax benefits, cultural and arts funding, and the revitalization of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. An \"innovation agenda\" will be supported with increased research funding and a Strategic Investment Fund for universities. The government is funding measures for universities through additional deficits estimated at C$113.2 billion through FY2021. This includes a 4% increase in the top tax rate and a reduction in the annual tax-free savings account contribution. The 2018 budget, released on February 27, 2018, totaled C$311.3 billion with a deficit of C$17.8 billion. Gender equity was the theme, with highlights including pay-equity legislation and incentives for new fathers to take parental leave.

Gender equity was the theme, with highlights including pay-equity legislation and incentives for new fathers to take parental leave. Additionally, there are initiatives such as a new Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program, revamped low-income tax credit, funding for scientific research, and the establishment of a Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity and a National Cybercrime Coordination Unit for the RCMP. The Bank of Canada has adjusted its benchmark interest rates multiple times since the global financial crisis, currently standing at 1.25%. The Bank of Canada has adjusted its key rate twice in 2017 and once in 2018 to the current rate of 1.25%. This accommodative stance has led to record Canadian household indebtedness, with the debt-to-disposable-income ratio reaching 170% in 2015. The value of the Canadian dollar has varied in recent years, dropping during the financial crisis and appreciating as the economy stabilized. The Canadian dollar depreciated from C$0.96/US$1 in July 2011 to a low of C$1.42/US$1 in January 2016 due to the end of the commodity boom and interest rate reductions. It has since rebounded to the range of C$1.30-1.20/$1.00 in 2017-2018. The strong Canadian dollar from 2002-2008 and 2010-2013 negatively impacted manufacturing, especially in the auto industry. Manufacturing has picked up since the currency depreciation, but it still represents a declining share of GDP. The United States and Canada have a significant bilateral commercial relationship, governed by trade agreements like the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both countries were instrumental in creating the multilateral trading system. However, unilateral tariff measures imposed by the Trump Administration have strained their trade relations. The Trump Administration's actions, including withdrawing from trade agreements and skepticism of multilateralism, have raised concerns about the existing system. Despite the strong economic ties between the United States and Canada, China has become the largest trading partner of the U.S. Canada remains a significant destination for U.S. exports, but Mexico has surpassed Canada in trade volume. In 2017, Canada was the largest purchaser of U.S. goods. In 2017, Canada was the largest purchaser of U.S. goods at 18.3% of exports and the third-largest supplier of U.S. imports at 12.8%. The U.S. is Canada's largest goods export destination and import supplier, with two-way trade representing nearly 32% of Canadian GDP. Trade relations between the two nations have faced challenges during the Trump Administration, with disputes over various issues such as softwood lumber, dairy restrictions, commercial aviation, and NAFTA negotiations. President Trump commented on these trade disputes in a June 2018 tweet. Negotiations to renegotiate NAFTA began in August 2017, focusing on modernizing the agreement with new provisions from TPP negotiations. Goals to conclude talks by March 2018 and May 2018 were not met. Negotiations to renegotiate NAFTA began in August 2017, with goals to conclude talks by March 2018 and May 2018 not met. The imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico may have dampened momentum for an agreement, with President Trump threatening to withdraw from NAFTA at times. U.S. proposals aim to reduce trade deficits and bring back manufacturing jobs, potentially leading to withdrawal from talks if goals are not achievable. Economists argue that trade deficits and job creation are more influenced by macroeconomic conditions than free trade agreements. Negotiations to renegotiate NAFTA have been ongoing since August 2017, with the United States proposing a revised agreement that would expire after five years unless all parties agree to extend it. Canada and Mexico oppose this proposal, preferring to modernize the agreement without restrictions on trade. President Trump has expressed interest in negotiating separate deals with Canada and Mexico, a stance supported by his economic adviser Larry Kudlow. The United States proposed a NAFTA agreement with a sunset clause opposed by Canada and Mexico. Prime Minister Trudeau stated that a five-year sunset clause was unacceptable. Automotive rules of origin have become a major issue in the negotiations, with the U.S. proposing to increase rules for cars, light trucks, engines, and transmissions. The United States has proposed increasing rules for automotive rules of origin in NAFTA negotiations, including a 75% regional content requirement for cars and a three-tiered rule of origin for components. The proposal also includes tying content requirements to wages, with 40% of a car and 45% of a truck to be made by workers earning $16 an hour. Additionally, 70% of a vehicle would need to be manufactured with North American steel and aluminum. Mexico has rejected tying wages to rules of origin levels, while Canada has not. The Trump Administration is pushing for stricter rules on automotive rules of origin in NAFTA negotiations, including tying content requirements to wages. This proposal aims to limit Canadian and Mexican firms' access to the U.S. procurement market by capping it at the level available in Canada and Mexico, which would reduce opportunities for them. The United States is seeking to exclude state and local government procurement from NAFTA, similar to the TPP. Canada is dissatisfied with Buy American policies, especially in \"pass-through\" government procurements. The US wants to disband the binational dispute settlement mechanism in Chapter 19. Chapter 19 of NAFTA allows for binational panel review of AD/CVD investigations, a provision Canada insists on keeping. Canada's dairy supply management system is a point of contention, with the US seeking its dismantling while Canada wants to uphold it. Discussions also involve U.S. dairy subsidies and restrictions on exports of ultra-filtered milk. The Trump Administration is considering removing the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism from NAFTA. This mechanism allows private investors to pursue claims against nations for violating investment provisions. The United States has proposed making ISDS an opt-in, opt-out system. The United States is considering making ISDS an opt-in, opt-out system, with each party deciding whether to accept cases from the other. There is a proposal to limit eligibility to claims involving direct expropriation, excluding arbitration for indirect expropriation. Canadian negotiators have suggested eliminating ISDS provisions altogether or keeping them only with Mexico if the U.S. opts out. The U.S. business community opposes scaling back or eliminating ISDS, while labor and civil society groups support a more skeptical approach. USTR Robert E. Lighthizer believes ISDS incentivizes outsourcing. The 2015 TPA called for meaningful procedures for resolving investment disputes, affecting congressional consideration of an agreement. Over 100 Members of Congress insist on strong ISDS provisions in a modernized agreement. The U.S.-Canada softwood lumber trade dispute centers on pricing policies and forest management differences. Canada's Crown lands contrast with privately held forests in the U.S. Canada's timber management practices are disputed by the U.S., with allegations of subsidies to promote the Canadian industry. Trade in softwood lumber was governed by a seven-year agreement until October 2015, restricting Canadian exports to the U.S. The U.S. allowed unlimited imports of Canadian timber under certain conditions, imposing export taxes and quotas when prices fell. The 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement expired, leading to a trade dispute (Lumber V) between the U.S. and Canada. U.S. lumber producers alleged that Canadian firms dump lumber in the U.S. market and benefit from provincial forestry subsidies. The International Trade Commission (ITC) and International Trade Administration (ITA) accepted the petitions, with the ITC finding that Canadian softwood lumber imports caused harm to U.S. producers. ITA imposed final duties in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings. The ITA imposed antidumping and countervailing duties on Canadian lumber due to subsidization and dumping margins. Canada is challenging these decisions at international tribunals. President Trump signed proclamations imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum under Section 232, initially excluding Canada and Mexico for NAFTA negotiations. Negotiations for NAFTA agreement are ongoing, with tariffs linked to the deal. Canada and Mexico reject the linkage, citing national security reasons. Canada is a significant source of U.S. steel and aluminum imports. Canada announced retaliatory tariffs of $12.8 billion to begin on July 1. Canada announced retaliatory tariffs of $12.8 billion on U.S. steel, aluminum, and other consumer products starting on July 1, 2018. The tariffs are disputed by Canada, citing its strong military ties with the U.S. and secure supplier status. Canada has initiated consultations at the WTO and NAFTA Chapter 20 dispute settlement. The tariffs could lead to increased production and employment in the U.S. industries affected, but may also result in higher prices, decreased sales, and job losses in downstream industries. On April 27, 2017, Boeing filed AD/CVD actions against Bombardier Aircraft of Canada, alleging unfair competition due to government aid and below-market prices. Commerce imposed antidumping and subsidy rates, but the ITC found no harm to U.S. industry. This could lead to increased production in other countries like Canada for vehicles, as they would not be subject to tariffs as long as NAFTA is in effect. Before the ITC finding was released, Bombardier partnered with Airbus to produce planes in Alabama to avoid tariffs. The Canadian government also canceled its procurement of Boeing fighter jets. In 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative downgraded Canada on intellectual property rights protection to a \"priority watch list\" country. Canada enacted the Copyright Modernization Act in 2013, similar to the U.S. DMCA, allowing for format shifting. The DMCA (P.L. 105-304) allows format shifting and fair-use exceptions but prohibits circumvention of digital protection measures. Canada's Combating Counterfeit Products Act gives customs officials authority to seize pirated goods. The Supreme Court of Canada invalidated certain provisions in June 2017. In June 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated the \"promise doctrine\", a utility requirement used to assess patent validity. The doctrine required patent holders to fully demonstrate the usefulness of their invention at the time of filing, leading to the invalidation of 25 patents since 2005. This decision was seen as conflicting with the fundamental principles of patent law. The use of the promise doctrine in Canada has led to uncertainty in the business environment. Eli Lilly, a U.S. pharmaceutical company, took Canada to arbitration under NAFTA's Chapter 11 ISDS mechanism due to the invalidation of patents for two drugs. The ISDS panel ruled in favor of Canada, citing lack of proof of expropriation. Canada updated its patent regulations under CETA, offering two years of patent term restoration for delays in marketing authorization. In 2018, USTR criticized Canada's limited patent protection changes. Canada also adjusted its patent linkage system to comply with CETA, allowing generic drug makers to challenge patents. The burden of proof was on the patent holder, leading to potential duplication of effort in patent infringement lawsuits. Canada replaced its patent linkage system in 2017 with a single-track process for patent infringement and validity determinations. Despite these changes, the USTR placed Canada on the \"priority watch list\" in the 2018 Special 301 report due to concerns about weak enforcement of copyright and piracy infringement, lack of copyright prosecutions in 2017, and ambiguous education-related copyright exceptions. The United States has raised concerns about Canada's treatment of copyrights, geographical indications protections, and market access for U.S. agricultural producers in the FTA with the European Union. Strong IP provisions are a priority in NAFTA renegotiation. Dispute settlement panel requested over restrictions on U.S. wine exports in British Columbia. Canada's regulations on selling imported wine in grocery stores are seen as a violation of GATT Article III by the United States. Consultations were held in 2016 and 2017, and now a panel request has been made at the WTO. Canada must defend the province in the dispute settlement process. Canada is a major supplier of energy to the U.S. and a significant petroleum producer. Canada is the world's fourth-largest petroleum producer with the third-largest reserves after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. In 2017, the U.S. imported $53 billion worth of petroleum and natural gas from Canada, down from $115.7 billion in 2014. Canada supplied 51.2% of U.S. crude oil imports and 57.9% of natural gas imports in 2017. Additionally, Canada is a major supplier of processed uranium and electricity to the U.S. Canada is a reliable source of energy for the U.S. and a major supplier of oil and gas. The Keystone XL Pipeline, revived by the Trump Administration, aims to bring Canadian oil to the U.S. Canada supports the pipeline's construction but has concerns about restricting procurement to U.S. firms. The Trans-Mountain pipeline project in Canada has faced opposition from various groups, including environmentalists and some First Nation tribes. Despite ongoing litigation, Trans-Canada has started preconstruction work but has not committed to building the pipeline. The fate of the project, which aims to transport oil to China and Asia, remains uncertain due to delays and controversy. The Trans-Mountain pipeline project in Canada has caused conflict between Alberta and British Columbia. Alberta plans to regulate natural resource exports, potentially cutting off fuel to BC. The federal government will buy the pipeline for $4.5 billion to assert authority over interprovincial pipelines. The Canadian government will buy the existing Trans-Mountain pipeline and expansion project for C$4.5 billion to complete the project as a Crown corporation. Concerns exist about the impact on foreign investment in the energy sector due to delays in approval. Canada and the United States face similar debates on addressing greenhouse gas-induced climate change. Both countries have high greenhouse gas emissions per person due to factors like high income levels, personal vehicle dependence, and cold winters. Both Canada and the United States have regions heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy production. Energy regulation is primarily handled at the provincial or state level in both countries. Both nations aim to align their policies on greenhouse gas emissions to facilitate trade and compliance for businesses. They also share concerns about climate change impacts such as forest losses and public health effects. The Paris Agreement, a subsidiary to the UNFCCC, requires nations to submit pledges to reduce GHG emissions, adapt to climate change, and cooperate on mobilizing support. It addresses various impacts of climate change such as forest losses, public health effects, and risks to coastal communities. The agreement entered into force in 2016 and has been signed by both the United States and Canada. The Paris Agreement aims to reduce GHG emissions and address climate change impacts. President Trump announced the US's intention to withdraw in 2017, with the withdrawal process set to be completed in 2020. Prime Minister Trudeau expressed disappointment and pledged to continue working with the US at the state level. Canada adopted the \"Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change\" in December 2016, which includes a plan for carbon pricing starting at C$10 per ton in 2018 and rising to C$50 per ton in 2022. If provinces do not implement carbon pricing, the federal government will impose a backstop price. The federal government will impose a backstop carbon price if provinces do not place a price on carbon, with revenue returned to the province. This policy aims to reduce GHG emissions at the lowest cost, support innovation and clean growth, and allow flexibility for jurisdictions. Canada's updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement targets a 30% reduction in GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030, covering all sectors and various types of emissions. Canada has implemented measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with IPCC guidelines. This includes stricter emissions standards for vehicles, renewable fuel regulations, and phasing out coal-fired generating units. Provinces have until September 1, 2018, to outline their implementation strategies, with all except Saskatchewan agreeing to do so. Saskatchewan has challenged the law in court. Saskatchewan challenges the constitutionality of federal legislation on greenhouse gas emissions. The Regional Climate Action Plan aims to reduce GHG emissions by 35%-45% below 1990 levels by 2030, with a long-term goal of reaching 75%-85% of 2001 levels by 2050. The Western Climate Initiative administers a greenhouse gas emissions trading program among California, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. The Columbia River Treaty is an international agreement between the United States and Canada for the cooperative development and operation of the water resources of the Columbia River Basin. It was ratified in 1961 after more than 20 years of negotiations and implementation began in 1964. The Treaty involved the construction and operation of dams in both countries to provide flood control and power generation benefits. The United States agreed to provide Canada with cash payments and hydropower benefits under the Columbia River Treaty (CRT), known as the \"Canadian Entitlement,\" estimated to be worth up to $335 million annually. The CRT has no specific end date, and provisions would continue indefinitely unless terminated. Starting in September 2024, either nation can terminate most provisions with 10 years' notice. Both countries have shown interest in modifying the treaty. If not terminated or modified, most provisions would continue, except for flood control transitioning to \"called-upon\" operations. The United States and Canada are reviewing the Columbia River Treaty (CRT) with differing perspectives on tribal resources, fisheries, and hydropower benefits. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bonneville Power Administration recommended modifications to the CRT in 2013, including rebalancing hydropower provisions and delineating flood control operations after 2024. The Canadian Entity recommended continuing the Columbia River Treaty with modifications within the Treaty framework, disputing assumptions in the U.S. Entity's review process. Negotiations between the U.S. and Canada began in October 2016, with subsequent rounds scheduled for 2018. The Great Lakes are crucial as a source of fresh water for over 40 million people and support various economic activities. The Great Lakes ecosystem has been impacted by heavy manufacturing and human activity, leading to degraded water quality and habitat loss for native species. The United States and Canada amended the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 2012 to address environmental challenges and improve water quality. The revised agreement includes provisions to address aquatic invasive species, habitat degradation, climate change effects, and threats to human health and the environment. The United States and Canada have provided funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to address environmental challenges such as harmful algae, toxic chemicals, and vessel discharges. Congress authorized $300 million annually from FY2017 to FY2021 for the initiative. Despite attempts to cut funding in FY2018, $300 million was appropriated in 2018. The Trump Administration has requested $30 million for Great Lakes restoration in FY2019. Canada also announced a $35 million investment in its Great Lakes Protection Initiative to reduce toxic and nuisance algae. The International Joint Commission's \"First Triennial Assessment of Progress on Great Lakes Water Quality\" in November 2017 reported progress in meeting GLWQA objectives, including restoration of contaminated areas, habitat conservation strategies, and absence of new aquatic invasive species. Challenges identified include harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie and slow progress on addressing mutual concern chemicals. The Congress has concerns about a proposed deep geologic repository for nuclear waste near Lake Huron. The site would hold low- to mid-level waste materials currently stored above ground. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 directs the Secretary of State to engage with the Government of Canada to refer the proposed repository to the International Joint Commission. The Congress has concerns about a proposed deep geologic repository for nuclear waste near Lake Huron. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 directs the Secretary of State to engage with the Government of Canada to jointly refer the proposed repository to the International Joint Commission for research and study. It further directs the Secretary to report on the diplomatic and legal steps to address concerns about the protection of the Great Lakes water basin and review alternatives for the repository."
