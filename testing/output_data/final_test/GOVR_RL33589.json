The Act established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Department of Health and Human Services. This was the second reauthorization of federal programs aimed at enhancing the nation's readiness for public health threats like bioterrorism and pandemic influenza. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act was enacted in response to global terrorist activity and emerging infectious diseases. Congress extended and expanded authorities following the 2001 terrorist attacks and the anthrax attacks, highlighting the need for a better coordinated public health system. The Act aimed to address challenges in bolstering a public health system largely based in state authority and a healthcare system in private hands, amidst the integration of the Department of Homeland Security into national preparedness efforts. The 110th Congress faces challenges in integrating the Department of Homeland Security into national preparedness efforts. They may consider legislation to address expiring public health authorities and examine emergency response and funding authorities of the Secretary of HHS. The report discusses key provisions in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417) introduced by Senator Burr in July 2006. It compares these provisions with preexisting laws and addresses the reauthorization of health preparedness programs. Additionally, bills were introduced in the 109th Congress to enhance Project BioShield for bioterrorism preparedness. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417) was introduced by Senator Burr in July 2006 to enhance Project BioShield for bioterrorism preparedness. Key provisions of the law were attached to S. 3678 in December 2006, which was signed by the President on December 19, 2006. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (P.L. 109-417) aims to define national capacities for preparedness and response for public health emergencies, requiring federal coordination efforts. The Act mandates the Secretary of HHS to develop a National Health Security Strategy every four years. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 reauthorized programs in FEMA and established the position of Chief Medical Officer at DHS to coordinate medical and public health aspects of disasters. Members of Congress were interested in clarifying the relationship between the CMO and the Secretary of HHS. The Post-Katrina Act and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act define the roles of the Chief Medical Officer and the Secretary of HHS in disaster response. Congress is interested in how these roles are implemented and improving Project BioShield to develop countermeasures for public health emergencies. Project BioShield, established in 2004, aims to develop medical countermeasures for public health emergencies by guaranteeing a market for specific countermeasures. The program allows HHS to solicit bids and execute contracts for the delivery of countermeasures at guaranteed prices. Criticism has arisen due to perceived lack of progress on major countermeasure targets, highlighted by the cancellation of a large anthrax vaccine contract. The 109th Congress considered measures to improve Project BioShield. The 109th Congress considered measures to improve Project BioShield by incorporating proposals into the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, which requires the development of a strategic plan and the creation of the Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to support countermeasure development. This law allows milestone-based payments for Project BioShield contracts and facilitates communication between the government and countermeasure developers. The 109th Congress considered measures to improve Project BioShield by incorporating proposals into the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. This law allows milestone-based payments for Project BioShield contracts and facilitates communication between the government and countermeasure developers. Additionally, it permits the HHS Secretary to hold meetings and execute specific agreements with potential countermeasure developers, contingent on approval from the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. Congress has provided approximately $7 billion in grants to states for public health and hospital preparedness since FY2002, with concerns about grant management and program transparency. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act extended programs, adding new elements like federal authority to withhold funds for non-compliance, state matching requirement, and public disclosure of program activities. There was debate in the 109th Congress about the effectiveness of medical disaster response with the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) under DHS instead of HHS. NDMS was transferred to DHS in 2003, which was highlighted during the response to Hurricane Katrina. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act transferred the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) back to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2007. This transfer was supported by Congress and the Administration. The Act also emphasized the importance of early detection of bioterrorism and infectious disease threats through a national electronic network for sharing public health surveillance information in real-time. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act established a national electronic network for sharing public health surveillance information in near-real time. It also authorized grants to states for this network and required the Secretary to track influenza vaccine during a pandemic. Developing common data standards for disease detection and addressing privacy concerns are key challenges. Additionally, health professions programs under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act expired in 2002. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers programs in Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to address healthcare worker shortages. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act proposed a loan repayment project for those in shortage areas. S. 506, the Public Health Preparedness Workforce Development Act of 2005, aimed to provide scholarship and loan repayment programs for health professionals in public health agencies, but did not advance in Congress. Following the 2001 terror attacks, the 107th Congress passed the Bioterrorism Act to enhance the nation's readiness for bioterrorism and public health threats. The Act reauthorized a grant program for state and local public health capacity, allocating $1.08 billion for FY2003 through FY2006. Funding was based on a formula to ensure every state and territory received support for core public health preparedness activities. The Bioterrorism Act established a program of grants to prepare healthcare facilities for bioterrorism events, with $520 million authorized for FY2003. It also included provisions for public health preparedness, such as creating the position of Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness and expanding the Strategic National Stockpile program. Title II of the Bioterrorism Act required registration of laboratories and individuals with Select Agents, while Title III focused on food and drug supply protection. Title IV aimed to safeguard the drinking water supply. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 incentivized the development of treatments for biological and chemical agents. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Metropolitan Medical Response System, NDMS, and budget authority for the SNS to the new Department of Homeland Security, leaving most public health preparedness activities in HHS. The act directed collaboration between the Secretaries of HHS and DHS. The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000 addressed concerns about bioterrorism and infectious diseases by authorizing funds for state and local health department capacity building. This legislation complemented existing public health infrastructure programs initiated by the CDC in the 1990s. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 called for the establishment of a program to identify infectious agents for bioterrorism and require registration of facilities shipping those agents. The Select Agent program, overseen by CDC and USDA, was extended through FY2007 in response to the anthrax attack. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act (P.L. 107-188) and Project BioShield are important programs for public health preparedness and response to bioterrorism threats. Various reports provide detailed information on the provisions, purposes, authorities, appropriations, acquisitions, and policy implementation issues related to these programs. Additionally, there are reports on public health and medical preparedness and response to disasters, federal authority, and funding in the context of specific threats. The curr_chunk provides information on various CRS reports related to public health and disaster response, including topics such as federal authority, funding, public health system overview, Gulf Coast hurricanes response, pandemic influenza preparedness, mental health and substance abuse treatment for survivors, and FEMA policy changes post-Hurricane Katrina. It also references the Stafford Act and DHS preparedness and response planning activities.
