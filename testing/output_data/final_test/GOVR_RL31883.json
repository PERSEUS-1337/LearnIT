The agency has struggled to balance open scientific inquiry with the need for security, leading to questions about the attention given to its classified weapons-related program, especially in terms of counterintelligence. The Clinton Administration issued PDD-61 to restructure DOE's CI program, with the FBI taking leadership. Congress established NNSA to manage security programs, including CI for weapons laboratories. DOE and NNSA have separate CI offices but share resources. Foreign intelligence services target DOE and NNSA facilities. President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 61 in 1998 to address concerns about foreign intelligence targeting DOE and NNSA facilities. The directive established an independent CI office within DOE, led by a senior FBI executive, to improve quality and accountability in addressing threats to U.S. national security. PDD-61 established an independent CI office within DOE, led by a senior FBI official, to address threats to national security. The office gained authority over programming, funding, and personnel for counterintelligence activities at all DOE field offices and laboratories. However, by 1999, Congress deemed these reforms insufficient. In March 1999, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson fired scientist Wen Ho Lee from Los Alamos National Security Laboratory for failing a polygraph test and other security breaches. Lee pled guilty to one felony count. In May, a House Select Committee accused China of stealing nuclear secrets from the US. In June, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board publicly addressed intelligence matters for the first time in its history. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board criticized the Department of Energy for its poor security record on secrecy and confirmed that China had obtained classified U.S. nuclear weapons information through espionage. This led to the establishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration to manage national security-related nuclear programs. Congress proposed creating dual counterintelligence offices in DOE and NNSA. The creation of dual counterintelligence offices in DOE and NNSA was authorized to implement CI policy at non-NNSA facilities and NNSA facilities respectively. A presidentially appointed Under Secretary for Nuclear Security was designated to serve as NNSA Administrator, reporting to the Energy Secretary. The reorganization was prompted by a report blaming poor organization and lack of accountability for DOE's CI failures. The partially bifurcated CI structure has sparked debate. The dual counterintelligence offices in DOE and NNSA share resources and personnel for certain programs, sparking debate over effectiveness, especially with emerging non-traditional threats. Critics warn of communication issues threatening sensitive investigations, while supporters argue for a dedicated CI office within NNSA. Observers question the effectiveness of DOE and NNSA in accomplishing their CI missions and the current bifurcated CI management structure. A 2002 report criticized DOE's management dysfunction in security and CI. The 2002 report highlighted DOE's management dysfunction in security and counterintelligence (CI), pointing out the lack of clarity, consistency, and strategic planning. It criticized the dual office structure for CI, leading to fragmentation and hindering the establishment of a strong CI program. Despite some progress in CI programs, the dual office structure exposes DOE and NNSA to potential future CI missteps. The Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive (NCIX) criticized the DOE and NNSA's bifurcated CI structure for causing day-to-day problems and potential future missteps. The NCIX criticized the DOE and NNSA's bifurcated CI structure, warning of potential future missteps. The PFIAB recommended establishing a semi-autonomous agency within DOE for more effective CI reform. The NCIX criticized the DOE and NNSA's bifurcated CI structure, recommending a unified, integrated DOE-wide function for counterintelligence. The PFIAB suggested establishing a semi-autonomous agency within DOE for more effective CI reform. The NCIX and former DOE Secretary recommended consolidating the two CI offices under one senior officer reporting directly to the Energy Secretary to improve the effectiveness of the CI program at DOE. The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized the DOE Secretary to consolidate the counterintelligence offices under the control of the NNSA administrator. Congress could choose to maintain the current organizational structure or consider alternative approaches. The conferees urge collaboration between the counterintelligence offices at DOE and NNSA for the security of programs and facilities. Several organizational approaches are being discussed regarding counterintelligence, including maintaining the status quo, separating DOE and NNSA, consolidating CI implementation under NNSA, or consolidating all counterintelligence within either DOE or NNSA. Proponents of the status quo argue that DOE has not focused enough on CI, while NNSA was established to focus on this issue. DOE's Office of Counterintelligence would develop CI policy for DOE, including NNSA, but implementation would only occur at non-NNSA facilities. NNSA/ODNCI would implement CI policy at NNSA facilities. Opponents of the current structure argue that it leads to inefficiency, confusion, and miscommunication, particularly in counterintelligence. They propose a complete separation of DOE and NNSA counterintelligence programs, with OCI supporting DOE and NNSA/ODNCI supporting NNSA. Proponents believe this separation would establish clearer lines of authority, improving communication and coordination within both agencies. The third approach consolidates all DOE CI implementation under NNSA, with DOE's Office of Counterintelligence in charge of formulating CI policy. Proponents argue this would support integrated and coordinated CI activities, allowing NNSA to focus on implementation and DOE on policy. Opponents fear it would create redundancy and confusion in CI operations. The final approach consolidates two CI programs under either the Energy Secretary or the NNSA administrator. Proponents argue for DOE consolidation to emphasize CI as a department-wide mission, including protecting technologies, infrastructure, and nuclear weapons secrets. Opponents argue against consolidating CI under DOE control. Consolidating CI under DOE control is debated due to concerns about DOE's anti-security culture. Proponents argue for consolidation to improve accountability and coordination, while opponents believe only a semi-autonomous agency like NNSA can establish a security-focused cultural environment. Both sides agree that consolidation would enhance the effectiveness of the CI program."
