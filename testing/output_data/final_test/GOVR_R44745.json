    "content": "The federal government supports adoption through federal grants to states and tax benefits for individuals offsetting adoption costs. This report focuses on federal adoption tax benefits, including an adoption tax credit and income tax exclusion for employer-provided adoption assistance. It provides an overview of adoption in the US, details on the tax benefits, legislative history, and potential policy options. The report discusses adoption tax benefits and the legal process of adoption, categorizing it into domestic public agency adoption, domestic private adoption, and intercountry adoption. Adoption involves transferring parental rights from birth parents to adoptive parents through a formal legal process. In 2012, approximately 120,000 children were adopted in the United States, with 44% being domestic public agency adoptions, 49% domestic private adoptions (including stepchild adoptions), and 7% international adoptions. The total number of adoptions has decreased between 2001 and 2012, mainly due to a decline in foreign adoptions. Domestic public agency adoptions have remained stable, while domestic private adoptions have decreased from 70,000 per year in 2001 to 60,000 per year in 2012. The number of foreign adoptions declined from 20,000 per year in 2001 to 9,000 per year in 2012. Adoption costs vary depending on the type, ranging from $0 to $2,500 for domestic public agency adoptions, $15,000 to $45,000 for domestic private adoptions, and $20,000 to $50,000 for intercountry adoptions. The adoption tax credit assists qualifying individuals. The adoption tax credit helps offset adoption costs for qualifying taxpayers, with a maximum credit of $13,810 in 2018. Income limits apply, with the credit phased out for higher earners. The credit is non-refundable but can be carried forward for up to five years. Eligibility rules and credit calculation details are provided below. Before calculating the adoption tax credit, taxpayers must determine the eligibility of the child being adopted and the qualifying expenses. Eligible children are those under 18 or older individuals unable to care for themselves. Qualifying expenses include adoption fees, court and attorney costs, travel expenses, and other directly related adoption expenses. The adoption tax credit allows taxpayers to claim qualified adoption expenses, excluding certain expenses like surrogate parenting arrangements or expenses for a spouse's child. To claim the credit, taxpayers must file IRS Form 8839 and provide details about the adopted child. To claim the adoption tax credit, taxpayers must file Form 8839 with details about the adopted child, including their name, age, and taxpayer identification number (TIN). If the TIN is not available, an adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN) can be used. Married couples must file jointly to claim the credit, while domestic partners can split expenses and credit but are subject to the same limit. Taxpayers can claim the adoption tax credit for qualifying expenses in the year following payment, even if a domestic adoption is not finalized. Expenses for foreign adoptions can only be claimed in the year the adoption is finalized, with no credit available if the adoption is never completed. In 2018, the maximum adoption tax credit is $13,810 per child, with the credit amount being the lesser of qualifying adoption expenses or the maximum statutory amount. Special needs adoptions always receive the maximum statutory amount per child. The maximum aggregate amount of the adoption tax credit that can be claimed equals the sum of the credit amounts for each eligible child. The maximum adoption tax credit in 2018 is $13,810 per child, with the credit amount being the lesser of qualifying adoption expenses or the maximum statutory amount. The total credit a taxpayer can claim is the sum of the credit amounts for each eligible child. The actual credit claimed may be less due to income limitations and nonrefundability. The adoption tax credit can be carried forward if it exceeds tax liability, with limitations based on income levels. Higher-income taxpayers are more likely to be subject to the first limitation, while lower- and middle-income taxpayers are more likely to face the second limitation. The credit amount is reduced for each eligible child if the taxpayer's income exceeds the phaseout threshold of $207,140 in 2018. In 2018, the adoption tax credit phaseout threshold is $207,140, adjusted annually for inflation. The credit amount decreases proportionally for incomes between $207,140 and $247,140. Taxpayers with income $40,000 above the threshold are ineligible for the credit. The phaseout range remains fixed at $40,000. The credit is nonrefundable and cannot exceed taxes owed. Taxpayers can carry forward excess adoption tax credits for up to five years, allowing them to use the credit on future tax returns. However, there are practical complexities in tracking expenses and previous claims. The adoption tax credit can be claimed using the carryforward provision for special needs adoptions, which are children considered difficult to place for adoption by the state child welfare agency. Foster care adoptions mostly fall under special needs adoptions. In 2015, 81.3% of adoptions were special needs adoptions, defined by specific factors like age, disabilities, or minority status. Only 0.04% of taxpayers claimed the adoption tax credit, with an average credit of $3,928. In 2015, the adoption tax credit averaged $3,928, representing 29% of the maximum credit amount of $13,400. The majority of claimants had adjusted gross income between $100,000 and $200,000, with few taxpayers earning over $200,000 claiming the credit due to phase-out rules. Approximately 60% of the tax credit dollars went to taxpayers in the $100,000 to $200,000 income range, while those with AGI under $30,000 did not claim the credit due to nonrefundability. The adoption tax credit amount varied over the years, with an average of $2,000 from 1997 to 2001, doubling to $4,000 between 2002 and 2009, peaking at over $11,000 in 2010-2011, and then dropping back to around $4,000 from 2012 to 2015. The number of claimants increased and decreased over the years, influenced by legislative changes and income levels. The adoption tax credit amount doubled between 2002 and 2009 due to legislative changes, resulting in more upper-income taxpayers claiming the credit. The decline in claims between 2006 and 2009 can be attributed to a decrease in foreign adoptions, which are more likely to claim the credit. The decline in foreign adoptions between 2006 and 2009 led to fewer taxpayers claiming the adoption tax credit. The credit was nonrefundable until 2010, allowing taxpayers to carry forward any unused credit for up to five years. Taxpayers often claimed less than the maximum value of the credit, requiring them to carry forward the remaining amount to future tax returns. The adoption tax credit was nonrefundable until 2010, allowing taxpayers to carry forward unused credits. The number of claimants increased until 2010, with first-time claimants and carryover credits. When made refundable in 2010, claimants could receive the full amount, leading to a drop in claimants in 2011. The number of claimants seems more tied to the credit structure than actual adoptions. After becoming nonrefundable again in 2012, the adoption tax credit saw an increase in claimants, even though there was no evidence of an increase in adoptions. Taxpayers with qualifying adoption assistance programs through their employers can exclude up to $13,810 from their income, reducing taxes based on their tax bracket. Taxpayers can claim the exclusion and the credit concurrently for the same adoption, but cannot claim both tax benefits for the same expenses. For one adoption, a taxpayer is eligible for up to $13,810 in tax-free employer-provided adoption assistance and a $13,810 adoption credit. The maximum value of tax benefits for adoption in 2018 could be up to $18,920 per adoption, depending on expenses, income level, and employer-sponsored adoption assistance. The exclusion for employer-provided adoption assistance has the same maximum as the adoption tax credit, subject to income limitations and definitions of qualified expenses. Special rules for special needs children also apply for both the credit and the exclusion. The exclusion for employer-provided adoption assistance allows up to $13,810 of income to be excluded, regardless of actual adoption expenses or payment. The same filing and timing rules as the adoption credit apply, with payments needing to be made during or after the adoption is finalized. Employer-provided adoption assistance programs must meet specific requirements to be excluded from an employee's income. Before the enactment of the adoption tax credit and exclusion for employer-provided adoption assistance in the mid-1990s, Congress enacted an itemized deduction for adoption expenses associated with the adoption of a special needs child as part of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-34). This deduction was repealed five years later by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514). The Joint Committee on Taxation provided several reasons for the repeal of this tax benefit. The itemized deduction for adoption expenses for special needs children was repealed due to it benefiting higher-income taxpayers and being more appropriate as an expenditure program. Congress later enacted tax incentives to encourage adoptions, including the adoption tax credit and exclusion for employer-provided adoption assistance in 1996. The adoption tax credit under P.L. 104-188 equaled qualifying expenses up to $5,000, or $6,000 for special needs adoptions. It phased out for taxpayers with AGI between $75,000 and $115,000 and was only available for special needs adoptions starting in 2002. The $5,000 adoption credit was set to expire at the end of 2001, along with the exclusion for employer-provided adoption assistance. The exclusion had a maximum amount of $5,000 or $6,000 for special needs adoptions, and phased out for taxpayers with AGI between $75,000 and $115,000. Advocates believed these incentives would lower financial barriers to adoption. The current tax benefits were enacted to alleviate financial barriers to adoption and encourage more adoptions, especially of children from the U.S. foster care system. Congress aimed to reduce the financial burden of adoption, particularly for special needs children. Representative Cardin emphasized the high costs of adoption and the need to make it more affordable for parents. The bill recognizes the challenges of placing special needs children for adoption and provides incentives for special needs adoptions. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 extended and expanded the adoption tax credit and exclusion, increasing the maximum credit amount to $10,000 per eligible child, including special needs children. The adoption tax credit and exclusion were extended and increased under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. The maximum credit amount was raised to $10,000 per eligible child, including special needs children, with the income level for phase-out raised to $150,000. Congress believed these changes would reduce the after-tax cost of adoption for affected taxpayers. The adoption tax credit and exclusion were extended and increased under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, with the maximum credit amount raised to $10,000 per eligible child. Congress believed that increasing the size of the adoption credit and exclusion would encourage more adoptions and allow more families to afford adoption. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act temporarily modified the adoption tax credit and exclusion for 2010 and 2011, making the credit refundable and increasing the maximum credit amount to $13,170 in 2010. Senator Nelson justified making the credit refundable as a way to encourage adoption among lower-income Americans. The adoption credit has been increased and made refundable for lower-income individuals, making adoption more affordable. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the provisions for the credit and exclusion through 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made the modifications to the credit and exclusion permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) made the EGTRRA modifications to the adoption tax credit and exclusion permanent. Economists evaluate adoption tax benefits to assess their impact on encouraging adoptions, distribution among taxpayers, and administrative complexity. Adoption is seen as beneficial and should be encouraged through federal policies like tax benefits, although there is little evidence that these benefits effectively increase adoptions. The adoption tax benefits have increased over time, but the actual number of adoptions has not. These benefits may not be enough to encourage families to adopt, as personal issues or beliefs may play a bigger role. Economists consider the benefits economically inefficient if they do not lead to more adoptions, and they mainly benefit upper-income Americans. The adoption tax benefits mainly benefit upper-income Americans, with a significant portion of the tax credit dollars going to taxpayers with income over $75,000. This raises concerns about fairness and equity in the distribution of adoption tax benefits. The principle of equity in taxation states that taxpayers with higher income should pay more taxes. This is reflected in the progressive nature of the federal income tax code, where higher-income individuals pay a greater share of their income in taxes. Adoption tax benefits that primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers may be seen as inequitable under both vertical and horizontal equity principles. Horizontal equity suggests that taxpayers with similar income levels should pay similar amounts in taxes. Adoption tax benefits can lead to inequities in taxation, as taxpayers with the same income may end up paying different amounts in taxes based on factors like homeownership, college expenses, or adoption. The IRS has struggled to administer adoption tax benefits effectively, with a high rate of audits for returns claiming the adoption tax credit. Despite efforts to verify documentation, the IRS disallowed $11 million in adoption credit claims, representing 1.5% of total claims audited. The IRS flagged a large proportion of returns for audit due to lack of familiarity with adoption documentation, leading to challenges in administering the refundable adoption credit. The varying documentation requirements across states and the state-based decision on special needs designation contribute to the complexity. This situation mirrors issues seen with the Earned Income Tax Credit, where non-standardized documentation causes problems for both taxpayers and the IRS. The IRS administers adoption tax benefits to encourage adoptions, with Congress considering modifications to achieve policy goals. There is debate on whether these benefits effectively increase adoptions, leading to discussions on potentially replacing them with direct spending on adoption or reallocating revenue to reduce the deficit. Congress could potentially modify adoption tax benefits by increasing the credit and exclusion percentage or eliminating the current statutory cap on the value of the benefits. While this may increase the value of the benefits for many taxpayers, it is uncertain if it would encourage more adoptions. There is limited evidence on the impact of adoption tax benefits on the decision to adopt. Increasing the size of adoption tax benefits will raise the total cost, with $251 million in adoption tax credits claimed in 2015. Making the adoption tax credit refundable could allow taxpayers with little or no tax liability to claim the full value in a year, unlike the current nonrefundable system where the credit is capped by tax liability. The adoption tax credit can be carried forward for up to five years and was temporarily refundable in 2010 and 2011. Making the credit refundable could benefit low- and middle-income taxpayers, promote equity, reduce compliance burden, and allow claimants to receive the full value sooner. When the adoption tax credit was nonrefundable, taxpayers claimed less than the maximum amount on average. Many taxpayers carried the credit forward on subsequent tax returns, requiring diligent record keeping. There could be a significant lag between when adoption expenses were incurred and when the credit was claimed. For example, legal expenses for a foreign adoption in 2010 could only be claimed on the 2012 tax return. The adoption tax credit was nonrefundable, with taxpayers claiming less than the maximum amount on average. They could carry forward the credit for expenses until their 2017 tax return. Making the credit refundable could encourage more adoptions from the domestic foster care system, especially among low-income taxpayers. The adoption tax credit, previously nonrefundable, could potentially increase adoptions from the foster care system among low-income taxpayers. However, making the credit refundable may lead to compliance burdens and administrative challenges for the IRS. Policymakers may need to find ways to prevent improper claims of the credit to reduce taxpayer burden and administrative difficulties. The adoption tax credit, previously nonrefundable, required paper filing with specific documentation based on the type of adoption. Making the credit refundable increased the total claimed amount significantly in 2010 and 2011. The 2010 and 2011 data show the cost of making the adoption tax credit refundable. Congress may adjust the credit formula to reduce costs and provide equal benefits for different types of adoptions. Taxpayers adopting children from abroad currently face timing restrictions for claiming tax benefits. Taxpayers adopting a child from abroad can only claim tax benefits once the adoption is finalized, unlike domestic adoptions. Congress could modify the definition of \"special needs adoption\" to include all types of adoptions. The IRS required paper tax returns with adoption documentation when the credit became refundable, causing issues with verification. One solution could be allowing a standard third-party affidavit for adoption verification. The IRS is considering allowing a standard third-party affidavit for adoption verification, which could reduce confusion and burden for taxpayers and IRS examiners. One suggestion is to convert the adoption assistance exclusion into a deduction available to all taxpayers, potentially increasing the availability of this benefit. However, this policy change may also lead to higher costs. The policy change may expand the availability of the adoption benefit but could increase costs and complexity for taxpayers. The value of the deduction depends on the taxpayer's tax bracket, providing the greatest tax savings to higher-income individuals. An illustrative example shows how a taxpayer claiming a $20,000 adoption tax credit would use carryforwards. In 2012, a taxpayer incurs $5,000 of adoption expenses but cannot claim the credit on that year's tax return. They must wait until 2013 to apply the expenses and claim up to a $5,000 tax credit. However, due to a $3,000 income tax liability in 2013, the taxpayer can only claim $3,000 of the credit, carrying forward the remaining $2,000. In 2014, a taxpayer can apply $17,000 of adoption expenses on their tax return, claiming a $3,000 credit and carrying forward $7,190. In 2015, they can continue to claim the credit using the carried-forward expenses, with a maximum of $7,400 available. In 2015, the taxpayer can claim $4,000 of the adoption tax credit, with a carryforward of $3,190. In 2016, the taxpayer can claim $3,190 of the credit, with no additional carryforward."
