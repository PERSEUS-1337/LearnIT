    "content": "The Act titled \"Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011\" amends the Oceans and Human Health Act. It establishes an Interagency Oceans and Human Health Research Program. The Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 amends Section 902(a) and (b) of the Oceans and Human Health Act to enhance public health benefits from the ocean. It requires the National Science and Technology Council to update the Interagency Oceans and Human Health Research Implementation Plan every 10 years. The updated Plan under the Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 defines the roles of Federal agencies to coordinate efforts in research programs related to harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. It complements existing research activities of various Federal departments and agencies. The updated Plan under the Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 outlines the coordination of Federal agencies in research programs on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. It includes monitoring, surveillance, prediction forecasting, and mitigation efforts, as well as support for scientists and participation in research and outreach initiatives. The Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 updates the Plan to coordinate Federal agencies in research programs on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. It includes interdisciplinary research among ocean, atmospheric, biological, and medical sciences to improve understanding of processes affecting human health. The Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 aims to study the impact of the ocean on human health, including diseases, algal blooms, marine-derived pharmaceuticals, and marine environmental microbiology. It also focuses on using marine organisms and habitats for biomedical research and as indicators of human health and environmental well-being. The Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 focuses on marine environmental microbiology linked to human health, human health effects from chemicals, predictive models of public health risks based on marine ecosystem health, and social studies on the relationship between oceans/coasts and human health. The Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 emphasizes the importance of an integrated ocean and coastal observing system to monitor marine public health issues, including climate change impacts, biological population health data, and detection of toxins in marine waters and seafood. It also includes updates on genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other related sciences for detecting, quantifying, and predicting health risks using in situ, laboratory, and remote sensors. The Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011 emphasizes the importance of monitoring marine public health issues, including detecting infectious microbes, harmful algae, toxins, and chemical contaminants in ocean waters. It also focuses on identifying new genetic resources for biomedical purposes and updating equipment, technologies, and methodologies for application to oceans and human health objectives. The Biennial Report section is amended to change from an annual to a biennial reporting schedule. The Biennial Report section is amended to change from an annual to a biennial reporting schedule by adjusting the frequency of reporting and updating terminology. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceans and Human Health Program is established. The Secretary of Commerce establishes an Oceans and Human Health Program under the interagency oceans and human health research program to coordinate research on the role of oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes in human health. The program focuses on forecasting health risks and monitoring emerging threats to public health. The Secretary of Commerce establishes an Oceans and Human Health Program to coordinate research on the role of oceans in human health, focusing on forecasting health risks and monitoring emerging threats. The program includes assessing risk perception, management needs, response actions, and developing ocean health products and services. Coordination with other federal agencies conducting similar research is required. The Oceans and Human Health Program aims to establish a strategic implementation plan with defined goals and benchmarks. It may provide support for centralized program coordination, an external advisory panel, national centers of excellence, transitioning scientific discoveries, research grants, distinguished scholars, and training. Advisory Panel amendments are also included. (b) Advisory Panel amendments include the addition of public health professionals, veterinarians, and other health professionals. National Centers will focus on agency missions and program scope. Extramural Research Grants will support research within the program scope. Training Program amendments are also included. The Training Program under Section 903(e) is amended to provide competitive training and exposure. A new program for Distinguished Scholars in oceans and human health research may be established by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce may execute contracts, leases, grants, or agreements for the Oceans and Human Health Program. Coordination is required between the Oceans and Human Health Program, National Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System, Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Program for developing instruments and early warning systems related to ocean health. The Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Program coordinates efforts with other programs under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Secretary of Commerce operates the Oceans and Human Health Program as an interdisciplinary research, development, and application program. Within 6 months of the Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of 2011, a report to Congress on implementing recommendations is required. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may apply for and use various funds, hold patents, and receive royalties to further the mission of the Oceans and Human Health Program. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration can apply for funds, hold patents, and share personnel and facilities with partners for the Oceans and Human Health Program. SEC. 4. PUBLIC INFORMATION AND OUTREACH. Section 904(a) is amended to include all relevant National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration programs and institutions of higher education. Section 904(b) requires the Secretary of Commerce to submit a biennial report to Congress on projects, products, and programs funded under the Oceans and Human Health Program. The Secretary of Commerce must report to Congress on how the Oceans and Human Health Program is meeting its strategic goals and any recommendations for improvement. The report may be combined with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration input for an interagency report. SEC. 5. Authorization of appropriations amends Section 905 to change funding amounts and terminology. SEC. 6. Defines oceans to include the Great Lakes and coastal areas."
