    "content": "Russia, formerly the Russian Federation, emerged in December 1991 after the dissolution of the USSR. The country's federal structure, inherited from the Soviet era, includes regions, republics, and territories. The constitution establishes a strong presidency with central authority, accountable to the president rather than the legislature. The government in Russia is accountable to the president, not the legislature, with the presidential Administration considered the true locus of power. Vladimir Putin has been in power for over 17 years as president or prime minister. His approval ratings have increased significantly since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, consistently exceeding 80%. The Federal Assembly serves as Russia's bicameral legislature, with the Federation Council consisting of 170 deputies representing the country's regions and republics. The Federation Council in Russia has 170 deputies, with two from each region and republic, including Crimea. The State Duma has 450 deputies, half elected by proportional representation and half in single-member districts. The judiciary is perceived to be controlled by the government, with the Supreme Court as the highest appellate body and the Constitutional Court ruling on legality and constitutionality. Under Putin's rule, Russia has seen a decline in democratic credentials, with the dissolution of the Supreme Commercial Court in 2014. The Constitutional Court can now disregard human rights verdicts from international bodies if they conflict with Russia's constitution. Russia was classified as a \"hybrid\" regime by Freedom House in the early 2000s, transitioning to a consolidated authoritarian state by 2008. Since Putin's return to the presidency in 2012, Russia has experienced a new rise in authoritarian governance, with Freedom House assigning it the same \"freedom rating\" as China, Yemen, Cuba, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016. The U.S. Department of State's human rights report highlights the Russian government's increasing measures to suppress individuals and organizations critical of the government. The human rights report criticizes the Russian government for lack of due process in politically motivated cases and restrictions on NGOs. Laws require foreign-funded organizations to register as \"foreign agents\" and allow the government to label foreign organizations as \"undesirable.\" 88 NGOs are classified as foreign agents, with Golos being the first in 2014. In 2015-2016, several organizations, including the Levada Center and Memorial, were labeled as foreign agents in Russia. Additionally, eleven organizations were barred for \"undesirable\" activity, such as the National Endowment for Democracy and Open Society Foundations. In April 2017, three affiliates of Open Russia, founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, were also added to the list. In Russia, there are restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression, with harsh penalties for participating in unsanctioned protests. New \"antiterrorism\" laws have broadened the definition of extremism and imposed restrictions on religious worship. LGBT rights are limited by a law prohibiting \"propaganda\" among minors. In Russia, laws restrict freedom of expression by prohibiting \"propaganda\" promoting \"non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors. The European Court on Human Rights deemed the law discriminatory. Discriminatory actions have affected religious and sexual minorities, such as the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses and reports of harassment in Chechnya. In Russia's North Caucasus, over 100 men were detained on suspicion of homosexuality, with reports of beatings, torture, and three deaths. Putin's spokesperson denied knowledge of the allegations, and the local administration dismissed the reports. Despite Putin's promise to investigate, it is unclear if any action was taken. Opposition figures in Russia, including Boris Nemtsov, have been murdered or died under mysterious circumstances. Many influential figures in Russia, including politician Boris Nemtsov, have been murdered or died under mysterious circumstances. Vladimir Putin is considered the most powerful person in Russia, but he leads a network of officials and business leaders. Minchenko Consulting group has identified the most influential figures in Russian policymaking. The most influential figures in Russian policymaking include around 50 key individuals in various spheres. Recent changes include a reduction in influence of Putin's longtime senior associates and a rise in younger officials. The rise of younger officials in Russian policymaking is evident, with many being loyal to Putin and gaining powerful positions. Some started as members of Putin's security service and have advanced to key roles, such as regional governors and deputy heads of the Federal Security Service. The declining influence of Putin's longtime colleagues is being observed, with factors such as efficiency, mismanagement, corruption, age, and bereavement playing a role. However, not all cases show these factors. The changes do not yet constitute a complete turnover, as some of Putin's longtime colleagues still hold significant power. This gradual shift is happening amidst fierce struggles for wealth. Amidst fierce struggles for wealth and influence among different power centers in Russia, including the FSB, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Investigative Committee, Ramzan Kadyrov, and a more liberal wing of the government, there are speculations that rivalries sometimes lead to events beyond Putin's control. Examples include the murder of Boris Nemtsov and the arrest of Alexey Ulyukaev. In September 2016, Russians elected the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, with the ruling United Russia party winning over 75% of the seats. The election marked a decrease in expectations of democratic change compared to the 2011 elections, which sparked protests against electoral fraud. Putin's government benefited from patriotic sentiment following Russia's annexation of Crimea. The 2016 Russian election saw the ruling United Russia party winning over 75% of the seats in the State Duma. The election was influenced by Russia's annexation of Crimea and appeals for national solidarity in the face of Western sanctions. The government took measures to bolster United Russia's victory and minimize opposition gains, with restrictions on opposition leaders and negative publicity branding them as agents of the West. Restrictions on mass demonstrations tightened, urban centers favoring the opposition were redistricted, and the election date was moved up in the 2016 Russian election. United Russia (UR) benefited from electoral rule changes, winning over 90% of single-member races with its financial and administrative resources. Election observers raised concerns about the election process. In the 2016 Russian election, United Russia (UR) won over 90% of single-member races with financial and administrative resources. Election observers noted concerns about fraud, with the counting process being criticized in 23% of polling stations. Three other parties gained seats, known as the loyal opposition, including the Communist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and A Just Russia. A Just Russia, a center-left party led by Sergei Mironov, briefly aligned with the opposition in 2011-2012 before returning to the fold. In the 2016 elections, no liberal opposition party won Duma seats, but Yabloko and PARNAS, both European-style liberal democratic parties, were eligible to compete. PARNAS faced criticism for including a populist firebrand on its list. Additionally, candidates from the Open Russia movement, founded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, contested 18 single-member races. The Party of Progress, led by Alexei Navalny, had its registration revoked in 2015, preventing them from participating in the election. Navalny himself is barred from running for office due to a criminal conviction. Opposition fragmentation and fear of brand damage hindered formal unification with other parties. In 2015, Navalny's Party of Progress joined a \"Democratic Coalition\" with PARNAS, facing registration issues and collapsing in 2016. Economic difficulties led to protests in Russia, with Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation organizing nationwide protests in 2017. In 2017, Navalny's Foundation attracted thousands to protest against corruption, leading to temporary detentions and legal actions. The government aims to reduce discontent by increasing social benefits before the 2018 presidential election. Speculation surrounds succession politics and Putin's potential reelection plans. Observers speculate about potential successors in the event of a controlled succession after 2018, with little faith in a democratic transition of power. Scenarios include emergence of candidates from right-wing nationalist or post-Communist left forces, not from a liberal opposition. Other possibilities involve a loss of control by Putin or his inner circle due to economic collapse, weakened state apparatus, or a failed external war. Rival political centers could also compete for power. The Russian economy has experienced periods of decline, growth, and stagnation since 1991. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there was a significant decline in GDP, followed by a decade of strong economic growth driven by increases in oil prices. However, the economy was severely impacted by the global financial crisis in 2008, exposing weaknesses. Concerns have been raised about potential power struggles and the rise of nationalist forces in Putin's absence. The Russian economy faced a downturn starting in 2008 due to its heavy reliance on oil exports and a weak financial system. Government control over key industries, like energy, also hindered growth. After a brief recovery in 2010, growth slowed again by 2013. External factors such as low oil prices and sanctions led to further economic challenges, including contraction and capital flight. In 2014, Russia's economy contracted by 2.8% with capital flight totaling $152 billion. The ruble depreciated by over 50% against the dollar, inflation increased to 15.5%, trade declined by 31% and 36%, budget deficit widened to 3.4%, and poverty rose to 19.2 million people. In 2015, reserves fell from $500 billion to $356 billion. Despite sanctions, the economy stabilized in 2016 with a slight contraction of 0.2%. In 2016, Russia's economy showed signs of improvement with a slight contraction of 0.2%. Private sector capital outflows decreased significantly, inflation dropped to 7.0%, the ruble stabilized, and reserves began to rise. Foreign direct investment started to resume, highlighted by a major deal with Qatar Investment Authority and Glencore purchasing a stake in Rosneft. Poverty levels were estimated at 13.5% of the population. According to the IMF, Russia's economy is projected to grow by 1.4% in 2017 due to rising oil prices and improved investor sentiment. The government has addressed budget shortfalls by tapping into the Reserve Fund, which has decreased to $16 billion from $143 billion in 2008. Consideration is being given to consolidating Russia's two sovereign wealth funds. Russia's economy faces long-standing challenges including slow diversification, weak property rights, and state involvement. Sanctions hinder investment growth, while the low ruble value and reliance on oil pose risks. Despite sanctions, the EU remains Russia's largest trading partner. Russia's top merchandise export destinations in 2016 were the Netherlands, China, and Germany, while its main sources of imports were China, Germany, and the United States. The impact of sanctions and low oil prices on Russia's economy remains uncertain, with experts suggesting adverse effects. The twin shocks of sanctions and low oil prices have negatively impacted Russia's economy. In 2015, the IMF estimated that sanctions and Russia's ban on agricultural imports reduced output by 1.0% to 1.5% in the short term. Over the medium term, the effects could be more significant, reducing output by up to 9.0%. Sanctions were not meant to push Russia over the economic cliff in the short run but to exert long-term pressure. Russian Finance Minister estimated the annual cost of sanctions at $40 billion, compared to $90 billion-$100 billion lost due to lower oil prices. The economic impact of sanctions on Russia has been significant, with estimates showing a 2.4% decrease in GDP by 2017. However, this effect is 3.3 times less than the impact of lower oil prices. Sanctions have severely harmed Russia's access to international financial markets, but the decline in energy prices has had a more severe effect. A study found that companies in Russia subject to sanctions lost a significant portion of their operating revenue, asset value, and employees compared to non-sanctioned peers. The long-term effects of sanctions, if they remain in place, are uncertain. The long-term impact of sanctions on Russia remains uncertain. Restrictions on U.S. financing for certain sectors or technology in Russian oil projects may have a more pronounced economic impact in the future. Russia's ability to find alternative economic partners, like China, India, and Brazil, will play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of U.S. and EU sanctions. Despite limited direct trade and investment between the U.S. and Russia, the potential consequences of sanctions on both countries are still unclear. In 2016, the United States was Russia's third-largest source of merchandise imports and 10th largest destination for exports. U.S. merchandise trade with Russia has significantly decreased over the past three years. U.S. merchandise exports to Russia dropped from $11.1 billion in 2013 to $5.8 billion in 2016, while imports fell from $27.1 billion to $14.5 billion. Investment ties between the two countries have also weakened, with U.S. investment in Russia decreasing to $9.2 billion in 2015. In 2016, top U.S. merchandise imports from Russia included fuels, oils, noncrude oil, aluminum, iron, steel, inorganic chemicals, precious metals, stones, and uranium. U.S. exports to Russia focused on machinery, nuclear reactors, aircraft, and spacecraft. In 2016, U.S. exports to Russia included aircraft, spacecraft, vehicles, optic instruments, electric machinery, and pharmaceutical products, accounting for over 75% of total exports. Several large U.S. companies like PepsiCo, Ford, GE, and Boeing are actively engaged in trade with Russia through exports, joint ventures, and reliance on Russian suppliers. The U.S.-Russia Business Council, with around 170 U.S. member companies, provides services for businesses operating in Russia. In 2012, Russia joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), and legislation allowed the President to extend permanent normal trade relations to Russia. The U.S. Trade Representative reports annually on Russia's WTO commitments. The 2016 report highlighted Russia's departure from WTO core tenets towards import-substitution economic policies. Russia, a significant energy producer, is the third-largest oil producer, second-largest natural gas producer, and sixth-largest coal producer. It is also the largest natural gas exporter, giving it market power for geopolitical purposes. Natural gas is a regional commodity due to expensive transport infrastructure. Russia is a major energy producer, ranking third in oil production, second in natural gas production, and sixth in coal production. It holds market power as the largest natural gas exporter, with natural gas being a regional commodity due to costly transport infrastructure. In 2015, several European and non-European countries heavily relied on Russian natural gas imports, with some countries depending on Russia for over half of their total gas consumption. Only a few countries, both EU and non-EU, relied on Russian gas for more than 20% of their total primary energy consumption. Maintaining leverage in Europe is crucial for Russia. Russia's dominance as Europe's top gas supplier is evident in its efforts to develop multiple pipeline routes, like Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2, to reduce reliance on transit states and meet regional demand. Approval from Denmark, Finland, and Sweden is still pending, with the EU also assessing regulatory implications. Opposition to the pipeline comes from countries like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is opposed by several governments, including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, and some U.S. Congress members, who argue it goes against the EU's goal of diversifying energy sources and could make Eastern Europe vulnerable to Russian manipulation. Russia's South Stream pipeline project was canceled in 2014, but the Turk Stream project now follows a similar route, stopping at the Turkish-Greek border. Gazprom has signed contracts for the Turk Stream project. In recent years, Russian foreign policy has become more assertive, with a focus on reestablishing Russia as a dominant political force in the post-Soviet region and minimizing the influence of rival powers like NATO and the EU. This has led to concerns about a new Cold War and increased attention from U.S. policymakers. Gazprom has signed contracts for projects like the Turk Stream pipeline, which aims to strengthen Russia's energy influence in the region. Russian foreign policy aims to establish Russia as a dominant global power, capable of competing with the United States. Debates exist on issues such as deterring Russian aggression, cooperating with Moscow, and the strategic vision of the Russian government. Retaining close ties with neighboring states is a fundamental goal since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian policymakers aim to rebuild ties with neighboring states that were once part of the USSR, seen as claiming a traditional sphere of influence. Terms like \"near abroad\" and \"region\" have been used to describe Russia's post-Soviet neighbors. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was established in 1991 to reintegrate post-Soviet states, excluding the Baltics. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was established in 1991 to reintegrate post-Soviet states, excluding the Baltics. Russia has had more success developing relations with a narrower circle of states through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). Members of these organizations have diverse goals, including trade facilitation and protection against external threats. Russia plays a dominant role in the CSTO and EEU, with significant population, GDP, and military expenditures. It maintains active bilateral relations with member states, focusing on economic, security, and political ties. Military facilities in CSTO states include bases and radar stations. Relations with partners are not always smooth, with occasional differences expressed. Relations between Russia and its CSTO and EEU partners can be challenging at times due to differences in foreign policy and economic development. While Russia's closest partners have not always fully aligned with Russia, they did support Russia in certain instances such as the annexation of Crimea. Additionally, partners like Armenia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan have voted with Russia in rejecting UN resolutions condemning Russia's actions. Russia's partners have strong ties with other countries, such as Kazakhstan with China and the West in the energy sector. China is the largest trading partner of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Armenia and Belarus have close relations with Russia but also economic ties to Europe. Both Armenia and Kazakhstan have partnerships with NATO. Kyrgyzstan hosted a military base for coalition troops fighting in Afghanistan for over 13 years. Russia has partnerships with Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, who pursue independent foreign policies and do not seek membership in Russian-led blocs. These states are significant energy producers and have alternative transit routes. Russia also has a partnership with Uzbekistan, which competes with Kazakhstan for regional leadership in Central Asia. Relations with Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine have been challenging as they seek close ties with the West, with Georgia pursuing NATO membership. Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine are close NATO partners and have association agreements with the EU. They have territorial conflicts with Russia, including separatist regions supported by Moscow. Russia went to war with Georgia in 2008 to prevent control over South Ossetia. The 2008 war between Russia and Georgia resulted in the expulsion of Georgian residents from South Ossetia and Abkhazia, with Russia recognizing their independence. Russia has imposed embargoes on Georgia and Moldova, but both countries have partially normalized relations. Ukraine has had a turbulent relationship with Russia, with disputes over NATO, the EU, Crimea, and gas transit. The decision to postpone Ukraine's agreement with the EU led to the Euromaidan protests, government crackdown, and eventually the downfall of President Yanukovych. This sparked Ukraine's armed conflict with Russia, resulting in the annexation of Crimea and the rise of separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. In late August 2014, Russia increased support for separatists in response to a new Ukrainian offensive. A cease-fire agreement, the Minsk Protocol, was negotiated in September 2014 but failed to resolve the crisis. A more detailed cease-fire agreement, Minsk-2, was reached in February 2015, requiring a total cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, and Ukrainian control over its border with Russia. Implementation of Minsk-2 provisions has been limited despite commitments from all sides. As of mid-May 2017, the conflict in eastern Ukraine had resulted in at least 10,090 fatalities. Despite Moscow's denial of direct involvement, there are estimated to be around 4,200 Russian troops in the region, supporting separatists with weapons and armed vehicles. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has heightened tensions between NATO and Russia, with around 4,200 Russian troops in the region. NATO has taken actions to counter Moscow and reassure Central and Eastern European allies. Efforts to build a cooperative NATO-Russia partnership have had mixed results. The NATO-Russia Council (NRC) was established in 2002 to promote bilateral cooperation between NATO and Russia. Meetings were suspended in 2014 but resumed in 2016. Prior to the suspension, areas for cooperation were identified, including a Joint Review of 21st Century Security Challenges in 2010. The NATO-Russia Council (NRC) was established in 2002 to promote cooperation between NATO and Russia. Common security challenges were identified, such as instability in Afghanistan, terrorism, and weapons proliferation. Despite some cooperation, disagreements persisted within the alliance and between NATO and Russia. After the 2010 agreement on missile defense cooperation, NATO and Russia faced disagreements. Following Russia's actions in Ukraine, NATO reinforced its collective defense with the Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) in Poland and the Baltic states, led by the UK, Canada, Germany, and the US. NATO has increased military exercises in Central and Eastern Europe, expanded the NATO Response Force, and established new command-and-control capacities in the region. The United States has played a key role in these initiatives, including Operation Atlantic Resolve to bolster its military presence in Eastern Europe in response to Russian actions. Operation Atlantic Resolve involves increased rotational deployments of air, ground, and naval assets, funded by a $5.2 billion appropriation for the European Reassurance Initiative. The EU has also coordinated with the US on imposing sanctions on Russia, despite Russia being the EU's fourth-largest trade partner. The EU's relationship with Russia is complex due to economic ties and differing views among member states. While some advocate for a strategic partnership, others see Russia as a threat, with perceptions shifting after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Many in Europe are concerned about Russia's non-military efforts to expand influence on the continent, including disinformation, fake news, cyberattacks, and cultivating relations with sympathetic parties. These actions aim to sow disunity and destabilize the EU and NATO, with a growing ideological link between European far-right parties and the Russian leadership. European far-right parties in Europe are believed to have connections with the Russian government, with speculation of financial support and assistance in organizational expertise and media. This support aims to strengthen ties and influence within these parties. The Russian government, under Putin, has been sophisticated in exerting influence in Europe through various means such as supporting pro-Russian parties, civil organizations, and media outlets. Russia and China cooperate to counter U.S. hegemony and criticize U.S. military presence in Asia. Both countries hold vetoes on the U.N. Security Council and often oppose U.S. efforts to upgrade defense capabilities with treaty allies. China and Russia cooperate to counter U.S. hegemony and often oppose U.N. Security Council resolutions supported by Western states. Their partnership is influenced by external events, with U.S. behavior being a key factor. China has avoided forming an anti-Western alliance and maintains significant trade with the U.S. Russia's intervention in Ukraine has affected its relations with China, driving closer cooperation in response to Western sanctions. The relationship between China and Russia has shown signs of strain due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to an increased need for Beijing's support. Tensions have also arisen over perceptions of Chinese migration to Russia. China remains Russia's largest trading partner, but there are concerns about the economic imbalance between the two countries. In 2015, trade between China and Russia declined significantly, with Chinese exports falling by over 30% and imports from Russia dropping by more than 20% due to lower energy prices. However, in 2016, bilateral trade saw a modest increase, driven by growing Chinese exports to Russia. Energy deals, including large oil-for-loan agreements and a major gas pipeline project called \"Power of Siberia,\" have been key aspects of the partnership between the two countries. Russia and China have advanced security relations through military exercises under the SCO. Joint naval drills have been conducted in various seas since 2012, signaling a message to the West. Russian military involvement in Syria has historical roots dating back to the 1950s. Syria has historical ties with Russia dating back to the 1950s. Russian naval forces have had access to a facility in Tartus since the 1970s, using it as a logistical hub for Mediterranean operations. Former President Hafez al Asad hosted Soviet military advisers but resisted Moscow's attempts to gain permanent access to shore facilities. Russian personnel were based in Syria before the current intervention, providing military support to the Assad regime after the NATO-led intervention in Libya in 2011. Russia has historical ties with Syria dating back to the 1950s. Moscow provided military and financial assistance to President Hafez al Asad's regime. Despite differences, Russia and the United States cooperated in peacemaking efforts. In 2013, Russia proposed an international mission to remove chemical weapons from Syria to avoid U.S. military intervention. In 2015, Russia began a gradual buildup of personnel and military equipment in Syria, leading to airstrikes in September. Russia began airstrikes in Syria in September, targeting Syrian opposition and later Islamic State forces. They also resupply Syrian military forces and introduced advanced air defense systems. Russia's airstrikes have enabled forces loyal to Asad to reverse opposition gains, particularly in Aleppo. Their actions have complicated proposals for a no-fly zone and strained cooperation between the U.S. and Russia. Russia's involvement in Syria includes airstrikes targeting Syrian opposition and Islamic State forces, resupplying Syrian military, and introducing advanced air defense systems. They have enabled Asad's forces to regain territory, complicating proposals for a no-fly zone and straining U.S.-Russia cooperation. Russian ground forces focus on defending bases and installing modernized weapons systems to bolster Asad's capabilities and test new weapons. Russia has tested 162 weapons in Syria, with a focus on the T-90 battle tank's performance against U.S.-made TOW missiles. They aim to weaken Syrian rebel groups to strengthen the Asad government's negotiating position. Russia may extend operations in Islamic State-held areas and maintain influence by advising the Syrian military. They have agreements for long-term presence at Tartus naval facility and Hmeimim airbase in Latakia. Russia has taken an active role in political negotiations in Syria, hosting peace talks with Turkey and Iran in Astana, Kazakhstan. A memorandum signed by Russia, Iran, and Turkey called for the creation of four \"de-escalation areas\" in Syria, potentially becoming spheres of influence for these countries. Russia has deployed military police in Damascus and southwestern Syria to establish two of these areas. The planned de-escalation area in southwestern Syria emerged from a cease-fire deal brokered in July by the United States, Russia, and Jordan. Analysts suggest that Russia's intervention in Syria was motivated by the series of losses suffered by the Russian-backed Syrian government in 2015, U.S. and other third-party security assistance to Syrian opposition groups, the growth of the Islamic State organization in Syria, and the potential for broader U.S.-led coalition military operations. Asad's potential defeat in 2015 would have had negative implications for Russia, including the loss of a key partner in the Middle East and a region where Russia was expanding its influence to establish itself as a global power and peer competitor to the United States. Russian authorities opposed a U.S. military-backed transition in Syria, fearing it would benefit extremists like the Islamic State. They warned that the collapse of the Asad regime could lead to the spread of Islamist extremism to other countries, including Central Asia and Russia. Reports indicate that Russian citizens, mainly from Muslim-populated regions, have fought with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. The Al Qaeda-aligned Islamic Emirate of the Caucasus, established in 2007, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and formed a local affiliate, the Wilayah Kawkaz. Russia intervened in Syria to bolster its influence, test military capabilities, and assert global power, amidst international criticism over actions in Ukraine. Russia's foreign policy priorities traditionally focus on the post-Soviet region and the West, but it also actively engages in global relations. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a member of groups like the G8 and BRICS, Russia plays a significant role in global issues such as nonproliferation, counterterrorism, and global health challenges. Russia is a leading oil and gas exporter and the second-largest major weapons exporter globally. It has constructed nuclear power plants in various countries and cultivated bilateral partnerships worldwide, including in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Russia has reengaged with former Soviet-era partners in Latin America, including Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Brazil. In sub-Saharan Africa, Russia is expanding its focus, aiming to strengthen relations in a region where the Soviet Union once had close partners. Russia's military surprised observers with actions in Ukraine and Syria, showcasing capabilities that were previously underestimated due to perceived decline since the Cold War. The Russian military has shown improved capabilities in recent years, demonstrated by the swift seizure of Crimea in 2014 and involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. This strategy of \"hybrid warfare\" involves using irregular forces covertly supported by regular troops, along with an information and propaganda campaign to create misdirection. Additionally, Russia's campaign in Syria serves broader diplomatic objectives and allows for the testing and display of military capabilities. Russia's military has demonstrated improved capabilities through operations in Crimea, Ukraine, and Syria. They have showcased advanced military technologies, including long-range cruise missiles and modern combat aircraft. Russia has also focused on enhancing its presence in the Arctic, establishing new facilities and forming specialized Arctic warfare brigades. Additionally, Russia has adopted a more aggressive posture with increased air and sea patrols. Russia's Western Military District, spanning from Finland to northeastern Ukraine and including Kaliningrad, hosts around 400,000 troops. Unofficial estimates suggest a lower number. The district comprises various army, air force, navy, and special forces units. In 2016, Russia announced plans to add two new units. In May 2016, Russia announced plans to deploy new divisions in the Western and Southern Military Districts, totaling 30,000 troops. Russian forces in the region, including ships, submarines, and S-400 air defense systems, could block NATO reinforcements in the Baltic Sea. A quick Russian strike could reach Estonia and Latvia's capitals in 36-60 hours. Kaliningrad is strategically important for Russia, with a heavy military presence, including the Baltic Fleet and airbases. In October 2016, Russia deployed Iskander short-range nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad in response to new NATO deployments. This deployment is part of Russia's plan to modernize its non-nuclear ballistic missile system and pursue an anti-access/area denial strategy in the region. Russia's plan for Kaliningrad is to modernize its military infrastructure, not flood it with troops. Analysts suggest Russia may try to seize the Suwalki Gap to connect Kaliningrad with Belarus. Russia has increased militarization in neighboring states, including Crimea with an estimated 28,000-29,000 troops and supporting separatist movements in eastern Ukraine. Russia has deployed thousands of troops in various regions without consent, including Georgia, Moldova, and Armenia. In Georgia, military bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia house thousands of personnel. In Moldova, troops are stationed in Transnistria. Additionally, Russia has a military presence in Armenia. Armenia hosts 3,300-5,000 Russian troops and has agreements with Russia for joint air defense and combined forces. The U.S.-Russian relationship has fluctuated over the years due to disagreements over Russia's sphere of influence and NATO enlargement. Bush and Putin attempted to improve relations after 9/11. U.S.-Russian relations shifted post-9/11 towards cooperation against terrorism and economic integration, but tensions resurfaced over issues like the Iraq War, color revolutions, Russian pressure on neighbors, and missile defense plans. The 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict led to a low point in bilateral ties. The Obama Administration aimed to reset relations with Russia, leading to cooperation in various areas. The United States and Russia cooperated in various areas, including establishing a U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission, signing the 2010 New START Treaty, facilitating transit of supplies to Afghanistan, cooperating in Afghan counternarcotics, Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, imposing sanctions on Iran, developing the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, imposing U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea, and removing chemical weapons from Syria. Despite progress in various areas of cooperation, U.S.-Russian relations faced challenges, particularly regarding Russia's disapproval of U.N. Security Council decisions on Libya and concerns over NATO missions being used for regime change. Tensions escalated with Russia's disputed parliamentary elections in December 2011 and Putin's return to the presidency in March 2012. Hillary Clinton expressed concerns about the elections, further straining relations. In response to concerns raised by Hillary Clinton about the fairness of the election, Putin accused the State Department of interference in Russia's internal affairs. This led to a decline in relations, culminating in the passing of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act in December 2012, which imposed sanctions on individuals involved in human rights abuses. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act imposed sanctions on individuals involved in human rights abuses in Russia, leading to intense Russian reaction and the termination of an adoption agreement with the US. In response to the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, Russia enacted a \"foreign agent\" law targeting foreign-funded organizations. This led to the closure of U.S. foreign assistance programs and the postponement of a U.S.-Russian presidential summit in 2013. Tensions escalated further in 2014 due to Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea. In response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, the United States and its allies imposed sanctions and suspended various forms of cooperation with Russia. Russia was also removed from the G8 group of nations. In December 2016, President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for election-related cyber activity. The Trump Administration responded to increased harassment of U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia by declaring 35 Russian diplomatic personnel persona non grata and denying access to Russian government-owned compounds. Despite initial efforts to improve relations with Russia, tensions escalated following sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration for election-related cyber activity. In February 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressed willingness to work with Russia for practical cooperation. He later met with Putin and Lavrov in Moscow, acknowledging the strained U.S.-Russia relations. President Trump also met with Putin in July 2017 at a G20 meeting in Germany. Improved U.S.-Russian relations are desired by many, including former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. Former Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the importance of not ignoring Russia due to its size and power. The United States faces challenges in improving relations with Russia while maintaining commitments to allies and addressing concerns about Russian interference in the U.S. election. Despite expressing a desire for cooperation on various issues, such as Syria and cybersecurity, the Administration has faced constraints. Media reports suggested hesitation in seeking cooperation with Russia against the Islamic State, but Secretary Tillerson's meeting with Putin indicated a willingness to engage. After Secretary Tillerson's meeting with Putin in April 2017, they discussed ways to address terrorism in Syria and find a solution to the conflict. In July 2017, President Trump and Putin talked about a de-escalation agreement in southwestern Syria and the potential for cooperation in other conflict zones. This marked a positive step in U.S.-Russia collaboration in Syria. They also discussed improving communication channels between the two governments. Secretary Tillerson and Russia agreed to establish a working group to address smaller issues and stabilize the relationship. Russia could play a constructive role in influencing North Korea's nuclear program. The U.S. supports dialogue with Russia on cybersecurity, but President Trump rejected the idea of a joint cybersecurity unit. Tom Bossert, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, emphasized the importance of engaging in a dialogue with Russia on cybersecurity to establish rules and norms in cyberspace. Administration officials have acknowledged that Russia's interference in U.S. elections hinders efforts to improve relations. Secretary Tillerson raised concerns about Russian interference in meetings with Putin, leading to discussions on the obstacles it poses to the Russian-U.S. relationship. The Secretary highlighted election interference as a barrier to improving US-Russia relations and emphasized the need for assurances against future interference. The US intelligence community unanimously agrees on Russian interference. The Administration also aims to change Russia's policy towards Ukraine, condemning Russian actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Secretary Tillerson continues to condemn the Russian occupation of Crimea and insists that sanctions will remain until Russia returns control of the peninsula to Ukraine. He emphasizes the importance of Russia changing its approach in Ukraine and expects them to honor their commitments to de-escalate violence in the region. The situation in Ukraine remains a barrier to improving US-Russia relations, and Tillerson calls on Russia to make progress in implementing agreements to de-escalate violence. The Secretary of State calls for the withdrawal of separatist armed forces and heavy weapons in Ukraine to allow OSCE observers to fulfill their role. President Trump and Secretary Tillerson have both urged Russia to cease destabilizing activities in Ukraine. Former U.S. Ambassador Kurt Volker was appointed as the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations. President Trump signed the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 into law, which imposes sanctions on Russia and strengthens existing ones. President Trump signed the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017 into law, imposing new sanctions on Russia and establishing a congressional review of any presidential action to ease sanctions. The Russian government responded by reducing U.S. mission personnel in Russia and suspending U.S. usage of facilities in Moscow. The 115th Congress has passed the Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act of 2017, which imposes sanctions on Russia and strengthens existing ones. Congressional committees have held numerous hearings on various Russia-related matters, including election interference and INF Treaty violations. The 115th Congress has passed legislation imposing sanctions on Russia, including cyber-related executive orders and additional sanctions. The bill also establishes a congressional review of any presidential actions to ease or lift sanctions. This legislation was included in the Countering Iran's Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017, which passed both the Senate and the House with overwhelming support. The President signed the bill into law on August 2, 2017, which also includes sanctions on Iran and North Korea. In FY2017, Congress allocated funds for democracy programs in Russia, including promoting Internet freedom. Additional restrictions were placed on defense and energy appropriations. Legislation has been introduced to address Russian influence operations and illicit financial activities. An executive interagency committee was established to counter Russian covert influence. Current versions of defense and intelligence authorization acts for 2018 also include measures related to countering Russian activities. In FY2017, Congress allocated funds for Countering Russian Influence Fund to counter aggression in Europe and Eurasia. The fund supports civil society organizations for programs strengthening democratic institutions, countering Russian influence, and promoting energy security. Legislation authorizes an additional $250 million for FY2018 and FY2019 to assist NATO and EU members against Russian disinformation and cyberattacks. The Countering Russian Influence Fund supports programs to counter aggression in Europe and Eurasia, strengthen democratic institutions, and promote energy security. The act requires reports on Russian-funded media organizations and influence on elections in Europe and Eurasia. It also states that the US does not recognize territorial changes by force, including illegal invasions and occupations in various regions. Foreign operations appropriations restrict funds for policies recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea or supporting occupation of certain regions. The House passed a resolution condemning violence in Chechnya based on sexual orientation, calling for accountability under the Magnitsky Act. U.S. sanctions on Russia are mainly in response to actions in Ukraine, with over 595 individuals and entities sanctioned since 2014. President Obama imposed economic sanctions on Russia, targeting 595 individuals and entities for their actions in Ukraine. The sanctions were based on executive orders issued in 2014, identifying those who undermined Ukraine's stability, annexed Crimea, used armed force, or conducted business in occupied Crimea. Designated individuals and entities face asset blocking and entry denial into the US. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) enforces sanctions on Russia, restricting transactions with designated entities and persons. Sectoral sanctions limit financing for state-controlled companies in Russia's financial sector, as well as companies in the energy and defense sectors. Prohibitions also extend to projects in deepwater, Arctic offshore, and shale oil development in Russia. P.L. 115-44 directs further restrictions on financing in Russia's financial and energy sectors. The US enforces sanctions on Russia in financial and energy sectors, extending prohibitions to worldwide projects involving designated persons with at least 33% ownership interest. Export licenses for military, dual-use, and energy-related goods are denied to nearly 200 designated end-users. Sanctions are required on foreign persons making significant investments in deepwater, Arctic offshore, or shale oil projects in Russia, as well as on foreign financial institutions funding such projects. The Ukraine-related sanctions imposed by the US in 2014 require sanctions on individuals undermining Ukraine's stability. While the effectiveness of the sanctions in changing Russian policy is uncertain, they have negatively impacted the Russian economy. Russia has not reversed its occupation of Crimea or dropped support for separatists in Donbas. However, Russia has signed agreements recognizing Donbas as part of Ukraine and rebel military operations have been limited to the conflict zone perimeter. In December 2016, the Obama Administration imposed sanctions on nine individuals and entities for election-related activities. The US imposed sanctions on nine individuals and entities for election-related malicious cyber activity, including Russia's FSB and GRU. These designees face asset blocking, transaction prohibitions with US persons, and denial of entry into the US. The sanctions were codified under P.L. 115-44, expanding the scope to include activities undermining cybersecurity. Additionally, restrictions are placed on individuals engaging in significant transactions with Russia's defense or intelligence sectors. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 requires sanctions on individuals involved in human rights abuses in Russia, with 44 individuals currently sanctioned. The Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 mandates sanctions on Russian government officials. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and the Support for the Sovereignty, Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Stability of Ukraine Act of 2014 require sanctions on Russian government officials involved in human rights abuses and those responsible for significant corruption. Sanctions are also imposed on foreign individuals supporting human rights abuses in territories controlled by Russia, as well as on those facilitating investments benefiting Russian government officials. Additionally, sanctions are mandated against Russian entities involved in arms exports and financial institutions engaging in related transactions. The P.L. 115-44 introduces sanctions on foreign persons aiding the Syrian government in acquiring advanced weapons. It also allows sanctions on those investing in Russia's energy export pipelines. Reports on expanding sanctions to Russian elites and combating illicit finance are required. Russian individuals and entities have been sanctioned for various activities related to Syria, North Korea, terrorism, transnational crime, and weapons proliferation. A declassified report by the ODNI stated that President Putin ordered an influence campaign in the 2016 US presidential election to undermine public faith in the democratic process and harm Hillary Clinton's electability. The report also mentioned Russian aspirations to help President-elect Trump by discrediting Clinton. Unofficial allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election involved the illicit collection and release of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton's campaign chairperson. These operations targeted the Democratic Party and other U.S. and international entities, including Republican-connected individuals. The FBI found no evidence that the current RNC or Trump campaign were successfully hacked, although Russian hackers breached old RNC domains. Emails from DNC and Podesta were released by WikiLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and DC Leaks, allegedly linked to Russian intelligence. The ODNI report corroborates claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election, including accessing state or local electoral boards. Russian government cyber actors targeted election-related networks in 21 states, with some successfully compromised. The report also mentions Russian efforts through state-run media and social media to promote Trump and denigrate Clinton. Voter registration systems may have been hacked, but there is no evidence of tampering with vote tallies or emails released by WikiLeaks. The ODNI report confirms Russian interference in the 2016 election, targeting election-related networks in 21 states. Russian efforts included promoting Trump and denigrating Clinton through state-run media and social media. Congress is investigating Russian cyber activities and interference in U.S. elections, with various committees conducting related hearings and legal actions taken against Russian individuals for cyber activities. In December 2016, two individuals faced cybercrime sanctions for stealing over $100 million from U.S. businesses and personal data from 500 million Yahoo accounts. In March 2017, the Department of Justice indicted four individuals, including two FSB officers, for the Yahoo data theft. Two Russian suspects are being sought for extradition from the Czech Republic and Spain. In April 2017, a Russian MP's son was sentenced to 27 years for credit card and identity theft. Recent cybercrime prosecutions in Russia include FSB officials on treason charges. FSB officials are being tried for treason, with speculation linking the arrests to Russia's interference in U.S. elections. Some individuals are accused of being part of a hacking group that obtained and sold private information of Russian officials. The head of the hacking group pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years in prison. Arms control negotiations were crucial during the Cold War for communication between the United States and the Soviet Union. During the 1990s, arms control played a less central role in US-Russia cooperation. However, since 1992, three arms control treaties have been negotiated, with two entering into force: the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty of 2002 and the New START Treaty of 2010. The New START Treaty and the 1987 INF Treaty are the key nuclear arms control agreements between the two countries. The New START Treaty expires in 2021 but may be extended for five years, with both nations needing to meet strategic arms limits by February 2018. The New START Treaty limits strategic arms to 800 launchers and 1,550 deployed warheads for each side. The future of the treaty is uncertain as the Trump Administration has not made any official statements. The INF Treaty eliminated intermediate-range missiles in Europe, but the US accused Russia of violating it in 2014. In 2014, the United States accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty by developing a ground-launched cruise missile with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. Russia began deploying the missile in numbers greater than needed for testing, violating the treaty's \"spirit and intent.\" General Paul Selva confirmed Russia's deployment, stating it posed a threat to NATO facilities and showed no intention of complying with the treaty. The United States and Russia have various arms control agreements, including a \"hotline\" for emergency communications established in 1963 and updated in 2008. They also have Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers (NRRC) since 1987, which are crucial for implementing bilateral arms control agreements and the Ballistic Missile Launch Notification Agreement. President Obama used the hotline to communicate with Putin about election interference. Since 1992, the United States has provided over $10 billion to help Russia dismantle nuclear weapons and enhance security for weapons of mass destruction. This funding supported programs managed by the Department of Defense, Energy, and State to transport, store, and eliminate weapons in Russia, improve security at storage sites, and focus on securing and eliminating chemical and biological weapons. The United States and Russia signed a new bilateral protocol to aid Russia with Soviet-era weapons cleanup work. Cooperation on nuclear security continued, but projects on nuclear weapons dismantlement and chemical weapons destruction ceased. Joint nonproliferation efforts declined after Russia's actions in Ukraine. Joint nonproliferation efforts between the United States and Russia declined further after Russia's actions in Ukraine. In December 2014, Russia informed the U.S. it would no longer accept assistance in securing nuclear materials. Congress imposed restrictions on nonproliferation assistance funding to Russia, except with a national security waiver. The most prominent remaining bilateral nuclear security projects in Russia ceased in 2016. President Putin issued a decree suspending participation in a U.S.-Russian weapons plutonium disposal agreement in October 2016. In response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, joint nonproliferation efforts between the United States and Russia declined. Russia suspended participation in various cooperative agreements, including a 2013 research agreement and a 2010 agreement on converting research reactors. Despite these suspensions, both sides committed to continuing work on the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement. Congress is expected to continue shaping U.S. policy towards Russia, focusing on monitoring new sanctions and programs addressing Russian interference in domestic political processes. The curr_chunk discusses responding to Russian interference in U.S. and European politics, reassuring European allies, deterring Russian aggression, promoting Russia's compliance in resolving the Ukraine conflict, addressing violations of the INF Treaty, exploring cooperation with Russia on Syria and ISIS, and identifying other areas for potential cooperation like North Korea, arms control, cybersecurity, and space."
