    "content": "The Act titled \"No Child Left Unimmunized Against Influenza Act of 2009\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses, with over 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths in the US annually. The CDC recommends routine influenza vaccination for children aged 6 months to 18 years due to their higher risk of infection compared to adults. School-aged children are key for transmitting respiratory viruses like influenza. The elderly and young children are most at risk for severe illness from influenza due to weaker immune responses. Vaccinating children can protect the elderly. School-based vaccination programs are effective in reducing transmission and absenteeism. Focusing on vaccinating children will help build a foundation for future vaccination efforts. School-based vaccination programs are crucial for future vaccination efforts, especially for pandemic situations. Increased participation in annual influenza vaccination programs helps establish the infrastructure needed for pandemic vaccination. These programs also aim to conduct mass immunization clinics and collaborate with local public health teams during public health emergencies. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM USING ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AS INFLUENZA VACCINATION CENTERS.\" is about utilizing elementary and secondary schools as influenza vaccination centers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a multistate demonstration program using elementary and secondary schools as influenza vaccination centers in collaboration with various stakeholders. The program will not replace costs for children covered by other federal programs for the influenza vaccine. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will work with stakeholders to ensure children with private insurance have coverage for influenza vaccine expenses outside of a physician's office. Payment for vaccine costs not covered by federal programs or private insurance will be addressed. The Secretary may pay vaccine costs through the demonstration program, following ACIP recommendations for children aged 5 to 19. Schools will be selected for participation based on criteria determined by the Secretary and the Secretary of Education. The demonstration program for secondary schools will be located in metropolitan and rural areas, serving low-income public school students. Participation is voluntary, and the program will run for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons. Health care providers can choose any approved influenza vaccine. The Secretary will submit a report on the results of the demonstration program for secondary schools, including an assessment of influenza vaccination rates among school-aged children in localities where the program is implemented. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends annual influenza vaccination for children aged 6 months to 18 years. An assessment is needed for using schools in a multi-state pandemic response program. The feasibility of a school-based vaccination program using existing funding sources should be evaluated. The impact of seasonal vaccinations on student absenteeism and education days gained should be determined. The success of the demonstration program should be evaluated. In this section, a recommendation will be made on whether a demonstration program should continue, expand, or terminate. Definitions for \"elementary school,\" \"secondary school,\" and \"low-income\" are provided. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The term \"Secretary\" means the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2012."
