    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Telephone Consumer Slamming Prevention Act of 1997\" and includes a prohibition on long-distance slamming. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include verification procedures required for subscriber selections of interstate carriers. No carrier can change a subscriber's selection of a provider of interstate telephone service without obtaining a written change authorization from the subscriber. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires carriers to obtain a signed and dated written change authorization from subscribers for any changes in interstate telephone service providers. The authorization must follow specific solicitation procedures, including being a standalone document, not containing any promotional offers, and provided to the subscriber in duplicate for retention. Any carrier violating the requirements of obtaining written change authorization from subscribers for interstate telephone service changes will be liable to the subscriber for switching fees and long-distance charges incurred during the unauthorized service period. If a State certifies to the Commission, it shall administer a slamming complaint system for interstate telephone service subscribers that meets specific requirements. The State commission must establish and maintain a slamming complaint system that meets requirements set by the Commission. The certification is effective upon submission, and the Commission can prescribe the process for terminating certifications. The Commission will administer a slamming complaint system for states not described in the previous paragraph. The State commission must establish a slamming complaint system for interstate telephone service subscribers that meets specific requirements. This system allows subscribers to register complaints about unauthorized provider changes and determines violations and liability. The State commission must establish a slamming complaint system for interstate telephone service subscribers to report unauthorized provider changes and track violations. Monthly reports are required to determine the number of violations involving illegal service changes for each telecommunications carrier in the State. If the system is administered by a State commission, the information must be provided to the Commission. The Commission requires telecommunications carriers to inform subscribers about the slamming complaint system in their phone bills, including how to register a complaint and contact information for the system. The Commission will establish performance limits for unauthorized changes in subscribers' selections of providers of interstate telephone service. These limits will be based on a study of incidence rates, with the ability to review and adjust them periodically. The Commission will establish performance limits for unauthorized changes in subscribers' selections of providers of interstate telephone service. These limits will be compared monthly for each telecommunications carrier by the Commission. If a carrier exceeds the limit, a forfeiture penalty will be imposed. If a carrier exceeds the performance limit for unauthorized changes in subscribers' selections of interstate telephone service, they will be considered to have willfully failed to comply with the Act and will be liable for a forfeiture penalty to the United States. The Commission will consider the extent and gravity of the violation in determining the amount of the penalty. The section outlines the criteria for determining violations of performance limits and emphasizes that carriers must still comply with consumer protection laws and states can enforce additional oversight measures. The section allows carriers to implement systems and procedures to ensure compliance with performance limits without hindering enforcement of this section or other Federal statutes. SEC. 3 amends the Communications Act of 1934 to limit slamming liability provision to intrastate service. SEC. 4 specifies the effective date and regulations. SEC. 4 specifies the effective date and regulations for the amendments made by this Act, including the Commission prescribing necessary regulations and a standard form for written change authorizations."
