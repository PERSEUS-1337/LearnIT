    "content": "The Act titled \"Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce Act\" is established for the purpose of promoting fair competition in foreign commerce. Congress finds that the United States contributes significantly to international development projects through various multilateral lending institutions, which are often plagued by fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, and misuse of funding, hindering fair competition in foreign commerce. Detection of impediments before they occur is crucial for ensuring the appropriate use of valuable United States resources in international development projects. Independent third-party procurement monitoring plays a key role in detecting and preventing such impediments by evaluating each stage of the procurement process to promote transparency, minimize fraud, corruption, waste, and inefficiency, and strengthen international trade and foreign commerce. The purpose of this Act is to require the use of independent third-party procurement monitoring in international development projects to promote transparency, prevent fraud and corruption, and strengthen international trade and foreign commerce. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate committees\" refer to specific Senate and House committees. \"Independent third-party procurement monitoring\" aims to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in international procurement. The term \"independent\" means the monitor does not have any conflicts of interest. The term \"each stage of procurement\" includes technical specifications, bidding documents, evaluation reports, contract preparation, and delivery of goods and services. \"Multilateral development banks and other lending institutions\" refer to specific international organizations like the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund. The curr_chunk mentions various international organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Investment Corporation, North American Development Bank, and African Development Fund. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR COMPETITION IN FOREIGN COMMERCE. The Secretary of the Treasury must provide a strategic plan for independent third-party procurement monitoring in multilateral development banks within 180 days of this Act. The plan includes instructions to oppose the use of US funds until recipient institutions adopt anticorruption measures. The Secretary of the Treasury must report annually to Congress on the progress of implementing procurement reforms in multilateral development banks and recipient countries. No funds for nonhumanitarian foreign assistance programs can be used unless specific anticorruption measures are in place. Foreign assistance programs, like those of the Agency for International Development, require recipient countries to have transparent procurement practices free of corruption and to use independent third-party monitoring. Exceptions to the rules for foreign assistance include cases where funds are deemed crucial for national security interests by the President, as well as for urgent humanitarian needs, democratic reform, independent organizations, and free market development."
