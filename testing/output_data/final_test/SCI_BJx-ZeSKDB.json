    "content": "We explore compositional set embeddings for inferring multiple classes associated with input data, useful for tasks like multi-object detection in images or multi-speaker diarization in audio. Two novel models are devised: one with an embedding function trained with a \"composite\" function for set union operations, and another with a \"query\" function for determining class relationships. These models perceive input classes and encode relationships between class label sets. Experiments on simulated data, OmniGlot, and COCO datasets are conducted. In experiments on simulated data, OmniGlot, and COCO datasets, composite embedding models outperform baselines. Embeddings, driven by advances in deep learning, are widely used in various applications like natural language processing, object recognition, and speaker verification. They create fixed-length representations for more efficient downstream analysis and support one-shot learning. Previous research focused on single-class examples, but we explore cases with multiple classes per example. In contrast to single-class examples, we investigate embedding multiple classes per example using compositional set embeddings. The goal is to automatically perceive the classes in each example and answer questions about class relationships. Our function f maps examples into an embedding space where examples with the same classes are close together and different classes are far apart. The paper proposes two models where function f is trained with either a \"composition\" function g or a \"query\" function h to answer questions about set union and subsumption. The goal is for g to compose embeddings of examples containing classes T and U to approximate the embedding of an example containing classes T \u222a U. The embedding space is compositional and novel, with potential applications in speaker recognition and multi-object recognition in images. The function g composes embeddings to infer information about unseen classes, such as identifying speakers in audio signals or objects in images using one-shot learning. The embedding space is compositional and novel, with potential applications in speaker recognition and multi-object recognition in images. Given just the embedding of an image, answer whether it contains the object(s) in another image. Storing just the embeddings but not the pixels could be more space-efficient. Evaluation of models focused on the unique contribution of compositional embedding compared to traditional embedding. Modeling assumptions and notation refer to the data to be embedded as \"examples\" and the universe of classes as S. Ground-truth rendering and classification functions are defined for subsets of classes. This paper introduces the concept of \"compositional set embeddings\" that can perceive multiple objects in examples and represent them for set operations. Two models are presented for set union and set containment. The embeddings are evaluated on various datasets to show their effectiveness. The concept of \"compositional set embeddings\" is introduced in this paper, which can perceive multiple objects in examples and represent them for set operations. Two models are presented for set union and set containment, and the embeddings are evaluated on various datasets to demonstrate their effectiveness. Recent research has focused on combining word embeddings in deep NLP architectures to infer higher-level attributes like sentiment. This work builds on earlier studies exploring how neural networks can efficiently represent the grammatical structure and semantics of input sentences. In recent research, neural networks have been investigated for their ability to understand novel sentences with known words. Joshi et al. (2018) developed compositional pairwise embeddings in the NLP domain, while Lyu et al. (2019) focused on compositional network embeddings for predicting relationships between new nodes in a graph. Their approach differs from ours in terms of embedding spaces and capturing set relationships. The paper discusses encoding a set of objects with a neural network, focusing on ensuring invariance to the order of examples. Various approaches have been proposed, including permutation-invariant content-based attention and a probabilistic model for predicting set elements and cardinality. The goal is for the model to generalize to any number of classes within a set. The paper explores encoding sets of objects with neural networks, emphasizing invariance to example order. It addresses challenges for two tasks: perceiving multiple interacting objects simultaneously and defining geometrical structure for set union operations. The goal is for the model to generalize across various class sets. The paper discusses encoding sets of objects with neural networks, focusing on invariance to example order and generalizing across class sets. It outlines a procedure for one-shot learning on unseen classes by inferring label sets from reference examples and estimating the label of a new example based on embeddings. The paper discusses encoding sets of objects with neural networks, focusing on invariance to example order and generalizing across class sets. Although the number of possible subsets is exponential in |S|, for speaker diarization the number of overlapping speakers is typically small, making the iteration tractable. Functions f and g are trained jointly for each example x associated with classes T. A hinge loss is computed for comparison, with a small positive real number. A simulation using 1-D \"audio\" signals was conducted to explore the viability of Model I. The paper discusses encoding sets of objects with neural networks for speaker diarization. A convolutional neural network is used to identify speakers in audio waveforms after one-shot learning with a set of 250 speakers. The goal is to identify the speakers contributing to each audio waveform. Architecture includes functions f and g trained on test speakers not seen during training. The study used a convolutional neural network to identify speakers in audio waveforms through one-shot learning with a set of 250 speakers. The architecture included functions f and g trained on test speakers not seen during training. The evaluation of accuracy was done in various ways, including identifying the exact set of speakers and distinguishing the number of speakers in the set. The study utilized a convolutional neural network for speaker identification through one-shot learning with 250 speakers. The compositional embedding method showed significant accuracy improvement compared to the baseline, especially on singletons, 2-sets, and 3-sets. The approach also excelled in inferring the number of elements in the label set. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of compositional embedding in speaker identification through one-shot learning. The embedding space visualization showed clear clustering of markers for different label sets, with accurate estimation of the union of label sets. The study showed the effectiveness of compositional embedding in speaker identification through one-shot learning. The estimated clusters align closely with the actual clusters, although some inaccuracies exist. The method was also evaluated on the OmniGlot dataset, which contains handwritten characters from 50 alphabets. In the experiment, the model uses f and g to select classes that match the test examples' embeddings. The rendering function adds noise to images with multiple classes. The goal is to train f and g to infer the classes in unseen test examples. All embeddings were normalized.

The goal is to train f and g to infer the classes in unseen test examples. All embeddings were normalized. Architecture: For f, ResNet-18 was used. Training and testing processes were similar to Experiment 1. Baselines were compared, including Most frequent (MF) and Traditional f with simulated composite reference examples (SimRef). In the experiment, the model uses f and g to infer classes in unseen test examples by simulating composite reference examples. Different approaches are used, including traditional embedding and mean embedding methods. The experiment uses f and g to infer classes in unseen test examples by simulating composite reference examples. The proposed f & g method outperforms other baselines in accuracy, showing that f benefits from knowing how its embeddings are combined. The model struggles when deciding among all possible label sets, but optimizing g improves accuracy. After optimizing g, a simple symmetric linear function achieves the best performance. Adding more FC layers may lead to overfitting, suggesting the need for regularization or more training data. Extending compositional embedding from \"composition\" to \"containing\", a new mechanism using a query function h is introduced to test if one set of classes subsumes another. Unlike g, h is not symmetric and can be trained differently. Model II introduces a new mechanism using a query function h to determine if one set of classes subsumes another. Unlike the symmetric linear function g, h can be trained in an unsupervised manner and does not require knowledge of specific label sets. The model can be trained on one set of classes and applied to a different set, making it useful for zero-shot learning scenarios. Model II introduces a query function h for determining class subsumption, trained unsupervisedly. It can be applied to different class sets, useful for zero-shot learning. Training involves binary cross-entropy loss without needing individual labels. Tested in a one-shot learning setting with different training and testing classes. The proposed method compares with a traditional embedding method by training to separate examples based on association with a single class. It involves picking positive and negative examples for composite examples and computing a hinge loss to backpropagate through the model. The method uses a query function to determine class subsumption during testing. During testing, a query function is used to determine class subsumption by thresholding the distance between embeddings. Compositional embeddings outperformed the baseline, with deeper architectures showing an advantage. Model II was trained and evaluated on COCO, a challenging problem where objects need to be identified in different images. The study utilized bounding boxes to crop singleton objects from images for training. Positive queries involved pairs of images with singleton label sets. Comparisons were made with the TradEmb method and a ResNet classifier with multiple binary outputs. Results are presented in Table 1 (b). The proposed methods easily outperformed TradEmb and the ResNet baseline in estimating classes for each image. Deeper architectures for h performed better, and a new embedding mechanism was introduced to map objects into a space for inferring relationships between embedded vectors. Ground-truth rendering processes were not explicitly known and had to be learned implicitly. Experiments on simulated data, OmniGlot, and COCO showed imperfect accuracy. The experiments on simulated data, OmniGlot, and COCO showed imperfect accuracy but outperformed baselines. An embedding function trained jointly with composition or query functions could be optimized further by leveraging class co-occurrence. An alternative training procedure to encourage mapping of certain vectors yielded poor results.

An alternative training procedure to encourage mapping of certain vectors yielded poor results. The composition function g needs to map two vectors on a unit sphere back onto the same sphere to uniquely identify a set of classes. This construction is inspired by basic group theory, where each element of a permutation group can be represented as a rotation of Euclidean space. The composition function g is modeled after a permutation group of degree m = 2k, containing pairwise exchanges of coordinates. The group is commutative with 2k elements, ensuring the range of g contains 2|S| elements. Each member of the group is associated with a unique permutation matrix, and a vector e \u2205 is defined with distinct components. Singleton sets {s i } are associated with permutation matrices, and a neural network f is defined. The neural network f uses permutation matrices to detect classes in examples, while the function g computes the product of permutation matrices associated with embedded vectors. This enables perfect inference of the union of classes in any examples. The neural network f and function g enable perfect inference of class unions in examples. Each speaker is represented by a prototype waveform of sinusoids. Training dataset includes 250 simulated speakers with examples combined in subsets for training. In subsets of randomly selected examples, individual speakers, combinations of 2 speakers, and combinations of 3 speakers were included. Functions f and g were jointly trained for 4000 epochs using a learning rate of 0.002 and the Adam algorithm. At test time, one singleton example was chosen as the reference for one-shot learning. Test sets consisted of 3072 examples with 1-sets, 2-sets, and 3-sets of speakers. Image generation involved random affine transformations and Gaussian noise. Training was performed on 964 OmniGlot classes. Training is performed on 964 OmniGlot classes with augmented images. Each mini-batch includes 10000 examples from 5 classes. Adam is used for training with a learning rate of .0003. Testing accuracy is computed over 659 OmniGlot classes. The dataset, ResNet-18 model, and function h are the same as in Experiment 2. During training, each mini-batch contains 128 query pairs with positive and negative queries. Binary cross entropy loss and Adam optimizer are used for optimization. COCO's training set is utilized, with ResNet's last dimension modified to 80 for subclass classification. The output layer consists of 80 classifiers, each corresponding to a possible subclass. During evaluation, subclass labels are assumed known for query images. ResNet encodes images into n-bit strings for n classes, but may not be the most efficient representation due to unlikely co-occurrences. The proposed f & h embedding method utilizes co-occurrence structure for more accurate query responses. Other models require singleton images cropped according to COCO's bounding box labels. Padding is applied to all images. The images were padded with zeros to be square and downscaled to 128x128. The architecture used was the same as Experiment 3, with a 3-channel input layer. Training and testing involved balancing positive and negative queries. The performance decreased with more subclasses in the images."
