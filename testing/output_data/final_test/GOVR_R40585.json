    "content": "The report, originally published in May 2009, discusses EPA's potential regulation of stationary sources under the Clean Air Act. Since then, EPA has indicated its intentions through proposed regulations and guidance, including greenhouse gas emission standards for new motor vehicles. An \"endangerment finding\" was finalized in December 2009, paving the way for regulation of greenhouse gases for new and modified stationary sources. The EPA has proposed a Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule to limit permitting requirements for sources emitting more than 25,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalents. Legislation to address greenhouse gases is a priority for the President and Congress, with existing Clean Air Act authorities allowing for emission limitations. EPA is already working on regulations for new mobile sources in response to court decisions. The EPA is finalizing regulations for greenhouse gases from new mobile sources, which will trigger regulations for stationary sources as well. Stationary sources account for 72% of US greenhouse gas emissions, with large sources of fossil-fuel combustion being responsible for half of the total emissions. EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources. The EPA is finalizing regulations for greenhouse gases from new mobile sources, which will also apply to stationary sources. Stationary sources, responsible for 72% of US greenhouse gas emissions, include large fossil-fuel combustion sources. EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases from stationary sources, with a focus on reducing emissions from these sectors due to their timeliness and cost-effectiveness compared to the transport sector. The report discusses various statutory authorities and control options, including a potential EPA-coordinated cap-and-trade program, to address greenhouse gas emissions under existing Clean Air Act provisions. Administrative challenges, particularly related to the New Source Review \u2013 Prevention of Significant Deterioration, are also highlighted. The EPA has been considering a regulatory approach using existing Clean Air Act authorities for over a decade. In 1998, it was concluded that greenhouse gases could be regulated under the Act. A group of organizations petitioned the EPA in 1999 to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles under Section 202 of the Act. In 2003, EPA denied a petition to regulate CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. However, in a 2007 decision (Massachusetts v. EPA), the Supreme Court ruled that EPA does have the authority to regulate these emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA must decide if emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution endangering public health. The Bush Administration's EPA did not respond to the petition for two years after the Court's decision, issuing only an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2008. The EPA received objections from various officials regarding regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, stating that the Act is not suitable for reducing emissions. The ANPR was deemed of limited use in reaching a conclusion on the endangerment issue. The current Administration prioritized reviewing the endangerment issue of greenhouse gases. EPA proposed that GHGs endanger public health and welfare, with a 60-day public comment period. Legal initiatives are underway to control GHG emissions from stationary sources. In 2006, the EPA revised the NSPS for electric utilities without including a CO2 standard. Several states challenged this omission, leading to a remand by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2007. EPA Region 8 granted a PSD permit for a waste-coal-fired plant in Utah, which was contested by the Sierra Club citing CO2 monitoring requirements established in Massachusetts v. EPA. The EPA imposed CO2 monitoring and reporting requirements, leading to the installation of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for CO2 emissions at the Bonanza plant. The EAB remanded permits for reconsideration of CO2 BACT requirements in various cases, including one for a new cogeneration boiler at Northern Michigan University and another for the Desert Rock coal-fired power plant in New Mexico. EPA Region 9 filed a motion for a voluntary remand to include a CO2 limitation in the Desert Rock permit. Desert Rock is set to install \"carbon-ready\" technology instead of current coal technology. The Environmental Integrity Project filed a complaint with the D.C. Circuit Court regarding nitrous oxide emissions from nitric acid plants. EPA Administrator Jackson prefers Congress to address climate issues through legislation. President Obama and Administrator are committed to an endangerment finding. The Clean Air Act provides three paths to regulate GHGs from stationary sources: as criteria air pollutants, hazardous air pollutants, or designated air pollutants. Two lesser explored trails are Section 115 and Title VI. The Act's backbone is the creation of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health. The Clean Air Act establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) to protect public health by setting levels for air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare. The Act mandates the EPA to identify and set primary and secondary NAAQS to safeguard public health and welfare from adverse effects of air pollutants in ambient air. The EPA has identified six criteria pollutants for NAAQS regulation: sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead. These pollutants impact public welfare by affecting crops, wildlife, water, property, and personal well-being. If greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide were added as criteria pollutants, new NAAQS would need to be set. Setting a NAAQS for CO2, a greenhouse gas, poses challenges in determining the appropriate concentration level that endangers public health or welfare. The focus has been on setting primary standards based on concentration-response studies and epidemiology. Setting a NAAQS for CO2, a greenhouse gas, poses challenges in determining the appropriate concentration level that endangers public health or welfare. Studies show a correlation between higher CO2 exposure and health risks, although direct linkages are not as clear as with other pollutants. The indirect argument is that higher CO2 levels may lead to increased temperatures, which could have health consequences over time. Setting a NAAQS for CO2 is challenging due to the unclear correlation between CO2 exposure and health risks. Scientists suggest different concentration levels, with current levels at 385 ppm. Action is only required if ambient concentrations exceed the standard. The importance of distinguishing primary from secondary standards in setting a NAAQS for CO2 or other GHGs is highlighted. The setting of secondary NAAQS is crucial to prevent damage to various aspects such as crops, wildlife, and economic values. However, EPA has often overlooked the setting of secondary NAAQS, with most being set at the same level as primary standards. Establishing a NAAQS for GHGs may not be worthwhile without a defensible case for it. Establishing a NAAQS for GHGs may not be worth the effort unless a defensible case for a specific primary standard below ambient levels can be made. Failure to attain primary NAAQS in a timely manner has consequences. If a CO2 or GHG NAAQS is set by EPA, nonattainment areas must be identified. The procedure for this is specified under Section 107 of the Act, with distinct local and regional concentrations of pollutants generally linked to stationary or mobile sources. Variations in concentrations exist, with some sources emitting pollutants hundreds of miles away. The NAAQS for GHGs may not be suitable due to the homogeneous concentrations of CO2 across the country. Designating nonattainment areas for GHGs would require the entire United States to be included. The State Implementation Plan (SIP) provisions may not be effective for GHG regulation as they focus on reducing emissions in nonattainment areas. State Implementation Plans (SIPs) are designed for local pollution sources, but may not be effective for greenhouse gases due to their uniform distribution across the country. Tailoring SIPs to each nonattainment area may not have a measurable impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. EPA Section 126 allows downwind states to petition for controls on upwind sources if significant emissions cross state lines. The Center for Biological Diversity and 350.org petitioned the EPA to designate carbon dioxide and six other greenhouse gases as criteria air pollutants with pollution caps, despite the challenges of individual states or nonattainment areas making significant progress towards reducing emissions. The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments designate six greenhouse gases as criteria pollutants with pollution caps based on science. Section 112 includes provisions for Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) requirements for major sources, health-based standards for residual risks, standards for area sources, and prevention of catastrophic releases. MACT and area source provisions would be relevant for controlling greenhouse gases under this section. EPA is required to set standards for emissions reduction considering cost and other factors. The MACT standards for new and existing sources of hazardous air pollution must be stringent, with existing sources given three years to comply. Additionally, EPA must establish standards for area sources, such as gas stations or dry cleaners, that collectively emit significant quantities of hazardous air pollutants. EPA can impose less stringent control technologies for area sources emitting hazardous air pollutants. The Bush Administration suggested that greenhouse gases could be listed as hazardous air pollutants under Section 112, but EPA was more cautious in its analysis. The language of Section 112 of the Act raises questions about whether greenhouse gases (GHGs) could be considered hazardous air pollutants. Congress intended the section to regulate air toxics, which are pollutants listed under subsection 112(b). EPA has been cautious in analyzing whether GHGs fall within this scope. Congress established criteria and procedures for revising the list of hazardous air pollutants in Section 112(b)(2), but EPA has not added any substances in the 18 years since. The Administrator can add pollutants that pose a threat to human health or the environment, including substances known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic, neurotoxic, or toxic. The section under consideration in Section 112 is not well-suited for regulating common greenhouse gases like CO2, which are emitted in large quantities. It may be more useful for regulating small volume chemicals with potent greenhouse effects, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which has a global warming potential much higher than CO2. SF6 accounted for a small percentage of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2007. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions in 2007 were 16.5 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent, but actual emissions were only 690 metric tons. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) could be considered for regulation due to its low emissions and high global warming potential. Section 112 sets a threshold for major sources of emissions, with a presumption in favor of regulation for designated pollutants. The EPA focuses on determining that emissions of certain substances will not cause adverse effects on human health or the environment. \"Designated pollutants\" refer to air pollutants not classified as criteria air pollutants or toxic air pollutants, regulated under Section 111 with New Source Performance Standards imposed on major new stationary sources. The EPA imposes New Source Performance Standards on major new stationary sources of air pollution, regardless of location or ambient air conditions. The standards aim to address sources that contribute significantly to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare. The Administrator has the flexibility to differentiate standards based on classes, types, and sizes within categories of new sources. The EPA has the authority to enforce New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) on major stationary sources of air pollution. Section 111 provides flexibility for regulating greenhouse gas emissions, including source categories, size, gases regulated, and timing of regulations. This allows for consideration of costs and secondary effects like health and environmental impacts. Section 111 of the regulations provides flexibility in regulating greenhouse gas emissions, allowing consideration of costs, secondary effects, and technology advancements. This flexibility includes determining control systems that have been \"adequately demonstrated\" and prioritizing performance standards based on factors like size and costs. Section 115 of the regulations allows EPA to address global climate change issues by invoking international triggers based on reports from international agencies indicating air pollutants from the US may endanger public health in foreign countries. Unlike other sections, Section 115 focuses on international effects. The EPA can address global climate change issues under Section 115 by using international triggers based on reports from recognized international sources like the IPCC. The Secretary of State can request EPA action based on pollution that endangers public health in foreign countries, without the need for an EPA endangerment finding. The EPA can address global climate change issues under Section 115 based on reports from international sources like the IPCC. The Secretary of State can request EPA action for pollution endangering public health in foreign countries. EPA must act on allegations by the Secretary of State, implemented through SIP revisions. Section 115 could be used without promulgating NAAQS for greenhouse gases. Martella and Paulson argue for using Section 115 to address climate change. Martella and Paulson oppose EPA's assertion that a greenhouse gas NAAQS is necessary to invoke Section 115 for addressing climate change. They argue that Section 115 is not limited to criteria pollutants and can apply to any air pollution. The Clean Air Act allows for SIP revisions to comply with additional requirements, including those under Section 115. Section 115 applies to foreign countries that reciprocate rights with the US on air pollution prevention or control. EPA notes that reciprocity with affected countries may trigger Section 115, allowing countries to argue for U.S. action based on hindrance to their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, endangerment from climate change, or low emissions levels. Section 115 provides flexibility for EPA in designing programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, allowing for model thresholds and source categories to be set by EPA. States can choose the most appropriate solution for their mix of greenhouse gas sources, and EPA could develop a holistic model plan to be implemented by the states. This mechanism also limits the scope of the program. Section 115 provides flexibility for EPA in designing programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, allowing for model thresholds and source categories to be set by EPA. States can choose the most appropriate solution for their mix of greenhouse gas sources. Martella and Paulson argue that invoking Section 115 should not trigger PSD-NSR or Title V permitting requirements. Section 115 has never been implemented, and many countries prefer a negotiated settlement on climate change. Title VI, added to the Clean Air Act in 1990, addresses ozone depletion by human-made substances. Title VI of the Clean Air Act, added in 1990, aims to address ozone depletion caused by human-made substances. Some of these substances also contribute to climate change, like CFCs and HCFCs. Substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals, such as HFC-134a and PFCs, can themselves be greenhouse gases. The production of substitutes like HCFC-22 can also result in the release of greenhouse gases like HFC-23. Research continues on the relationship between the stratosphere, ozone layer, and climate change. Section 612 allows the EPA to identify substitutes for ozone-depleting substances that are also greenhouse gases. Section 612 of the Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to identify substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals that reduce risks to human health and the environment. The resulting program, Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP), aims to replace harmful substances with less harmful alternatives. Section 615 provides a mechanism to control greenhouse gas emissions with an endangerment finding requirement and broad discretionary authority for the EPA to respond. Section 615 of the Clean Air Act grants the EPA broad discretionary authority to regulate substances that may affect the stratosphere and endanger public health. This includes greenhouse gases, with a two-part judgment required by the EPA to determine their impact on the ozone layer and public welfare. EPA's ANPR did not assess this aspect. In its ANPR, EPA acknowledged the broad authority granted by Section 615 of the Clean Air Act to regulate substances affecting the stratosphere. The agency highlighted the potential for establishing a cap-and-trade program depending on findings, but took a narrow view on greenhouse gas performance standards, focusing on incremental improvements for existing sources. The EPA is considering regulations that anticipate future technology for new electric generating sources, such as requiring \"carbon-ready\" technology for new construction to prepare for carbon capture technology in the future. Integrated-gasification, combined-cycle (IGCC) technology is being discussed, particularly in relation to the Desert Rock PSD-NSR permit reconsideration. The EPA is considering regulations for new electric generating sources, focusing on \"carbon-ready\" technology like IGCC for future carbon capture. EPA believes section 111 can set performance standards based on current technology and more stringent limits in the future. The technical support document does not mention fuel-neutral or technology-based standards for carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants. The EPA could set a fuel-neutral standard for carbon dioxide emissions from newly-constructed powerplants, similar to existing regulations for NOx emissions. This standard would encourage the use of lower-carbon technologies like natural gas, and could also apply to modified existing sources to promote a transition to cleaner energy sources. The EPA could set a fuel-neutral standard for carbon dioxide emissions from newly-constructed powerplants, encouraging lower-carbon technologies like natural gas. This standard would also apply to modified sources, requiring emissions reductions for coal-fired facilities through carbon control technology like CCS. EPA's use of NSPS has promoted pollution control equipment installation even during technology debates. The EPA's new source performance standards have pushed electric utilities to adopt complex scrubbing systems for emissions control. Mandating carbon capture technology on stationary sources is seen as the most direct way to encourage its adoption. The Clean Air Act mandates performance standards on stationary sources, illustrated by the 1971 and 1978 SO2 NSPS for coal-fired powerplants. EPA determined a 1.2 pound of SO2 per million Btu of heat input standard in 1971, requiring a 70% reduction in emissions from new powerplants. Low-sulfur coal was identified as a solution available in both eastern and western regions. The 1971 Utility SO2 NSPS mandated a 70% reduction in emissions from new powerplants, which could be achieved with low-sulfur coal or emerging FGD devices. The market for FGD units rapidly expanded due to various regulations, with a focus on retrofits rather than new installations. Taylor estimates that between 1973 and 1976, 72% of the FGD market was in retrofits. By 1977, 14 vendors offered full-scale commercial FGD installation. Despite growth, only 10% of new coal-fired facilities built between 1973 and 1976 had FGD. Early FGD performance was not great. AEP led a campaign against FGD in 1974, but Congress modified NSPS requirements in 1977 for a 70%-90% reduction in emissions. The \"scrubber requirement\" mandated a 70%-90% reduction in emissions, achievable through FGD devices. Government policies and regulations played a crucial role in stimulating invention and technology development in the FGD market. The early years of FGD development involved technology-forcing regulations that pushed for the installation of new technology in utility plants. The development of this equipment faced challenges, but ultimately proved effective in pulling technology into the market. Carbon capture technology requires a new infrastructure for widespread development. For long-term development of carbon capture technology, new infrastructure like pipelines and storage sites may be needed. In the short-term, alternatives such as enhanced oil recovery and in-situ geologic storage can support early projects. Using new construction to introduce carbon capture technology could be a path to widespread commercialization. Regulatory approaches like NSPS may be a first step, while the possibility of setting up a cap-and-trade program under the Clean Air Act is debated. The debate surrounding Section 111(d) in the Clean Air Act includes the potential for an EPA-coordinated cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions. EPA considers cost savings as a factor in developing performance standards, which could lead to deeper reductions through a trading program across different greenhouse gases and source categories. The debate over Section 111(d) in the Clean Air Act involves the authority for an EPA-coordinated cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions. A lead author argues against this authority, stating that section 111 does not allow for such a program. The section provides a contingency plan if performance standards are not feasible, giving EPA the authority to establish standards based on the best available emissions reduction technology. The debate over Section 111(d) in the Clean Air Act involves the authority for an EPA-coordinated cap-and-trade program for CO2 emissions. Congress assumed pollutants would be emitted through a conveyance designed to capture them, which conflicts with a trading program. EPA used Sec. 111(d) to justify a rule to reduce mercury emissions from power plants, but the court decision did not repudiate this reasoning. Other sections of the Act might also be considered for establishing an economy-wide program. Section 110, 115, and 615 of the Clean Air Act could potentially be used to establish an economy-wide cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gas emissions. Section 110 outlines requirements for State Implementation Plans, including enforceable emission limitations and economic incentives like fees and auctions of emissions rights. These sections provide a basis for broader GHG regulatory tools once emission standards are issued under any section of the Act. Section 110 of the Clean Air Act may not be an authority for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases, as it requires an applicable requirement under the Act. While economic incentives and marketable permits are mentioned, it is unclear if they can be used for economy-wide control measures. EPA has previously incorporated market-oriented emissions trading elements into traditional performance standards for mobile and stationary sources. Performance standards for mobile sources under Title II have been coupled with averaging, banking, and trading provisions, allowing covered parties to meet emissions obligations on a fleet- or unit-wide basis. Banking provides incentives for additional reductions by giving credit for overcompliance, which can be used towards future compliance obligations, promoting technology innovation within the sector. The cap-and-trade program could potentially be established under Section 115, with states creating their own programs to comply with EPA-determined emission caps. EPA cannot impose a cap-and-trade system on states; they would need to voluntarily agree to participate in an EPA-coordinated scheme. If Section 615 is triggered by science, EPA could establish a cap-and-trade program for regulated pollutants emitted by new facilities. Preconstruction review and permitting are required for facilities emitting over 250 tons of regulated pollutants, except for hazardous air pollutants and renewable fuels. New sources under PSD-NSR provisions must also undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology. State permitting agencies determine BACT on a case-by-case basis, considering energy, environmental, and economic impacts. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS but can be more so. More stringent controls may be required if modeling shows BACT is insufficient to avoid violating PSD emission limits or NAAQS. PSD-NSR is needed for any pollutant \"subject to regulation\" under the Clean Air Act, with varying interpretations of this phrase. Some argue CO2 is already regulated due to monitoring requirements, while others believe an endangerment finding would trigger PSD-NSR for GHGs. The EPA's interpretation of the law regarding greenhouse gas emissions and PSD-NSR requirements is under review by the new Administration. The New Source Review provision presents challenges in controlling greenhouse gases due to specified triggering thresholds. The PSD-NSR has specified thresholds for major emitting facilities, with greenhouse gases having a low threshold compared to other bills. BACT determination is required on a case-by-case basis, potentially leading to a significant increase in state determinations and permit activity. Including greenhouse gases in the PSD program may lead to a significant increase in permits issued, stretching the resources of EPA and state permitting authorities. While BACT determinations are typically made on a case-by-case basis, exceptions can be made to streamline the process and ensure the agency can fulfill its mission. The development of \"presumptive BACT\" determinations may streamline the permitting process, especially for small sources not covered under Section 111 regulations. EPA has proposed a Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule to address the threshold problem, setting limits for new source permitting and major modifications under the PSD-NSR program. The EPA discussed the potential increase in annual emissions due to regulations on greenhouse gases (GHGs) triggering Title V permit requirements for facilities emitting 100 tons per year or more of GHG pollutants. This could lead to over 550,000 additional sources requiring Title V permits, a significant increase from the current 15,000-16,000 sources. Title V sources could see a tenfold increase, with newly subject sources including large residential and commercial buildings. EPA estimates over 6 million sources could be subject to Title V if the emission threshold remains at 100 tons per year. Small sources of greenhouse gases may need permits to operate under Title V, with covered entities required to pay fees to cover permit program costs. Increased permitting activity has led to speculation on the extent of its impact. Some agricultural interests have raised concerns about the possibility of a \"cow tax\" under Title V for emissions from agricultural activities. EPA has no current plans to regulate GHG emissions from agriculture, but the issue of size has been acknowledged. EPA and others are considering alternatives to reduce the extent and cost of these provisions. EPA is exploring alternatives to reduce the extent and cost of permitting requirements for small sources, including legal interpretations and the use of general permits. The agency may avoid imposing certain requirements on small sources through administrative necessity or by interpreting statutory provisions differently in rare cases. EPA proposed a Title V and PSD-NSR permitting threshold of 25,000 tons per year of CO2-equivalents on September 30, 2009 to avoid overwhelming state permitting authorities with a large number of permit applications due to upcoming regulations to control GHG emissions. This proposed rule would phase in the applicability thresholds for both the PSD and title V programs for sources of GHG emissions. The EPA proposed new permitting thresholds for GHG emissions in the Title V and PSD programs. The proposal aims to avoid overwhelming state permitting authorities with a large number of permit applications. A study will be conducted within five years to assess the authorities' ability to administer the programs, with a potential revision of thresholds or streamlining techniques. EPA will likely focus on large sources first, such as coal-fired power plants, which account for a significant portion of the country's GHG emissions. The EPA proposed new permitting thresholds for GHG emissions in the Title V and PSD programs to avoid overwhelming state permitting authorities. The estimated 670 coal-fired electric power plants emit a significant portion of the country's GHG emissions. Farms emit less than 4% of total GHGs, while methane from landfills and livestock operations contribute around 1.8% and 2.4% of GHG emissions, respectively. The Institute for Policy Integrity suggests prioritizing larger sources first and gradually including smaller sources in the NSR permit applicability. EPA has the discretion to determine its own resources and capability for implementing these changes. The EPA can reduce administrative burden by defining \"potential to emit\" based on actual emissions, implementing a general permit scheme for PSD-NSR and Title V, and issuing general permits for categories with numerous similar emission sources. The EPA can issue a \"general permit\" for all sources in a category, reducing administrative burden by allowing public input on the general permit instead of individual permits. General permits are commonly used for air and water pollution control, and would require monitoring and reporting for compliance. A general permit application can be simple with low fees, typically ranging from $100 to $350 per permittee. EPA and the Institute for Policy Integrity argue for general permits for small sources under PSD-NSR to avoid issues. If an endangerment finding triggers emissions standards under the CAA, Citizen Suits under Section 304 could be initiated. Section 304 of the Clean Air Act allows for civil actions against individuals or government entities for violating emissions standards. It also permits suits against the EPA for failing to perform required duties. Citizen suits have been used to enforce regulations on emitting facilities. The Clean Air Act allows for civil actions against violators of emissions standards, including suits against the EPA for not enforcing regulations on emitting facilities. The debate on regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Act is not new, as past challenges like acid rain were also addressed through existing provisions. The Clean Air Act requires a demonstration of cause-effect relationship for SO2 reductions, which may be expensive and controversial. Program administrators will not act aggressively without Congressional mandate or new evidence. Congress added new Titles to the Act to address acid rain and ozone depletion, introducing a market-based approach for reducing pollutants. In the case of Title IV, a market-based approach was introduced to reduce pollutants, leading to successful results. This approach has been used to address interstate transport of smog and control greenhouse gases, although the latter is a more complex issue. Not all sources may respond well to a market-based approach due to various factors like price sensitivity and size. Initiatives to use the Clean Air Act as a substitute or complement to a market-based system for regulating greenhouse gases were discussed in a 2008 testimony. The Act's provisions offer advantages such as immediate deployment, familiarity to the EPA, regulation of diverse sources, and inherent fairness. Using existing Clean Air Act provisions to address climate change has advantages such as immediate deployment, familiarity to the EPA, and regulation of diverse sources. However, there are disadvantages like the lack of statutory deadlines and unclear authority for cap-and-trade schemes. The NAAQS program is not ideal for regulating globally harmful pollutants, and the ultimate decision on greenhouse gas policy rests with Congress. EPA's endangerment finding provides many options, but Congress has the final say on the approach. The ultimate decision on greenhouse gas policy rests with Congress, which can override EPA's decisions or enact new statutory authorities as seen with acid rain and stratospheric ozone depletion."
