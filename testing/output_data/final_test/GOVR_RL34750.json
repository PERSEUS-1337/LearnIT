    "content": "The federal government has increased focus on protecting the US against terrorist nuclear or radiological attacks since 9/11. This includes expanding programs, developing new equipment, and deploying radiation detection equipment. The Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) program is a new technology proposed to enhance radiation detection effectiveness. This report outlines the ASP program's history and issues for Congress as it progresses. The ASP program, led by the Department of Homeland Security, aims to replace current radiation detection portals at U.S. borders. These portals detect radiation emissions from passing objects. Current procedures involve primary screening at the portals, with secondary screening if radiation is detected. Additional equipment can be used to identify the radiation source. The ASP program aims to replace current radiation detection portals at U.S. borders with a more efficient system that can both detect radiation and identify its source. This could enhance security by preventing nuclear threats from entering the country and reduce costs associated with false alarms from harmless sources like cat litter or ceramic tiles. The program was initiated in 2004 by the DHS Directorate of Science and Technology and continued by DNDO in 2005. In 2005, responsibility for the ASP program was transferred to DNDO, and advanced technology prototypes were tested at the Nevada Test Site. In March 2006, the GAO expressed concerns about the detection capabilities of the prototypes, recommending a cost-benefit analysis for deployment. In May 2006, DNDO reported a cost-benefit analysis supporting ASP procurement and awarded contracts to three companies in July 2006. In July 2006, contracts were awarded to Raytheon Company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Canberra Industries for ASP system development. The DHS planned to deploy 80 systems quickly and a total of about 1,400 at entry points. GAO reported concerns about the cost and performance of the ASPs in October 2006. In 2007, DHS engaged in further testing of ASP systems to achieve a significant increase in operational effectiveness as required by the Act, but the GAO criticized the tests for methodological flaws. In September 2008, GAO issued a critical report on DNDO's ASP testing, stating that the testing provided little information on the actual performance capabilities of the ASPs. The resulting test report was deemed inadequate for determining if ASPs were an improvement over current equipment. DHS convened an Independent Review Team to address these criticisms and determine their validity, which found no bias in the test results but noted that some aspects of the testing process were not ideal. The Independent Review Team found that the testing process for the ASP system was not ideal and that the test results were not properly linked to operational outcomes. DNDO conducted additional testing in response to this feedback, including computer simulations using synthesized signals to test the system's ability to detect threat objects. The DNDO conducted injection studies to test the system's ability to detect threat objects amidst other materials. Congress prohibited funds for ASP procurement until a certification of increased operational effectiveness was issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security, who was also directed to consult with the National Academy of Sciences before issuing the certification. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329) required secretarial certification before FY2009 funds could be used for full-scale ASP procurement. The National Academies identified shortcomings in the ASP test campaigns, including limited test object configurations. The report recommended expanding computer modeling for ASP performance, using different metrics to assess radiation portal monitors and ASP systems, and providing guidance for cost-benefit assessment. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 expanded the prohibition on funds for full-scale ASP procurement. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 expanded the prohibition on funds for full-scale ASP procurement until a \"significant increase in operational effectiveness\" is certified by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The act also directed DNDO to implement NAS recommendations for incorporating computer modeling in testing, using low-rate initial production ASPs for inspection, and conducting a more rigorous cost-benefit analysis. In 2009, the GAO reviewed the recent test campaign and noted improvements in test rigor. Preliminary results were mixed, with sensitivity differences between ASP and existing systems depending on shielding. The GAO recommended continued testing against modified existing systems and completion of injection studies before certification. DNDO is conducting additional testing for a certification decision expected in late FY2011. Officials will move forward with certification when sufficient test results support it, without waiting for other efforts to complete. The DNDO has asserted that existing test results are sufficient for ASPs to demonstrate operational effectiveness. The DHS is working on logistics for operational testing before deciding on deploying ASP systems acquired through LRIP. An ASP Governance Board has been established to oversee future ASP system use if secretarial certification occurs. The Board recommends that the ASP program no longer be considered for use based on performance and cost estimates. The ASP program is recommended for use only in a secondary screening capacity, pending certification of a \"significant increase in operational effectiveness\" by the Secretary of Homeland Security. DNDO may use previously appropriated funds for ASP procurement if certification is achieved. Plans for ASP deployment may change based on current DNDO strategies. The DNDO's ASP program does not require additional funds for procurement, with no new funding requested for FY2010 and FY2011. Congress has expressed concerns and support for the program, facing policy issues on effectiveness, costs, and criteria for deployment. Funding for DHS in FY2011 remains at FY2010 levels until March 4, 2011. The DNDO's ASP program aims for a significant increase in operational effectiveness through integrating radiation detection and source identification into a single step. Congress is questioning whether ASPs would outperform existing systems and if the investment is worthwhile. Ongoing testing by DNDO and scrutiny from GAO and others have led Congress to direct DHS to have the National Academies review the ASP test campaigns. The National Academies issued an interim report in 2009 with recommendations for DHS on evaluating ASP performance. Recommendations included an iterative approach with modeling and physical testing, incremental deployment with continuous improvement, and not proceeding with further procurement until addressing findings and recommendations. The ASP program, favored in a cost-benefit analysis, has incorporated NAS recommendations for computer modeling and testing. DNDO is implementing recommendations to use ASPs for inspection at various sites and complete a more rigorous cost-benefit analysis. DNDO believes the ASP program has followed the spirit of NAS recommendations on testing and evaluation. The government has implemented recommendations for the ASP program, including using tools for analysis and injection. The performance of ASP systems in tests has matched predictions well, but threshold settings for real-world cargo still need empirical evidence. DNDO agrees with NAS recommendations on procurement and cost-benefit analysis, planning to incorporate them into deployments. Congress should assess DNDO's response to NAS recommendations and DHS's plans for ASP. Some critics doubt the effectiveness of ASPs in detecting nuclear material, stating that it can be shielded or smuggled in undetected. DNDO conducted a cost-benefit analysis in 2006, which DHS used to justify the value of improved detection systems. The DHS performed a cost-benefit analysis on the ASP program, concluding that the reduced impact on commerce outweighed the costs. However, the GAO disagreed, stating that the analysis lacked a sound basis. Additional analyses will be used for the Secretary's certification decision, focusing on economic costs and benefits. The National Academies suggest that the costs of the ASP program may outweigh economic benefits, with factors like risk reduction from nuclear terrorism playing a significant role. The cost of procuring and deploying ASP systems has changed since the program's inception, with the cost increasing from $1.2 billion to approximately $3.1 billion for full deployment or $2.1 billion for reduced deployment as of 2008. The number and purpose of the systems may change based on ongoing testing, and the Secretary's decision in 2010 to only consider ASP deployment for secondary screening may reduce the program's projected cost. The DNDO's 2006 cost-benefit analysis for ASP deployment focused on reducing nuisance alarms by identifying radiation sources accurately. This would decrease the need for further screening of conveyances, minimizing the impact on commerce. However, with the Secretary's decision to exclude ASP deployment in primary screening, this justification no longer applies. DNDO's cost-benefit analyses did not quantify the security benefit of enhancing radiation screening effectiveness. The security benefit of improving radiation screening effectiveness lies in the avoided cost of a nuclear or radiological attack in the United States. Calculating this benefit is challenging due to uncertainties in potential attack consequences and the difficulty of quantifying incremental detection improvements. The National Academies recommended alternative analytical approaches such as Capability-based planning, game theory, cost-effectiveness analysis, and break-even analysis to assess the benefits of improving radiation screening effectiveness in reducing the risk of a nuclear detonation in the United States. These approaches aim to provide structured assessments and insights into the cost-effectiveness and benefits gained per dollar spent. The Office of Management and Budget emphasizes the importance of considering non-quantified benefits and costs in regulatory cost-benefit analysis. Professional judgment should be used to determine their significance, and threshold analysis can help evaluate their importance. The National Academies recommended that DNDO consider non-quantified effects in addition to threshold analysis for regulatory cost-benefit analysis. They advised DNDO to clearly define ASP program objectives within the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture framework. The DNDO plans to present a finalized cost-benefit analysis to the DHS Acquisition Review Board (ARB) once the ASP has completed testing and evaluation. The ARB will consider this analysis and make a recommendation to the Secretary on certifying an increase in operational effectiveness. The increased cost of the ASP program has raised uncertainty about total costs and benefits. Congress is interested in the program's scope, total cost, deployment plans, benefits, and how it enhances homeland security. They are also concerned about the potential reduction in successful attacks with ASP system deployment. The potential deployment of ASP systems aims to reduce successful attacks, balancing economic factors. Computational modeling is used to assess ASP performance against threats. Injection studies are suggested to address concerns, with a preference for actual testing. The National Academies recommend comprehensive modeling and physical testing for ASP systems. The ASP system uses sodium iodide crystals for radiation detection, unlike radiation portal monitors that use polyvinyl toluene. The GAO is assessing the life cycle cost of the ASP program, which will depend on the number of deployed systems. DNDO has not yet developed a comprehensive model of the ASP system for simulated testing as recommended by the National Academies. The GAO estimated the life cycle cost of PVT standard cargo portal at $308,000 compared to $822,000 for the ASP standard cargo version. DHS estimates PVT radiation portal monitors cost $12,000 per year, while ASP maintenance costs range from $65,000 to $100,000 per year. The ASP system costs are higher but may offer greater benefits, efficiencies, or effectiveness. The DHS established a definition of \"significant increase in operational effectiveness\" based on criteria in a memorandum. Congress may want to review if the criteria align with the certification requirement's intent, as no clear definition was provided in the appropriations acts. The DHS agencies, including DNDO and CBP, jointly established certification criteria defining a \"significant increase in operational effectiveness.\" The unclassified memorandum, less than two pages long, documents an internal decision-making process within DHS. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to alter, overturn, or uphold the criteria, potentially establishing a new set of criteria for judging operational effectiveness of ASPs. The memorandum maintains existing certification criteria developed jointly by CBP and DNDO, representing user and developer needs. Some criteria lack specified minimum improvements, criticized by GAO for setting a low bar for performance enhancements. The criteria for equipment upgrades lack specified minimum improvements, criticized for setting a low bar for performance enhancements. DNDO states that for some threat types, current systems are already expected to detect correctly 100% of the time, making further improvement impossible. The criteria do not define under what test conditions or with which test data they are to be verified. The DNDO criteria for equipment upgrades lack specified minimum improvements and do not define test conditions or data for verification. DNDO officials have mentioned how certain criteria will be assessed, such as using field validation tests for assessing screening time and specific test campaigns for assessing detection abilities. The GAO believes injection studies should be completed before certification decisions. The National Academies recommend extensive modeling for ASP system performance evaluation, focusing on detection and false alarm rates. However, criteria do not address reliability, ease of use, and cost, leading to concerns about the balance of the criteria. Experts suggest criteria should prioritize increasing the likelihood of detecting threats. The criteria for ASP system performance evaluation should prioritize increasing the likelihood of detecting genuine threats over reducing false alarms. The criteria focus on radiation detection and source identification, but do not consider potential changes in operational procedures that could enhance system performance in the field. The criteria for ASP system performance evaluation prioritize detecting genuine threats over reducing false alarms. They compare ASP performance against current systems but not against different operational detection thresholds. DNDO has recommended comparing ASPs against systems with \"energy windowing\" software. DHS does not require this comparison in certification criteria. DNDO plans to deploy next-gen handheld detectors, but it's unclear if they will compare ASP performance with existing handheld detectors. DNDO will compare ASP performance with existing handheld detectors or new next-generation detectors. The date for secretarial certification has been postponed multiple times, with the current reported date set for FY2011. The decision for full-scale production of the ASP system is now separate from secretarial certification. The Secretary of Homeland Security will make the certification decision based on available test results and information. The Secretary may decide to fully deploy ASP systems using remaining funds from prior-year appropriations. Approximately $78 million remained unobligated from FY2007-FY2009 funds for ASP system acquisition in June 2009. DNDO did not request additional funds for ASP systems acquisition in FY2010 or FY2011. The Secretary may consider the costs of ASP systems compared to other detection improvements. The DHS may invest in additional secondary inspection systems instead of ASP systems to achieve similar reductions in screening time. Cost-benefit analyses will inform the Secretary's decision, which may lead to a limited deployment of ASP systems at high-throughput locations. This decision could reduce the overall program cost. DNDO prefers large-scale procurement of ASP systems for uniformity and cost efficiency. Congress may inquire about deployment strategies, replacement timelines for existing systems, and the expected lifespan of ASP systems. DHS may consider investing in secondary inspection systems as an alternative to ASP systems to reduce screening time and overall program costs. The federal government is facing a shortage of helium-3, a key component of the ASP system used to detect special nuclear material. This shortage raises concerns about the viability of the neutron detection system in the ASP system, which was designed to be more sensitive than current radiation portal monitors. The DNDO expects the ASP system to be adjusted to have equivalent sensitivity and helium-3 demand as the current systems. The DNDO plans to replace existing radiation portal monitors with ASP systems to address the helium-3 shortage. If sufficient helium-3 is not available, a shortfall in radiation portal monitor deployment may occur, leading to prioritization of deploying monitors or replacing them with ASP systems. The DHS and DOE are testing neutron detection systems using other materials, but a system may not be available for deployment for several years. DNDO plans to reduce helium-3 in ASP systems, which could complicate testing. Previous test data with more helium-3 may be used to evaluate operational effectiveness, raising questions about the validity of relying on older results. Helium-3 is only used for neutron detection, not gamma radiation analysis. Congress has options for addressing the ASP program, including awaiting further departmental action, providing legislative guidance to DHS, increasing oversight, reviewing decisions, assessing funding needs, and changing the program's direction. Congressional oversight can continue while awaiting further action by DNDO to develop necessary data for certification or to determine if the ASP system should not be further developed. A key question for Congress is whether DHS's definition of \"significant increase in operational effectiveness\" aligns with congressional intent. Congress may support DNDO's ASP procurement based on this definition or may choose to define the phrase themselves to ensure alignment with their intent. This decision could involve specifying criteria for determining operational effectiveness, such as simulations and modeling assessments. Congress may direct DHS to make a determination on the \"significant increase in operational effectiveness\" by a specified date instead of conducting more tests and development. Oversight activities by congressional committees have scrutinized DHS's ASP program, focusing on testing, certification, and procurement processes to ensure alignment with congressional intent. To ensure the validity of DHS's decision to certify and procure the ASP system, Congress could direct DNDO to provide documentary support for programmatic decisions for review by GAO or the National Academies. This may lead to delays in deploying ASP systems. If secretarial certification is granted, Congress could review the decision to ensure it aligns with legislative intent and impose additional restrictions or requirements on the ASP program, such as limiting procurement rates or reevaluating decision-making processes. Congress may need to assess funding for ASP systems, potentially requiring additional appropriations depending on deployment rates. They could allow the use of prior-year funds and provide further funding as needed, or rescind unobligated funding. Congress might also consider changing the program's direction if secretarial certification is delayed, directing DNDO to adjust ASP technology expectations or invest more funds accordingly. Policymakers could direct DNDO to invest more funds into developing alternate technologies beyond ASP systems or to cease ASP system development efforts. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 prohibits full-scale ASP procurement until a significant increase in operational effectiveness is certified by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary must consult with the National Academies before certifying ASP program deployment. The conference report emphasized following NAS recommendations for development and certification, conducting independent cost-benefit analysis, and deploying low rate initial production ASP systems for data collection. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee reports on FY2010 appropriations included limitations on funds for ASP system procurement. The House report required DHS to submit a reprogramming proposal if secretarial certification was delayed, urged decision-making based on test information and cost-benefit analysis, and allowed deployment of existing ASP systems for data collection. The Senate report directed DNDO to implement National Academies recommendations before certification or procurement decisions. The Senate report recommended incorporating computer modeling, using available ASPs in operational environments, and conducting a more rigorous cost-benefit analysis for ASP system procurement. It also directed DHS to brief the Senate Appropriations Committee if the recommendations are not followed and suggested placing acquisition funds within operational components like the U.S. Coast Guard. The Continuing Appropriation Act, 2011 provides DHS with FY2011 funds at the FY2010 level through March 4, 2011. The Homeland Security Science and Technology Authorization Act of 2010 contained provisions addressing the ASP program, emphasizing the need for viable alternatives to existing primary screening technology."
