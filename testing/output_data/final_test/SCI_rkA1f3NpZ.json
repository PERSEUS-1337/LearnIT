Ensemble methods are proposed as a defense strategy, showing improved accuracy and resilience against attacks on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. Deep neural networks have shown significant improvements in various areas like computer vision and speech recognition. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, where noise is added to mislead the system's output. Adversarial attacks are hard to detect and occur after the DNN is trained. The training of the DNN is completed, and it is assumed that the DNN and all its parameters are fully known to the adversary. Various methods for attacking neural networks are discussed in the literature, highlighting the importance of building robust neural networks. Defense methods against adversarial attacks are also being developed frequently. Defense methods against adversarial attacks in neural networks include training with perturbated data, distillation to reduce perturbation effectiveness, and using denoising autoencoders. Adversarial attacks can also be detected. Examples of adversarial attacks on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are shown in FIG1. Ensemble methods are used to create a more robust classification system against adversarial attacks, as current detection systems are vulnerable. These methods involve constructing a set of classifiers to classify new data points based on their predictions. Various ensemble methods like Bayesian averaging, Bagging, and boosting have been successful in machine learning competitions. This manuscript empirically evaluates the robustness of using ensembles of classifiers in adversarial contexts. Ensemble methods are advantageous in defending against adversarial perturbations as they increase accuracy on unperturbed data and can be combined with other defense mechanisms. However, they come with increased computational complexity and memory requirements. This manuscript evaluates the robustness of ensemble methods to adversarial attacks, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art results on unperturbed test data while enhancing defense against perturbations. This paper evaluates the robustness of ensemble methods to adversarial attacks by testing them on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Two methods for producing adversarial attacks are briefly described, including the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) by BID5. The gradient \u2207 x J(\u03b8, x, y) can be computed using backpropagation, and adversarial perturbations perform well on DNNs due to linear elements like ReLUs or maxout networks. The basic iterative method (BIM) is an extension of FGSM, where perturbations are applied iteratively to the input x. Ensemble methods are used to improve classifiers in supervised learning by constructing a set of classifiers for weighted or unweighted predictions. Ensemble methods are used to improve classifiers in supervised learning by constructing a set of diverse classifiers with random initial weights. Adversarial perturbations show diversity in classifier performance, with most classifiers remaining accurate even with small perturbations. Ensemble methods in supervised learning involve training diverse classifiers with random initial weights. This can be achieved by using different network architectures, applying Bagging on the training data, or adding Gaussian noise to the data. Ensemble methods in supervised learning involve training diverse classifiers with random initial weights. One method is to add Gaussian noise to the training data to make classifiers more robust against adversarial perturbations. The ensemble predicts by letting each classifier vote for a label, choosing the label that maximizes the average output probabilities. To attack a network, the gradient of each classifier in the ensemble must be calculated using methods referred to as Grad. 1 and Grad. 2. Ensemble methods involve training diverse classifiers with random initial weights. To attack a network, the gradient of each classifier in the ensemble must be calculated using methods referred to as Grad. 1 and Grad. 2. The effects of these gradients for attacking ensembles are compared in section 4, with empirical evaluations on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Experiments were conducted on ensembles of 10 classifiers for comparability, with results summarized in TAB1. Ensemble methods involve training diverse classifiers with random initial weights. The experimental results are summarized in TAB1 and visualized in FIG0. Comparisons with other defense methods and combinations with ensembles are shown in TAB4. FGSM and BIM perturbations are conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with specific parameters. Abbreviations in TAB1 and FIG0 are explained for different network initialization methods and training data modifications. Each ensemble is attacked using FGSM and BIM based on gradients. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 test samples of handwritten digits. The objective is to classify digits from 0 to 9. Ensembles slightly outperform single classifiers, with a classification accuracy of roughly 99% on unperturbed test data. However, when attacked by adversarial methods, the performance of the networks changes dramatically. When attacked by adversarial methods, the classification rate of networks changes dramatically. Using FGSM attack with gradients from Grad. 1, single classifiers drop to 35%-56% accuracy, while ensembles achieve 57%-78%. With gradients from Grad. 2, ensembles still reach 45%-70% accuracy. Single classifiers perform poorly with BIM method, as low as 6% accuracy, while ensembles achieve 65%-92% accuracy against Grad. 1 attacks. Ensemble methods show higher accuracy against Grad. 1 attacks (65%-92%) and Grad. 2 attacks (89%-98%) compared to single classifiers. Using random initialization and multiple networks in ensembles improves robustness against adversarial attacks. Bagging outperforms other methods on perturbations but slightly worse on unperturbed data. Adding small Gaussian noise to training data enhances ensemble performance. Adding Gaussian noise to the training data improves ensemble performance against adversarial attacks, making classifiers more robust. However, this method performs worst on unperturbed test data compared to other ensemble methods. The ensemble method performs worst on test data but still outperforms single classifiers on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. CIFAR-10 consists of 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples of three-color component encoded images of ten classes. The network architecture described in TAB3 is used for experiments with 25 epochs. Single classifiers on CIFAR-10 achieve 72%-80% accuracy, while ensembles reach 77%-84% accuracy. Ensembles outperform single classifiers on CIFAR-10 dataset with accuracies ranging from 77%-84%. When attacked with FGSM using Grad. 1, single classifiers drop to 16%-30% accuracy, while ensembles remain more robust at 43%-61%. BIM attacks result in accuracies of 11%-31% for single classifiers, compared to 52%-67% for ensembles. Similar trends are observed on MNIST dataset, with ensembles consistently outperforming single classifiers against adversarial perturbations. Ensembles using Grad. 2 outperform those using Grad. 1 on CIFAR-10 dataset. Ensembles are more robust against Grad. 2 attacks than Grad. 1 attacks. Bagging performs better than random initialization and different network architectures. Adding small Gaussian noise on training data is effective against adversarial perturbations but not on real test data. Comparison with defense methods BID5 BID22 and BID23 shows positive effects of combining them. Ensembles using Grad. 2 outperform Grad. 1 on CIFAR-10. Bagging is better than random initialization. Adding Gaussian noise helps against perturbations. Combining defense methods BID5, BID22, and BID23 shows positive effects. Adversarial training uses FGSM as a regularizer to increase robustness. Defensive distillation involves training a teacher model on data X and computing smoothed labels at temperature T. The distilled network is trained on training data X using smoothed labels at temperature T. Single networks with adversarial training or defensive distillation have lower accuracy than ensembles with bagging. Combining ensembles with adversarial training improves robustness against perturbations, while defensive distillation does not show the same improvement. Ensemble methods, such as random initialization or Bagging, increase accuracy on test data and enhance classifiers' robustness against adversarial attacks. Researchers highlight the vulnerability of neural networks to perturbations, especially in security-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. The standard ensemble method outperforms adversarial training and defensive distillation, showing the highest accuracy on unperturbed test data. This manuscript emphasizes the importance of obtaining robust neural networks against adversarial attacks. Ensemble methods can enhance classifiers' robustness against adversarial attacks. Combining ensemble methods with other defense mechanisms like adversarial training can further improve robustness. Testing simple attack scenarios suggests ensemble methods may enhance defense against various adversarial attacks."
