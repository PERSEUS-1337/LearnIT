    "content": "EMPLOYER REDUCTIONS. Employers planning a reduction in operations must provide written notice to employees, labor organizations, community officials, and the Secretary of Labor. The notice should be given at least 3 months before the reduction, unless a collective bargaining agreement requires a longer notification period. Employers must provide written notice of a planned reduction in operations, including details such as workplace location, reasons for the reduction, duration, and number of affected employees. The notice should also outline employees' rights and benefits under collective bargaining agreements or employer policies. The notice requirement does not apply in cases of unforeseen events causing the reduction. The notice requirement for a planned reduction in operations applies to various scenarios, including unforeseen events, labor disputes, reductions in commercial, industrial, or agricultural enterprises, temporary or seasonal workplaces, seasonal factors customary in the industry, and reductions due to employer bankruptcy. SEC. 2. ACTION BY THE SECRETARY OF LABOR.\n\nWithin 130 days of receiving a notice of a reduction in operations, the Secretary of Labor will coordinate state services to help displaced workers and explore the feasibility of establishing a community-owned business at the workplace.\n\nSEC. 3. ACTION BY EMPLOYER. An employer planning a reduction in operations must offer to sell the workplace, equipment, and inventory to the community or employee organization attempting to form a community-owned business. The offer cannot be withdrawn before the 50th day after notifying the community and employees. Sales under section 5 require compliance with a collective bargaining agreement. If the agreement has expired or will expire soon, the buyer must agree to negotiate with employee representatives. SEC. 4. REDUCTION IN OPERATIONS IN EFFECT. When a reduction in operations occurs, the employer must offer affected employees the choice of permanent preference rights in hiring, vacation benefits, and severance pay based on years of service. Severance pay includes one week's wages for each year of service, with additional bonuses for every 5 years of service. When a reduction in operations occurs, affected employees are offered the choice of preference rights benefits or severance pay. Severance pay includes one week's wages for each year of service, with additional bonuses for every 5 years of service. If an affected employee accepts a transfer to a workplace 40 miles or more from their residence, they are entitled to reimbursement for moving expenses and legal fees up to $500. Employees have 30 days to choose between severance pay benefits and preference rights benefits. In cases of a reduction in operations, affected employees must choose between preference rights benefits or severance pay within 30 days. If no choice is made, the employer can assign an option. The employer must continue to pay the employer's share of health and insurance premiums for one year or until the employee is eligible for benefits due to reemployment. Collective bargaining agreements take precedence over this Act. The Secretary of Labor will provide technical assistance upon request for employees or communities affected by reductions in operations, including informational meetings on community-owned businesses and feasibility evaluations. Enforcement measures are also outlined. The Secretary of Labor enforces the Act by issuing subpoenas, administering oaths, obtaining evidence, and taking testimony. Penalties are outlined for non-compliance. An employer failing to provide notice of a planned reduction in operations may face a civil penalty of up to $1,000 per affected employee. Failure to pay the penalty within 10 days results in a judgment that can be filed and enforced as a lien on the person's property. Any employer failing to give notice of a planned reduction in operations may be liable to affected employees for back pay and benefits under an employee benefit plan. Employers may be liable for expenses related to an employee benefit plan during employment loss, up to a maximum of 60 days. The liability amount is reduced by wages paid, voluntary payments, and payments to third parties on behalf of the employee. The liability incurred by employers for expenses related to an employee benefit plan during employment loss can be reduced by crediting the employee with service for the period of the violation.
