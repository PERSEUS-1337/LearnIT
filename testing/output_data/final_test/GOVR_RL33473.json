Similar issues were addressed in the 110th Congress through introduced legislation. The report discusses legislation introduced in the 110th Congress to enhance judicial security, with data showing judges are targets of threats and aggressive behavior. The US Marshals Service recorded 3,096 reports of inappropriate communications, threats, and attacks involving federal judicial officials between 1980 and 1993. Recent data from the US Marshals Service and the Bureau of Justice Assistance show that court officials, including federal, state, and local judges, have been targets of threats and attacks. Over the past 35 years, 8 state or local judges have been killed, 13 assaulted, 3 local prosecutors killed, and 4 assaulted. Additionally, the USMS reported receiving around 700 threats against judiciary members annually, with about 20 requiring protective detail and 12 needing 24/7 protection. Data from a survey on judicial safety in Pennsylvania revealed that judges faced various threats, with 52% reporting incidents of inappropriate communications, approaches, and physical assaults in the past year. 35% of respondents changed their judicial conduct due to threats experienced by themselves or their associates. Since 1987, New York's Office of Court Administration has handled over 2,000 reported threats against judges, with 1,300 occurring since 1995. Concerns have been raised about the U.S. Marshals Service's ability to provide security for the federal judiciary. A Department of Justice report found that the USMS failed to assess threats against federal judges in a timely manner and lacked intelligence-sharing capabilities. Additionally, the USMS lacked risk-based standards for protecting judges. The US Marshals Service lacked risk-based standards for protecting judges during high-risk trials and when they are not in court. Judge Jane R. Roth testified that funding and staffing issues have hindered the USMS's ability to provide adequate protection for the federal judiciary. She also raised concerns about the USMS's staffing levels and questioned whether budgetary problems stemmed from law enforcement responsibilities serving both the executive and judicial branches. The US Marshals Service is facing challenges in providing adequate protection for the federal judiciary, with staffing issues hindering their ability to meet operational demands. State courts struggle to access federal funding for court security measures, as they must compete with executive branch agencies for funding. Witness intimidation poses a barrier to citizen engagement with the criminal justice system. Witness intimidation reduces citizen engagement with the criminal justice system, depriving police and prosecutors of critical evidence and undermining public confidence. Intimidation can result from threats or community norms, including implicit gestures or explicit violence. Threats, more common than physical violence, effectively deter cooperation with law enforcement. According to a report by the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), witness intimidation is pervasive and increasing, with 36% of witnesses in Bronx County, New York, directly threatened and 57% fearing reprisals if they cooperate with law enforcement. Prosecutors believe witness intimidation plays a role in 75%-100% of violent crimes in gang-controlled neighborhoods. The prevalence of witness intimidation is difficult to quantify due to various reasons, including under-reporting of crime and lack of empirical research on community-wide intimidation. A report from the National Center for Victims of Crime presented data on surveys and interviews of youths in Massachusetts regarding experiences with gang-related crime and witness intimidation. Witness intimidation related to gang crime is prevalent, with 38% of survey respondents hearing about threats against schoolmates and 28% against neighbors. 12% of those who reported gang crimes received threats. Threats were mainly face-to-face or via phone calls, with half involving beatings. Other methods included notes, online messages, stalking, property vandalism, and social isolation. The 109th and 110th Congress responded to witness intimidation by enacting legislation to improve judicial security measures, increase funding for judicial security, and provide greater protection for judges, their family members, and witnesses. This included creating a grant program for states to provide protection for judges and witnesses. Additionally, four other bills aimed to create a short-term witness protection section in the US Marshals Service and establish a grant program. The 110th Congress introduced bills to enhance judicial security and witness protection, including creating a grant program for short-term witness protection. One bill, H.R. 2325, proposed allowing certain Department of Justice employees to carry firearms for protection. Other bills addressed court security issues, such as the Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007 and the Court and Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 2007. P.L. 110-177 increases penalties for voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, introduces new penalties for suppressing testimony, and sets imprisonment terms for offenses involving attempted murder or use of physical force. P.L. 110-177 imposes penalties for offenses involving threatening physical force, intimidation, or misleading conduct to prevent testimony, destroy evidence, or avoid legal proceedings. Harassing someone to prevent them from attending official proceedings or reporting violations can result in fines, imprisonment up to 20 years, or both. P.L. 110-177 imposes penalties for offenses involving threatening physical force, intimidation, or misleading conduct to prevent testimony, destroy evidence, or avoid legal proceedings. It increases the sentence to a maximum of 30 years for attempting to kill someone in retaliation for attending an official proceeding or providing information to law enforcement. P.L. 110-177 increases penalties for retaliating against witnesses, victims, or informants, and for assaulting U.S. officials or law enforcement officers. It allows prosecution in the district where the offense occurred and sets new penalties for such actions. Under P.L. 110-177, individuals who commit a simple assault punishable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7115 can face fines and up to a year in prison. More severe penalties apply if the assault involves physical contact, intent to commit another felony, bodily injury, or the use of a dangerous weapon. P.L. 110-177 introduces new grant programs for witness and victim protection, allowing funds to be used to prevent threats and intimidation against victims and witnesses of violent crimes. The program authorizes $20 million annually for FY2008 through FY2012 and permits Correctional Options grants to improve court security. P.L. 110-177 amends current law to allocate 10% of Correctional Options grants for state courts to enhance court security. It also allows state and local courts to receive funding for bulletproof vests for court officers. The Attorney General can require grant applicants to consult with judicial and law enforcement officials. Additionally, a new grant program is created under P.L. 110-177. P.L. 110-177 establishes a grant program for state courts to create and maintain a threat assessment database to analyze trends in domestic terrorism and crime. The law also mandates the Attorney General to develop a standard set of data elements for effective information sharing. Additionally, the legislation allocates $15 million annually from FY2006 to FY2009 for this purpose and includes measures to protect judicial personnel. P.L. 110-177 mandates consultation between the USMS Director and the Judicial Conference for judicial security needs. The USMS has final authority on security requirements and an additional $20 million per year from FY2007 to FY2011 is allocated for hiring deputy marshals to provide judicial protection. P.L. 110-177 mandates hiring senior-level deputy marshals to investigate threats to the judiciary and provide protective details, as well as making it illegal to file false liens against U.S. employees, with penalties including fines and prison sentences. P.L. 110-177 prohibits making restricted personal information about covered persons publicly available with the intent to threaten or incite violence, punishable by up to five years in prison or a fine. The law also requires the Attorney General to report on the security of Assistant U.S. Attorneys. The Attorney General must report on the security of federal attorneys handling cases involving terrorists, criminal gangs, drug traffickers, and white supremacists within 90 days of the Act. The law prohibits bringing dangerous weapons into federal court facilities and reauthorizes fugitive apprehension task forces coordinated by the U.S. Marshals Service, with $10 million authorized annually from FY2008 to FY2012. Additionally, the law extends the redaction provision for financial disclosure reports. The discussed provisions in various bills aimed to address judicial security, including increasing sentences for specified offenses and creating specific penalties for crimes against federal judges or law enforcement officers. H.R. 2325 proposed fines and imprisonment for anyone convicted of murdering, attempting to murder, or conspiring to murder a federal judge or law enforcement officer. The bill, H.R. 2325, proposed increased penalties for crimes against federal judges or law enforcement officers, including fines and imprisonment ranging from 3 years to life for various offenses such as manslaughter, kidnapping, and assault on a U.S. government employee. The bill, H.R. 2325, aimed to increase penalties for crimes against federal judges or law enforcement officers, including fines and imprisonment for assaulting a U.S. government employee while on duty or using a deadly weapon during the assault. Penalties would also apply to assaults on former government employees. The bill, H.R. 2325, proposed increased penalties for assaulting federal judges or law enforcement officers. Penalties included fines and imprisonment ranging from 2 to 25 years based on the severity of the assault and the use of a dangerous weapon. H.R. 2325 proposed specific penalties for assaulting federal judges or law enforcement officers, including fines and imprisonment ranging from 2 to 25 years based on the severity of the assault and the use of a dangerous weapon. The bill also outlined penalties for threatening or harming the immediate family of federal judges or law enforcement officers with the intent to impede or retaliate against them. The bill proposed penalties for various crimes against federal judges or law enforcement officers, including murder, kidnapping, assault, and threats. Penalties ranged from fines and imprisonment of 2 to 25 years, with additional punishment for other criminal conduct during the same episode. The bills proposed new grant programs and amendments to establish a Short-term State Witness Protection Section within the USMS for witnesses in state and local trials involving violent crimes. Protection would be provided through cooperative agreements with prosecutors' offices. The Short-term State Witness Protection Section in bills like S. 79 and H.R. 3547 would prioritize grants and services for prosecutors' offices in states with high murder rates and above-average violent crime rates. These bills also authorize a grant program for short-term witness protection. H.R. 933 and S. 79 would allow the Attorney General to grant awards for short-term witness protection to state and local district attorneys offices in states with high murder rates. The grants would be for trials involving homicide, serious violent felonies, or serious drug offenses. The proposed legislation (H.R. 933 and S. 79) would allow the Attorney General to grant awards for short-term witness protection to state and local district attorneys' offices in states with high murder rates, averaging at least 100 murders per year over the past five years. The grants could be used to provide protection to witnesses in trials involving homicide, serious violent felonies, or serious drug offenses. Additionally, H.R. 3547 and S. 456 propose a similar grant program, allowing the Attorney General to award grants to state and local criminal prosecutors' offices for identifying witnesses in need of protection. The proposed legislation (H.R. 3547 and S. 456) would authorize $90 million annually for FY2008 through FY2010 to make grants for short-term witness protection. The grants could be used by prosecutors' offices to identify and provide protection to witnesses in trials involving homicide or serious violent felonies. Both H.R. 3547 and S. 456 proposed authorizing $90 million annually for FY2008 through FY2010 for short-term witness protection grants. The bills aimed to expand the circumstances under which the Attorney General can provide protection to witnesses in cases involving criminal street gangs, serious drug offenses, or homicide. The bills discussed include measures to protect judicial personnel. S. 378 would allow redaction of information from financial disclosure reports to protect family members of justices, judges, and judicial officers. H.R. 2325 would allow certain Department of Justice employees to carry firearms, with regulations to be issued by the Attorney General. The bill would have required the Attorney General to issue regulations for carrying out provisions related to allowing Amtrack Police Department officers and federal law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms. It would also have modified requirements for retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms."
