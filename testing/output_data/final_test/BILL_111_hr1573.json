SEC. 3. NATIONAL HOME ENERGY SAVINGS REVOLVING FUND. A revolving fund called the National Home Energy Savings Revolving Fund is established within the Department of Energy.

To be eligible for funds under this Act, a local government must submit an application to the Secretary with required information, including a description of the payment method. The Secretary will allocate funds from the Revolving Fund to eligible local governments based on need for loans to homeowners, with a limitation on the amount provided to a single government in a fiscal year. The Revolving Fund provides funds to local governments, limited to 2% per unit. Repayment of loans to homeowners is required, with local governments transferring amounts due to the Secretary within 120 days. SEC. 5. Loans to homeowners for qualified home energy audits and certified energy savings improvements. Loans provided to homeowners under this Act must be used for conducting qualified home energy audits, implementing certified energy savings improvements, acquiring such improvements, or installing them. The Secretary will establish procedures and techniques for home energy audits that meet established standards. Energy audits must meet Secretary-established standards, prioritize cost-effective energy savings improvements, measure energy requirements, and consider interaction among measures. Loan funds can be used for implementing energy savings improvements by homeowners. To be eligible for a loan, homeowners must have an energy audit that identifies cost-effective energy improvements and is documented in a report listing savings in order of effectiveness, payback period, and contribution to energy savings. To be eligible for a loan from a local government unit, homeowners must submit an application with required information.

The total loan amount for a single homeowner from a local government unit is limited to $10,000, with the option for a lower limit. Loans must be used for eligible purposes on the homeowner's primary residence. Local governments must provide information on loan purposes to homeowners receiving funds under the Act.
