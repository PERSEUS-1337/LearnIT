    "content": "The report provides an overview of the Obama Administration's FY2012 budget request and the status of FY2012 appropriations for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED). This bill allocates discretionary and mandatory appropriations to federal departments and related agencies, with discretionary funds representing less than one-quarter of the total funds. The L-HHS-ED bill is a significant source of discretionary funds for domestic non-defense federal programs. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations, particularly the L-HHS-ED bill, which is known for its controversial funding and program scope. It explains important terminology and provides an overview of the FY2012 appropriations process for the bill. The FY2012 appropriations process for the L-HHS-ED bill is summarized, including congressional actions, enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74), and comparisons to FY2011 and proposed funding. Additionally, discretionary L-HHS-ED funding over the past ten years and budget enforcement activities for FY2012 are outlined. The report provides an overview of House and Senate steps towards a budget resolution and 302(b) allocations for FY2012 appropriations for the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies. It focuses on appropriations to agencies under the jurisdiction of the Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The FY2012 enacted numbers cited do not reflect the across-the-board rescission required by Section 527 of Division F of P.L. 112-74. The L-HHS-ED bill provides appropriations for federal departments and agencies such as the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services (excluding certain agencies funded by other bills), Department of Education, and related agencies like the Social Security Administration and Corporation for National and Community Service. The L-HHS-ED bill includes funding for various federal departments and agencies, such as the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, Social Security Administration, Corporation for National and Community Service, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Institute of Museum and Library Services, National Labor Relations Board, and Railroad Retirement Board. Funding totals in the report do not include amounts provided outside the regular appropriations process. Certain direct spending programs like Social Security retirement and parts of Medicare receive funding directly from their authorizing statute and are not subject to the regular appropriations process. Mandatory spending for appropriated entitlements is not fully controlled by appropriators, as the authorizing statute sets program parameters. Failure to appropriate necessary funds may lead to legal action by entitled recipients. Some entitlements, like Social Security retirement, receive direct spending budget authority and are not subject to annual appropriations. Funding amounts in the report exclude direct spending budget. The report focuses on funding amounts provided through appropriations bills, excluding direct spending budget authority. Mandatory amounts for the FY2012 President's request reflect current law estimates and do not include proposed changes to program authorizing statutes. The report primarily emphasizes discretionary funding, as it receives more attention during the appropriations process. The bill includes more mandatory funding than discretionary funding, giving appropriators less flexibility. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows a federal agency to spend, which may become available in the current or future fiscal years. Advance appropriations refer to amounts available in future years. Appropriations levels in the report refer to total budget authority provided in a bill, regardless of when the funding becomes available. The report also breaks out \"current year\" appropriations for obligation in a given fiscal year. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2055) into law on December 23, 2011, which included mandatory funding and appropriations for the L-HHS-ED departments for FY2012. The appropriations process involves measuring current year appropriations against 302(b) allocation ceilings set by Congress. Scorekeeping adjustments by the Congressional Budget Office are not reflected in the appropriations levels displayed in the report. President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2055) into law on December 23, 2011, providing $163.9 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED accounts for FY2012. The law also includes $576.7 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $740.6 billion for the bill. This funding level is nearly 1% less than the FY2011 level, with an across-the-board rescission required for most discretionary accounts. President Obama signed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 3672, P.L. 112-77) into law on December 23, 2011, providing $484 million for program integrity activities at the Social Security Administration. This supplemental funding, combined with the annual appropriations from P.L. 112-74, brings the total FY2012 L-HHS-ED discretionary funding level to $164.3 billion. Figure 1 shows the breakdown of discretionary and mandatory funding for L-HHS-ED agencies by P.L. 112-74 and P.L. 112-77. The House and Senate initiated action on full-year FY2012 L-HHS-ED appropriations with bills H.R. 3070 and S. 1599. The House bill proposed $160 billion in discretionary funding, while the Senate bill proposed roughly $165 billion, similar to FY2011 levels. The Senate bill for FY2012 L-HHS-ED appropriations proposed $577 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $742 billion in the bill. President Obama's FY2012 Budget requested $178.5 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of 8% from FY2011. Annual appropriations for L-HHS-ED in FY2011 were provided through continuing resolutions, with the final CR signed into law on April 15, 2011. The final FY2011 CR provided $165.3 billion in discretionary funding for accounts traditionally funded by the L-HHS-ED bill, along with an estimated $557.4 billion in mandatory funding, totaling $722.7 billion in the bill. Table 2 compares FY2012 funding levels to FY2011, including amounts from the final FY2012 annual appropriations law and the FY2012 disaster relief law. The FY2012 House and Senate L-HHS-ED appropriations bills are also included in the comparison. HHS received over three-quarters of the FY2011 and FY2012 L-HHS-ED appropriations, mainly due to significant mandatory funding for Medicaid and health care trust funds. The Department of Education received about 10% of total funding in each year, primarily discretionary. The Department of Education receives primarily discretionary funds, accounting for about 9% of total funds in FY2011 and FY2012. The Department of Labor receives the smallest share of funding, roughly 2% in both years. When looking at discretionary appropriations, HHS accounts for a smaller share, about 42% in both years, while the Department of Education represents a larger share at 41%. In FY2011 and FY2012, HHS and the Department of Education together dominate discretionary-only L-HHS-ED funding, accounting for roughly 84% combined. Discretionary funding for related agencies and the Department of Labor make up the remaining 16%. L-HHS-ED discretionary appropriations grew by 24% from $132.4 billion in FY2003 to $163.9 billion in FY2012. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25) was signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, to address the national debt limit. It included provisions to increase the debt limit and reduce the federal deficit by establishing discretionary spending caps for the next ten fiscal years. This affected the FY2012 appropriations process, including the House and Senate 302(b) allocations for L-HHS-ED appropriations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established discretionary spending caps for the next ten fiscal years. For FY2012, the overall discretionary cap was set at $1.043 trillion, with $684 billion for security spending and $359 billion for non-security spending. Security spending includes funding for the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, National Nuclear Security Administration, Intelligence Community Management Account, and Budget Function 150. Non-security spending includes L-HHS-ED appropriations. Adjustments to spending caps are allowed for certain overseas contingency costs. Adjustments to annual discretionary spending caps are made for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, disaster relief, continuing disability reviews, redeterminations, and controlling health care fraud and abuse. In FY2012, adjustments were made for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, but not for health care fraud and abuse. The Budget Control Act's statutory budget caps are enforced through sequestration if exceeded. The Budget Control Act enforces statutory budget caps through sequestration if exceeded. The FY2012 enacted amounts were within the limit, so sequestration was not required. The Senate allocated funds under the spending cap to each Appropriations subcommittee, including L-HHS-ED. The Senate reported revised allocations on December 17, 2011. Prior to the enactment of the Budget Control Act (BCA), the House passed a budget resolution for FY2012 but did not specify spending amounts for programs. The House has not adjusted its allocations to reflect the higher BCA levels. The Senate revised 302(b) allocations on December 17, 2011, including for L-HHS-ED, in line with budget enforcement caps. The budget enforcement caps are applied to budget authority in the current fiscal year, excluding emergency funding, and adjusted for scorekeeping by the Congressional Budget Office. The figures are based on regular L-HHS-ED appropriations only, rounded to the nearest million or billion. Enacted FY2012 amounts in the text have not been adjusted for the across-the-board rescission. DOL is a federal department providing services related to employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contracts. The Department of Labor (DOL) provides services related to employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. DOL entities focus on workforce development and worker protection, administering programs like the Workforce Investment Act, Job Corps, Employment Service, and Veterans' Employment and Training Service. Worker protection services are also provided, such as Occupational Safety and Health. The Department of Labor (DOL) provides various worker protection services through entities like OSHA, MSHA, and the Wage and Hour Division. These services ensure worker safety, wage and overtime law adherence, and contract compliance. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects labor market data and analysis. The final FY2012 appropriations law allocated $12.6 billion for DOL, slightly less than previous funding levels. The final FY2012 appropriations law allocated $4.9 billion for programs under the Workforce Investment Act, a decrease from FY2011 levels and below the Administration's FY2012 request. The WIA Adult and Youth state formula grant programs maintained funding, while the Dislocated Worker state formula grant program saw a reduction. Governors' reserve of WIA state formula grants is limited to 5% of the total received. The FY2012 appropriations law reduced the statutory limit for state formula grants under the Workforce Investment Act to 5%. It also allocated $50 million for the Workforce Investment Fund, which is less than previous funding levels. Additionally, the law directs the Government Accountability Office to study how entities match employment and training activities to job opportunities. The FY2012 appropriations law provides funding for the Workforce Investment Fund (WIF) as a stand-alone appropriation, rather than redirecting funds from other programs. It also includes funding for the Green Jobs Innovation Fund (GJIF) and maintains funding for Job Corps at the FY2011 level. The FY2012 appropriations law eliminates advance appropriations for Job Corps and maintains funding for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans Program at $449 million. It rejects transferring administration of CSEOA to HHS and does not allocate funds for the State Paid Leave Fund proposed in the FY2012 President's Budget. The FY2012 appropriations law provides $264.9 million for the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS), with increases for various programs. It also includes provisions for transferring funds for employment and training needs of young parents to other projects and implementing the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) to Hire Heroes Act of 2011. Additionally, $183.5 million is allocated for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA), a 15% increase from the previous year. The Administration requested $240.9 million for the Wage and Hour Division (WHD), an increase of $13.5 million (+6%) above the FY2011 funding level of $227.5 million. The increase was requested to hire additional auditors and inspectors to detect and deter employee misclassification as \"independent contractors.\" However, the FY2012 appropriations law did not provide additional funding for this initiative. The FY2012 appropriations law maintains funding for the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) at $227.5 million, with no additional funding provided for the requested increase. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) receives $583.4 million, a $24.8 million increase (+4%), for additional employees for regulatory and whistleblower investigations. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) receives $384.3 million, a $22.4 million increase (+6%), for resources to address case backlogs and purchase Continuous Personal Dust Monitors. OSHA's funding increases by $7.2 million (+1.3%) compared to FY2011, while MSHA's funding also increases. The FY2012 law increases funding for OSHA by $7.2 million (+1.3%) and for MSHA by $12.2 million (+3.4%) compared to FY2011. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) requested $647 million, reflecting efforts to improve surveys and establish a new National Longitudinal Study (NLS) on youth. The law maintains BLS funding at $610.2 million. HHS is a federal department with multiple agencies working to enhance Americans' health. Annual appropriations laws direct funding to most HHS agencies. The L-HHS-ED bill allocates funding to various Public Health Service agencies like HRSA, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and AHRQ, supporting healthcare services, research, and disease prevention. It also funds CMS for Medicare and Medicaid administration, ACA consumer protections, and HHS agencies ACF and AOA for social services. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for various Public Health Service agencies and HHS Office of the Secretary to support healthcare services, research, and social services. The FY2012 appropriations law allocates $69.8 billion in discretionary funding for HHS, which is $693 million less than FY2011 and $3.4 billion less than the President's Budget request. CMS receives the majority of mandatory funding for Medicaid benefits and health care trust funds. In FY2011 and FY2012, CMS received a significant portion of total HHS appropriations, while NIH and ACF received the majority of discretionary HHS appropriations. Discretionary funding for these agencies made up two-thirds of all discretionary HHS appropriations in both years. The Public Health Service Evaluation Tap and other important aspects of discretionary HHS appropriations are discussed in this section. The Public Health Service Evaluation Tap provides additional funding to HHS programs beyond their regular appropriations. This tap allows the Secretary of HHS to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations for program evaluation purposes across HHS. In the annual L-HHS-ED act, Congress specifies the maximum percentage for the set-aside, which is 2.5% of eligible appropriations in FY2012, the same as in FY2011. The President's Budget had proposed to increase the set-aside to 3.2% in FY2012. Congress also allocates a portion of the available money for transfer to specific programs. The funding amounts from the tap are labeled \"non-add\" in the table because they are not counted in the totals of appropriated funds. Overall funding levels may not change greatly due to shifts in funding sources. Limited selection of FY2012 discretionary funding highlights for HHS programs are reviewed. The FY2012 appropriations law provided either a small increase or level funding for public health agencies like CDC and NIH, while agencies like HRSA, SAMHSA, and AHRQ received slightly less funding compared to FY2011. The FY2012 President's Budget had proposed increases for these agencies. The final FY2012 appropriations law slightly reduces funding for HRSA's health professions programs, rejecting some of the Administration's proposals. For example, discretionary funding for the National Health Service Corps was eliminated, and funding for the Alternative Dental Health Care Providers Demonstration Project was prohibited. The final FY2012 appropriations law maintains level funding for HRSA's Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education program and primary care programs, including $1.6 billion for community health centers. It also reduces funding for CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health by 7% from FY2011. The final FY2012 appropriations law maintains funding for various health programs, including rejecting the proposal to fund NIOSH solely via the PHS Evaluation Tap. It also provides $1.2 billion for chronic disease prevention and health promotion programs, with $457 million from the PHS Evaluation Tap. The law includes additional pre-appropriated funding from the ACA for these programs. In FY2012, $1 billion is available for transfer from the PPHF, with distribution among programs still unclear. NIH received a $2 million increase in overall appropriation, with all institutes and centers seeing increases due to the elimination of a provision to transfer $300 million to the Global Fund. The largest increase at NIH (+$76 million) goes to the Buildings and Facilities account, reaching $126 million in FY2012. Additionally, a new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences is established as per the President's request. The FY2012 law establishes a new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and reallocates funds from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR). The law increases appropriations for SAMHSA block grants, with the Mental Health Block Grant receiving $440 million (+10% from FY2011) and the Substance Abuse Block Grant receiving $1.7 billion (+1% from FY2011). Funding for state prevention grants for mental health and substance abuse proposed by the Administration is not provided in the law. The FY2012 appropriations law provides $4.2 billion in discretionary funding for CMS, with increases in funding for Mental Health Block Grant and Substance Abuse Block Grant. Decreases in appropriations are seen for Mental Health PRNS and Substance Abuse Treatment PRNS. The majority of the discretionary appropriation is directed towards CMS program management activities, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. The final FY2012 appropriations law provides $16.5 billion in discretionary funding for ACF, which is $715 million less than FY2011 but $342 million more than the President's Budget request. The law does not include a provision that would have prohibited HHS from using funds for the CMS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. In FY2012, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) faces the largest cut among discretionary ACF programs, receiving $3.5 billion, $1.2 billion less than FY2011 but $909 million more than the President's request. The law eliminates funding for the Job Opportunities for Low-Income Individuals program but maintains funding for the Community Services Block Grant at $679 million, double the Administration's request. The final FY2012 appropriations law provides $8.0 billion for Head Start (+6% from FY2011) and $2.3 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (+3% from FY2011), showing support for early childhood care and education programs. Additionally, $1.47 billion in discretionary funding is allocated for AOA, which is $24 million (-2%) less than FY2011 and $764 million (-34%) less than the President's Budget request. The majority of AOA programs receive level funding compared to FY2011, with a few exceptions. The FY2012 law reduces funding for certain AOA programs compared to FY2011. For example, funding for Program Innovations is eliminated, and funding for the Alzheimer's Disease Supportive Services Program is decreased. The law also rejects proposals to transfer programs from other agencies to AOA, including the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program and the State Health Insurance Program. The final law provides no funding for the administration of the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports (CLASS) program, a voluntary insurance program established by the ACA. CLASS implementation was suspended in 2011, and administrative costs were previously funded by the ACA Implementation Fund. Annual appropriations laws regularly contain restrictions related to controversial issues such as abortion and research involving human embryos. These provisions limit the use of L-HHS-ED funds for abortions to cases of endangerment, rape, or incest. Additionally, funds cannot be used for managed care packages with abortion coverage, except in specific circumstances. Federal programs and state/local governments receiving funding are prohibited from discriminating against healthcare entities that do not provide abortion services. Since FY1997, appropriations have also prohibited the use of funds for creating human embryos for research or research involving the destruction of human embryos. The FY2012 law reinstates provisions related to abortion and research involving human embryos, as well as restrictions on needle exchange programs and gun control advocacy. Appropriations details for HHS offices and programs are provided, excluding funds outside the annual appropriations process. Amounts are rounded to the nearest million or billion, with dollar and percent changes based on unrounded amounts. The FY2012 law reinstates provisions related to abortion and research involving human embryos, as well as restrictions on needle exchange programs and gun control advocacy. The federal government provides roughly 9% of overall funding for elementary and secondary education, with states and local districts contributing the majority. The United States Department of Education (ED) performs various functions, including promoting educational standards and administering federal education programs. The United States Department of Education (ED) administers numerous elementary and secondary education programs, focusing on improving academic outcomes for disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. In higher education, ED supports the majority of direct aid for students, including financial aid programs like student loans and the Pell grant. Additionally, ED oversees vocational rehabilitation, career and technical education, and adult education programs. The final FY2012 appropriations law provides $68.2 billion in discretionary funding for the United States Department of Education (ED), which is $190 million less than FY2011. This amount is $9.2 billion less than the President's Budget request. The discussion focuses on highlights from the final FY2012 appropriations law, the President's Budget request, and the House and Senate bills for FY2012. The President's Budget proposed a reorganization of Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs. The President's FY2012 budget request proposed consolidating Education Act programs into larger programs, resulting in discrepancies with current program titles. Some discretionary programs in the budget request, such as Education for the Disadvantaged State Grants and School Improvement Grants, would have received funding increases. The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program did not receive an increase in funding in FY2012, despite a proposed $100 million increase. Other programs like Race to the Top and Investing in Innovation also received less funding than recommended in the President's Budget. The final FY2012 appropriations law provided $550 million for Race to the Top and $150 million for the Investing in Innovation Fund. Several programs saw cuts in funding compared to FY2011, including Race to the Top, the Teacher Incentive Fund, and Safe Schools and Citizenship\u2013National Programs. Funding was eliminated for programs such as Foreign Language Assistance and Teaching of Traditional American History. In FY2011, key literacy programs like Striving Readers, Even Start, and Literacy through School Libraries received no funding. The FY2012 budget proposed $383 million for a new literacy initiative, with the final appropriations law allocating $160 million for Striving Readers. The Senate proposed $183 million for Striving Readers, while the House did not allocate any funds for literacy programs. The FY2011 CR directed the Administration to use part of the Race to the Top appropriation for early childhood care grants. In FY2011, the Race to the Top (RTT) appropriation was used for early childhood care grants. The FY2012 budget proposed increasing discretionary funding for Pell Grants and included proposals to reduce costs in the Pell Grant program. The final FY2012 appropriations law specified that the RTT program should include a robust early learning component. The FY2012 appropriations law redirected funding from savings to the Pell Grant program, reducing the need for discretionary funding by $13.2 billion. The discretionary base maximum award for AY 2012-13 is $4,860, with a total maximum award of $5,550. The FY2012 appropriations law maintained the Pell Grant maximum award at $5,550 for AY2012-13, exempting it from a 0.189% rescission. The law also made changes to Student Loan and Pell Grant programs. Appropriations details for ED offices and programs are shown in Table 10, excluding funds provided outside the annual appropriations process. The FY2012 appropriations law provided $13.9 billion in discretionary funding for related agencies in the L-HHS-ED appropriations, which is slightly higher than the previous year but lower than the President's request. The largest share of funding in the L-HHS-ED bill goes to the Social Security Administration (SSA), accounting for 97% of the entire related agencies appropriation in FY2012 ($64 billion) and 96% in FY2011 ($61.4 billion). The bulk of mandatory SSA funding supports the Supplemental Security Income program. The SSA also constitutes roughly 83% of discretionary funds in FY2012 and FY2011, covering administrative expenses for Social Security, SSI, and Medicare. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) receives roughly 2% of all funding and 8% of discretionary funding in FY2012 ($1.1 billion) and FY2011 ($1.1 billion). The House version of the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill proposed eliminating funding for CNCS programs like VISTA and AmeriCorps State Grants. The final FY2012 appropriations law includes funding for all but one CNCS program, with Learn and Serve America program not receiving any funding. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting receives $445 million in two-year advance funding, less than the President's request. The Social Security Administration will have the same amount to administer its programs. The FY2012 appropriations law provides $11.4 billion for Limitation on Administrative Expenses and program integrity activities for the Social Security Administration, maintaining funding levels similar to FY2011. The National Healthcare Workforce Commission was created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The National Healthcare Workforce Commission, established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, had members appointed by the Comptroller General in 2010. The President requested $3 million for the commission, but no funding was provided in the FY2012 appropriations bill. The bill also included a provision prohibiting the National Labor Relations Board from using funds for new regulations on electronic voting for collective bargaining."
