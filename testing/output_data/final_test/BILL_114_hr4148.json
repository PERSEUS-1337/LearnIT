    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Obstetric Fistula Prevention, Treatment, Hope, and Dignity Restoration Act of 2015\". Congress finds that every two minutes, one woman dies from pregnancy-related complications, with 99 percent of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Over half of these deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa and one-third are in South Asia. Most of these deaths are preventable. Additionally, for every woman who dies, an estimated 20 women survive but experience pregnancy-related disabilities, such as obstetric fistula. This condition is a hole that forms between the bladder and vagina, or the rectum and vagina. Obstetric fistula is a condition that occurs after prolonged, obstructed labor without timely medical intervention. The fetus puts pressure on the bladder and vaginal or rectal walls, causing tissue damage and resulting in abnormal openings. This leads to incontinence, physical pain, disability, and emotional trauma for the mother. The majority of cases result in stillborn babies and complications like frequent infections. Obstetric fistula can lead to various physical symptoms like bladder infections, infertility, foul odor, and nerve damage. The condition also has mental, emotional, and social effects such as depression, social isolation, discrimination, suicidal thoughts, lack of economic opportunities, and inability to continue schooling. Women and girls with fistula may feel hopeless due to stigma and lack of awareness about treatment options. Survivors require regular medical attention and support, but often face barriers in accessing adequate services due to financial constraints. Additionally, women may face property loss if they are divorced or abandoned. The World Health Organization estimates over 2 million women live with obstetric fistula, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases annually. Poverty, malnutrition, and gender discrimination are root causes, leading to a lack of timely obstetric care. Obstetric fistula was eliminated in Europe, North America, and other developed regions through improved access to medical interventions, particularly emergency obstetric care. The United Nations Secretary General called for world leaders to commit to ending obstetric fistula, which primarily affects the poorest and most marginalized women due to social, economic, and gender inequalities. Obstetric fistula is preventable through medical interventions like skilled attendance during labor, access to family planning, and emergency obstetric care. The majority of cases can be surgically treated with success rates as high as 90 percent, costing around $400. Surgery requires a trained surgeon, support staff, an operating theater, and postoperative care. According to the Department of State, women's access to health-related knowledge and services is crucial for their own well-being and that of their families. The health and well-being of women not only enhances productivity and economic participation but also benefits future generations. In 2002, the United Nations Population Fund and EngenderHealth conducted the first-ever assessments. In 2003, UNFPA and partners launched a global campaign to address obstetric fistula in over 50 countries across Africa, Asia, and the Arab region. The Campaign focuses on prevention, treatment, and social reintegration for fistula survivors. The Campaign to End Fistula, launched in 2003 by UNFPA and partners, aims to provide support for fistula survivors through surgery, training of healthcare workers, community outreach, and rehabilitative care. Over 57,000 fistula repairs have been directly supported, with additional repairs by Campaign partners. The initiative collaborates with national counterparts and United Nations agencies to address obstetric fistula globally. In 2004, USAID provided funding through the ACQUIRE Project managed by EngenderHealth to support services in collaboration with various organizations for national capacity strengthening to reach regional backlogs of women living with fistula in remote regions. EngenderHealth managed the Fistula Care project funded by USAID in Bangladesh and Uganda from 2007 to 2013. In 2013, USAID awarded a new 5-year cooperative agreement to EngenderHealth for the Fistula Care Plus project in Africa and Asia. The project aims to expand access to care, test new approaches, and improve health outcomes for women with fistula. USAID currently supports fistula treatment services in 137 sites in six countries and addresses prevention in 36 more sites. The Fistula Care Plus project has a budget of $74,490,000 and has helped over 39,000 women receive fistula repairs since 2004. The United States Global Health Initiative aims to strengthen key organizations and partnerships to achieve development goals. Through the Every Woman Every Child initiative, the US is committed to reducing maternal mortality and supporting family planning programs. The USAID Maternal Health Vision for Action aims to reach 120,000,000 additional women and girls with family planning information and services by 2020, focusing on averting maternal morbidity and disability. SEC. 3. PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF OBSTETRIC FISTULA. The President is authorized to provide assistance to address social and health issues leading to obstetric fistula and support its treatment through various organizations. Assistance will focus on increasing prevention through access to sexual and reproductive health services, building local capacity, and improving national health systems. Assistance is provided to prevent and treat obstetric fistula by supporting tools for countries, addressing social and economic inequities, empowering women and girls, and promoting education and delayed childbirth. Promoting public awareness to reduce stigma and violence against women and girls with obstetric fistula. SEC. 4. COORDINATION, REPORTING, RESEARCH, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION. Assistance authorized under this Act promotes coordination through the International Obstetric Fistula Working Group and supports prevention and treatment programs. Funds are used for evidence-based programs and reporting to Congress is required annually. The Act promotes coordination through the International Obstetric Fistula Working Group and supports prevention and treatment programs. Annual reporting to Congress is required on activities to reduce obstetric fistula incidence and increase treatment, aligning with national action plans."
