    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Super Pollutants Act of 2015\". Short-lived climate pollutants contribute significantly to global warming, despite their small percentage by weight. Reducing these emissions could prevent millions of premature deaths and crop losses annually, as well as decrease sea-level rise and warming rates. The United States could lead in phasing down hydrofluorocarbon production and consumption, aligning with global efforts to limit warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The Montreal Protocol has been successful in protecting the ozone layer and achieving climate benefits. Since the signing of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, there has been a 98% reduction in ozone-depleting substances, leading to significant climate protection cobenefits. The interagency Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, released in March 2014, aims to reduce methane leakage and waste in the US economy. The Act defines \"short-lived climate pollutant\" as black carbon, methane, and high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons. The Task Force refers to the Interagency Task Force on Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Mitigation established under the Act. The President shall establish the Interagency Task Force on Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Mitigation within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Task Force will include heads of relevant Federal departments and agencies, and must submit a report to congressional committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report includes plans to reduce hydrofluorocarbons, methane, and related emissions by the Federal Government. It also outlines specific plans to purchase cleaner alternatives and transition to safer equipment. The Federal Government plans to reduce short-lived climate pollutants by incorporating recommendations from various entities and reports, identifying relevant programs addressing these pollutants, and eliminating overlapping programs. The Federal Government aims to reduce short-lived climate pollutants by consolidating programs, identifying gaps, consulting with stakeholders, and submitting a report to Congress within 18 months. SEC. 5. REDUCTION OF BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS. Through the membership in the International Maritime Organization, the Secretary of State, in consultation with other relevant departments, will develop a comprehensive plan to reduce black carbon emissions from international shipping. This plan includes a clean freight partnership, limits on black carbon, and efforts to protect access to critical fuel shipments and emergency needs of coastal communities. The Secretary of State will develop a plan to reduce fine-particle emissions in the shipping sector by installing advanced emissions controls and reducing sulfur content in fuels. As chairperson of the Arctic Council, they will lead efforts to reduce black carbon emissions through an Arctic-wide goal and encourage other countries to adopt similar goals. The Secretary of State is encouraged to work with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to craft financing mechanisms for black carbon mitigation activities. The Administrator of USAID will prioritize black carbon mitigation activities as part of official development assistance. The Secretary of State, in collaboration with other agencies, will prioritize projects that have environmental, gender, livelihood, and public health benefits, including support for clean-burning cookstoves. They will also provide aid to reduce black carbon emissions from various sources through technical assistance. The Secretary of State, in collaboration with other agencies, will prioritize projects to reduce black carbon emissions from various sources through technical assistance, including lowering sulfur content in diesel fuels, expanding access to diesel particulate filters, providing low-emission engine designs to vehicle manufacturers, and developing energy efficiency alternatives for generators and industrial processes. SEC. 6. GLOBAL REDUCTIONS IN HIGH-GWP FLUORINATED GASES. The text chunk discusses Congress's recommendation for the Environmental Protection Agency to amend regulations to include hydrofluorocarbons and expand initiatives for their recovery. It also suggests cooperation with the Secretary of Energy to modify the Energy Star program to include refrigerant systems with high energy efficiency. The Senate recommends the EPA to amend regulations to include hydrofluorocarbons and expand recovery initiatives. It also suggests modifying the Energy Star program with the Secretary of Energy to include high energy efficiency refrigerant systems. The Senate supports US leadership in amending the Montreal Protocol on Ozone-Depleting Substances. The Montreal Protocol aims to transition away from high-GWP HFCs globally. A study on high-GWP HFC alternatives is required within 2 years, evaluating availability and identifying regulatory barriers. The Super Pollutants Act of 2015 prohibits the manufacture of uncharged hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 air conditioning condensing equipment for residential use one year after enactment. The Super Pollutants Act of 2015 bans the production of uncharged hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 air conditioning condensing equipment for residential use. The EPA must create regulations within 180 days to enforce this ban and reduce HCFC-22 consumption allowances accordingly. Additionally, a study will be conducted on R-134a Automotive Air Conditioning Recharge Kits. The EPA will conduct a study to minimize the release of HFC-134a from automotive air conditioning recharge kits when not in use, with a report due to Congress within 1 year. SEC. 7. REDUCTION OF METHANE EMISSIONS. The Secretary of State, Energy, EPA, and Commerce will provide technical guidance to other countries on emissions containment from various sources. They will collaborate with international initiatives and organizations for voluntary reduction efforts. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study to identify equipment with high leak rates in the production value chain and voluntary efforts to replace or monitor them. A report will be submitted to Congress within 1 year. In evaluating gas and oil-related projects for financial support, the heads of the United States Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation should require the use of best technology to detect and repair methane leaks, minimize venting and flaring, and reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants."
