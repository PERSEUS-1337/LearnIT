    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep America's Oil Here Act\". The Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to increase fuel economy standards and establish renewable fuel standards. The administration is accelerating the implementation of these standards to reduce domestic oil consumption. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 aims to increase fuel economy standards and reduce domestic oil consumption. New rules for light-duty vehicles from 2012-2025 will decrease global warming emissions and lower the need for millions of barrels of oil per day by 2030 and 2040. The Federal Government is taking measures to assist economic growth and reduce economic pressures related to high oil prices by increasing domestic oil production. Crude oil production in the United States is at its highest level in 15 years, with expectations for continued growth through 2020. Restrictions on exports of oil produced on public lands are seen as necessary to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of oil and refined products. The Secretary of the Interior can only accept bids for new oil and gas leases on Federal lands if bidders certify that all oil and refined products produced from those leases will only be sold in the United States. The President has the authority to waive certain requirements for oil leases if it is in the national interest and does not increase domestic oil consumption from hostile countries, raise costs for oil refiners, or lead to higher gasoline prices for consumers. The President can waive requirements for oil leases if it is in the national interest and does not increase domestic oil consumption from hostile countries, raise costs for oil refiners, or lead to higher gasoline prices for consumers. Waivers may be granted if there is no net loss of crude oil or refined petroleum products domestically, if a waiver is necessary under the Constitution, a law, or an international agreement, or if there is a standing trade agreement with a North American trading partner allowing for exports consumed in North America. SEC. 5. SUNSET. This Act, including any certification, expires after 10 years. Two years before expiration, reports on the Act's impact on oil production, consumption, prices, and markets are to be submitted to Congress. SEC. 6. REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCT DEFINED. The term \"refined petroleum product\" in this Act includes finished motor gasoline, aviation gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, fuel oil, lubricants, waxes, petroleum coke, and asphalt."
