    "content": "The Act is titled the \"No Federal Funding to Benefit Sanctuary Cities Act\" and aims to protect local and federal law enforcement officers who cooperate to safeguard communities. The \"No Federal Funding to Benefit Sanctuary Cities Act\" designates states and their officials complying with detainers from the Department of Homeland Security as acting on behalf of DHS with full authority. Legal challenges to detentions under these detainers are addressed in legal proceedings. The detainer issued by the Department of Homeland Security under certain sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act absolves states and their officials of liability for complying with the detainer. It also deems the officer, employee, or agent as a federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. The detainer issued by the Department of Homeland Security under specific sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act absolves states and their officials of liability. Section 1346(b) of title 28, United States Code provides the exclusive remedy for the plaintiff, with the United States being substituted as the defendant. This section does not provide immunity to any person who knowingly violates civil or constitutional rights. SEC. 3. SANCTUARY JURISDICTIONS INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDS. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, sanctuary jurisdictions are barred from receiving Federal financial assistance if they have policies that limit sharing information on immigration status or refuse to comply with Department of Homeland Security requests under certain immigration laws. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires compliance with detainers and notification of release. States designated as sanctuary jurisdictions must return federal financial assistance and funds will be reallocated to non-sanctuary states. If a unit of general local government is a sanctuary jurisdiction and receives Federal financial assistance, the funds must be returned to the agency for reallocation to non-sanctuary jurisdictions. If a government in a nonentitlement area is not a sanctuary jurisdiction, the funds must be returned to the Governor for reallocation to other local governments in the state that are not sanctuary jurisdictions."
