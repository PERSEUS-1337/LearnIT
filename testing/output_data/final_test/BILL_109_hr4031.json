    "content": "The \"Nursery and Tropical Fruit Producer Hurricane Relief Act\" provides crop disaster assistance for nursery crop and tropical fruit producers. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide emergency financial assistance to commercial ornamental nursery, fernery, and tropical fruit producers in disaster counties for eligible inventory losses due to Hurricanes Dennis, Katrina, or Rita. To be considered a commercial nursery or fernery operation, the producer must be registered in the state where they conduct business. Eligible inventory includes various crops for sale, but excludes edible varieties, plants for reforestation, or crops that are not insurable. Losses and payments for nursery and fernery producers are calculated accordingly. For nursery and fernery producers, inventory losses are calculated individually for each location without offsetting losses between different sites. Payment amounts are based on the difference between pre-disaster and post-disaster inventory values, using wholesale prices and not exceeding specified price limits. The USDA provides payment assistance to eligible plant and tropical fruit producers for crop losses. Payment amounts are calculated based on the affected acres, payment rate, and the producer's share of the crop. There is a payment limitation of $80,000 per person. Additionally, the Secretary offers debris-removal assistance using necessary funds from the Commodity Credit. The Commodity Credit Corporation provides emergency financial assistance to ornamental nursery and fernery producers in disaster counties affected by hurricanes for debris removal costs.
