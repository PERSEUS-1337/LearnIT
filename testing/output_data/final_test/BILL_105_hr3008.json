    "content": "The \"Notch Fairness Act of 1997\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. The \"Notch Fairness Act of 1997\" amends Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act to include a transitional increase amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B). This increase is calculated based on the excess under former law. The product is calculated by multiplying the excess under former law by the applicable percentage determined by a table based on the year of eligibility for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for old-age insurance benefits eligibility ranges from 55 percent in 1979 to 3 percent in 1987. In 1987, the old-age insurance benefits eligibility percentage was 3 percent, which increased to 5 percent in 1988. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between an individual's applicable former law primary insurance amount and the amount calculated under current law without certain provisions. The 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' is the amount that would be an individual's primary insurance amount if calculated under the law in effect in December 1978. The amount of an individual's primary insurance is determined by specific provisions under section 215(a) and (b) as in effect in December 1978, with modifications as provided. Subsection (b)(4) does not apply, and only certain calendar years after 1950 are considered for computation base years. The primary insurance amount for an individual is determined by specific provisions, with modifications, and certain calendar years are considered for computation. The individual's wages and self-employment income are significant. Paragraphs (F) and (G) apply to individuals to ensure a higher primary insurance amount. The primary insurance amount of an individual can be determined by filing an election with the Commissioner of Social Security. The election must be filed in the prescribed form and manner. If the individual dies before filing the election, it can be filed by another beneficiary entitled to benefits. Any election filed after December 31, 1998, will be null and void. Upon receipt of a timely election, the Commissioner will certify it to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment. The Treasury will pay an individual $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The first payment must be made by July 1, 1999. If a deceased individual has not filed an election, beneficiaries can file on their behalf by December 31, 1998. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay beneficiaries $5,000 in 4 annual installments from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The first payment must be made by July 1, 1999. The amendments made by this Act will be effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977. Monthly benefits under title II of the Social Security Act will not increase due to these amendments before July 1999. The amendments will only apply to benefits payable after fiscal year 2002. The spending limits for budget authority and outlays under this Act are extended to fiscal year 2003. Individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act for June 1999 may have their benefits recomputed to reflect benefit increases based on specific sections of the Act. The Commissioner of Social Security will recompute the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act for June 1999, taking into account the amendments made by the Act. The legislation requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to decrease discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 1999 through 2002 to offset the increase in direct spending resulting from the enactment of the legislation. The decrease in spending limits will be in the nondefense category for fiscal year 1999 and in the discretionary category for all other fiscal years. This decrease will be treated as direct spending legislation decreasing the deficit for each fiscal year."
