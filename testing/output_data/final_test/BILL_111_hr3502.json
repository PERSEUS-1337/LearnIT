    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Mitochondrial Medicine Research and Treatment Enhancement Act\". It includes findings and purpose statements. Mitochondrial disease is a group of diseases caused by defects in mitochondria, leading to a lack of energy production and cell dysfunction. There are over 40 identified mitochondrial diseases, with many more yet to be discovered. These diseases were first recognized in the late 1960s and can affect individuals of any age, with varying mortality rates. Mitochondrial disease primarily affects children, with symptoms appearing before age five. Approximately 80 percent of affected children do not survive beyond the age of 20. It is associated with various neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, and autism, as well as diseases related to aging, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Mitochondrial disease is commonly caused by genetic mutations in nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial diseases can be caused by genetic mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, as well as environmental factors like medications. Research estimates that 1 in 4,000 children will develop a mitochondrial disease by age 10, with 1,000-2,000 new cases in the US annually. While 1 in 200 children are born with both normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA, it is unknown how many will develop the disease. Currently, there are no cures for mitochondrial diseases. The National Institutes of Health is increasing its focus on mitochondrial disease and dysfunction, sponsoring activities to advance mitochondrial medicine. The purpose of this Act is to promote research for better understanding and treatment of mitochondrial disease. The National Institutes of Health is enhancing research and treatment activities related to mitochondrial medicine by establishing an Office of Mitochondrial Medicine. The Office of Mitochondrial Medicine is established within the NIH to facilitate research into mitochondrial medicine, improve coordination among research institutes, and provide training to research scientists. The Office of Mitochondrial Medicine at NIH aims to enhance research, coordinate institutes, and offer training in mitochondrial medicine. This includes training for research scientists and healthcare providers, establishing scientific review groups, and consulting with other NIH directors. The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall update the plan for mitochondrial medicine research biennially. Additionally, the Director will annually award research grants for mitochondrial medicine. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will award grants for integrated research programs and planning activities related to mitochondrial medicine. Additionally, grants may be awarded to establish Mitochondrial Medicine Centers of Excellence for interdisciplinary research and training in this field. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will establish a national registry for medical information of patients with mitochondrial disease. This includes training programs for research scientists and health professionals, continuing education for healthcare professionals, and providing living stipends for those enrolled in mitochondrial research training programs. The Director will establish a national biorepository for tissues and DNA from patients with mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial medicine research plan to be developed within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
