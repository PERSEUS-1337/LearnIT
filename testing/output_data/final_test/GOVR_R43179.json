    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers benefits such as medical care, disability compensation, education, and home loan guarantees to eligible veterans. The VA operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), with the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) handling compensation, pensions, and education assistance, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintaining veterans' cemeteries and providing burial benefits. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services, medical research programs, and education and training for healthcare professionals. It also serves as a backup to the Department of Defense medical system during emergencies and supports the National Disaster Medical System. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services, medical research programs, and education and training for healthcare professionals. It serves as a backup to the Department of Defense medical system during emergencies and supports the National Disaster Medical System. VA health care eligibility is based on military service and service-connected disabilities. Enrolled veterans may receive care from sources other than the VA, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, or TRICARE. VA-enrolled veterans do not pay premiums for care but may have out-of-pocket costs for certain conditions. In FY2013, around 8.9 million out of 22.2 million living veterans were enrolled in the VA health care system. The total number of enrollees increased by 6.6% from FY2010 to FY2013. VA anticipated treating approximately 5.75 million unique veteran patients in FY2013, and estimates treating about 5.8 million in FY2014. Additionally, VA expects to treat over 674,000 OEF, OIF, and OND veterans in FY2014, representing about 10.4% of the overall patients served by the VA. VHA also provides medical care to non-veterans, with an expected increase of almost 18,000 in FY2014. The VHA is expected to treat nearly 6.5 million patients in 2014, including non-veterans, with a 1.3% increase from FY2013. The number of outpatient visits is projected to reach 95.5 million in 2014. The report focuses on appropriations for VHA and provides an overview of VA's budget for FY2013 and the President's request for FY2014. The FY2013 VHA budget summary includes information on advance appropriations for three VHA accounts. Recent legislative developments for the FY2014 VHA budget are also discussed. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts from 2010 to 2014 provided advance appropriations for VHA accounts in subsequent fiscal years. Advance appropriations are scored as new budget authority when funds become available for obligation, not when enacted. Advance appropriations for VHA accounts are scored as new budget authority when funds become available for obligation, not when enacted. Funding tables in the report show advance appropriations under a separate memorandum and in the corresponding fiscal year column. Funding for FY2013 includes budget authority authorized in P.L. 112-74 and augmented by supplemental funding from other acts. The VA budget includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. Mandatory accounts fund various benefits and services, while discretionary accounts fund medical care, research, construction, and operating expenses. Funding for each fiscal year does not include advance appropriations for the following year. In FY2013, the VA budget authority was $134.1 billion, with 46% ($61.2 billion) being discretionary and 54% ($72.9 billion) mandatory. Discretionary funding mainly supported VA health care programs, while mandatory funding went towards disability compensation and pension programs. For FY2014, the President's budget request was $147.9 billion, with $63.5 billion discretionary and $84.5 billion mandatory. The VA formulates its budget request approximately 10 months before the President submits it to Congress. The budget request is based on the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM), which estimates the resources needed to meet the demand for health care services for enrolled veterans. The model considers the projected number of veterans enrolled, utilization of services, and unit cost of providing care. Adjustments are made to account for VA healthcare characteristics and veteran demographics. The VA uses the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) to estimate resources for healthcare services for enrolled veterans. The model considers veteran demographics, utilization rates, and economic factors. VHA updates the estimates annually to incorporate the latest data for budget requests. In FY2004, Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure to provide better oversight and accurate accounting of funds. The VHA is funded through four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care for veterans. The medical services account covers expenses for furnishing inpatient and outpatient care and treatment of veterans and certain dependents, including care in non-VA facilities, outpatient care on a fee basis, medical supplies, salaries of employees under Title 38, hospital food service operations, aid to state veterans' homes, and support services for family caregivers of veterans. Funding for biomedical engineering services was transferred from the medical facilities account to this account in FY2013. The medical services account covers expenses for providing care to veterans and dependents, including outpatient care, medical supplies, and support services. Funding for biomedical engineering services was transferred to this account in FY2013 and continued in FY2014 through the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill. This account supports the management and administration of VA health care facilities, including medical centers, outpatient clinics, and Vet Centers. The medical facilities account funds expenses for operations and maintenance of VHA's infrastructure, including utilities, administrative expenses, construction projects, leases, laundry services, and more. The medical and prosthetic research program focuses on research for veterans' healthcare needs, funding various types of research such as clinical trials and centers of excellence. VA researchers receive funding from various sources including the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and private sources. Unlike other federal agencies, VA's research program is intramural, conducted by VA investigators at VA facilities. Congress allows VHA to bill some veterans and health care insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover the cost of medical services for veterans. The VA health care facility collects funds from first and third-party bills to cover the cost of medical services for veterans. The Administration is proposing legislative changes to increase collections, including disclosing patient records to private health insurance plans for reimbursement purposes. The President's FY2013 budget request for the VA included $135.8 billion in budget authority, with $53.3 billion allocated for VHA. This represented a 4.1% increase over FY2012 appropriations, with funding for medical services, support, facilities, and research accounts. The proposal aims to allow VHA to collect charges for treating veterans' nonservice-connected conditions. The President's budget requested $54.5 billion in advance appropriations for VHA for FY2014, with a supplemental request of $236.6 million for VA, including $27 million for VHA. Congress did not pass a regular MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2013 and funded most of VA through a six-month continuing resolution. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2) provided $236.6 million in supplemental funding for the VA, including $27 million for VHA. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) signed into law on March 26, 2013, provided $133.9 billion in budget authority for the VA. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided approximately $72.9 billion in mandatory funding and $61 billion in discretionary funding, with $53.3 billion allocated for VHA in FY2013. Additionally, P.L. 113-6 included $54.5 billion in advance appropriations for medical care accounts for FY2014. Section 3001 in Division G of the act mandated a 0.1% across-the-board rescission for discretionary VA accounts in FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided funding for VA accounts in FY2013, with a 0.1% across-the-board rescission mandated. Subsequent calculations by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required additional rescissions of 0.032% for security budget authority and 0.2% for nonsecurity budget authority. The President's FY2014 budget request was submitted to Congress on April 10, 2013, seeking $147.9 billion. The FY2014 President's Budget requests $147.9 billion for the VA, with $157.5 million additional funding for medical services. The increased funding reflects the costs of implementing healthcare acts. The President is asking for $55.2 billion for VHA in FY2014, allocated across various accounts. The President's budget requests $55.6 billion in advance appropriations for medical care in FY2015. The House Budget Committee reported a budget resolution calling for $145.7 billion in budget authority for Veterans Benefits and Services in FY2014. In FY2014, there was $63.1 billion in authority and outlays, with a 3.1% increase from the previous year. Mandatory spending totaled $82.4 billion in authority and $82.3 billion in outlays. The budget resolution authorizes $55.483 billion for FY2015 in advance appropriations for medical care. The President's budget request for FY2015 is $55.6 billion for medical care. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution for veterans' health-care needs, setting FY 2014 levels at $145.5 billion for budget authority and $145.3 billion for outlays. The resolution also includes $1.688 trillion in budget authority and $1.68 trillion in outlays for Veterans Benefits and Services from FY 2014-2023. Discretionary spending for FY 2014 is set at $63.1 billion in budget authority and $62.9 billion in outlays. The House Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee approved a Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2014, with a total of $147.6 billion proposed for the VA. This includes $84.5 billion for mandatory programs and $63.1 billion for discretionary programs. H.R. 2216 proposes $54.9 billion for VHA for FY2014. The House-passed measure for FY2014 includes $54.9 billion for VHA, with funding allocated to medical services, medical support and compliance, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The proposal does not include additional funding requested by the President, but suggests rescinding $156.0 million from the FY2014 VHA amount provided in FY2013. Additionally, H.R. 2216 proposes $55.6 billion in advance FY2015 funding for various VHA accounts. The Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee approved the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2014, totaling $147.9 billion, with $84.5 billion for mandatory programs and $63.5 billion for discretionary programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include the full additional funding requested by the President for medical services, proposing a $25 million increase instead. The committee raised concerns about the lack of details in the budget request regarding data and assumptions in the actuarial model projection. The Committee cannot accurately assess the merits of an additional request without the modified data and assumptions in the updated actuarial model projection. The Department routinely carries forward significant funds from one fiscal year to the next, and any funding carried forward from FY2013 should be applied to unanticipated needs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved an additional $100 million for the medical facilities account for FY2014 for nonrecurring maintenance projects. Congress was unable to complete action on FY2014 appropriation acts before the new fiscal year, leading to a partial government shutdown. In 2013, a partial government shutdown occurred due to a lapse in funding. Congress passed a temporary CR on October 16, 2013, to reopen the government. The CR funded most of the VA until January 15, 2014. An extension was granted through January 18 for legislative consideration. On January 17, 2014, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, which included the MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2014, providing $147.9 billion for the VA. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2014 allocates $147.9 billion for VA programs in FY2014, with $55.1 billion for VHA. This includes funding for medical services, facilities, and research accounts. Additional funding of $40 million for medical services and $85 million for medical facilities is provided to address maintenance needs at VA hospitals and clinics. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2014 provides $55.6 billion in advance appropriations for FY2015 for three VHA accounts. Additionally, P.L. 113-76 rescinds $50 million from the FY2014 VHA accounts."
