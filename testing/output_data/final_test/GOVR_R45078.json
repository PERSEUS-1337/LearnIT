    "content": "Expulsion is the process by which a house of Congress may remove one of its Members, after the Member has been duly elected and seated. Unlike exclusion, which occurs when a body of Congress refuses to seat a Member-elect, expulsion requires a two-thirds majority vote. The Supreme Court has clarified that exclusion and expulsion serve different purposes and happen at different times. In Powell v. McCormack, the Court examined the constitutionality of excluding Representative Adam Clayton Powell from the House of Representatives. The investigation of expenditures authorized by Powell during the 89th Congress found that he engaged in improper activities, including deceiving House authorities and directing illegal payments to his wife. The House refused to administer the oath of office to Powell at the start of the 90th Congress. A Select Committee recommended Powell be seated as a Member and disciplined, but the House voted to exclude him instead. Powell sued for reinstatement, and the Supreme Court held that... The Supreme Court ruled that Powell's exclusion from Congress was unconstitutional, stating that exclusion and expulsion are different actions. While Congress has broad authority over expulsion, its authority over exclusion is limited to specific qualifications. Despite a two-thirds majority vote to exclude Powell, it could not substitute for expulsion. Understanding the Expulsion Clause requires examining its text, historical background, limited judicial interpretations, and potential limitations by other constitutional provisions. The Expulsion Clause in the Constitution allows each House to punish members for disorderly behavior and expel them with a two-thirds majority vote. This standard is generally based on the number of members present and voting, similar to the process for removing officials in other branches of government. The Expulsion Clause in the Constitution allows Congress to remove officials in the executive and judicial branches through impeachment. The origins of this power stem from the practices of the English Parliament, where expulsion was done more liberally. There were no established standards for expulsion, leading to hundreds of members being expelled for various reasons before the 19th century. Before the 19th century, parliamentary expulsions in England were carried out for reasons such as publishing slanderous writings or treason, often to remove unpopular or dissenting legislators. An influential case was that of John Wilkes, a Member of Parliament who criticized the King's peace treaty with France in 1763. Wilkes was expelled, arrested, and later reelected but faced multiple expulsions and exclusions from Parliament before finally being allowed to serve in 1774. The Wilkes case in England had a significant impact on the American colonies, leading to fewer expulsions in state legislatures after the Revolution. This case influenced constitutional restrictions on expulsion powers, including fixed qualifications for legislators and a two-thirds majority requirement for expulsion. The Expulsion Clause in the House and Senate requires a two-thirds supermajority to expel a Member, with no significant debate at the Constitutional Convention. Early drafts distinguished between expulsion and punishment for \"disorderly behavior,\" with the two-thirds requirement added later by James Madison for the importance of such a decision. No specific misconduct was mentioned during the Convention discussions. The Founders did not specify the type of misconduct that would warrant expulsion at the Constitutional Convention. The key barrier to abuse of the expulsion power was seen as the requirement of a supermajority approval by Congress, rather than defining specific conduct for expulsion. The U.S. Supreme Court has not directly ruled on the expulsion of a Member of Congress, but has mentioned that expulsion can occur for conduct inconsistent with a member's trust and duty. The U.S. Supreme Court has not directly ruled on the expulsion of a Member of Congress, but has mentioned that expulsion can occur for conduct inconsistent with a member's trust and duty. The Court emphasized that the House and Senate have exclusive power to expel members, and judicial precedent on the Expulsion Clause is limited due to the political question doctrine. This doctrine prevents courts from deciding cases involving \"political questions\" where there is a lack of judicially manageable standards. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the broad power of Congress to discipline its members through expulsion, separate from civil or criminal liability. The Court has declined to interfere with Congress's discretion in exercising this power, recognizing it as essential for maintaining the integrity and dignity of the legislative body. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's broad power to discipline its members through expulsion, with standards at the \"almost unbridled discretion\" of Congress. Members facing legislative discipline are judged without specific standards or a right of review. In Powell v. McCormack, the Court found that the House cannot exclude a duly elected Member who meets all constitutional requirements. In a concurring opinion, Justice William O. Douglas noted that no justiciable controversy would be presented in an expulsion case. Members of Congress expelled have not challenged the decision in court, with lower courts citing separation of powers concerns. For example, in United States v. Traficant, a Member of the House of Representatives was expelled after being convicted of criminal charges and violating internal rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected a Member's claim of double jeopardy in facing both criminal trial and legislative discipline. The court ruled that both branches have the authority to punish Members independently. In a similar case, a Member censured by the House sought judicial review but was denied due to separation of powers concerns. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected a Member's lawsuit challenging the House's disciplinary action, citing the political question doctrine and the Expulsion Clause's discretionary power. Arguments exist that the Constitution may impose constraints on expulsion power that could be justiciable. Constraints on the expulsion power may raise justiciable matters, such as conflicts with other constitutional provisions like the right of a Member's constituency to choose their representative. This issue arises when a Member is considered for expulsion due to pre-election misconduct known to the voters. The House or Senate could potentially \"abuse its high prerogative\" in such cases. The expulsion power of the House or Senate may face constraints related to conflicts with constitutional provisions, such as the right of a Member's constituency to choose their representative. This could lead to questions about whether external constraints, like individual rights provisions, limit the exercise of the expulsion power. For instance, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause's equal protection component could prevent discriminatory expulsion decisions. The expulsion power of the House and Senate may be limited by constitutional provisions, such as preventing discriminatory expulsion decisions based on a Member's race. Judicial review could be warranted in cases where expulsion functions as an exclusion of a Member through the imposition of additional qualifications, violating the Supreme Court's precedent in Powell. For example, expelling a new Member for a previous criminal conviction could be seen as adding a non-constitutional qualification for election to Congress. The Powell Court distinguished between exclusion and expulsion, stating that they are not interchangeable. The Court deferred to the House in determining the constitutional provision being used, rejecting the idea of equating exclusion with expulsion. The House Resolution No. 278 was deemed an exclusion proceeding, not an expulsion. The Court distinguished between exclusion and expulsion, emphasizing that they are not the same. Congress's interpretation of its expulsion power may influence the understanding of the Expulsion Clause due to limited historical evidence and judicial precedent. The interpretation of Congress's expulsion power is crucial in understanding the Expulsion Clause. Historical practice is often considered in interpreting constitutional provisions, but the extent of its influence depends on how long settled and established the practice is. The margins of the House and Senate's expulsion power remain unsettled, especially regarding expelling a Member for conduct before their current term. The expulsion power of Congress is important in interpreting the Expulsion Clause. Historical practice may influence how the expulsion power is understood, even though expulsion cases are rare. 20 Members of Congress have been expelled in total, with 5 from the House and 15 from the Senate. This historical practice may guide future decisions on expelling Members. Expulsion from Congress is not solely based on historical grounds, but rather at the discretion of the House or Senate. Legal commentary suggests that expulsion should be done judiciously and with strict justice. The primary reason for expulsion has been disloyalty to the United States. Expulsion from Congress is often due to disloyalty to the United States. The earliest expulsion case in 1797 involved a Senator who planned an attack on Spanish territories for personal gain. The majority of expulsion cases for disloyalty occurred during the secession of Confederate states in the Civil War. During the Civil War, the Senate expelled 10 Members representing seceded states for failing to appear and allegedly conspiring against the Union. Expulsions post-Civil War were rare until recent cases in the House involving broader misconduct. The two most recent expulsions from the House involved Members convicted of criminal charges related to public corruption, including bribery, illegal gratuities, obstruction of justice, and racketeering. These expulsions occurred in 1980 and 2002, marking rare instances of expulsion for misconduct beyond disloyalty to the country. In recent cases, there have been calls for expulsion or preliminary proceedings towards potential expulsion of Members, but they ended up resigning before a formal decision was made. It is uncertain how much importance should be given to such cases or which cases qualify as relevant for considering expulsion. Members have resigned facing formal expulsion inquiries or recommendations for expulsion due to misconduct during their time in office. For example, in 1995, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics recommended expelling a Member for sexual misconduct, misuse of staff, and interference with investigations. In the House, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct recommended expelling a Member for conduct violations that led to criminal convictions. The Expulsion Clause allows for the House and Senate to expel Members for misconduct during their term, but it is unclear if prior conduct can be grounds for expulsion. Past practices show inconsistency in expulsions for prior misconduct, with no clear interpretation on the matter. The House and Senate may expel Members for misconduct occurring before an election, but there is inconsistency in their approach. There is evidence of a reluctance to expel Members for prior conduct, with justification based more on policy than constitutional authority. The justification for not expelling Members for prior misconduct is based on respecting the electoral decisions of the voting public and deference to the popular will. This view aligns with James Madison's belief in \"frequent elections\" ensuring virtuous legislators and Justice Joseph Story's early perspective on the expulsion power. Joseph Story believed that while the expulsion power was necessary for the integrity of each house, it should be used sparingly and with the approval of a two-thirds majority. Congress's attempt to balance this power with the will of the people lacks a clear constitutional basis, as seen in a 1914 House Judiciary Report. The House's power to expel members is essential to maintain integrity, but should be used sparingly and with caution. It should only be invoked in extreme cases of misconduct, with great circumspection. This power is separate from policy considerations and should be exercised judiciously. The House's power to expel members should be used sparingly and with caution, only in extreme cases of misconduct. There is ambiguity regarding whether expulsion can be applied to misconduct known before a Member's election, with concerns about exceeding constitutional authority by imposing House standards over those of the constituency. The House has explored this issue more extensively than the Senate. The House has explored the issue of expelling members more thoroughly than the Senate. Speaker John G. Carlisle stated in 1884 that the House cannot punish a Member for offenses committed before their election. There is debate on whether a Member can be expelled for prior misconduct, as seen in the differing conclusions drawn by House committees in 1872. The House had the authority to expel Members for misconduct that occurred before their election, as seen in the case of Ames and Brooks in the Credit Mobilier scandal. The committee found that there was no restriction on when an offense warranting expulsion had to occur, stating that the House could expel a Member without any reason at all if two-thirds agreed. The committee discussed the House's power to expel Members for misconduct, including overriding the will of a Member's constituency if they elected someone with questionable conduct. They believe that a constituency would not knowingly elect someone guilty of moral turpitude, and the House has the right to protect itself by expelling such Members. The House Judiciary Committee concluded that the House has limited power to expel Members, stating that as long as a Member's actions are not disorderly or unfit, expulsion is not justified. The Committee emphasized the importance of respecting the constituency's choice of Representatives. Despite this, the House decided to censure rather than expel Ames and Brooks. The House has viewed itself as lacking power to expel a Member for misconduct occurring before their last election, as shown in various examples. The House Rules Manual previously stated a distrust in punishing such cases, but no longer does. In 1925, a House committee noted that precedents suggest the House will not expel a Member for actions prior to their current term. The House has a longstanding tradition of not expelling Members for misconduct that occurred before their election. This principle has been supported by House precedents and was also referenced in the Supreme Court case Powell. The Court did not consider Powell's exclusion as an expulsion, as Members believed restrictions on expelling a Member for past conduct applied to their power. This indicates the Court did not rule on the House's authority to expel for past misconduct. In 1979, a House committee recommended censuring Charles C. Diggs, Jr., for a criminal kickback scheme involving his congressional employees. The committee noted the House's jurisdiction to inquire into misconduct prior to a Member's last election and impose disciplinary sanctions short of expulsion. The committee did not definitively state whether expulsion could be applied to prior misconduct but deemed it unwise to express an opinion on the matter. The House committee recommended censuring Charles C. Diggs, Jr. for a kickback scheme involving his employees. It was deemed unwise to express an opinion on the House's power to expel for prior misconduct. In a similar case, Raymond F. Lederer was recommended for expulsion for misconduct before his reelection, as voters were not fully aware of his offenses at the time of his reelection. The Senate's consideration of expulsion for prior misconduct is less developed than in the House, with limited practice suggesting no clearly established view on expelling a Member for conduct before their election. In 1807, John Quincy Adams emphasized the Senate's broad expulsion power, requiring a two-thirds majority for expulsion as a safeguard against legislative discretion abuse. The Senate's consideration of expulsion for prior misconduct is less developed than in the House, with limited practice suggesting no clearly established view on expelling a Member for conduct before their election. In 1807, John Quincy Adams emphasized the Senate's broad expulsion power, requiring a two-thirds majority for expulsion as a safeguard against legislative discretion abuse. The report also suggested that whether the public was aware of the misconduct was significant in asserting that expulsion was the appropriate remedy when misconduct was suddenly revealed to the world. Other Senate precedents suggest that the timing of the misconduct should be viewed as one of many factors in determining whether expulsion is appropriate. For example, allegations were made against Senator-elect Arthur R. Gould for bribery in connection with a Canadian railroad contract that occurred 15 years earlier, but the Senate committee recommended disregarding all charges. The Senate's expulsion power for prior misconduct is less established compared to the House. In a case involving Senator William Langer, allegations of misconduct led to a recommendation for exclusion, but the full Senate disregarded the charges. The committee emphasized that expulsion for offenses before election depends on the specific circumstances of each case. The Senate's investigation into Senator Langer recommended his exclusion due to lacking \"moral fitness\" but noted the absence of authority to expel him. The report concluded that expulsion can only occur for offenses committed during membership. However, the Senate retains the right to expel a Member for unknown prior misconduct, as seen in the case of Senator Packwood in 1995. The Senate Ethics Committee recommended expelling Senator Packwood for various allegations, including sexual misconduct dating back to 1969, uncovered after his 1992 reelection. The Committee report acknowledged the Senate's broad expulsion power, distinguishing it from censure. The Senate Ethics Committee recommended expelling Senator Packwood for various allegations, including sexual misconduct dating back to 1969, uncovered after his 1992 reelection. The report noted that historically, neither House of Congress has abdicated its ability to punish a Member in the form of censure for prior misconduct. The Senate report cited a past expulsion case where the Senate did not act on a specific charge since it was to have been taken previously to the election of the Senator. Both bodies have been inconsistent in their views on the expulsion power's application to conduct occurring prior to a Member's last election. Key factors for consideration include whether the Member's constituency had knowledge of the misconduct. The Constitution grants the House and Senate the authority to expel members with a two-thirds majority vote. Historical practice shows that the expulsion power is not clearly defined, especially regarding the timing and nature of conduct that justifies expulsion. The exercise of restraint in expulsion cases is more of a policy choice than a constitutional restriction, based on respect for the democratic system. Historical practice suggests that debates over the expulsion power revolve around preserving the integrity of a house versus upholding the results of a democratic election."
