    "content": "Most provisions for expanding the income tax base are on the tax expenditure list by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which includes over 200 separate tax provisions. Tax expenditures result from special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential tax rates, or deferrals. Some potential base broadening provisions, like deductions for moving expenses and business entertainment, are not on the list. Tax expenditures do not cover exclusions like SNAP or Medicaid, but they provide a good inventory of tax provisions. Tax expenditures are a good inventory of potential sources for tax base broadening, developed to show they can substitute direct spending. They are categorized into functional budget categories, with a large portion falling under housing and commerce. However, this organization can lead to portions of a tax provision appearing in different categories. For example, the deduction for charitable contributions is estimated separately for health, education, and other recipients. Tax expenditures are classified based on economic behaviors they affect, not budget categories. They are divided into seven categories: saving, business investment, consumption, owner-occupied housing, labor supply, government programs, and structural. Consumption-related provisions mainly focus on health, education, and charity. Consumption-related provisions in tax expenditures fall into three main categories: health, education, and charity. JCT's revenue loss estimates were calculated assuming the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and 2009 tax cuts in 2012. The estimated revenue loss for each category is shown in Table 1, along with the share of total revenue loss. An adjustment is provided for provisions that would be reinstated if the Bush tax cuts and 2009 provisions were extended. This adjustment does not consider changes in tax rates and includes provisions related to child credit, education, earned income credit, and lower rates on dividends. Allocating provisions to these categories is complex. Allocating provisions to seven basic categories is complex. Owner-occupied housing subsidies impact investment returns and housing consumption costs. Provisions related to saving and consumption often involve excluding employer-provided benefits, affecting labor supply and savings returns. Government programs involve shifting money between categories, with some programs impacting savings indirectly. The property tax deduction in owner-occupied housing is considered an investment. Savings and business provisions reducing tax on capital make up a significant portion of tax expenditures. There is a debate on lowering the tax burden on capital income, which could complicate income tax reform. Provisions reducing tax on labor income make up a smaller share, despite capital income being smaller than labor income. The earned income credit makes up two-thirds of labor supply tax expenditures. The top 20 tax expenditures, including employee health insurance and pensions, account for nearly 90% of the total cost. The top 10 expenditures make up 70% of the total cost. The 2001-2003 Bush tax cuts and the 2009 tax cuts expiring in 2012 include provisions such as the child credit and lower rates for dividends. Tax expenditures can distort behavior but may be justified for economic policy goals. Tax expenditures in different categories are analyzed for their impact on economic efficiency, with a focus on retirement savings. Pensions receive favorable tax treatment, with employer contributions excluded from income and tax deferred savings plans allowing deductions for employee contributions. Pensions can be defined benefit or defined contribution plans, with self-employed individuals also eligible. The overall effect of pension tax treatment is equivalent to a tax exemption or a negative/positive tax rate depending on retirement tax rates. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) offer tax advantages such as deferred taxes on investment earnings and deductions for contributions. There are traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs, with high-income earners facing phase-outs for new contributions. Traditional IRAs are similar to pension plans, while Roth IRAs provide tax-free earnings. Roth IRAs are similar to tax exempt bonds in that earnings are not taxed, with no deduction for contributions or tax on benefits. High-income taxpayers can invest in non-deductible IRAs, with tax deferred until benefits are received. There is a small savers' credit for lower-income taxpayers contributing to a retirement plan. Inside buildup on life insurance and annuities is not taxed, and death benefits from life insurance are also tax-free. Capital gains are subject to a lower rate, currently 15% but scheduled to rise to 20% after 2012. The capital gains tax rate is currently 15%, scheduled to rise to 20% after 2012. Assets held until death are not taxed on the gain accrued during the decedent's lifetime. Dividends are also subject to a 15% rate, but may be taxed as ordinary income after 2012. Extending the Bush tax cuts would keep the capital gains and dividend rates at 15%. Some economists debate whether preferential treatment of capital gains in the tax system is desirable. They argue for a tax system that does not tax investment returns, with some favoring a consumption tax. Eliminating tax expenditures and lowering rates could increase the average tax rate for capital, but not necessarily the marginal tax rate. Pensions and IRAs may become less attractive due to tax benefits with ceilings. The impact of tax reductions on savings is unclear, with evidence suggesting they may not have a significant effect. The evidence suggests that tax reductions do not have a significant effect on savings and investment. The pattern of savings is influenced by income effects, with incentives for retirement savings being driven by psychological and advertising reasons. Individuals may require upfront tax benefits and penalties to prevent raiding their retirement plans. The evidence suggests that tax reductions do not significantly impact savings and investment. Default plan features like automatic enrollment in pension and 401(k) plans can increase participation. However, tax benefits may disproportionately benefit high-income individuals. One way to reduce revenue loss is to limit total dollar contributions to defined contribution plans. This could increase national saving without reducing private saving, as high-income individuals tend to max out their pension contributions. A reduced capital gains tax rate may benefit higher incomes, as gains are taxed only upon realization, leading to a lock-in effect. Realizations decline when the tax rate increases, resulting in a revenue loss. Taxing capital gains as ordinary income could only recoup a small portion of this loss in the long run. Research suggests that taxing capital gains as ordinary income could result in a revenue gain of $55 billion, but current scoring assumptions may prevent this from being fully realized during congressional debate. Heirs benefit from an exclusion of gains at death by using the value at the time of death as the basis for determining capital gains. The value at the time of death is used to determine capital gains, effectively resetting gains to zero. Treating death as a realization event could lead to the sale of assets to pay taxes, but this has never been proposed. Lower rates for dividends aim to reduce double taxation of corporate equity income. The treatment of capital gains and dividends in relation to corporate tax revisions is discussed, with a focus on the potential impact of cutting corporate rates below individual rates. This could lead to the corporate form being used as a tax shelter, especially with lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends. However, differential rates may encourage tax sheltering to convert ordinary income into capital gains, such as in the case of carried interest for investment managers. The proposal to treat certain income as ordinary income could generate $1.7 billion in revenue for FY2013. Accelerated depreciation is a significant individual business provision that ranks in the top 20. Coordinating changes in accelerated depreciation with corporate tax reform is crucial, as it affects investment and the effective tax rate on investment. Reducing the corporate tax rate has a larger windfall gain than the windfall loss from reducing depreciation, leading to a rise in the effective tax rate on investment. The mortgage interest deduction, property tax deduction, and capital gains tax exemption for owner-occupied housing are significant tax expenditures totaling $144.2 billion. The mortgage interest deduction accounts for 65% of these incentives, while the capital gains exclusion and property tax deduction each account for 17.5%. These provisions aim to reduce the cost of acquiring, maintaining, and selling a home. The mortgage interest deduction, property tax deduction, and capital gains tax exemption for owner-occupied housing account for significant tax expenditures. The exclusion of net imputed rental income also subsidizes owner-occupied housing, providing additional tax benefits beyond just deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes. Taxing imputed rent would pose administrative and valuation challenges. The mortgage interest deduction is subject to a limit of $1 million for acquiring or improving a home, with additional deductions for home equity loans and second homes. The deduction for interest other than mortgage interest was eliminated in the 1986 tax reform act. Three questions are addressed regarding the tax provisions: should the government promote home ownership, are the tax subsidies effective in achieving that goal, and should imputed rent be taxed. Homeownership subsidies are justified if there is a housing shortage in private markets due to external effects or market imperfections. Subsidies are often justified for wealth accumulation and positive neighborhood contributions. Research suggests homeownership may not necessarily improve children's welfare when controlling for other factors. Recent research suggests that homeownership subsidies may not necessarily improve children's welfare when controlling for other factors. Homeownership can lead to wealth accumulation and positive neighborhood contributions, but it can also have negative effects such as adopting exclusionary policies that restrict housing supply and resist racial integration. Homeownership subsidies may lead to negative effects like resisting racial integration, reducing job creation, and causing environmental damage by promoting overconsumption of housing and moving away from high density areas. This can also result in less portfolio diversification, greater risk, and labor immobility, impacting others through social institutions like unemployment insurance. The mortgage interest and property tax deductions may not significantly impact tenure choice or homeownership rates, as evidenced by stable ownership rates despite changes in inflation and tax rates. The major barrier to owning a home is the down payment, rather than tax benefits. The tax deductions for homeownership, such as mortgage interest and property tax deductions, may not significantly impact homeownership rates. The major barrier to owning a home is the down payment, which is not affected by the subsidies. These subsidies tend to benefit wealthier taxpayers and are not well targeted, leading to uncertainty in their effectiveness. Eliminating these subsidies could increase tax revenue. Eliminating subsidies for homeownership, such as mortgage interest and property tax deductions, could increase tax revenue. Suggestions include lowering the $1 million mortgage limit, disallowing home equity loans, and imposing a percentage of income ceiling on property taxes. Limiting deductions for state and local taxes to 2% of adjusted gross income could raise significant revenue. Another proposal is to substitute a credit for the itemized deduction to benefit moderate-income homeowners. The proposal to substitute a credit for the itemized deduction aims to benefit moderate-income homeowners. This change could have a different impact compared to the housing capital gains exclusion, which may not affect tenure and home size choices but could lead to a lock-in effect on capital gains taxes. This could potentially worsen labor immobility and discourage downsizing or switching to rental housing for older individuals. The tax benefit for owner-occupied housing may need to be retained due to limited data on the effect of holding homes until death on tax revenues. Market imperfections in the health sector lead to overconsumption by those with insurance, contributing to the lack of health insurance coverage for many individuals. The health market lacks transparency in pricing, leading to overconsumption. Public policy aims to contain costs and achieve universal health insurance coverage. The largest health tax expenditure, employer-provided health benefits exclusion, encourages excessive purchase of health insurance, contributing to rising costs. Employer plans often lack high deductibles, influenced by the tax subsidy, but help address market failures in insurance coverage. The health legislation passed in 2010 mandates health insurance, constrains premium ranges, and provides subsidies for lower-income families. With universal coverage in place, the justification for encouraging employer health insurance would no longer apply, making the case for taxing these benefits clear. The health legislation passed in 2010 mandates health insurance, constrains premium ranges, and provides subsidies for lower-income families. There are technical challenges to taxing employer health insurance, but a possible policy option could be to lower the ceiling on high cost plans. The exclusion of benefits provided under cafeteria plans would be easier to eliminate. The deduction for health expenses is an itemized deduction for out-of-pocket health expenditures exceeding a percentage of adjusted gross income. The current threshold is 7.5% but will increase to 10% in 2013. The rationale for this deduction is that these expenses are involuntary and reduce the taxpayer's ability to pay taxes. The 10% threshold is high compared to historical standards, and it is unclear if it could be increased further while still achieving the ability-to-pay objective. A deduction for charitable contributions is an itemized deduction subject to market failures due to \"free-rider\" problems. Individual taxpayers may benefit from others' contributions, leading to undersupply of overall giving. The deduction may be questionable economically if contributors give less than the revenue loss, suggesting government grants could be more effective for charitable purposes. The deduction for charitable contributions may lead to undersupply of overall giving due to \"free-rider\" problems. Contributors may receive direct or implicit benefits, with only a small portion going directly to aid those in poverty. Implementing a floor for charitable contributions could increase induced giving per dollar of revenue loss and improve tax compliance. A 2% income floor is estimated to raise $18.7 billion for FY2013. The deduction for charitable contributions with a 2% income floor is projected to raise $18.7 billion for FY2013. About 14% of contributions would no longer have a marginal incentive, but the revenue gain would be 37% of the total tax expenditure. Revising the treatment of appreciated property, especially for high-income groups, could also be considered to increase tax revenue. Tax provisions related to labor supply, such as the earned income tax credit and exclusion of fringe benefits, aim to incentivize work effort. The earned income credit is a significant subsidy for low-income individuals, particularly families with children, helping to offset wage stagnation and payroll tax burdens. However, it may impact labor force participation and hours worked due to benefit phase-outs and implicit taxes as earnings increase. The earned income tax credit incentivizes work effort, especially for low-income individuals with children. It encourages labor force participation of single mothers but has little effect on hours worked. Another provision excludes income earned abroad from U.S. tax, subsidizing employees in low tax jurisdictions without clear economic rationale. Some tax expenditures subsidize government programs, raising questions on the most effective way to achieve their goals. Tax provisions and direct spending are being debated for achieving program goals. The focus is on whether tax exemptions for Medicare and Social Security benefits are necessary for government transfers. Taxing these benefits could reduce the federal deficit or be used to maintain benefit levels. Recipients affected would mostly be moderate income individuals. The debate surrounds taxing Medicare and Social Security benefits to reduce the federal deficit or maintain benefit levels. The recipients affected would mainly be moderate income individuals. Other federal government benefits are also under consideration for taxation, such as military allowances and veteran's benefits. The debate surrounds taxing Medicare and Social Security benefits to reduce the federal deficit or maintain benefit levels for moderate income individuals. The deduction of state and local income taxes and interest on tax exempt bonds raises questions about subsidizing activities in specific states or localities by nation's taxpayers. State and local government spending may benefit federal taxpayers through services like education and care for the poor. State and local government spending tends to benefit their own residents, with tax exempt bonds and income tax deductions being criticized as inefficient subsidies. Reform efforts have targeted these benefits in the past, with suggestions to cap income tax deductions as a percentage of income. Limiting the deduction for all state and local taxes to 2% of adjusted gross income could raise $66 billion in FY2014. Limiting the deduction for all state and local taxes to 2% of adjusted gross income could raise $66 billion in FY2014, compared to $89 billion if the deduction were eliminated altogether. Tax exempt bonds pose issues as the exemption of interest benefits high-income taxpayers, leading to higher after-tax returns for them compared to direct subsidies to states. An initiative to eliminate extra returns on state and local bonds by aligning their yields with taxable bonds has begun with Build America Bonds. The potential change in tax-exempt bonds would mainly affect new bond issues, with limited revenue impact in the short term. The cost of the exemption includes private activity bonds, which benefit businesses by excluding interest for private borrowing, but are restricted to specific uses like sewer facilities and transit. The CBO budget options study suggests a potential revenue gain of $3 billion in FY2013, increasing to $29 billion by FY2021. The tax-exempt interest on state and local bonds is being considered for modification, particularly affecting new bond issues and potentially generating revenue. The largest revenue cost of tax-exempt interest is for hospitals. Coordination with corporate tax reform may be necessary as corporations also purchase these bonds. The discussion focuses on the top 20 tax expenditures, with smaller provisions that could also raise significant tax revenue not being addressed. Table 4 lists 24 provisions with revenue effects of at least $1 billion, totaling $100 billion or 8% of total tax expenditures. These smaller tax expenditures include no provisions for owner-occupied housing and only two related to savings. The largest category is consumption, with health and education accounting for a significant fraction. Most health provisions are extensions of employer health exclusions, while education subsidies are not in the top 20. The tuition tax credit, government programs, and labor supply provisions are among the top 20 education subsidies with relatively small revenue loss. These provisions include exclusions for military allowances, combat pay, and employee fringe benefits aimed at encouraging mass transit or carpooling. The exclusion of miscellaneous employee fringe benefits, such as discounts, parking, and gyms, amounts to $18.2 billion and ranks 16th on the major tax expenditures list. These benefits favor industries where they are prevalent, like retail sales. The production activities deduction for corporations, introduced in 2004, aimed to encourage manufacturing operations in the US. Tax expenditures, initially aimed at corporate manufacturing to promote operations in the US, have been expanded to other industries and unincorporated businesses. These expenditures are often seen as benefiting higher-income taxpayers more due to the progressive nature of the income tax system. However, some tax expenditures are targeted towards lower-income taxpayers. Tax expenditures can impact the distribution of after-tax income, with the Suits progressivity index used to determine if benefits primarily go to upper or lower-income taxpayers. The index ranges from -1 to +1, with negative values indicating regressive benefits for higher-income taxpayers and positive values indicating progressive benefits for lower-income taxpayers. Distributional consequences can also be influenced by tax code features and the nature of the tax expenditure. The Suits index measures the distribution of tax benefits, showing regressive benefits for higher-income taxpayers in the saving category due to their likelihood to save and invest. Higher tax brackets receive greater benefits from reducing taxable income, leading to a disproportionate share of tax benefits for higher-income individuals. Tax benefits for 401(k) contributions vary based on tax bracket, with higher brackets receiving more significant reductions in tax liability. Pension and IRA savings are less regressive due to contribution limits. Housing deductions are available to itemizing taxpayers, with benefits leaning moderately regressive. Itemizing taxpayers span various income levels, with over half of the total amount distributed among them. Tax benefits for 401(k) contributions vary based on tax bracket, with higher brackets receiving more significant reductions in tax liability. Pension and IRA savings are less regressive due to contribution limits. Housing deductions are available to itemizing taxpayers, with benefits leaning moderately regressive. Over half of the total amount deducted is claimed by taxpayers with income over $100,000 due to owning more expensive homes with larger mortgages and higher property taxes. The tax provisions in the consumption category show no consistent pattern in the Suits index. The tax benefit of the charitable contribution deduction is regressive for the same reasons as the mortgage interest deduction. The tax benefit of the deduction for medical expenses is moderately progressive with a Suits index of +0.183 due to the income floor. In 2010, medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income could be deducted, with lower-income households having higher medical expenses relative to their income. Health care expenditures for the poorest 20% of households were 15.4% of their income compared to 3.1% for the richest 20%. The tax benefit of excluding employer-provided health insurance is progressively distributed. The earned income tax credit (EITC) provides progressively distributed tax benefits. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit available to all qualifying taxpayers, regardless of their tax bracket. It is subtracted directly from tax liability and can result in a refund for taxpayers with no tax liability. The EITC is available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income below a certain level and is not dependent on itemizing deductions. Additionally, government tax expenditures can be either progressive or regressive, with tax benefits like the exclusion of tax-exempt interest and deduction of state and local income taxes being regressive. Tax-exempt interest is mainly received by higher-income taxpayers, with tax benefits depending on the taxpayer's bracket. The deduction of state and local income taxes is regressive due to limitations for itemizers and higher-income taxpayers paying more taxes. On the other hand, Medicare and Social Security benefits exclusions are progressive, benefiting elderly taxpayers with lower incomes. The Social Security benefit exclusion depends on income, with lower-income taxpayers having more excluded. The child tax credit is not income-dependent and benefits those with qualifying children. Simplifying tax provisions like deductions and credits could streamline tax administration. Including certain types of income that do not appear on the tax return can pose technical challenges in tax reform proposals, particularly in determining the value of income and enforcing tax provisions without actual income realization. These challenges apply to key provisions like the exclusion of employer health insurance and pensions, Medicare benefits, and the taxation of capital gains, accounting for a significant portion of total tax expenditures. The challenges in tax reform proposals include determining the value of income for provisions like exclusion of employer pensions, Medicare benefits, capital gains taxation, and inside buildup of annuities. Administering these tax expenditures fairly is difficult due to the complexity of assigning value to employer health insurance based on factors like age, health conditions, and family size. This could lead to adverse selection issues and large imputed income for individuals with serious health problems. The 2010 health care debate discussed alternatives for assigning value to employer health insurance, such as a fixed dollar amount per employee or differentiated amounts based on factors like family size and age. However, these approaches may lead to inequities and imputed income discrepancies, especially for individuals with existing health conditions or working in firms with poorer health averages. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act proposed a flat rate tax for insurers to pay, but this would create issues with employee tax rates. Modifying the exclusion of Medicare faces similar problems in determining the insurance value of the benefit, as it is difficult to assess. The coverage remains the same for all individuals regardless of earnings or years paying taxes. The value of insurance and income inclusion varies based on taxpayer characteristics and contributions to Medicare. Social Security benefits are taxed based on past earnings. Challenges arise in modifying tax exclusions for employer retirement plans due to the complexity of defined benefit pension plans. Changing the tax treatment of defined contribution plans like 401(k) plans could create a disparity in tax treatment of pension plans. Modifying the exclusion from income for gains at death may be difficult due to uncertainty about asset values and estate funds to pay the tax. The tax treatment of gains at death involves selling assets above market value at the time of death, with no subsequent gain taxed until the asset is sold. Heirs calculate gain as the excess of sales price over market value at death. However, difficulties in obtaining basis information and asset prices can arise, leading to valuation problems and potential cash flow issues for the estate. Past proposals requiring heirs to use original purchase price have been suspended. The tax treatment of gains at death involves selling assets above market value at the time of death, with no subsequent gain taxed until the asset is sold. Heirs calculate gain as the excess of sales price over market value at death. However, difficulties in obtaining basis information and asset prices can arise, leading to valuation problems and potential cash flow issues for the estate. Past proposals requiring heirs to use original purchase price have ultimately been suspended shortly after or even before they took effect. The most recent example, enacted in 2001, would have had the capital gains provision taking effect in 2010. It was changed by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 ), which allowed heirs of decedents dying in 2010 to elect how the capital gains would be taxed. The estate could elect no estate tax and use the original purchase price for gains, or continue step-up in basis and pay an estate tax (with a $5 million exemption). The 13 th -largest tax expenditure, the exclusion of inside buildup on life insurance and annuities (the earnings on premiums), is a benefit that can be determined actuarially, but the individual taxpayer does not actually receive the income. Consequently, changing the tax treatment would require taxation on an accrual basis rather than on a realization basis. The extent to which this might cause cash flow difficulties for the estate. The tax treatment of gains at death involves selling assets above market value at the time of death, with no subsequent gain taxed until the asset is sold. Heirs calculate gain as the excess of sales price over market value at death. Difficulties in obtaining basis information and asset prices can lead to valuation problems and potential cash flow issues for the estate. Among smaller tax expenditures, miscellaneous fringe benefits pose valuation problems, such as employee discounts for clothing in retail stores. The extent of the discount's benefit and valuation issues arise, adding complexity to tax forms. Public support for various tax expenditures is strong, with survey respondents favoring maintaining these provisions even if it means lower tax rates. Examples include only 30% supporting the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes in exchange for lower rates. Other provisions like charitable deductions, employer-provided health insurance, child care expenses, and 401(k) contributions also have varying levels of support for elimination in return for lower tax rates. However, public opinion on the mortgage interest deduction is more complex. Public support for the mortgage interest deduction is not straightforward. 93% of respondents find it important, with only one-third supporting its elimination for deficit reduction. However, almost half would exchange it for lower tax rates, and 50% support eliminating it for mortgages over $500,000 and second homes. Less than half favor eliminating all tax deductions for lower tax rates, despite only one-third claiming these deductions. Most tax expenditures have majority support, except for reduced tax rates on capital gains. The analysis suggests obstacles to base broadening by eliminating or reducing tax expenditures due to their perceived importance, distributional reasons, technical difficulties, and popularity. Savings incentives account for a significant portion of revenue loss, making it challenging to repeal or scale back these provisions. Despite support for tax reform, many groups want to avoid increasing taxes on savings and prefer a system without taxation of capital income. Many obstacles hinder the elimination or reduction of tax expenditures, particularly savings incentives, which contribute significantly to revenue loss. The difficulty lies in valuing unrealized income associated with these benefits, making it challenging to raise capital gains tax rates for revenue. The concentration of tax benefits among higher-income individuals complicates reducing top rates while maintaining distributional and revenue neutrality. Large tax expenditures like the exclusion of employer health insurance and Medicare also pose challenges. The exclusion of employer health insurance and Medicare, accounting for 20% of total revenue loss from tax expenditures, presents challenges due to difficulties in valuing in-kind benefits. Modifying these provisions has been considered but faces obstacles, especially in the case of Medicare, which benefits lower-income taxpayers. Other tax expenditures, such as fringe benefits, also encounter measurement issues. The earned income credit is the most progressively distributed tax provision, primarily benefiting lower-income individuals. The earned income credit benefits lower-income individuals the most, but changing it while maintaining revenue neutrality is challenging. Taxing currently untaxed Social Security benefits would also impact lower-income individuals. The deduction for medical expenditures is high and bipartisan support exists to extend child tax credit benefits. These specific tax expenditures account for 11% of total revenue loss. The capital gains exclusion for owner-occupied housing is another difficult tax expenditure to reduce. Tax expenditures, including major itemized deductions like mortgage interest and charitable contributions, account for over 60% of revenue loss. It may be challenging to eliminate or reduce these provisions due to public attitudes. Gaining additional tax revenues through base broadening could be limited to $100-150 billion, impacting the FY2014 budget deficit. The additional tax revenue from base broadening could reduce the FY2014 budget deficit by 30% to 43%, equivalent to 6% to 9% of projected individual income tax. However, this would not allow for significant tax rate reductions. The appendix lists tax expenditures by category, including savings related items like capital gains rates and tax treatment at death. The curr_chunk discusses tax benefits for pensions, individual retirement accounts, lower rates for dividends, business provisions including research and development costs, energy, natural resources, and agriculture, owner-occupied housing benefits like mortgage deduction and exclusion of capital gains. The curr_chunk discusses various tax benefits related to consumption, health, education, charity, labor supply, and government, including exclusions for different types of income and benefits. The curr_chunk provides details on tax benefits for child and dependent care, earned income credit, government exclusions, tax deductions, disaster relief, child credit, and additional standard deduction for the blind and elderly. Data from the 2006 IRS Statistics of Income Public Use Tax File is used to estimate the progressivity of selected tax expenditures. The 2006 IRS Statistics of Income Public Use File and the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances are sources of data used to estimate tax expenditures and analyze taxpayer information. The IRS data is a sample of tax returns with changes made to protect taxpayer identities, while the SCF includes wealth, employment, and income details for households. The analysis sample consists of 130,438 taxpayers, representing 122.7 million taxpayers. The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is used to estimate tax benefits for retirement accounts like 401(k) and IRAs. It assumes a 6% rate of return on account balances. Medicare benefits and employer health insurance premiums are not reported in the SCF, but their values are estimated based on national expenditure and employer contributions. The Suits Index, a measure of tax progressivity, is calculated using concentration curves based on data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Concentration curves show how tax benefits are distributed among different income groups. The Suits Index measures tax progressivity using concentration curves, showing how tax benefits are distributed among income groups. It ranges from -1 (completely regressive) to +1 (completely progressive), with zero indicating proportional tax benefits. Area A is below the concentration curve, while area B is below the diagonal line in the figures."
