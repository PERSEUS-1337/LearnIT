    "content": "In 2014, 86% of U.S. television households subscribed to MVPD services, which bring broadcast signals to homes through various means like copper wire, fiber optic cable, or satellite dish. DIRECTV and DISH Network are the two main DBS companies in the U.S., with approximately 20.2 million and 14.0 million subscribers respectively. Since the 1970s, Congress and the FCC have created regulatory frameworks for the retransmission of broadcast television signals by cable and satellite operators. These frameworks aim to balance various public policy goals, such as competitive video services, property rights in copyright law, free over-the-air broadcast television, localism, and providing network television services to homes without access. The frameworks also consider the interests of satellite, cable, broadcast, program content, and device manufacturing industries, as well as small businesses and consumers. MVPD operators offer broadcast stations and cable networks to customers, retransmitting signals subject to legal regimes like retransmission consent under the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC administers provisions on retransmission consent. The FCC administers retransmission consent provisions for MVPD operators offering broadcast stations and cable networks. The Communications Act and Copyright Act specify procedures for licensing public performance of copyrighted content on retransmitted signals, allowing operators to access special royalty rates. The Copyright Act provisions in Title 17 address negotiating with copyright holders for broadcast programs, with different rules for cable and satellite operators. The U.S. Copyright Office administers royalty payments, while the Copyright Royalty Board handles distribution and disputes. Congress has amended the Copyright Act through laws like the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act and the 2014 STELA Reauthorization Act. In amendments to the Copyright Act and Communications Act, Congress regulates satellite retransmission of broadcast television to promote competition between satellite and cable operators. Satellite operators must have legal rights and broadcaster consent to retransmit signals, with specific requirements for different types of broadcast television stations. The law distinguishes between local and distant signals for satellite transmission. Designated Market Areas (DMAs) define local television markets for retransmission consent. Some rural households rely on satellite TV for local channels. DBS operators can provide local-into-local service but are not required to do so. DBS operators can provide local-into-local service but are not required to do so. They must carry signals of all local broadcast stations that request carriage. If a retransmission consent agreement is not reached, the satellite operator cannot include the station's signal. Satellite operators can retransmit up to two distant stations affiliated with major networks to subscribing households. DBS operators can provide local-into-local service to unserved households with a network (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, or PBS). Unserved households are those unable to receive local network-affiliated station signals due to various reasons. The provisions of STELA allow satellite operators to retransmit distant network station signals to unserved subscribers without obtaining consent or complying with FCC rules. Section 119 of the Copyright Act enables satellite operators to obtain rights to copyrighted programming from distant broadcast network affiliates, superstations, and independent stations. This allows operators to pay a royalty fee to the U.S. Copyright Office semiannually, avoiding the need to negotiate with individual copyright holders. Section 119 of the Copyright Act allows satellite operators to transmit superstations and distant independent stations to commercial establishments and households without negotiating with individual copyright holders. It also grandfathers certain distant signal subscribers until December 31, 2019. Section 339 of the Communications Act permits the carriage of distant television stations by satellite operators, with references to Section 119. If Section 119 is not renewed by Congress, portions of Section 339 would become ineffective after December 31, 2019. Section 325(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Communications Act allows satellite operators to retransmit distant network stations' signals to unserved households without needing retransmission consent. This provision is similar to the compulsory licensing scheme for cable operators. It also prohibits exclusive contracts for carriage and mandates good faith negotiations for retransmission consent. The FCC's rules on good faith negotiations for retransmission consent may become irrelevant if Congress does not extend the provisions beyond December 31, 2019. This could lead to impasses in negotiations, causing subscribers to lose access to broadcast programming. The 113th Congress reauthorized STELA, including extensions of provisions in the Copyright Act and Communications Act until December 31, 2019. The Copyright Act provisions allowing satellite operators to transmit stations under a statutory license are extended until December 31, 2019. The Government Accountability Office is required to evaluate changes to carriage requirements for MVPDs under the Communications Act if Congress phases out compulsory copyright requirements. The report will cover similar ground as a 2011 Copyright Office report on possible repeal of statutory licensing provisions. The report recommends repealing Sections 111, 119, and 122 of Title 17, U.S.C. It suggests allowing stakeholders to develop market licenses for a phase-out, adopting a date-certain and tiered schedule for an effective transition. Congress should permit copyright owners to create marketplace licensing options, set a date trigger for phase-out of distant signal licenses, delay repeal of local signal licenses for testing new business models, and address concerns of stakeholders in broadcast industries. The report recommends repealing Sections 111, 119, and 122 of Title 17, U.S.C. Congress should evaluate concerns of stakeholders in the broadcast programming distribution chain, refrain from applying statutory licenses during the transition period, and extend Section 339 of the Communications Act. Section 201 of 17 U.S.C. extends Section 339 of the Communications Act, allowing satellite operators to carry distant television signals. Section 101 extends certain provisions in the Communications Act until December 31, 2019, including rules related to retransmitting distant network stations without consent. Section 103 of the Communications Act amends rules regarding negotiations over retransmission consent between MVPDs and station licensees. It requires the FCC to update its rules to encourage timely agreements in good faith. The FCC must start the rulemaking process within nine months of the enactment of STELA. Additionally, it prohibits joint negotiations for retransmission consent contracts between television broadcast stations in the same market. The FCC prohibits joint negotiations for retransmission consent contracts between television broadcast stations in the same market, unless they are considered to be owned by the same entity. This includes cases like Univision Communications Inc. negotiating on behalf of Entravision Communications Corporation in certain markets where they both own stations. This rule expands on a previous FCC order from 2014 regarding joint negotiations among top four stations in a DMA. The FCC prohibits joint negotiations for retransmission consent contracts between television broadcast stations in the same market. The FCC rules have no retroactive effect and only apply to negotiations going forward. Section 105 of the FCC order strikes a sentence that prohibited cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial TV stations during Nielsen rating periods. The FCC must revise its regulations by March 4, 2015 to comply with this provision. The STELA Reauthorization Act aimed to provide regulatory parity by reducing broadcast stations' revenue at stake in retransmission consent negotiations compared to cable operators. This allowed local broadcast stations to selectively require cable carriage during sweeps ratings periods, impacting advertising rates. The Act also directed the FCC to include information on cable companies' payments for retransmission consent in its annual surveys. The FCC conducts annual price surveys on cable operators' rates for basic cable service, other programming, and equipment. It compares rates between cable services facing competition and those that do not. Section 325(b)(3)(A) of the Communications Act instructs the FCC to consider the impact of broadcasters' retransmission consent on cable operators' rates for basic service tiers. The FCC is directed to develop a streamlined process for small cable operators to file \"effective competition\" petitions within 180 days. If an operator is found to have \"effective competition\" in a community, they are not subject to government regulation of prices for their basic service tier. The cable company filing the petition must prove they face effective competition for their video services. Section 106 of the FCC repeals the ban on integrating security and navigation functions in set-top boxes provided by cable operators. The ban will no longer be effective after December 4, 2015, with waivers extended through December 31, 2015. The FCC is directed to establish a group of technical experts to recommend standards for downloadable security by August 4, 2015. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler plans to establish the working group promptly. The FCC has an outstanding notice of inquiry from April 2010 regarding Internet-enabled devices connecting with MVPDs' video services. Section 104 delays enforcement of a FCC order on joint sales agreements until December 19, 2016. These agreements allow one broadcast station to sell advertising time on another station in the same market. Stations have two years to comply with the FCC order. The FCC order granted stations two years to comply with ownership limit rules and extended the deadline in a public notice. Satellite video providers must submit annual reports to the FCC by August 31, 2015, detailing retransmission of local signals and satellite capacity use. The FCC order granted stations two years to comply with ownership limit rules and extended the deadline in a public notice. Satellite providers must submit annual reports by August 31 of each year, renewing reporting requirements. Orphan counties, without in-state broadcast stations, may not receive local programming, impacting consumers. Regulatory frameworks for satellite and cable distinguish between local and distant signals, requiring compliance with Nielsen-defined local markets. Congress may need to modify Copyright and Communications Acts to allow satellite operators to retransmit in-state signals. Broadcasters argue that they have incentives to provide more in-state programming without the need for congressional or FCC action. Prior to the 2014 STELA Reauthorization Act, bills were introduced regarding the retransmission of local programming by cable operators. Broadcasters argue that allowing MVPDs to retransmit out-of-market broadcast network programming would undermine the local broadcasting system and affect their exclusive rights in negotiating retransmission consent. Several bills were introduced in the 113th Congress regarding the orphan county issue, but none were incorporated into the enacted legislation. These bills aimed to allow orphan counties to petition the FCC for inclusion in local television markets, facilitate the delivery of in-state but out-of-market television stations to specific counties, and provide greater access to in-state television programming for cable and satellite subscribers in certain counties. FCC rules permit modifications to local television markets upon request from broadcast stations or cable systems. The 2014 STELA Reauthorization Act extends the market modification process to satellite carriers, allowing consumers in one community to receive a local commercial TV station from another market with relevant content. This may benefit consumers in \"orphan counties\" by providing access to in-state TV programming via satellite. The 2014 STELA Reauthorization Act extends the market modification process to satellite carriers, allowing consumers in one community to receive a local commercial TV station from another market with relevant content. This could benefit viewers in orphan counties by providing access to more in-state programming. The FCC is directed to update the definition of a \"community\" to modify markets for cable and satellite carriage, with a focus on promoting access to television broadcast signals originating in the viewer's state of residence. The FCC must establish rules by August 4, 2015, and provide information on its website regarding market modifications. The 2014 STELA Reauthorization Act extends the market modification process to satellite carriers, allowing consumers to receive local TV stations from another market. The FCC is required to update the definition of a \"community\" to promote access to in-state programming. The new law does not specify who may petition the FCC to modify a market for satellite service. Only broadcast television stations and cable operators can currently petition the FCC for market modifications. The STELA Reauthorization Act allows broadcast stations and satellite operators to petition to modify a market for satellite service. It amends sections of the Communications Act to create near-parity between satellite and cable operators in determining station eligibility for carriage by an MVPD outside its market. The FCC must consider specific factors when modifying local television markets for satellite and cable carriage of broadcast television stations. The FCC must consider specific factors when modifying local television markets for satellite and cable carriage of broadcast television stations, including whether the station provides coverage or local services to the community, promotes consumers' access to in-state broadcast signals, offers news coverage or events of interest to the community, and evidence of viewing patterns. Satellite and cable operators are prohibited from deleting a commercial station's signal during the FCC's market modification proceeding. The FCC must consider specific factors when modifying local television markets for satellite and cable carriage of broadcast television stations. Satellite operators are not required to carry additional stations under the market modification process if it is not feasible. Section 103(b) prohibits a broadcast television station from limiting an MVPD's ability to carry a significantly viewed station. Section 109 requires the FCC to submit a report to Congress by May 4, 2016. The FCC is required to submit a report to Congress by May 4, 2016, analyzing alternatives to DMAs for defining markets to increase programming options. A 2010 report found that most U.S. households have access to in-state programming and television stations via DBS. Any changes to significantly viewed status rules for DBS would need to align with existing regulations. The FCC concluded that Congress would need to make a statutory change for the FCC to modify its significantly viewed process for DBS operators. Any changes in the rules would not be covered by the significantly viewed copyright license, unless negotiated copyright permission is obtained. Modifying the Communications and Copyright Acts to include DBS operators in market modification applications could increase the number of local stations available to consumers. This was addressed in Section 102 of the 2014 STELA Reauthorization Act. During the consideration of the STELA Reauthorization Act, Senators Thune and Rockefeller proposed \"Local Choice,\" which aimed to change the requirement for cable operators to carry broadcast stations on the basic tier. The proposal suggested that only noncommercial and commercial stations that choose must-carry would be automatically included on the basic tier, while others would set a price for subscribers to receive them on an a la carte basis. Although this proposal was not enacted, it may be revisited by the 114th Congress during a comprehensive revision of communication and copyright laws."
