It must be compatible with the State's hunting licensing system. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior.

The Secretary mandates that individuals purchasing electronic stamps from a State must receive an actual stamp before it expires, in a method agreed upon. States must collect and submit customer information and stamp revenue to the Secretary. The Secretary requires States to submit sales information for electronic stamps, including the Federal portion of fees. States can charge a fee for issuing electronic stamps to cover costs. This section does not apply to State fees collected separately. A State can issue a duplicate electronic stamp to replace a lost or damaged one. States cannot require the purchase of a hunting license to issue an electronic stamp under this Act. SEC. 6. ELECTRONIC STAMP REQUIREMENTS; RECOGNITION OF ELECTRONIC STAMP. The Secretary shall require an electronic stamp issued by a State under this Act to have the same format as any other license and specify identifying features of the licensee. The electronic stamp bestows the same privileges as an actual stamp, is recognized nationally as a valid Federal migratory bird hunting stamp, and authorizes the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl. The electronic stamp issued by a State allows the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl in any State following its laws. It is valid for a duration not exceeding 45 days. The authority of a State to issue electronic stamps under this Act may be terminated by the Secretary if the State violates the terms approved in the application, or by the State itself with written notice to the Secretary."
