    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 1999\" promotes the adoption of children with special needs. The \"Adoption Equality Act of 1999\" promotes the adoption of children with special needs by amending Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act to specify requirements for a child to be eligible for supplemental security. The \"Adoption Equality Act of 1999\" amends Section 473(a) of the Social Security Act to establish eligibility criteria for supplemental security income benefits for children with special needs in foster care or child care institutions. The State determines the child's special needs and considers them, along with the adopting parents' circumstances, when determining payment amounts. The \"Adoption Equality Act of 1999\" amends eligibility criteria for adoption assistance payments for children with special needs. Children not citizens or residents of the US meeting certain requirements are eligible. Children previously eligible for adoption assistance payments and available for adoption due to dissolved prior adoptions are also covered. The \"Adoption Equality Act of 1999\" expands eligibility for adoption assistance payments to children with special needs, including those not US citizens or residents adopted internationally. Payments are not made to parents for such children placed in foster care after failed adoptions. The \"Adoption Equality Act of 1999\" requires states to use savings from reduced expenditures on services for children or families after failed adoptions to provide post-adoption services. Additionally, the act expands adoption assistance payments to children with special needs, including those adopted internationally. The Social Security Act is amended to define a child with special needs as one who cannot be returned to their parents' home or meets medical/disability requirements for supplemental security income benefits. Additionally, the state must identify a specific factor or condition for the child. The Social Security Act defines a child with special needs as one who cannot be placed with adoptive parents without adoption assistance and medical assistance. Efforts must be made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents before providing assistance. The amendments made by this section regarding adoption and medical assistance shall take effect on October 1, 1999."
