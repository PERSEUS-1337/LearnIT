    "content": "The \"Government Shutdown Prevention Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. It includes an amendment to Title 31. The \"Government Shutdown Prevention Act\" includes an amendment to Title 31, specifically adding a new section for continuing appropriations in case regular appropriation bills are not passed before the fiscal year begins. The \"Government Shutdown Prevention Act\" introduces a new section for continuing appropriations if regular appropriation bills are not passed before the fiscal year begins. Appropriations for projects or activities will be based on the previous fiscal year's funding levels or a joint resolution for continuing appropriations. The \"Government Shutdown Prevention Act\" allows for continuing appropriations based on the previous fiscal year's funding levels or a joint resolution for projects or activities during a lapse in appropriations. The appropriation bill or continuing resolution for a fiscal year must become law by the end of that fiscal year. Any funds or authority granted for a project or activity in a fiscal year will be subject to the terms and conditions of the previous fiscal year. Appropriations, funds, and authority for a project or activity in a fiscal year will cover all obligations or expenditures during that fiscal year. Expenditures for a project in a fiscal year under this section must be charged to the appropriate appropriation when a bill providing for the project becomes law. This section does not apply if another law already provides funding or authority for the project to continue. The term 'regular appropriation bill' refers to annual bills that allocate funds for various government programs and agencies, including agriculture, defense, energy, homeland security, and education. These bills must be passed for projects to receive funding and authorization to continue. The curr_chunk outlines different categories for appropriations, including the legislative branch, military construction, veterans affairs, Department of State, transportation, housing, and urban development. A clerical amendment is also mentioned in the text. The curr_chunk states \"1311. Continuing appropriations.\""
