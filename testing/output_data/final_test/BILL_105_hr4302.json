    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of birds as indicators of environmental health, their roles in pollination and seed dispersal, and their economic benefits in controlling insects on agricultural crops. Despite their irreplaceable value, many North American bird species are in decline, with 90 species listed as endangered or threatened in the United States and another 124 of high conservation concern. Mexico lists approximately 390 bird species as endangered, threatened, vulnerable, or rare. Out of nearly 800 bird species in the US, around 500 migrate among nations. Neotropical migrants, primarily wintering in Latin America and the Caribbean, have faced population declines due to habitat loss and degradation. Conservation efforts require international cooperation to establish safeguards along migration routes and stopover areas. This Act aims to address the joint commitment needed from nations and society to protect these species. The Act aims to protect migratory birds in collaboration with neighboring nations, conservation organizations, corporations, and other private entities. The Act aims to protect migratory birds through collaboration with various entities. The Act aims to support neotropical migratory bird conservation programs in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States, promote partnerships between different entities for bird conservation, encourage participation from cooperating countries, facilitate local conservation efforts, and provide financial resources for projects. The Act aims to provide financial resources for projects supporting neotropical migratory bird conservation, promote collaboration for effective conservation, and enhance existing conservation efforts. SEC. 4. CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a program to provide financial assistance for projects promoting the conservation of neotropical migratory birds. Eligible entities include governmental entities in the US, US nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and private entities, as well as organizations and entities in Latin America or the Caribbean. The program established by the Secretary of the Interior provides financial assistance for projects that focus on conserving neotropical migratory birds in Latin America, the Caribbean, or the United States. Project proposals must demonstrate habitat conservation, local public participation, consultation with government officials, and sensitivity to local historic and cultural aspects. Project proposals must demonstrate sensitivity to local historic and cultural resources, comply with applicable laws, and provide necessary information for evaluation. Projects should aim to support conservation objectives and ensure long-term operation and maintenance by local entities. The Federal share of project costs should not exceed 33 percent, with at least 50 percent coming from non-Federal sources. The non-Federal share of project costs must be covered by various entities, including US and international NGOs, states, corporations, and private entities. Local entities in the project country must also provide matching support. Local entities in the project country, including corporations and business interests, must contribute at least 50 percent of the non-Federal share of project costs.
