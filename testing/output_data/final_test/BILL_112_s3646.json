According to the Department of Defense's April 2012 Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in Afghanistan, U.S. and coalition forces are degrading the Taliban-led insurgency to allow the Afghan National Security Forces and Government to assume full responsibility for Afghanistan's security by the end of 2014. The transition to Afghan security lead began in July 2011 and will be complete country-wide by the end of 2014. According to a 2002 study on Women, Peace and Security, restrictions on women's rights can indicate potential conflict. In Afghanistan, the government, NATO, and ISAF develop transition plans approved by the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board. In Afghanistan, restrictions on women's mobility and rights can indicate extremist presence. The security of Afghan women and girls during security transitions is crucial for the success of the transition strategy. Key indicators include women's mobility, participation in local government, school attendance, access to government services, and prevalence of violence against women. Maintaining physical security for Afghan women is essential for their participation in education, commerce, politics, and public life. Protecting the security and human rights of Afghan women and girls is crucial for their participation in education, commerce, politics, and public life. Female officials in Afghanistan face serious threats to their security, and involving Afghan men and boys in educating them about the benefits of women's participation is essential. Male officials and security personnel can play a significant role in supporting and protecting women and girls. The Chicago Summit Declaration by NATO in May 2012 emphasizes the importance of the Afghan National Police evolving into a credible civilian law enforcement force. However, women in the Afghan National Army and Police face barriers such as a discriminatory work environment and lack of facilities. Female recruitment and retention rates in the Afghan National Security Forces remain low as of September 2012. The Afghan National Security Forces have low rates of female representation, with only 1,700 women serving in the total force, which is less than half of one percent. President Hamid Karzai aimed to recruit and train 5,000 women in the Afghan National Police by 2014, but currently, there are only 1,370 women in the force, representing 0.87 percent. In the Afghan National Army, approximately 350 women serve, making up 0.17 percent of the force, far below the government's goal of achieving a 10 percent female force. The Afghan National Security Forces have low rates of female representation, with only 1,700 women serving in the total force. Male security personnel often lack the training to respond effectively to violence against women. The Afghan Ministry of Defense and Interior face challenges in promoting fair treatment of women in the force. The Afghan National Police faces challenges in fully integrating and protecting women in the workforce, especially at the provincial and district levels. Provincial Headquarters Commanders prefer male candidates and lack facilities to support policewomen. Cultural impediments, weak recruitment, and uneven policy application hinder progress in recruiting women for police operations. Stronger documentation, implementation, and enforcement of policies are needed to better integrate women. The United States and its coalition partners have committed to supporting the human rights of women and girls in Afghanistan by integrating women into peace-building processes to promote democratic governance and long-term stability. The National Action Plan and NATO's Chicago Summit Declaration emphasize the importance of women's participation in peace-building and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan to promote security and stability. The Strategic Partnership Agreement between the United States and Afghanistan, signed in 2012, emphasizes the essential role of women in society and their rights in economic, social, political, civil, and cultural aspects. The Strategic Partnership Agreement between the United States and Afghanistan, signed in 2012, highlights the importance of women's rights in various aspects. The Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the Secretary of State, is required to submit a strategy within 60 days to promote the security of Afghan women during the security transition process. This strategy will involve monitoring and responding to changes in women's security conditions in transitioning areas. The transition process in Afghanistan includes actions such as designating a Civilian Impact Advisor to assess the impact on male and female civilians, reviewing indicators for collecting sex-disaggregated data, and developing additional indicators to measure women's security, including women and girls' mobility. Integrating indicators related to women's security, such as girls' school attendance and violence against women, into assessments of overall security conditions during the transition period in Afghanistan. During the transition period in Afghanistan, efforts are being made to support women's rights and security. This includes increasing gender awareness among Afghan National Army and Police personnel through training programs and collaboration with partners. Programming is being implemented to address human rights issues concerning women and girls, responses to threats against them, and appropriate behavior towards female colleagues and community members. The quality and consistency of this training across regional commands are being assessed, along with its impact on trainee behavior. Efforts are also being made to work with national and local Afghan National Army and Police leaders to develop enforcement and accountability mechanisms for personnel who violate codes of conduct related to women's rights. A strategy is being developed to increase the number of female members in the Afghan National Army and Police by setting realistic recruitment and retention objectives in consultation with Afghan partners. Collaboration with national and local leaders and coalition partners is also planned to achieve this goal. Working with ANA and ANP leaders to address challenges in recruiting and retaining female personnel, including targeted campaigns, expanded training, parity in pay and promotion rates, and facilities for women. Increasing understanding of how women in the security forces enhance overall effectiveness. Working with national and local ANA and ANP leaders to develop a plan for maintaining and increasing the recruitment and retention of women in the security forces post-transition. The Secretary of Defense must report actions taken to implement this strategy in progress reports to Congress. The Senate's Committee on Armed Services and Foreign Relations, along with the House of Representatives' Committee on Armed Services and Foreign Affairs, are involved in overseeing military and foreign affairs matters."
