    "content": "In this paper, the phenomenon of \"super-convergence\" in training residual networks is discussed, showing that fewer iterations are needed compared to standard methods. Super-convergence is linked to improved generalization in deep networks, achieved through cyclical learning rates and large maximum learning rates. Training with large learning rates also acts as a regularization method. The approach provides significant performance gains, especially with limited labeled data. A simplified version of the Hessian Free optimization method is used to estimate the optimal learning rate. The architectures for replicating this work will be shared upon publication. This paper presents empirical evidence supporting the concept of \"super-convergence\" in deep neural networks, achieved through the use of large learning rates with the cyclical learning rate method. The phenomenon, analogous to super-conductivity, can significantly speed up training for certain datasets and architectures. The primary goal is to contribute to the ongoing research on stochastic gradient descent and generalization in deep learning. The literature discusses SGD, generalization, and super-convergence in deep neural networks. A comparison of test accuracies between super-convergence and typical training regimes for Cifar-10 shows that super-convergence achieves higher accuracy in fewer iterations. A modified learning rate schedule also improves final test accuracy significantly. The paper's contributions include demonstrating a new training phenomenon and providing systematic investigation. In this paper, the authors demonstrate a new training phenomenon where large learning rates regularize the network, leading to finding flat local minima that generalize well. They simplify the second-order optimization method to estimate optimal learning rates, showing that large learning rates find wide, flat minima. The effects of super-convergence are more pronounced with less labeled training data. The paper also discusses the practice of using a global learning rate for many epochs before decreasing it and continuing training, with significant improvements in final test accuracy. The paper discusses the use of large learning rates to regularize the network and find flat local minima that generalize well. It simplifies second-order optimization for optimal learning rates and explores adaptive learning rate methods. The study contrasts with suggestions for maximum learning rate values and emphasizes the importance of global learning rates for improved test accuracy. Adaptive learning rate methods like Nesterov momentum, AdaDelta, AdaGrad, and Adam do not use large enough learning rates for super-convergence without using CLR. A warmup learning rate strategy could be seen as a form of CLR, similar to the SGDR method proposed by BID24. Experiments show that the SGDR method does not lead to super-convergence. This work is connected to ongoing research on stochastic gradient descent, noise importance for generalization, and the generalization gap in deep learning. In this work, cyclical learning rates (CLR) and the learning rate range test (LR range test) are used, following suggestions from previous studies. CLR involves setting minimum and maximum learning rate boundaries and a stepsize for iterations. The learning rate changes linearly between the boundaries in cycles. The LR range test is used to determine if super-convergence is possible for an architecture by starting with a small learning rate and slowly increasing it linearly. This provides information on how well the network can be trained over a range of learning rates, with a distinct peak in test accuracy. The learning rate at this peak is used as the maximum learning rate bound when using CLR. The largest value at the peak is used as the maximum learning rate bound when using CLR. The optimal initial learning rate usually falls between the minimum and maximum values. LR range test on Cifar-10 with a 56 layer residual network showed high accuracy with learning rate values up to 3.0. This behavior led to experimentation with higher learning rates, indicating potential for super-convergence. The test accuracy remains consistently high for a long range of large learning rate values in runs with a maximum number of iterations. Significant progress is made in early iterations, but little improvement occurs over the bulk of the iterations. Cyclical learning rates are well suited for training when the loss topology forms a valley leading to a local minimum. The learning rate starts small for convergence, increases for faster progress through the valley, and decreases in the final stages of training. In the final stages of training, the learning rate is reduced to its original small value after allowing for faster progress through the valley. Super-convergence was observed with large learning rates, indicating regularization. Results from LR range tests on different architectures show decreasing generalization error with increasing learning rates. The final test accuracy results from super-convergence training show better performance compared to typical training methods. Large learning rates are shown to regularize training and lead to better generalization through larger gradient noise. Gradient descent is an optimization method that uses derivatives to update variables in a neural network. The Hessian-free optimization method BID25 proposes a second order solution using slope information from the second derivative. Newton's method approximates the loss function locally with a quadratic. The Hessian matrix, with \u2126(N^2) elements, is challenging to compute. The Hessian matrix, with \u2126(N^2) elements, is challenging to compute. Hessian-free optimization uses a finite difference approach to estimate the Hessian from two gradients. The AdaSecant method builds an adaptive learning rate based on this approximation. Equation 7 is rewritten in terms of weight differences from three sequential iterations. The adaptive learning rate for weight updates is calculated using Equation 8, which is based on the method in BID28. The optimal learning rates were computed for different scenarios, including a constant learning rate of 0.1 and a range of 0.1 to 3 with a stepsize of 5,000 iterations. The optimal learning rates for weight updates were calculated using a method based on BID28. The computed learning rate exhibited variations, so a moving average was used. Results showed that optimal learning rates should be in the range of 2 to 4 for this architecture. The technique was not fully evaluated in this paper, but it was used to demonstrate that training with large learning rates is indicated. Further assessment and tests of this method to estimate optimal adaptive learning rates are left for future work. When training data is limited, super-convergence shows better performance compared to standard training. A network with specific CLR parameters exhibits super-convergence and achieves higher accuracies. Super-convergence test accuracy is 1.2%, 5.2%, and 9.2% better for 50,000, 20,000, and 10,000 training cases, respectively. This highlights the benefits of super-convergence in training with limited data. Experiments were conducted on Resnets with 20 to 110 layers, investigating the effects of larger batch sizes in super-convergence training. Results showed a small performance improvement with larger batch sizes, and the generalization gap was similar for small and large mini-batch sizes. This suggests that training with large learning rates allows for the use of large batch sizes. Training with large learning rates allows for the use of large batch sizes, which is more effective for super-convergence. Experiments showed that a maximum learning rate of around 3 performed well, and training with a single cycle of CLR and a minimum learning rate of 0 also yielded good results. Batch normalization had an impact on super-convergence, with adjustments needed for optimal performance. When training networks quickly like with super-convergence, a fraction of 0.999 for accumulated global statistics may not update fast enough. Smaller values from Table 1 were found to be more suitable. Experiments with Cifar-100 confirmed super-convergence, even with added dropout. Various adaptive learning rate methods were tested on Cifar-10 with Resnet-56, but none accelerated training. Super-convergence was confirmed in experiments with Cifar-100, even with added dropout. Adaptive learning rate methods were tested on Cifar-10 with Resnet-56, but none accelerated training as effectively as super-convergence. Momentum values between 0.8 - 0.9 were found to yield higher final test accuracy, with results detailed in supplemental materials. The study provides empirical evidence supporting some theories and contradicting others, emphasizing the importance of noise for generalization in SGD. It focuses on the use of CLR with large learning rates to add noise during training, showing that higher noise levels lead to solutions with better generalization. This research impacts the understanding of SGD and the factors that contribute to solutions that generalize well. The study supports the importance of noise for generalization in SGD, emphasizing the use of CLR with large learning rates to add noise during training. It shows that higher noise levels lead to solutions with better generalization, aligning with previous research on wide, flat local minima producing better generalization. The study highlights the impact of noise levels during training, showing that noise scale is relevant to training rather than learning rate or batch size. It discusses the generalization gap between small and large mini-batches, suggesting a warm start with small batches followed by larger batch sizes. Starting with a warm start using a small batch size, the study suggests gradually increasing noise levels during training, reaching a peak, and then reducing noise towards the end (simulated annealing). It also mentions the use of large mini-batch sizes up to 8,192 and adjusting learning rates accordingly. Additionally, it discusses the impact of batch normalization on different mini-batch sizes and suggests using ghost statistics to handle variations. The paper discusses the regularization effect of training with large learning rates, allowing for shorter training lengths. It also highlights the need for a unified framework to address SGD noise and diversity in various aspects of training, such as architectural noise and input diversity. The paper emphasizes the importance of gradient diversity, time-dependent application of noise during training, and discovering new ways to stabilize optimization with large noise levels. These factors aim to improve generalization and address conflicting claims in the literature on SGD noise and diversity. The paper discusses the importance of gradient diversity, time-dependent noise application, and stabilizing optimization with large noise levels to improve generalization in SGD. It highlights the role of normalization methods like batch normalization in enabling super-convergence. The Resnet-56 architecture used consists of three stages with repeated residual block structures. New theories of SGD and generalization are needed to explain super-convergence. The Resnet-56 architecture consists of three stages with repeated residual block structures. Different structures are used between stages to reduce spatial dimensions. Batch normalization and scaling layers are utilized for true batch normalization behavior. Super-convergence is observed with both Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 datasets, showing independence on the number of classes. Results of the LR range test for Resnet-56 are shown in FIG0. The LR range test for Resnet-56 with Cifar-100 training data shows potential for super-convergence, with a smooth curve and high accuracy. Comparison to piecewise constant training regime in FIG16 shows 8.8% improvement in final accuracy.

The study tested various adaptive learning rate methods with Resnet-56 on Cifar-10 but found no indication of super-convergence. However, Nesterov, AdaDelta, and AdaGrad allowed super-convergence to occur. Adam did not exhibit this phenomenon. Super-convergence with Nesterov momentum method resulted in a final test accuracy of 92.1% after 10,000 iterations, outperforming a piecewise constant training regime at 90.9% accuracy after 80,000 iterations. Additionally, runs of super-convergence with and without dropout were compared, showing a small improvement in training results after 10,000 iterations.
