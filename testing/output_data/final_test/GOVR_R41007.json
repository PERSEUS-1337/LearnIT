    "content": "This report provides Congress with insights into China's political system, highlighting key features, governance challenges, and the roles of political actors. It aims to help Congress understand how these actors interact and their influence on China's relationships with other countries. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been in power in China for 63 years, evolving significantly over time. The CCP's adaptability has helped it avoid the fate of its sister parties in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Chinese Communist Party has avoided the fate of its sister parties in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Party maintains a permanent monopoly on power and is intolerant of dissent, but the political system is not monolithic or rigidly hierarchical. Competition exists among leaders and institutions at every level, including the Politburo Standing Committee, ministries, provincial governments, and the military. Deputies to the National People's Congress sometimes push back against the Party's control. In China, the National People's Congress occasionally challenges the government, courts, and prosecutors. Various actors like the media, corporations, academics, and NGOs influence policy debates. The ability to manage political transitions was tested during the leadership change in the Communist Party in 2012 when Bo Xilai's downfall revealed leadership rifts. The leadership change in the Communist Party in 2012 revealed serious rifts, questions about unity and loyalty, and turmoil in the top ranks. Xi Jinping emerged as the new General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. The 12th National People's Congress in March 2013 appointed Xi Jinping as State President and Li Keqiang as Premier of the State Council. Concerns have been raised about China's political system, with calls for political reform by retired Premier Wen Jiabao to prevent potential setbacks in economic and social development. China's new Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping has raised hopes for political reform by emphasizing the full implementation of China's state constitution and the need for the Party to police itself. However, there are apparent contradictions in his approach, as he also emphasizes adherence to the Party's constitution over the state constitution. The Chinese Communist Party's power is based on its control of the military, paramilitary forces, internal security forces, personnel appointments, media, judiciary, and internal security apparatus. Xi Jinping's stance on political reform remains unclear due to contradictions in his statements. The Chinese Communist Party's power is based on its control of various institutions, including the military and internal security forces. The Party entrusts the implementation of its policies to the State Council, which is overseen by the National People's Congress. However, in practice, the NPC, like other People's Congresses, is controlled by the Communist Party and has limited oversight. The National People's Congress (NPC), controlled by the Communist Party, has limited oversight over institutions under its supervision. NPC deputies approve budgets, agency reports, and personnel appointments. Its main power lies in initiating and shaping legislation. Other institutions like the People's Political Consultative Conferences (PPCCs) and China's minor political parties have little substantive power. The democratic parties pledge loyalty to the Communist Party and accept its leadership. China's political system is described as \"multi-party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist Party of China.\" The country operates under a collective leadership with no supreme leader since Deng Xiaoping's death in 1997. The Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee consists of seven members with specific responsibilities. Party General Secretary Xi Jinping is one of them. Party General Secretary Xi Jinping is ranked first among the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, with control over significant portfolios such as military and foreign affairs. Unlike his predecessor, Xi immediately assumed the top military post upon taking leadership, enhancing his authority. However, major decisions still require consensus from the group, which can be challenging due to the need for agreement among different constituencies and interest groups represented informally by the members. The collective leadership structure of the Chinese political system aims to safeguard against individual dominance. The Chinese political system's collective leadership feature aims to prevent individual dominance and guard against the emergence of a single powerful leader like Mao Zedong or Mikhail Gorbachev. The ultimate check on the Party general secretary's power was Deng Xiaoping, who removed reformist General Secretaries before settling on Jiang Zemin. It is uncertain if retired leaders like Jiang would have the authority to remove the general secretary today. China's military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), is an armed wing of the Communist Party, with the Party's \"absolute leadership\" over the military being a fundamental guarantee of Communist Party rule. The PLA's loyalty to the Party was evident in 1989 when they followed orders to clear unarmed protestors from Tiananmen Square, resulting in the deaths of hundreds. The PLA's actions during this time damaged their image both domestically and internationally. Political indoctrination emphasizing loyalty to the Communist Party has always been a key aspect of the PLA. The Party's control over the military is enforced through the General Political Department, responsible for political training and personnel management. Xi Jinping has emphasized the importance of obeying the Party's command and the military's readiness for combat as top priorities. The PLA's General Political Department manages political training and personnel matters, with political commissars serving alongside military commanders at all levels. There have been discussions about \"de-politicizing\" or \"nationalizing\" the PLA, but the Party has rejected these ideas. Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping opposes de-politicization, blaming the Soviet Union's collapse on this. China's constitution grants the National People's Congress extensive powers, but in reality, the NPC's authority is limited. The National People's Congress (NPC) in China is weak in reality despite having extensive powers on paper. The Communist Party controls the NPC, using it as a rubber stamp to ratify Party decisions. Deputies are nominated by the Party, with campaigning forbidden, further limiting the NPC's independence. The National People's Congress (NPC) in China is controlled by the Communist Party, with deputies elected from nominees without campaigning. 85% of the nearly 3,000 deputies hold concurrent posts as Party or state officials. The NPC Standing Committee, which operates when the full NPC is not in session, does not include holders of state, judicial, and procuratorial positions. Party control is ensured with a member of the Politburo Standing Committee serving as chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The Party's Politburo Standing Committee also serves as chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. Proposals for political reform in China aim to empower the NPC to enforce the constitution. Some suggest the Party rule through the NPC within constitutional limits, which would limit the Party's powers. Provincial leaders, including Party Secretaries, hold significant power in the political system. Provincial leaders in China hold significant power, with all provincial leaders sharing the same bureaucratic rank as central government ministers. Fiscal decentralization has empowered provincial governments, allowing them to have their own revenue streams and make decisions on public expenditure. Provinces also have the authority to pass their own laws and regulations, with Beijing giving them flexibility in adopting policies to boost economic growth. In China, provincial leaders have significant power and share the same rank as central government ministers. Provinces have their own revenue streams, can pass laws, and make decisions on public expenditure. Beijing allows provinces to adopt policies for economic growth but struggles to impose its will at times. Central government ministries in provinces report to both Beijing and provincial leadership, with provincial interests often taking priority. While China operates a unitary political system, Beijing ultimately has the upper hand in appointing provincial leaders. The Chinese government maintains control over provincial leaders by rotating them between provinces and Beijing to prevent the accumulation of regional power. Beijing can also investigate corruption and audit provincial finances. Official documents approved by the Communist Party Central Committee hold more authority than individual leaders' statements. Former Premier Wen Jiabao used foreign media interviews to discuss political reform ideas, but Chinese state media did not report on them, limiting their impact. China's reliance on paper documents, even in the digital age, helps build consensus and authority. The Chinese side values detailed joint statements with the U.S. as authoritative texts guiding the relationship. The Chinese Communist Party has had to adapt its ruling ideology to survive without undermining its power monopoly. It originally promised to help farmers and workers overthrow exploiters and establish socialism and communism. The Chinese Communist Party has shifted from its revolutionary roots to represent the interests of the majority, including capitalists. It faces criticism for moving away from Marxism as it protects private property rights and supports state-owned enterprises. The Chinese Communist Party emphasizes meritocracy in personnel appointments, claiming it as a superior political system compared to competitive elections. However, the extent of China's meritocracy is debated. The Chinese Communist Party claims to operate a meritocracy in personnel appointments, but a 2012 study found promotions were based on factional ties, familial connections, and education rather than professional competence. \"Princelings,\" children of high-level officials, hold prominent positions in the political system. Corruption and scandals have undermined the Party's reputation for appointing leaders with moral integrity. Enforcement of age and term limits for top Party and State positions has brought predictability to Chinese elite politics. No one older than 67 has been appointed to key leadership positions since 1997. Age limits have been extended to all members of the Central Military Commission. Ministers, provincial Party Secretaries, and governors have retirement age of 65. Enforcement of age and term limits in Chinese elite politics has brought predictability. Top officials have a retirement age of 65 and are limited to two five-year terms. This defines turnover at each Party Congress and limits the pool of candidates. Five of the seven current Politburo Standing Committee members are expected to serve only one term, with Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang eligible for a second term. Hu Chunhua and Sun Zhengcai, both aged 49, are emerging as potential future national leaders. The Chinese political system emphasizes long-term planning, with the Communist Party General Secretary presenting priorities at five-year intervals. \"Five-Year Plans\" set economic and social targets, guiding official policy. Future political leaders are groomed over time, with former Party General being a prominent example. Former Party General Secretary Hu Jintao was groomed for high office over a lengthy period, appointed as heir apparent in 1992 before finally ascending to the top job a decade later. China's current top leaders, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, had shorter apprenticeships. In 1989, the Party faced challenges with large-scale protests, leading to the split in leadership and the forceful clearing of protesters in Tiananmen Square, damaging China's standing in the world. The Party has prioritized maintaining social stability since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests damaged China's reputation. It has deployed a large internal security apparatus, including an 800,000-strong police force, a 1.5 million-strong paramilitary force, and the 2.25 million-strong People's Liberation Army with a domestic stability mandate. Other agencies involved in internal security include the Party's Propaganda Department and the Ministry of State Security. Since 1978, the CCP has prioritized maintaining social stability and has built a large internal security apparatus, including the police, paramilitary forces, and the People's Liberation Army. The Ministry of State Security focuses on internal security threats and intelligence-gathering abroad, while the Ministry of Justice operates China's prison system. China's spending on internal security agencies has surpassed its military spending since 2010, with a planned budget of $123.7 billion in 2013 compared to $119 billion on defense. The Party's Central Commission of Politics and Law oversees these agencies, with the head of the Commission now sitting at the Politburo level. Since 1978, the CCP has focused on building governing institutions and laws to handle rapid development and global interactions. The Party has undergone seven government re-organizations in the last 30 years, creating new agencies and committees. Despite these reforms, some challenges persist in the Chinese system, affecting effective governance. Some enduring challenges in the Chinese system undermine effective governance, such as \"stove-piping\" where ministries share information vertically but not horizontally. China lacks a coordinating body like the U.S. National Security Council. Leading Small Groups attempt to coordinate policy but vary in activity and are reluctant to enforce daily coordination. The U.S. values mechanisms like the Strategic & Economic Dialogue for bringing multiple Chinese agencies together for discussions. The Chinese government faces challenges in governance due to unproductive competition among official entities, leading to overlapping jurisdiction and bureaucratic competition. A government restructuring in 2013 aimed to address this by merging divisions and agencies under single organizations. The Chinese government's bureaucratic competition is exacerbated by rank consciousness, hindering inter-agency coordination and undermining lines of authority. Entities of equivalent rank cannot issue binding orders to each other, leading to difficulties in achieving successful coordination. The Chinese government's bureaucratic competition is hindered by rank consciousness, making coordination difficult. Entities of lesser rank face challenges when trying to coordinate with higher-ranking entities, such as the People's Liberation Army and the Foreign Ministry. State-owned enterprises sometimes outrank Party and state leaders in their jurisdictions, further complicating coordination efforts. The rank system in China hinders effective regulatory oversight, as entities with equal rank resist oversight. One proposed solution is to abolish administrative ranks for leaders of state-owned enterprises, financial institutions, and universities. The slow pace of reform in China's rank system for state-owned enterprises is due to leaders' reluctance to give up privileges like expensive cars, housing, and exclusive healthcare. Only Shanghai and Guangzhou have shown interest in implementing the proposed abolition of administrative ranks. The U.S.-China relationship faces challenges due to differing rank systems. The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue allows U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury and State to engage with higher-ranking Chinese officials. However, the U.S. Secretary of Defense still interacts with a lower-ranking Chinese counterpart. U.S. officials are frustrated by Chinese counterparts' lack of enforcement of policies and laws. The Chinese Communist Party's attitude towards the law is a key factor contributing to the lack of enforcement of policies and laws by Chinese counterparts. The Party supports rule by law but not rule of law, holding itself above legal restraints and preventing judicial authorities from investigating Party members without consent. This situation creates an unclear legal basis for the Party's powers. The Chinese Communist Party conducts its own investigations into Party officials accused of wrongdoing and decides whether to hand them over to the state judiciary. The Party denies judiciary independence and intervenes in legal processes to serve its interests, undermining the authority of the law. Officials prioritize economic development and stability over ruling lawfully, while civil society groups advocate for greater monitoring of rule enforcement, which the CCP resists. The CCP resists greater monitoring of rule enforcement, fearing empowering groups outside its control. Multiple coalitions, factions, and constituencies exist within China's political system, formed based on political mentorship, place of birth, affiliations, and common educational/work history. Former Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin promoted officials he knew from his time in Shanghai, who shared his interest in economic growth and breaking down ideological barriers. Jiang played a significant role in placing factional allies on the new Politburo Standing Committee. Competition within the Chinese Communist Party and the state is based on bureaucratic constituencies, with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology supporting industry against the Ministry of Environment. Widespread corruption in China includes lavish gifts, bribes for permits and jobs, embezzlement of state funds, and exemptions from laws for friends and relatives. China's economy has seen a significant increase in corruption over the past 30 years, with corrupt officials fleeing overseas with stolen funds amounting to billions of dollars. Estimates suggest that illicit financial flows out of China are in the trillions, with the country ranking 80th on the Corruption Perceptions Index. The United States is ranked 19th on the same index. Xi Jinping, after becoming Communist Party General Secretary in 2012, acknowledged corruption as a major issue within the Party. Despite efforts to address the problem internally, critics argue that the Party's lack of external supervision has allowed corruption to thrive. Investigations by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission are seen as politically motivated, leading to selective enforcement against officials. Corruption within the Communist Party of China is a major issue, with some officials engaging in large-scale corruption while others face investigations for lesser infractions. Suggestions to tackle corruption include media playing a watchdog role and officials disclosing family assets. Journalists who expose wrongdoing face risks, but microbloggers have successfully exposed corrupt officials. One high-profile case involved a local official wearing 11 luxury wristwatches, one worth more than twice his annual salary. The Communist Party's 82.6 million members make up 6% of China's population. In China, the Communist Party has 82.6 million members, representing 6% of the population. Party membership is prestigious but acceptance rates are low. Most members are male and work for the Party or State. Members must adhere to Party policies and be organized into specific units for regular activities. Party units exist in official and semi-official organizations, including private businesses. The Communist Party in China has a significant presence in universities, private businesses, and civil society organizations. Party bodies hold power within institutions and control avenues for career advancement. Party policy is communicated through directives and study campaigns to ensure ideological conformity among members. In 2009, the Party's Propaganda Department ordered nationwide study sessions on the \"Six Why's\" as part of a campaign on socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) is the most powerful decision-making entity in the Party, comprised of seven members from the broader Politburo. The Central Committee, with 205 full members, is the senior grouping of Communist Party officials supporting the Politburo. The Central Committee of the Communist Party has 205 full members and 171 alternate members. The Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) is the top decision-making body with seven members, each responsible for specific portfolios. The top-ranked PSC members also hold key positions in the political system, such as Party General Secretary Xi Jinping serving as Chairman of the Central Military Commission and State President. Other PSC members head Party \"Leading Small Groups\" for policy areas to facilitate coordination in implementing decisions. The Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) and the full Politburo are key decision-making bodies in the Communist Party, with the PSC having seven members responsible for specific portfolios. The full Politburo, consisting of 25 members, meets infrequently and focuses on major policy areas or national meetings. The PSC and Politburo derive their power from the Central Committee, with the PSC playing a crucial role in implementing decisions. The Central Committee, composed of leaders from various sectors, is elected by delegates to Party National Congresses every five years. Incumbent officials provide a list of nominees to the Central Committee, which ratifies it. The 17th Central Committee had members from provinces, central ministries, the military, Party organizations, and other constituencies. Delegates approve the Party General Secretary's report at the Party Congress, outlining the Party's agenda for the next five years. The Central Committee meets at least once a year in plenums to set the country's direction and make major personnel decisions. The Fifth Plenum of the 17th Central Committee in October 2010 discussed and approved the 12th Five-Year Plan for China's economy. Xi Jinping was appointed first vice chairman of the CMC, signaling his preparation to become the top official in the Communist Party in 2012. The CCP issues a public communiqu\u00e9 after each plenum to announce major decisions. The Party operates an extensive bureaucracy under the Central Committee and Party Secretariat, with the anti-corruption body represented on the Politburo Standing Committee. The Organization Department is responsible for recruiting and training Party members, while the Propaganda Department controls messaging and media. The Propaganda Department manages media and ideology for the Party, working with the Organization Department. The Central Commission of Politics and Law ensures Party control over internal security. Notable departments like the United Front Work Department are not represented below the Politburo level. The Politburo oversees various departments such as the United Front Work Department, International Department, and Foreign Affairs Leading Small Group Office. The People's Liberation Army reports to both Party Central Military Commission and State CMC, with Xi Jinping heading both bodies. The Party CMC holds authority over all armed forces in China. The Central Military Commission (CMC) in China has a civilian chairman, two uniformed vice chairmen, and eight uniformed regular members. The CMC directs the armed forces through four general departments: General Staff Department, General Political Department, General Logistics Department, and General Armament Department. The PLA's Department is responsible for weapons, equipment, electronics, and space program. It directs service branches like the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Second Artillery Corps, as well as military regions and paramilitary forces. The PLA's role in politics has been debated, with a trend towards removing the military from elite politics and institutionalizing its role as a professional force. The military's role in elite politics is decreasing, with a focus on professionalization. Despite limited representation in top Party bodies, the military maintains a direct line to the Communist Party General Secretary through the Central Military Commission. Senior military officers also participate in Party \"Leading Small Groups\" on various issues. Military officers in academic positions have become influential media commentators and bloggers, often expressing hawkish views. The Chinese military's role in elite politics is decreasing as it focuses on professionalization. Most military experts are affiliated with the Academy of Military Sciences or the National Defense University. The State system in China operates separately from the Communist Party, with the Party maintaining control over the government to ensure its influence. The Chinese State system operates separately from the Communist Party, with Party officials holding concurrent positions in the State system. While the Party sets policy and makes major decisions, the State implements and executes policies, focusing on managing the economy. Government officials are civil servants, with most being CCP members but not a requirement for higher positions. The Minister of Science and Technology in China is a member of a minor party and also chairs a satellite party. China's highest state officials are the State President and Vice President, with the General Secretaries of the Communist Party often serving as State President concurrently for symbolic purposes. The General Secretary of the Communist Party holds real power in China, while the State Council, headed by the Premier, manages the economy. Ministries report to the State Council, with some directly reporting to Communist Party entities. The Premier is China's most senior economic official, with four State Council Vice Premiers assisting. The Vice Premiers and State Councilors in China have specific portfolios, with the foreign affairs portfolio overseen by a State Councilor. Ministries and commissions under the State Council are competitive institutions with overlapping jurisdiction, each led by a Minister or Chairman with a Communist Party committee making major decisions. The Minister or Chairman of ministries in China oversees ideology and personnel matters, with the exception of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Despite being subordinate to the State Council and CCP, ministries can influence policy by drafting laws and regulations. For example, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology led the development of industrial policies supporting domestic firms after General Secretary Hu Jintao's call for \"indigenous innovation.\" The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) in China implemented policies to support domestic firms over foreign rivals, promoting \"indigenous innovation.\" This included making domestic technology the standard for 3G mobile telecommunications, requiring Chinese-made censorship software on new computers, and giving preference to domestic suppliers in government procurement. MIIT, along with the National Development and Reform Commission, are powerful in policy debates. The State Council's Legislative Affairs Office plays a key role in drafting national regulations and laws. The National People's Congress drafts the government's legislative agenda annually and collaborates with relevant ministries to implement it. Regulations are issued by the State Council or ministries, while laws require approval from the NPC. The NPC oversees matters related to Hong Kong and Macao, as well as other offices like the Research Office and Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. The NPC's main event is its annual full session in March, attended by nearly 3,000 deputies. In March 2013, the new five-year Congress, the 12th, approved new State and Congress leaders, including a President, Vice President, Premier, Vice Premiers, and State Councilors. NPC deputies usually vote to approve reports, laws, and candidates at annual full sessions, with some pushing back. Unlike the U.S. Congress, the NPC does not pass spending bills but approves the budget presented by the Minister of Finance. Individual NPC deputies can submit proposals for reforms or better law implementation. The National People's Congress (NPC) allows deputies to submit proposals for reforms or better law implementation, to which officials must respond in writing. The NPC's work is mainly carried out by its Standing Committee, composed of retired senior Party and state officials, heads of democratic parties, and leading figures from various fields. Other important NPC bodies include specialized committees and expert bodies. The NPC is the highest level of People's Congresses nationwide. The National People's Congress (NPC) is the highest level of People's Congresses nationwide in China. Since 2011, there has been a rise in independent candidates contesting elections for People's Congresses in city districts and townships, facing official harassment such as surveillance, detention, intimidation, censorship, and election irregularities. Despite these challenges, some independent candidates have been successfully elected. The CPPCC system in China engages in political consultation with the Communist Party, democratic supervision, and participation in state affairs. It allows select citizens to make policy suggestions but lacks power to enforce them. The system is referred to as a core part of China's socialist democracy, led by the Communist Party. The Communist Party in China operates a \"multi-party cooperation system\" with eight minor political parties. These parties are required to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and work together in developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. They are not allowed to operate as opposition parties and have limited influence in the political system. The minor parties in China are given leadership positions in the state bureaucracy, legislatures, and political advisory bodies. The heads of these parties serve as vice-chairmen of the National People's Congress, making them state leaders for protocol purposes. In 2007, Wan Gang became the first minor party member in the post-Mao era to be named to a ministerial post. As of 2011, there were only 19 non-Communist Party members in leadership positions within the government and party power structures. The PRC political system is influenced by various political actors known as \"policy entrepreneurs,\" some of whom operate behind the scenes. The media plays a crucial role in amplifying their voices, despite Party controls. With the rise of commercially driven media, traditional media subsidies have decreased, leading to a more diverse media landscape. The Chinese media landscape has become more diverse due to the rise of commercially driven media, eroding the Party's control over public discourse. Traditional Communist Party media outlets now coexist with more provocative publications that expose scandals and report on policy debates. Despite being subject to censorship, these publications challenge Party-approved news. The Chinese media landscape includes traditional Communist Party media outlets like Southern Daily and China Central Television (CCTV), which relay Party-approved messages. However, there are also more provocative publications like Caixin New Century Weekly and Caijing that offer probing analysis of policy issues. The rise of Twitter-like services known as \"weibo\" has empowered citizens to share news and views, challenging the Party's control over public discourse. The rise of \"weibo\" in China has allowed citizens to share news and views directly, putting pressure on traditional media and authorities. As of January 2013, 42.1% of Chinese were online, with 564 million Internet users. Nearly 75% accessed the Internet on mobile devices, and 309 million were weibo users. Authorities monitor weibo posts and have made arrests for online \"rumor mongering.\" The CCP has also encouraged official agencies and officials to use weibo to their advantage. The CCP has encouraged official agencies and officials to use weibo as a propaganda tool. Chinese officials monitor weibo for public opinion, influenced by nationalist views of \"netizens.\" State-owned enterprises in strategic industries have become global powerhouses due to government policies. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in China have become global powerhouses, with three Chinese SOEs ranking in the top 10 firms on the Fortune Global 500 list for 2012. SOE bosses are appointed by the Party's Organization Department and have a formal place in the Chinese political system. They can influence policymaking and agenda-setting due to their bureaucratic rank, technical knowledge, and economic power. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission oversees 115 central government-level SOEs. The Party expects SOE bosses to advance its interests, with private firm leaders also influential in Chinese politics. Property developers are a powerful interest group, resisting government control. Prominent businesspeople are awarded political positions, with the richest delegates to the National People's Congress having significant wealth. In 2011, the richest 70 delegates to the National People's Congress had a combined net worth of $89.8 billion. China has 429 think tanks, with 6 Chinese think tanks ranked among the top 100 globally. These think tanks influence policy by accepting commissions from the Party or state and self-generating reports for policymakers. China has 429 think tanks, with 6 Chinese think tanks ranked among the top 100 globally. These think tanks influence policy by accepting commissions from the Party or state and self-generating reports for policymakers. Experts attached to the institutes also serve as advisors, publish broadly, and inform the outside world about Chinese policy discourse. Notably, all Chinese think tanks named in the survey are located in Beijing or Shanghai, with only one being described as independent. China's academic community includes over 1,100 degree-granting institutions, with more than four dozen universities managed by the military or central government ministries. These universities are not independent and have Communist Party committees making major decisions. 32 universities have quasi ministerial bureaucratic rank. The China University Alumni Association ranks universities based on alumni who are members of the Communist Party Central Committee. Many social organizations in China are GONGOs, criticized for being retirement homes for officials. GONGO leaders, often retired senior officials, have influence due to their government connections. Under-staffed ministries and Communist Party departments often outsource work to GONGOs, which act as proxies for the government at international meetings. Different agencies sponsor varying numbers of GONGOs, with some industry associations providing perspectives from corporate leaders on policy issues. Grassroots NGOs in China need government sponsorship to be officially registered as \"social organizations,\" but Guangdong Province is experimenting with waiving this requirement. Some grassroots NGOs in China face obstacles in obtaining government sponsorship to be officially registered. Despite challenges, these NGOs have successfully raised public awareness on issues like environmental protection and public health, and provided services to under-served populations. For example, the Beijing Yirenping Center focuses on combating discrimination based on health status or disability by utilizing various advocacy tactics within the Chinese political system. Some grassroots NGOs in China have organized petitions and open letters to advocate for the revision of discriminatory laws against groups like carriers of Hepatitis B and HIV. Former Premier Wen Jiabao has made comments supporting political reform, including the need for a democratic election system, an independent judicial system, and freedom of speech. In 2012, Wen Jiabao called for political structural reform, emphasizing the need for reform in the leadership system of the Party and the state. He expressed support for the Arab Spring and the demand for democracy. However, other top officials, like Wu Bangguo, emphasized the limits of political reform in China. In 2012, two-ranked official reinforced the Party's insistence on its permanent rule, rejecting multiple parties in power and advocating for centralized power. Xi Jinping emphasized the need to abide by the constitution and laws, restricting power with regulations, and Party supervision. No mention of an independent judiciary was made. The Communist Party's Propaganda Department justifies its permanent monopoly on power by criticizing Western political systems as inefficient and unable to deliver rapid economic growth like China needs. The Party argues that competitive multi-party politics leads to social divisions, political instability, and hinders economic development. The Communist Party in China has been implementing reforms to improve governance without compromising its control over major decisions. In the 1980s, limited direct elections were allowed at the village level to enhance support for local leaders and combat corruption. The Communist Party in China has implemented reforms to improve governance while maintaining control. Limited direct elections at the village level were introduced in the 1980s to support local leaders and fight corruption. Village elections are overseen by party officials, with restrictions on candidates and campaigning. Recent innovations include workplace elections and increased transparency measures. Premier Wen expressed support for expanding direct elections to higher levels of government. The Communist Party in China has implemented reforms to improve governance while maintaining control. Limited direct elections at the village level were introduced in the 1980s to support local leaders and fight corruption. Recent innovations include workplace elections and increased transparency measures. Comprehensive ministerial and provincial government websites are a product of open government information regulations. However, these reforms appear to be designed to prevent Chinese citizens from having a direct role in selecting their top leaders."
