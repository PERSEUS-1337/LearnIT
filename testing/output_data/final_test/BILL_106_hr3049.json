    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Debt Emancipation to Enable Democracies (DEED) Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund have classified 40 heavily indebted poor countries. These countries owe the United States $6,752,100,000 in debt, with 83 percent classified as having low human development. Since the 1980s, these countries have struggled to service their debt, leading to an increase in the total amount owed to external creditors. The debt burden on heavily indebted poor countries has increased significantly, with the total amount owed to external creditors rising from $122 billion in the 1983-1985 period to $221 billion in the 1993-1995 period. This debt overhang hinders development spending and productive investment, undermining efforts to promote good governance and accountability. The Jubilee 2000 campaign is advocating for the cancellation of external debts for the poorest countries. The term \"eligible country\" in this Act refers to heavily indebted poor countries identified by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund under the HIPC Initiative, as well as Haiti. Additionally, the Act includes the cancellation of bilateral debt owed to the United States government by heavily indebted poor countries. The President shall cancel all amounts owed to the United States by eligible countries as a result of loans, guarantees, or credits. This applies only to countries with democratic governments promoting civilian control of the military, rule of law, and equality before the law. The President shall cancel debts owed by eligible countries with democratic governments promoting rule of law, equality, and respect for individual rights. This includes strengthening political, legislative, and civil institutions, as well as combating corruption. Debt cancellation under this section is not considered assistance and can override certain prohibitions. The President can cancel debts of eligible countries with democratic governments promoting rule of law, equality, and respect for individual rights, despite certain prohibitions. Conditional ban on providing funds to the IMF until debt owed by heavily indebted poor countries is canceled. Conditional ban on providing funds to the IMF until debts owed by eligible countries are canceled, Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility is terminated, and loans are no longer linked to structural adjustment policies. SEC. 6. Overseas Private Investment Corporation activities in heavily indebted poor countries contingent on debt relief for poverty reduction. The Corporation may engage in various financial activities in heavily indebted poor countries only if debt relief is provided for poverty reduction, as certified by the President to Congress. This applies to contracts for insurance, loans, and other agreements under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Corporation can engage in financial activities in heavily indebted poor countries only if debt relief is provided for poverty reduction, as certified by the President to Congress. This includes contracts for insurance, loans, and other agreements authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, entered into after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 7. NOTIFICATION.\n\nWithin 30 days of this Act's enactment, the Treasury Secretary must notify eligible countries of the US policy to cancel their debts, advocate for debt cancellation at the IMF, ensure debt relief funds are used for poverty reduction, and withhold funding from countries not using debt relief for poverty reduction.\n\nSEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT. Private Enforcement allows a US citizen to sue the US government for non-compliance with the Act. No funds can be given to the IMF while a lawsuit is ongoing. If the Treasury Secretary's certification is found to be arbitrary, the plaintiff is awarded $100 plus legal fees, and IMF funding is withheld. The IMF funding is withheld until the Secretary's certification is found to be non-arbitrary."
