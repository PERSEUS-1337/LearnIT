    "content": "The \"Professional Sports Integrity Act of 2005\" aims to protect the integrity of professional sports and enhance health and safety standards for major sports leagues by implementing minimum standards and procedures for testing prohibited substances and methods. The Act defines terms related to professional sports, such as \"professional baseball, basketball, football, or hockey game,\" \"major professional league,\" and \"professional athlete.\" It also includes provisions for testing banned substances for certain professional athletes. The Act prohibits major professional leagues from organizing games without meeting testing requirements for prohibited substances. Each athlete must be tested at least 4 times a year, including random testing during each season of play. Each major professional league must conduct at least 4 drug tests per year on athletes, including random testing during the season and off-season. Additional tests can be conducted if there is reasonable cause to suspect a violation. Athletes are not notified in advance of tests, and samples can be blood or urine, with testing methods consulted with the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Each professional athlete must be tested for prohibited substances determined by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Samples are analyzed by an approved laboratory, and a positive test results in penalties. Penalties for professional athletes testing positive include a minimum 2-year suspension for the first offense and permanent ban for the second offense, with loss of pay during suspension. Positive test results are disclosed publicly, and athletes have the right to appeal any penalties imposed. The major professional leagues consult with the US Anti-Doping Agency on procedures for adjudication and appeals. SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. The Federal Trade Commission has the authority to enforce violations of section 4 as unfair or deceptive acts. They will enforce this Act in the same manner as the Federal Trade Commission Act, with the ability to extend requirements to other professional sports leagues. The Federal Trade Commission can enforce violations of section 4 as unfair or deceptive acts, extending requirements to other professional sports leagues and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. SEC. 6. REPORTING REQUIREMENT. Major professional leagues must report testing policies and procedures to the Federal Trade Commission and congressional committees every 2 years, including data on tests conducted and outcomes without revealing athlete names. Congress believes that other professional sports leagues should implement similar steroid testing policies as required by this Act."
