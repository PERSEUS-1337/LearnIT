    "content": "In a significant policy shift, the Syrian government agreed to destroy its chemical weapons stocks and joined the Chemical Weapons Convention on September 12, following a U.S.-Russian diplomatic initiative. President Obama had sought congressional authorization for military action in response to a chemical weapons attack by Syria but postponed the vote. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced a Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons on September 14, with target dates for inspections and destruction set for November 2013. The Syrian government agreed to destroy its chemical weapons stocks and joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in September 2013. The government submitted a declaration to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) on September 20, 2013, detailing its stocks, munitions, precursor chemicals, and production facilities. The OPCW recommended a plan for destruction, approved by its Executive Council on September 27, 2013. International inspectors were to verify the declaration's accuracy and oversee the destruction process starting in October 2013. The United Nations and the OPCW have experience monitoring the destruction of chemical weapons in various countries. Syria has requested technical assistance for dismantling chemical weapons, likely involving U.S. support. Failure to comply could lead to sanctions or military action under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118. The U.N. Mission investigated the use of chemical weapons in Syria, concluding that sarin nerve agent rockets were used on civilians in Damascus. The international community faces concerns about the Syrian regime's use and control of chemical weapons, with reports confirming their use against opposition forces. President Obama and other governments have acknowledged these findings. President Obama and other world leaders warned of consequences for the use of chemical weapons in Syria, with the possibility of military action. Obama stated that the US would consider military action if Syria used or lost control of its chemical weapons. He later sought authorization from Congress for military action against Syrian regime targets. The White House confirmed the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons against the opposition. In 2013, the Syrian government was reported to have used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times. In response, the President authorized the expansion of military assistance to opposition forces. The US government expressed confidence in the security of Syria's chemical weapons by the Asad regime. Plans were made to secure the weapons in case the regime lost control, presenting unique challenges. Defense Secretary Panetta stated the situation in Syria was much worse than in Libya. The Pentagon estimates that over 75,000 troops would be needed to neutralize Syria's chemical weapons in a non-permissive environment. Concerns have been raised about securing these sites due to potential scenarios like Syrian government use of chemical weapons or loss of control. The US and other governments have warned of military intervention if chemical weapons are used, while also urging Russia to help maintain control over the weapons. Some suggest rewarding Syrian government commanders for securing chemical weapons from extremists. Other options include assisting the Free Syrian Army in securing these facilities. The ultimate goal is to prevent extremist groups from obtaining chemical weapons, but there are limits to monitoring and intelligence on their security. Specific scenarios for securing these weapons have not been openly discussed. Some analysts propose advanced planning for international teams to secure chemical weapons in Syria. Joint exercises in Jordan in 2012 included scenarios for securing these stocks. The United States and the Czech Republic are cooperating on NATO chemical defense preparation. Israeli President Shimon Peres has appealed to Russian President Putin to ensure the security of chemical weapons. Secretary Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov are discussing a proposal in Geneva for securing the chemical weapons stockpile in Syria. The ODNI report to Congress in 2011 stated that Syria has had a chemical warfare program since the mid-1980s, possibly in response to a perceived threat from Israel. Syria received chemical weapons from Egypt before the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and expanded its program in the late 1970s and early 1980s with support from the Soviet Union. Syria received chemical weapons and support from the Soviet Union in the late 1970s and early 1980s. U.S. government documents suggest that Syria has been seeking self-sufficiency in chemical weapons since the mid-1980s, procuring equipment and chemicals from Western Europe. Damascus has been enhancing its chemical weapon capability, aiming for an independent chemical warfare program. Syria has been enhancing its chemical warfare capability, aiming for an independent program. Despite not signing the Chemical Weapons Convention, Syria has renounced the use of chemical or biological weapons in warfare. Their ratification of the CWC is contingent on establishing a weapons of mass destruction-free zone in the Middle East. Syrian Foreign Minister supports the establishment of a chemical weapons-free zone in the Middle East. UK intelligence believes Syria has vast stockpiles of chemical weapons. Israel describes Syria's arsenal as the largest globally. U.S. assessments confirm Syria's possession of mustard blister agent, sarin nerve agent, and VX nerve agent. French intelligence reports over 1,000 metric tons of chemical warfare agents in Syria, including several hundred metric tons of sarin. Syria possesses a significant amount of chemical weapons, including mustard agent, sarin, and VX nerve agent. These weapons are stored in various locations throughout the country. The Syrian government is also developing new chemical agents. Syria's chemical weapons program relies on foreign sources for key precursor chemicals, as stated in the ODNI report for 2011. The country lacks the capacity to independently produce these chemicals, which are used to create blister or nerve agents. The potency of Syrian chemical agents is unknown, but they have been used with some effectiveness. These agents can be delivered through aerial bombs, ballistic missiles, and artillery rockets. Syria possesses thousands of munitions for chemical warfare agents and has the ability to strike multiple locations simultaneously with several thousand delivery vehicles, including ballistic missiles. The country also has several hundred mobile Scud B, Scud C, Scud D, and SS-21 short-range ballistic missiles. Reports on Syria's Scud missile inventory have varied over the years, with uncertainty on which missiles are tasked with delivering chemical weapons. While a 1988 U.S. assessment pointed to Scud B missiles as delivery vehicles for chemical weapons, more recent reports have been less precise. Syria is believed to have chemical warheads available for a portion of its Scud missile force, capable of delivering sarin, VX, and mustard agent. Persistent agents are seen as more effectively employed by missile warheads than non-persistent agents. The September 2013 French intelligence assessment provides details on Syria's ballistic missiles, including Scud C missiles capable of delivering sarin, VX, and mustard agent, Scud B missiles capable of delivering sarin and VX, SS-21 missiles capable of delivering sarin, mustard agent, and VX, and M600 missiles capable of delivering sarin, mustard agent, and VX. Syria's M600 missiles are capable of delivering sarin, mustard agent, and VX. The country also has 500-kilogram aerial bombs containing sarin and artillery rockets with ranges of 50 kilometers that can deliver chemical agents. Rocket launchers can be used to rapidly achieve this. Syria possesses various tactical munitions capable of delivering sarin at ranges of less than 50 km, including rocket launchers and artillery rockets. These weapons can be used on the battlefield against rebel forces, with known difficulties in controlling gas clouds, risking own troops, and contaminating the area for days or weeks. Syria's chemical munitions stockpile includes unitary and binary designs, with uncertainty in delivery due to dissipation or volatility of the agent. The exact composition is not publicly known, but it is believed to include sarin, mustard, and VX components. Syria's weapons stockpile includes sarin, mustard, and VX components. The process of filling unitary chemical munitions is hazardous for troops. If Syria used binary munitions, warheads could be deployed immediately. The Asad regime views chemical weapons as one of many tools in its arsenal. The Asad government in Syria has adapted its chemical weapons tactics to terrorize the population, using lower amounts of chemical agents for localized purposes. President Asad is the ultimate decision maker for the program, managed by the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center. The center, subordinate to the Ministry of Defense, includes Branch 450. Branch 450, a part of the Syrian military organization, is responsible for filling and securing chemical weapons. Syrian officials have stated that these weapons will only be used in case of external aggression, not in the Syrian crisis. Syrian officials have tried to clarify statements regarding the country's possession of chemical weapons, denying any admission of such weapons. They have been ambiguous in their responses, with the Information Minister denying the use of chemical weapons and reiterating that Syria does not possess them. Syrian officials have denied possessing chemical weapons and reiterated their stance that they will not use such weapons, even in armed conflict with Israel. President Asad has neither confirmed nor denied the possession of chemical weapons, and the Syrian government denied carrying out attacks in August 2013. Syrian officials denied carrying out the August 21, 2013, attacks. Foreign Minister Moallem admitted to the chemical arsenal and agreed to reveal the locations for inspection. The Syrian government acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and submitted a declaration of its chemical weapons stocks. The United States had discussions with Damascus on chemical weapons security. Officials from the Obama Administration and other governments have expressed concern about the security of Syria's chemical weapons, but U.S. officials have stated that the weapons stockpiles are secure. Former White House spokesperson Tommy Vietor noted that Syria's chemical weapons remain under government control. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta mentioned that some chemicals were moved to enhance security, but the main sites are still secure. Press reports of chemical weapons movement surfaced in December 2012. According to officials, there are concerns about Syria's chemical weapons security, but the Assad regime is believed to maintain control. Various government officials have stated that the weapons are secure for now. Ryabkov and British officials confirm Syrian government's control over chemical weapons, while some opposition groups seek capability. US and regional governments, including Israel, are working to ensure security. During a July 29, 2012 press briefing, Secretary of Defense Panetta mentioned Jordan, Turkey, and other allies as partners in efforts regarding Syria's chemical weapons. US and British officials claim knowledge of the locations of these weapons, with Deputy National Security Advisor Rhodes stating that while not certain of every munition, they have a general sense of the regime's control and locations. According to officials from France, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States, there is evidence that the Syrian government has used sarin nerve agent against opposition forces. White House expressed increasing concern about the regime using chemical weapons. Israeli military intelligence stated that Syria is preparing to use its chemical weapons, and British intelligence indicated a low threshold for their use. Director of National Intelligence also raised concerns about Syria's chemical weapons. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned that the Syrian regime, facing difficulties with conventional warfare, may resort to using chemical weapons against its own people. Allegations of chemical weapon use by both sides in the conflict emerged, with the Syrian government requesting a UN investigation into opposition forces' alleged use of chemical weapons in Khan al-Assal. Opposition forces also accused the regime of using chemical weapons in other recent attacks. The United Kingdom and France provided evidence to the U.N. Secretary General of chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime in recent attacks. U.S. intelligence assessed that the regime likely used sarin gas on a small scale in Syria. The White House official explained that U.S. intelligence on Syrian chemical weapons use is based on a mosaic of information that needs further investigation to establish a definitive judgment. Physical evidence contributed to the intelligence assessment, but uncertainty about the chain of custody precluded confirmation of how the exposure occurred. Secretary of State John Kerry stated that the U.S. has evidence of Syrian chemical weapons use. On May 28, 2013, the United States stated it had \"evidence\" of Syrian chemical weapons use, but clarified it was an intelligence assessment. On June 13, 2013, the White House confirmed that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons, including sarin nerve agent, multiple times against the opposition in the past year. Multiple sources of information supported this assessment, including attack planning, execution reports, symptoms consistent with chemical exposure, and analysis of physiological samples showing exposure to sarin. The analysis of physiological samples revealed exposure to sarin, indicating chemical weapons use in Syria resulting in an estimated 100-150 deaths. However, the positive results do not specify how or where individuals were exposed or who was responsible for dissemination. The U.S. assessment evolved from an initial intelligence assessment in April to gathering additional corroborating facts to raise confidence levels. The intelligence community pieced together information from various sources, including on-the-ground reports, physiological samples, open source reporting, and intelligence reports, to increase confidence in the assessment of chemical weapons use. This led to the announcement made by the President after firming up the assessment over several weeks. The U.S. assessment in June 2013 concluded that Syria had used chemical weapons multiple times in the past year to gain an advantage in conflict. The United Kingdom and France also supported this claim. The United Kingdom and France supported the U.S. assessment that Syria had used chemical weapons, including sarin, multiple times. British intelligence reported that the Syrian government used chemical weapons on at least 14 occasions before the August 21, 2013 attack. There was no evidence of opposition groups using chemical weapons in Syria. French Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the use of sarin gas by the Syrian government, including spraying it by helicopter. They stated that there is no indication of opposition groups using chemical weapons. The French government confirmed the use of sarin gas by the Syrian regime, with one set of samples showing its presence but not attributing it directly. French intelligence suggested that Syria may have used chemicals for non-chemical weapons purposes. Israel's assessment also indicated a high probability of chemical weapon usage by the Syrian military. The Israeli military assessment indicates a high probability of chemical weapon usage by the Syrian military, but it is not definitive proof. Russia has expressed skepticism towards these assessments, stating that they have found no credible evidence of Syrian chemical weapons use. Additionally, Russia claims that only opposition fighters in Syria have used chemical weapons. Experts' analysis suggests that only fighters of the armed opposition used chemical weapons at the Khal al-Assal site, with the weapons not meeting standard production criteria. Russia's Lavrov provided details, stating the missile and sarin gas used did not meet industrial standards and were made in Syria-controlled territory. Russian experts analyzed samples from the site, while US and UK officials deny opposition groups possessing or using chemical weapons. Russian officials have expressed skepticism about claims of Syrian government chemical weapons use, citing lack of convincing evidence and illogical timing. Other governments have also shown uncertainty, with the G8 condemning any use of chemical weapons in Syria without confirming their use. The Friends of Syria Core Group referred to the \"reported use\" of chemical weapons by the regime. The Syrian government used chemical weapons on August 21, 2013, killing 1,429 people according to the US assessment. The attack was confirmed by the UK and French intelligence reports. The French report suggests that the Syrian government has crossed a threshold to large-scale chemical weapons use, with concerns of future attacks. The US believes regime officials directed the August 21 attack, based on intercepted communications. The lack of a clear trigger for the regime's use of chemical weapons on a larger scale is noted. The British assessment suggests that President Asad likely delegated permission to use chemical weapons to senior regime commanders. Only Asad and influential clan members have the authority to order such attacks, which are carried out by the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center and armed forces. Opposition forces are not responsible for the chemical attack. The Syrian opposition is unlikely to have carried out the chemical attack on August 21, as stated by White House, British, and French assessments. They lack the capability and history of using chemical weapons, according to the assessments. President Obama also mentioned that the opposition does not have the means to carry out such attacks. The 2013 French report concluded that Syrian opposition forces were unlikely to have the capability to conduct the chemical weapons attack on August 21. The report highlighted evidence such as victim testimony, videos, and affected children at multiple locations. The Syrian government initially called for a U.N. investigation into chemical weapons use by opposition forces on March 19, 2013, but wanted to limit the investigation scope. The U.N. and Syria agreed on procedures for inspections in late July 2013. U.N. inspectors, led by Ake Sellstrom, arrived in Syria on August 18 to determine if chemical weapons were used. The U.N. is cooperating with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the investigation, emphasizing the need for swift access to relevant sites. The British intelligence assessment from August 29, 2013, highlighted the importance of timely access to affected sites for collecting environmental samples to determine the use of chemical weapons. France, the United Kingdom, and the United States supported the investigation and emphasized the need for establishing a chain of evidence. The U.S. intended to provide updated intelligence assessment to the U.N. Secretary General. The U.N. Secretary General received letters from various countries regarding alleged chemical weapons use in Syria. The G8 statement called for an objective investigation by a U.N. team with expertise from OPCW and WHO. The report should be delivered to the U.N. Security Council for assessment. The U.N. team, led by Sellestrom and U.N. High Representative Angela Kane, met with Syrian officials in Damascus to discuss the investigation. The team, consisting of experts from OPCW and WHO, arrived in Syria on August 18 to visit the Khal al-Assal site and two other confidential locations. The U.N. inspection team, led by Sellestrom and U.N. High Representative Angela Kane, arrived in Syria on August 18, 2013. The team would conduct on-site visits for up to 14 days, extendable upon mutual consent. Ban emphasized the need for access to reported sites for necessary analyses and sample collection. Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Mekdad assured full cooperation with the inspection team. On August 22, the United Nations requested permission from the Syrian government to investigate the chemical weapons attack near Damascus. The U.N. inspection team, led by Sellestrom and U.N. High Representative Angela Kane, arrived in Syria on August 18, 2013. They were granted permission to investigate the August 21 chemical weapons attack near Damascus. The team collected samples and evidence related to the attack and left Syria on August 31. The inspectors will transfer the gathered material to laboratories in Europe for testing. The U.N. inspection team collected samples related to the chemical weapons attack in Syria and shipped them to laboratories for analysis. The investigation team aims to complete their work promptly, with the final report to be shared with the Security Council and U.N. member states. Secretary Kerry raised concerns about the effectiveness of the inspections, citing restricted access and potential evidence destruction by the Syrian government. The U.N. inspection team faced restricted access during their mission in Syria, but were able to conduct fact-finding activities at priority sites. They were unable to conduct on-site visits at certain locations, including Khan al-Asal. The team prioritized investigating the August 21 chemical attack as per Secretary General Ban's request. Additionally, the Syrian government requested an investigation into alleged chemical attacks by opposition forces, which will be taken seriously. The U.N. inspection team concluded that sarin nerve agent was used in the Ghouta area of Damascus on a large scale. The U.S. may respond with military force to the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons. The international community will hold Syrian officials accountable for failing to control the country's chemical weapons. President Obama warned of possible military engagement if Syria used or lost control of its chemical weapons. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reiterated this policy to the Senate Armed Services Committee. The United States and the international community have plans in place to respond to any confirmed use of chemical weapons by Assad in Syria. President Obama and Secretary Hagel have both emphasized the consequences for such actions, with no option off the table. The White House official stated that the U.S. response to Syrian use of chemical weapons could involve diplomatic initiatives, nonlethal assistance to opposition groups, and humanitarian aid. President Obama announced an increase in non-lethal assistance to the civilian opposition and expanded support to the Supreme Military Council following evidence of chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime. The Administration plans to increase assistance to the opposition in response to Syria's use of chemical weapons. General Martin Dempsey outlined a military option involving airstrikes, no-fly zones, and ground forces to prevent the use or spread of Syrian chemical weapons. This operation would aim to control some chemical weapons and prevent their proliferation. President Obama emphasized the importance of upholding the international norm against chemical weapons and holding countries accountable for breaking it. He expressed the need for military action against Syrian regime targets to prevent further proliferation of chemical weapons, stating that it would not be an open-ended intervention. President Obama emphasized the need for military action against Syrian regime targets to prevent further proliferation of chemical weapons. French President Hollande also supported potential military intervention if chemical weapons were used, emphasizing a limited and collective response without ground troops or regime overthrow. The UK ruled out military operations to overthrow the Syrian regime, but stated that the use of chemical weapons would be a serious matter. The UK did not specify potential actions but did not rule out any options as the crisis deepened. The British Prime Minister ruled out UK participation in strikes on Syria after a vote in the House of Commons. Syria submitted its instrument of accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention on September 14, 2013. On September 14, 2013, a proposed Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons was presented by Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is developing a destruction plan for Syria, adopted on September 27, 2013. President Obama emphasized the need for \"verifiable and enforceable destruction\" of chemical weapons. Implementation issues include verification, access, security, and timelines. Security of chemical weapons stocks is a top priority due to the ongoing civil war in Syria, posing risks for international inspectors. The OPCW Executive Council adopted a decision on September 27, 2013, requiring Syria to destroy its chemical weapons program. Syria's declaration included details of names, types, and quantities of weapons stocks awaiting dismantlement. Security concerns, including physical risks for inspectors and the time-consuming, expensive process of destruction, are key issues in the process. The government responsible for the chemical weapons is tasked with guarding them until dismantlement. Syria's September 19 declaration to the OPCW Executive Council included details of its chemical weapons program, requiring submission of additional information within 7 days and a complete elimination by the first half of 2014. The decision also mandates the destruction of all chemical weapons material and equipment, with intermediate destruction milestones to be determined by November 15, 2013. The decision on Syria's chemical weapons program requires the destruction of production equipment by November 1, 2013. Damascus must cooperate with OPCW inspections starting October 1, 2013, and report monthly on implementation progress. The decision on Syria's chemical weapons program requires destruction of production equipment by November 1, 2013. The OPCW Executive Council will meet within 24 hours if Syria delays meeting requirements. The council may bring the matter to the U.N. Security Council. OPCW has authority to hire personnel for implementation and seek funding from States Parties. The U.S. and Russia have agreed on assessing Syria's chemical weapons. Syria's chemical weapons stockpile includes over 1,000 metric tons of various agents and precursor chemicals, such as sarin, mustard agent, and VX. The proposal outlines the categories of items to be destroyed, including production equipment, delivery systems, and research materials. Delivery vehicles, including Scud-type ballistic missiles, are not specified for destruction. Syria's chemical weapons stockpile includes over 1,000 metric tons of various agents and precursor chemicals, such as sarin, mustard agent, and VX. Damascus possesses Scud-type ballistic missiles, aerial bombs, and artillery rockets. Chemical agents and precursor chemicals could be destroyed outside of Syria, with the possibility of consolidation and destruction in the coastal area. Syria will begin implementing its CWC commitments before the Convention enters into force. The OPCW will adopt necessary measures for an accelerated program to verify the complete destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and capabilities. Target dates for destruction will be set, with an emphasis on the shortest possible final deadline. The proposal outlines target dates for the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons capabilities, with completion of initial inspections by November 2013 and complete elimination by the first half of 2014. Russia, the United States, and the OPCW will work together for security arrangements, with the Syrian government having primary responsibility. Kerry stated that inspectors should have access to all chemical weapons sites if the Asad government cooperates. The international community, including the United States and Russia, will need to contribute technical and financial assistance to ensure safe access to Syrian chemical weapons sites. Both the regime and opposition fighters will bear responsibility for this effort, with the OPCW calling for contributions in its September 27 plan. Countries can support the OPCW directly or provide assistance to Syria. Russia has claimed that opposition forces have used chemical weapons, posing a challenge. Kerry emphasized that all of Syria's chemical weapons are in areas under regime control and should not be in contested areas. The United States and Russia are prepared to provide high-level attention and resources to support the monitoring and destruction mission of the OPCW in Syria. The State Department is waiting for cost estimates from the OPCW, with the Senate approving $13 million for chemical weapons destruction in Syria. Funding is allocated for potential requirements in Syria if a partner is secured for the destruction of chemical weapons stockpile. The US and Russia are ready to support the OPCW in Syria to secure and destroy chemical weapons. Funding may come from G-8 countries and European nations have already contributed to similar efforts. The proposal includes referring non-compliance issues to the UN and a commitment from Washington and Moscow to ensure verification and implementation of a Security Council resolution. The U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118, adopted on September 27, 2013, requires Syria to comply with OPCW decisions and grants immediate access for inspections to prevent unauthorized chemical weapons use. Resolution 2118 mandates Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons program and allows governments to acquire, control, transport, transfer, and destroy identified chemical weapons. The resolution also requires monthly reports on implementation and non-compliance, with measures in place for unauthorized transfer or use of chemical weapons. Resolution 2118 mandates Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons program and allows governments to acquire, control, transport, transfer, and destroy identified chemical weapons. In the event of non-compliance, the Security Council will impose measures under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. The resolution also encourages states to provide support for the OPCW and the U.N., urges governments and all Syrian parties to assist with security arrangements, and requires states to prohibit the procurement of chemical weapons from Syria. Additionally, Resolution 2118 has provisions that apply to non-state actors. The Resolution 2118 mandates Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons program and has provisions regarding non-state actors. There are concerns about Syria's biological weapons program, which is believed to be less advanced than its chemical weapons program. Past U.S. assessments have indicated that Syria was conducting research and development on biological weapons. Syria's biological weapons program was assessed to be less advanced than its chemical weapons program. U.S. reports indicated that Damascus had not progressed much beyond research and development, with only pilot quantities of usable agent produced. Recent assessments suggest that Syria continued to develop an offensive biological weapons capability. Syria's biological weapons program is less advanced than its chemical weapons program. Recent assessments suggest that Syria has been researching biological weapons, but is still not capable of producing them effectively. The United States is concerned about Syria's compliance with arms control agreements regarding biological weapons. The 2013 report indicates uncertainty about Syria's potential use of biological weapons. Director of National Intelligence Clapper suggested that Syria's biological weapons program may be more advanced than previously thought, with the capability for limited agent production. While Syria has not weaponized biological agents, it could potentially modify existing weapon systems for delivery. The 2013 report suggests Syria may have advanced biological weapons capabilities, but not yet weaponized them. Funding from State Department's NDF and DOD's CTR could be used to secure or dismantle Syrian weapons post-regime collapse. CTR funds are aiding Syria's neighbors in bolstering border defenses. CTR funds are being used to assist Syria's neighbors in bolstering border defenses and preventing WMD proliferation from Syria. The Department of Defense is providing over $70 million for activities in Jordan, including training and equipping border security staff to detect and stop chemical weapons transfers. Training and equipment will also be provided to border security staff in Iraq and Turkey in FY2014 to prevent WMD proliferation across borders shared with Syria. In Libya and Iraq, chemical weapons dismantlement programs were conducted with varying success. In Libya, stocks were secured by US-aligned forces after the fall of the Qaddafi regime, while hidden stocks were later discovered. In Iraq, the US undertook similar work in 2003, but previous UN inspections had overestimated stockpiles. Nonproliferation efforts in both countries have focused on engaging former WMD weapons. The focus of nonproliferation programs in Iraq and Libya is engaging former WMD weapons scientists in civilian projects to prevent weapons proliferation. International partners have experience cooperating in dismantling chemical weapons stockpiles. CTR and NDF programs require host country agreement. In Syria, the focus is on bolstering neighboring states' capacity to interdict transfers due to the civil war and potential loss of control over chemical weapons. This poses a new challenge for nonproliferation efforts. The United States government is preparing to secure Syria's known stockpile of chemical weapons to prevent unauthorized access, including by terrorists. Experts suggest making joining the Chemical Weapons Convention a condition for recognition and support of a new government in Syria. The Assad regime has acceded to the Convention, obligating it to destroy its chemical weapons stocks and production facilities. The United States and other countries may contribute funds or technical support for Syrian chemical weapons destruction through the OPCW. Syria's chemical weapons stocks have been addressed in recent legislation, with provisions for dismantling and securing the weapons. The Assad regime is obligated to destroy its stocks and production facilities, with the cooperation of a \"Syrian entity\" to facilitate the process. The Syria Democratic Transition Act of 2013 (S. 617) proposes working with regional partners to secure and dispose of unconventional weapons in Syria, with a focus on chemical weapons. It gives the President authority to conduct these activities and calls for increased funding for these goals in the State Department's FY2014 budget request. NADR funds may also be used for similar purposes in other countries. The Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5857) allows NADR funds to be used for countries beyond the former Soviet Union if it is in the national security interest of the United States, potentially including Syria. The Syria Freedom Support Act (H.R. 2106) authorizes assistance to a future democratic Syrian government for securing and dismantling weapons of mass destruction. The Senate FY2012 Foreign Operations Appropriations Committee report (S.Rept. 112-85) mentions funding for Nonproliferation, Demining, and Anti-terrorism in the Near East. The Committee recommends additional funding for nonproliferation, demining, and anti-terrorism programs in the Near East, including Syria. The National Defense Authorization Act includes Section 1205, giving authority to provide assistance to countries in the region to respond effectively to incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. The National Defense Authorization Act includes Section 1205, authorizing up to $4 million for countries in the Near East, including Syria, to respond effectively to incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Section 1251(b) of this bill emphasizes the need for the President to consider all actions to reinforce the 'redline' on the use of such weapons by the Assad regime. The National Defense Authorization Act includes Section 1205, authorizing funds for countries in the Near East, like Syria, to respond to incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. The law requires the President to report promptly to Congress if a foreign government has used chemical or biological weapons in violation of international law. Additionally, the chairs of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Foreign Affairs Committee can request a report on this issue within 60 days. The use, transfer, or loss of control of chemical weapons in Syria could have severe consequences for the population. The potential use, transfer, or loss of control of chemical weapons in Syria could have severe consequences for the population, U.S. allies, and forces in the region. Congress may need to evaluate the Administration's plans for responding to these scenarios, including verification and destruction of chemical weapons, which may require forces, funding, and congressional authorization."
