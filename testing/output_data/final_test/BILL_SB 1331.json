    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind in the Department of Consumer Affairs consists of seven members appointed by the Governor, including individuals with a particular interest in issues faced by the blind or visually impaired. At least three members must be blind or visually impaired individuals who use guide dogs. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2018, unless a later statute extends the date. The board has exclusive authority to issue licenses for training guide dogs and instructing the blind or visually impaired in their use. Notwithstanding other laws, personnel from certified schools outside the state can provide follow-up services for guide dogs trained there in emergency circumstances with notification to the board. In emergency circumstances, personnel from certified schools outside the state can provide follow-up services for guide dogs trained there without notifying the board of the recipient's name, unless needed for investigating potential substandard care. Prior to providing follow-up services, personnel must have fingerprints on file with the board, unless services are provided under emergency circumstances. Out-of-state schools must provide written information to guide dog handlers when follow-up services are given. The board may refuse follow-up services if personnel have committed certain acts. Personnel providing services are subject to disciplinary action by the board. A factsheet will be prepared by the board outlining its role in assisting guide dog users and arbitration procedures. The board will prepare a factsheet outlining its arbitration procedure under Section 7215.6, to be posted on its website and provided to licensed guide dog schools. The section will be in effect until January 1, 2018, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
