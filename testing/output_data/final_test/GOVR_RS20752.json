    "content": "The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended, requires the President to submit a budget annually to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. The deadline for submission has changed over the years, with the current requirement being on or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution mandates that each new Congress convene on January 3, with a January 20 beginning date for a President's four-year term of office. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 mandates the President to submit a budget annually to Congress at the beginning of each regular session. The deadline for submission has changed over the years, with the current requirement being on or after the first Monday in January but not later than the first Monday in February of each year. The 20th Amendment to the Constitution sets the date for a new Congress to convene on January 3 and for a President's term to begin on January 20. The change in the deadline in 1990 allowed outgoing Presidents to leave the budget submission to their successors, which was exercised by George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. President George H.W. Bush did not submit a budget for FY1994, so President Bill Clinton submitted the original budget. Similarly, the budget for FY2002 was submitted by incoming President George W. Bush instead of outgoing President Bill Clinton. President George W. Bush announced that he would not submit a budget for FY2010, with then-OMB Director Jim Nussle stating that the budget would be submitted by the next President. President Barack Obama submitted his budget overview, \"A New Era of Responsibility: Renewing America's Promise,\" in February 2009, followed by detailed budget information in May 2009. President George W. Bush did not submit a budget for FY2010, with the next President, Barack Obama, submitting budget information in May 2009. Incoming Presidents have the option to revise their predecessor's budget, with some choosing to do so shortly after taking office. During six presidential transitions from FY1977, outgoing Presidents submitted budgets on time, while those not required left it to successors. Revisions can be submitted anytime, with Carter and Reagan revising budgets but not Bush. Carter submitted FY1978 revisions on Feb 22, Reagan submitted FY1982 revisions on Mar 10 and Apr 7. In recent years, original budgets have been submitted late without authorization. For example, the FY1991 budget was submitted a week after an extended deadline, and the FY1989 budget was submitted 45 days late without any deadline extension. Transition-year budgets for FY1994, FY2002, and FY2010 were submitted 66, 63, and 98 days beyond the deadline, respectively. Transition-year budgets for FY1994, FY2002, and FY2010 were submitted late without deadline extensions. Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama submitted their original budgets beyond the deadline, following a pattern set by previous incoming Presidents since Ronald Reagan. Since Ronald Reagan, incoming Presidents have presented budget messages to Congress. Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush provided a \"transition budget\" to facilitate their successor's budget development. President George H.W. Bush submitted a 573-page document to Congress before President Clinton's inauguration, containing historical data and budget projections under different economic assumptions. President Clinton prepared a \"transition budget\" for incoming President George W. Bush in 2001, providing revised budget projections and an economic update."
