    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Little Rock Central High School Desegregation 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act\". In 1957, Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas was desegregated by the \"Little Rock Nine\", African American students who faced violence but inspired the Civil Rights movement. Dr. Martin Luther King recognized their courage. In May 1958, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. attended the graduation of the first African American student from Little Rock Central High School, recognizing it as a significant event in the civil rights struggle. A commemorative coin will highlight the lasting legacy of this important event. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint $1 coins with specific specifications, including weight, diameter, and composition. These coins will be legal tender and considered numismatic items. The coins minted under this Act will symbolize the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School and its role in civil rights. The design will include the coin's value, the year \"2007\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities starting January 1, 2007, with sales possible before that date. Minting authority will end on December 31, 2007. The Secretary will sell coins at a price including face value, surcharge, and design costs. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will receive a reasonable discount. The Secretary will add a $10 surcharge per coin sold, with all surcharge proceeds promptly transferred to the Secretary of the Interior for the preservation and interpretation of resources at Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site. This includes site improvements, educational programs, and historic preservation projects. Additionally, funds may be used for cooperative agreements to maintain the historic character of surrounding corridors. (c) Limitation.--No surcharge may be included for the issuance of any coin under this Act during a calendar year if it would exceed the annual commemorative coin program issuance limit.
