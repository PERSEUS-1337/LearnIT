    "content": "The \"Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alzheimer's Act\" or the \"EUREKA Act\" authorizes National Alzheimer's and Dementia Research Breakthrough Prize Competitions under the Public Health Service Act. The EUREKA Act authorizes prize competitions to achieve breakthroughs in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease by 2025, improving care quality and efficiency, and expanding support for individuals and caregivers. The EUREKA Act authorizes prize competitions in collaboration with federal agencies and private organizations to accelerate breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease and dementia, focusing on non-invasive biomarkers and scalable therapeutic targeting. The EUREKA Act aims to accelerate breakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease and dementia through various means, including early detection methods, repurposing FDA-approved drugs, technological innovations for caregiving, overcoming scientific barriers, and addressing other disease needs. The Director of NIH determines appropriate areas for competition. Publication in Federal Register includes award amounts, deadlines, and eligibility criteria. Participants must register, comply with requirements, and meet eligibility criteria to win a prize. The EUREKA Act requires participants to be incorporated in the US, be citizens or permanent residents, and not be Federal entities or employees. An Advisory Council of experts in Alzheimer's disease will be convened to develop EUREKA prize competitions. The council for EUREKA prize competitions will consist of 8 members, including experts in managing prize competitions, Alzheimer's disease research, therapy development, and individuals from the caregiver or patient advocacy community. The Director of NIH will appoint a panel of judges to evaluate submissions for the competitions. The Director of NIH will evaluate submissions recommended by the judging panel and select awardees for the prize competitions. Technical assistance may be sought from other Federal agencies or external sources. The Director of NIH may also enter into agreements with private organizations to administer the competitions. Certain provisions of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 will apply to this section. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 provisions apply to the appointment and functioning of the judging panel. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the advisory council or judging panel. Private organizations, including nonprofit and for-profit entities, are defined in this section. Funding for prize competitions can come from Federal appropriated funds or private organizations. The Director of NIH can accept funds from various sources to support prize competitions, without giving special consideration in return. Up to $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2017 through 2021, with funds remaining available until September 30, 2025. These funds are meant to supplement, not replace, other funding for Alzheimer's disease research."
