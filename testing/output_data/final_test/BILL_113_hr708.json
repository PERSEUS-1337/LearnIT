    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act of 2013\". The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act of 2013 emphasizes the importance of sharing research findings to advance science and benefit society. It highlights the role of the Internet in making information readily available to all, and aims to maximize the impact of federally funded research by enabling wide reuse of peer-reviewed literature. The term \"Federal agency\" in this Act refers to an Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code. Each Federal agency with extramural research expenditures over $100,000,000 must develop a Federal research public access policy within 1 year of this Act. The policy should include common procedures for submitting research papers to the agency. The policy should also require the submission of the author's final manuscript of original research papers accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The Federal research public access policy requires the submission of final manuscripts of research papers funded by the Federal Government to be made publicly accessible online within 6 months of publication in peer-reviewed journals. The manuscripts must incorporate all changes from peer review and be replaced with the final published version if the publisher consents. The goal is to enable productive reuse of the research papers. The Federal research public access policy mandates that research papers funded by the Federal Government be made publicly accessible online within 6 months of publication. This includes the creation of an online bibliography linking to free full texts and long-term preservation in digital repositories maintained by Federal agencies. The Federal research public access policy applies to researchers employed or funded by the Federal agency, requiring works to be marked as public domain and made available online. It also utilizes laws for Government license creation. Exclusions include research progress reports. The Federal research public access policy applies to researchers employed or funded by the Federal agency, requiring works to be marked as public domain and made available online. Exclusions include research progress reports presented at professional meetings or conferences, laboratory notes, preliminary data analyses, notes of the author, phone logs, classified research, research resulting in revenue or royalties, and works that are rejected by journals. Nothing in this Act affects any right under patent or copyright law. Each Federal agency head must submit a report on the Federal research public access policy to specific Congressional committees. The report must include an assessment of the policy's effectiveness. The Federal agency head must submit a report on the effectiveness of the Federal research public access policy, including a study on the terms of use for research papers and whether they enable productive reuse and computational analysis. The Federal agency must provide a report on the effectiveness of the public access policy for research papers, including terms of use and the ability for productive reuse and analysis. This report should include a list of papers published in peer-reviewed journals, papers made available by the agency, and a summary of the time between journal publication and online availability. The Federal agency must make a statement and lists of papers available to the public on its website as part of the public access policy for research papers."
