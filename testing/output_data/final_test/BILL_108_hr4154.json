    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The \"Osteoporosis Early Detection and Prevention Act of 2004\" highlights the findings of Congress regarding osteoporosis, a disease characterized by low bone mass and increased susceptibility to fractures. Osteoporosis typically goes undiagnosed until a fracture occurs, and there is no cure for the condition, but drug therapy can help reduce the risk of new fractures. Therapy can reduce new hip and spine fractures by 50 percent, while nutrition therapy is also effective. Osteoporosis affects 44 million Americans, with 80 percent being women. Annually, 1.5 million bone fractures are due to osteoporosis, with half of women and one-fourth of men over 50 experiencing a fracture. The annual cost of treating osteoporosis in the US was $17 billion in 2001. Osteoporosis-related costs in the US are significant, with repairing a hip fracture costing $37,000 and screening tests ranging from $59 to $300. Fractures often lead to disability and institutionalization. Preventing fractures in aging individuals, especially postmenopausal women, can reduce costs under the Medicare program. Bone mass measurement is a reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis. Bone mass measurement is a painless and reliable way to diagnose osteoporosis early. Low bone mass is as predictive of future fractures as high cholesterol or high blood pressure are for heart disease or stroke. Medicare covers bone mass measurement for qualified individuals at risk of osteoporosis under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. SEC. 2. REQUIRING COVERAGE OF BONE MASS MEASUREMENT UNDER HEALTH PLANS. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include standards relating to benefits for bone mass measurement in group health plans. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must cover bone mass measurement for qualified individuals. This includes procedures approved by the FDA to identify bone mass, detect bone loss, or determine bone quality, with a physician's interpretation of the results. No specific facility type is required for these measurements. Qualified individuals at clinical risk for osteoporosis, including those with vertebral abnormalities, receiving chemotherapy or long-term steroid therapy, primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or excess thyroid replacement, or being monitored for osteoporosis drug therapy response, must have bone mass measurements covered by group health plans and insurance issuers. The frequency of these measurements is limited based on established standards. The Secretary will establish standards for the frequency of bone mass measurement benefits for qualified individuals under the Social Security Act. Group health plans can impose cost-sharing for these measurements, but there are limitations on the amount allowed. Cost-sharing or limitations for bone mass measurement cannot exceed deductibles, coinsurance, and limits applied to similar services. Group health plans and insurers cannot deny eligibility based on avoiding requirements or provide incentives to discourage bone mass measurements. The section prohibits providers from restricting bone mass measurements for qualified individuals, discussing preventive techniques, or penalizing providers for providing such measurements. It also clarifies that individuals are not required to undergo bone mass measurement and mandates compliance with notice requirements for group health plans. The section allows negotiation of reimbursement for care provided under this plan and does not preempt state laws providing greater benefits for osteoporosis detection or prevention. Section 2723(c) is amended to include sections 2704 and 2707. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by adding a new section to Subpart B of part 7 of title I, inserting sections 2704 and 2707. SEC. 714. STANDARDS RELATING TO BENEFITS FOR BONE MASS MEASUREMENT. Coverage for bone mass measurement is required for qualified individuals under group health plans and health insurance issuers. The procedure aims to identify bone mass, detect bone loss, or determine bone quality, and must be approved by the FDA. Conducting the measurement in a specific facility is not mandated. The term 'qualified individual' refers to those at risk for osteoporosis, with vertebral abnormalities, undergoing certain therapies, or being monitored for drug efficacy. Standards for bone mass measurement frequency are governed by the Public Health Service Act. The Public Health Service Act governs the standards for bone mass measurement frequency. Group health plans or issuers can impose cost-sharing for bone mass measurement, but it cannot exceed the limits applied to similar services. The Public Health Service Act sets standards for bone mass measurement frequency under group health plans or insurance coverage. Prohibitions include denying eligibility based on avoiding requirements, providing incentives to avoid bone mass measurements, and prohibiting discussions on osteoporosis prevention with patients. The Public Health Service Act prohibits penalizing providers for offering bone mass measurements to individuals. It does not mandate bone mass measurements for plan participants and requires notice of any modifications to group health plans within 60 days. The Public Health Service Act prohibits penalizing providers for offering bone mass measurements to individuals and requires notice of any modifications to group health plans within 60 days. Additionally, the provisions of this section do not preempt State law relating to health insurance coverage for osteoporosis detection or prevention. The Public Health Service Act prohibits penalizing providers for offering bone mass measurements to individuals and requires notice of any modifications to group health plans within 60 days. Additionally, the table of contents in section 1 of the Act is amended by inserting a new item after section 712. Standards relating to benefits for bone mass measurement are outlined in a new section of the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2707 apply to individual market health insurance coverage, with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws on osteoporosis detection or prevention are not preempted if they offer greater benefits. The amendments to section 2762 of the Act apply to group health plans starting in 2005 and to individual market health insurance coverage after that date. State laws on osteoporosis detection or prevention are not overridden by these amendments."
