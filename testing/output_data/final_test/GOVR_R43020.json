    "content": "Many Americans prioritize health care for themselves and their children, recognizing the importance of insurance in meeting health needs and preventing costly emergency care. Monitoring children's health early on is crucial for their development, while insurance coverage can alleviate financial and emotional stress for parents. Child support payments help noncustodial parents fulfill their financial obligations to their children. The Child Support Enforcement program ensures that children receive health care by including medical support in child support orders, covering expenses like medical, dental, and insurance costs. State guidelines define what constitutes medical support, expanding from just Medicaid reimbursement. Federal requirements for child support orders focus on reimbursement for Medicaid expenses and employer-related health insurance for the noncustodial parent. Congress has allowed states to require Medicaid recipients to assign their child support rights to the state and pursue private health insurance coverage from noncustodial parents to offset the cost of Medicaid benefits provided to the child. Mandatory assignment of medical support in child support orders became law in 1984. The 1993 amendment to ERISA required employer-sponsored group health plans to provide health care coverage for children of divorced, separated, or unmarried parents. The 1996 welfare reform law mandated all child support orders to include provisions for health care coverage and directed the CSE agency to notify the noncustodial parent's employer of their medical child support obligation. In 1998, the National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) was authorized to help secure health care coverage for children. Since 1984, Congress has aimed to increase private health care coverage for children of noncustodial parents with access to employer-based insurance. The National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) is a standardized form required by all state CSE agencies to ensure health care coverage for children. This legislation also established a Medical Support Working Group to make recommendations on improving medical support. In 2006, federal law defined \"medical support\" and required child support orders to include provisions for medical support from either parent. CSE agencies can enforce medical support against custodial parents with affordable health care coverage. This adds complexity to the program as medical child support can be imposed on either parent, leading to potential additional expenses for noncustodial parents. Noncustodial parents may face significant expenses for medical child support, including health insurance premiums, co-payments, and deductibles. High premiums can reduce disposable income, impacting financial child support. Medical support and health care coverage are not the same; a child may be covered by a custodial parent's insurance without medical support from the noncustodial parent. In the future, medical child support may become a CSE program performance measure, but more needs to be done before that can happen. States submit medical support data, but it is not audited for completeness and reliability. The establishment of medical support orders before determining affordability hampers state CSE agencies in enforcing medical child support. While there has been some improvement in establishing medical child support, enforcement lags behind. In FY2011, 81% of child support cases included medical child support, compared to 61% in FY1995. However, only 33% of medical support orders were complied with in FY2011, the same as in FY1995. Enforcement of medical support orders remains problematic despite various collection methods available to state CSE agencies. States have various methods to collect child support obligations, including reporting to credit bureaus, intercepting lottery winnings, seizing assets from retirement funds, and suspending licenses. Efforts to improve medical child support enforcement face challenges due to high healthcare costs and lack of compliance with medical support orders. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of balancing cash child support payments with medical support costs for noncustodial parents. It highlights the potential impact on custodial parents' ability to provide for their children's basic needs and the financial strain families may face without adequate medical support. The overlap between cash support and medical support in child support awards is a key factor in upward modifications. States may combine cash medical support with regular child support or have parents split medical costs. Routine medical expenses are factored into child support guidelines. Establishing and enforcing medical support promotes equity in sharing childrearing costs between custodial and noncustodial parents. The ACA, enacted in 2010, aims to increase access to health insurance for Americans without coverage. It expands federal private health insurance market requirements and Medicaid coverage. The ACA aligns with the CSE program in ensuring children have health care coverage. Federal law mandates every child support order to include medical child support provisions. The CSE program requires states to include provisions for medical child support in their guidelines. Courts or administrative agencies may require employees to provide health insurance for their children at a reasonable cost. Employers must honor medical support orders established under state law. The cost of private health insurance should not exceed 5% of the parent's gross income. Federal law mandates that health insurance coverage for children be enforced through the National Medical Support Notice (NMSN), ensuring children receive necessary healthcare as part of a child support order. State agencies send the NMSN to employers to facilitate this process. The cost of private health insurance for children should not exceed 5% of the parent's gross income or a state-defined alternative standard. The National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) is sent by state agencies to employers to enforce health insurance coverage for children as part of a child support order. This ensures children have access to healthcare through various options like Medicaid, CHIP, or Health Insurance Exchanges. States can also pursue cost-sharing for medical expenses if insurance is not available, with the goal of providing continuous and stable healthcare for children. Medical child support can take several forms, including ordering the noncustodial parent to provide health insurance, pay for private health insurance premiums, or reimburse the custodial parent for insurance costs. If insurance is not available at a reasonable cost, the custodial parent may apply for government-funded programs like Medicaid or CHIP for the child's healthcare coverage. Expenses for medical child support, including premiums and out-of-pocket costs, may be added to the noncustodial parent's child support payment. The percentage to be paid is based on each parent's financial situation. If private insurance is not available and children are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, the noncustodial parent may be required to provide cash medical support in addition to child support. This cash medical support is typically included in the child support order, and the employer may withhold it from the parent's paycheck. The employer is required to withhold medical child support payments from the parent's paycheck and enroll the child in health insurance coverage. State CSE agencies must be notified of any changes in employment status, and guidelines address how parents will provide for the child's healthcare needs. The guidelines address medical support for children, including health insurance coverage, allocation of uninsured expenses, and pursuing coverage through a parent's employer. States have laws ensuring children can enroll in health plans regardless of parents' marital status or living arrangements. CSE agencies can require employers to include medical support in child support orders. The guidelines address medical support for children, including health insurance coverage. CSE agencies can require an employer to include a child on a medical insurance plan when the noncustodial parent participates in a group health plan but does not enroll the child. If a custodial parent has access to better health insurance than the noncustodial parent, the child support order may increase the noncustodial parent's obligation to offset the cost. Court orders can also be modified to include medical child support. The guidelines process determines if Medicaid or CHIP is suitable for a child when neither parent has affordable health insurance. Noncustodial parents may be required to contribute cash medical support. Federal law mandates medical child support in every child support order, sometimes included in the general child support order. In child support orders, medical costs are often included in the basic child support obligation amount. Health insurance and uncovered medical expenses are divided between parents based on their income percentages. There has been improvement in enforcing medical child support, with 81% of cases including medical support in FY2011. In FY2011, 81% of child support cases included medical support. In the same year, 33% of cases complied with medical support orders, and 31% provided health insurance coverage as ordered. Public coverage data was not available until FY2012, potentially impacting enforcement rates due to affordability issues for obligated parents. The 1996 welfare reform law required states to establish an automated directory of new hires by October 1, 1997, containing employee and employer information. This information must be provided by employers within 20 days of hiring. The State Directory of New Hires then shares this information with the National Directory of New Hires within 3 business days. The National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) is a database that contains personal and financial data on working Americans and those receiving unemployment compensation. State agencies compare information with their databases of noncustodial parents and upload it to the NDNH. States regularly compare their databases with the NDNH to identify new employers. Within two business days of identifying a new employer of a noncustodial parent, the state must send an income withholding order and/or a National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) to enroll children in health care plans. The NMSN ensures children receive health care coverage required by child support orders, simplifying the process for employers and plan administrators. Some states centralize the NMSN issuance process, while others allow local child support agencies to handle it. The NMSN is a Qualified Medical Child Support Order that must be honored by all health plans, including federal agencies' group health plans. It is mailed to the employer along with the income withholding notice and contains two parts: Part A - Notice to Withhold for Health Care Coverage and Part B - Medical Support Notice. Establishing a medical child support order before verifying the affordability of the health plan can be problematic as CSE agencies cannot require a noncustodial parent to purchase unaffordable health insurance. When the employer receives a NMSN, they can either inform the CSE agency that coverage is not available or notify the health insurance plan administrator to enroll the child. The plan administrator, in turn, can provide an explanation for non-enrollment or enroll the child. Employers must forward Part B of the NMSN to the plan administrator and start withholding premiums upon enrollment notification. If employees have group health coverage through a union, the NMSN must be forwarded to the union representative. The employer must forward the NMSN to the appropriate union representative if they do not provide health insurance. The CSE program uses various methods to obtain child support, with income withholding being the most effective. In FY2011, 70% of child support payments were collected through income withholding. Medicaid is a program funded by states and the federal government to provide health care coverage to low-income individuals. States choose whether to participate in Medicaid, and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five other jurisdictions do. Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as part of the Social Security Act. Medicaid is a program funded by states and the federal government to provide health care coverage to low-income individuals. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories participate in Medicaid. States must follow federal rules to receive reimbursement that offsets at least 50% of Medicaid costs. Mandatory benefits include physician care, hospitalization, laboratory testing, and screening services. States must pursue third parties for medical bill payment and families with private insurance can still enroll in Medicaid. The Medicaid program covers poor families, pregnant women, children, and most adults under 65 with incomes below 133% of the federal poverty level. Private health insurance is primary, with Medicaid covering uncovered expenses. States must follow federal rules to participate in Medicaid. Custodial parents receiving Medicaid must assign their medical support rights to the state as per the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. This means the state can collect owed medical support from insurance companies or noncustodial parents. Failure to assign rights can result in denial or termination of Medicaid benefits for parents, but children's benefits remain unaffected. Custodial parents receiving Medicaid must assign their medical support rights to the state. The state can collect owed medical support from insurance companies or noncustodial parents. Children's benefits cannot be terminated even if parents refuse to assign rights. States are required to automatically assign a custodial parent's right to medical payments by third parties. Cooperation in establishing paternity and obtaining medical support is a condition of Medicaid eligibility for custodial parents. The Medicaid program requires custodial parents to assign their medical support rights to the state, cooperate in establishing paternity, and obtaining medical support for eligible children born out of wedlock. Failure to cooperate may result in termination of the parent's Medicaid benefits. This is done to pursue third parties legally liable for medical care costs, reducing state medical expenses. The Medicaid program requires custodial parents to assign their medical support rights to the state and cooperate in obtaining medical support for eligible children. The term \"third party\" includes entities liable to pay for medical care under Medicaid. The CSE agency determines if parents are cooperating in good faith and notifies both parents and the Medicaid agency of their decisions. The CSE agency notifies the Medicaid agency if a custodial parent is uncooperative, leading to benefits denial. Pregnant women below 133% of the federal poverty level are covered for birth costs by Medicaid. Repayment of birth costs may be required in some states through paternity judgments or child support orders. Some state statutes allow recovery of birth costs from noncustodial fathers to reimburse the Medicaid program, managed by CSE agencies. Concerns exist that this may lead to high child support arrearages and reduced collections from low-income fathers. It may be ineffective to collect Medicaid birthing costs from low-income noncustodial fathers, as it can inflate arrearages and deter child support payments. Some argue that requiring cash payments from uninsured fathers who may soon be Medicaid-eligible is unproductive. There are exemptions from the Medicaid CSE rules, including good cause exemptions and the pregnancy exemption. Both the assignment and cooperation requirement can be waived if a custodial parent. In 1990, Congress added exceptions to the cooperation requirement for Medicaid CSE rules, including good cause exemptions and the pregnancy exemption for poverty level pregnant women. This exemption is available during pregnancy and for 60 days postpartum. The pregnancy exemption for Medicaid CSE rules allows for coverage during pregnancy and 60 days postpartum. After this period, the mother must cooperate in establishing paternity and pursuing medical child support to maintain coverage. Congress recognized the importance of prenatal care for pregnant women and established the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 1997. Unlike Medicaid, CHIP is not an individual entitlement program. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is a federal-state matching program that provides enhanced federal funds to states offering health care coverage to uninsured children not eligible for Medicaid. CHIP extends coverage to children whose family income is too high for Medicaid but cannot afford private coverage. States can offer CHIP through Medicaid expansion, separate CHIP programs, or a combination of both approaches. Many states use streamlined applications and do not impose an assets test to encourage enrollment. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) can be offered through Medicaid expansion, separate CHIP programs, or a combination of both. Medicaid rules apply if CHIP is expanded, but separate CHIP programs have different rules. There are no explicit child support provisions in CHIP, and children must be covered regardless of parental compliance. The ACA requires health insurance exchanges to be established by January 1, 2014, to create a competitive marketplace for buying health insurance. Health insurance exchanges, established by the ACA, aim to offer a variety of health plans, certify participating plans, and provide information to help consumers understand their options. The goal is to increase access to coverage by bringing together buyers and sellers of insurance. Premium assistance in the form of federal tax credits is available to make exchange coverage more affordable. States are expected to set up exchanges, with the federal government stepping in if needed. Exchanges will primarily serve individuals buying insurance on their own and small businesses with up to 100 employees. States can create multiple exchanges, but only one can serve each geographic area. Health insurance exchanges, established by the ACA, aim to offer a variety of health plans, certify participating plans, and provide information to help consumers understand their options. The federal government will offer technical assistance to help states set up exchanges. Exchanges will screen individuals for eligibility for public insurance programs like Medicaid and offer qualified health plans for purchase. Subsidies in the exchanges will be provided through tax credits for low to middle income individuals who do not have access to affordable employer-sponsored health insurance. Premium assistance in the form of tax credits will be administered through individual income tax returns, with advance payments going directly to insurers. Qualifying individuals who file federal income tax returns can obtain these tax credits. The ACA's new tax-based definition of family size excludes children claimed as dependents on a custodial parent's tax return from the noncustodial parent's household size. This means the noncustodial parent cannot claim a premium tax credit for the child. Only one parent can claim the child as a dependent, leading to potential differences in coverage choices. One parent can claim the child as a dependent for tax purposes, affecting choices on who can benefit from tax credits. Analysts suggest improving medical child support by coordinating state Medicaid and CSE agencies for automatic referrals. This ensures children in both programs have access to necessary services. The medical child support assignment and cooperation requirements help low-income families access CSE services at no cost and potentially save Medicaid money by obtaining private health care coverage. Some custodial parents struggle to comply due to various reasons, leading to penalties such as denial of Medicaid coverage. Coordination between state Medicaid and CSE agencies is suggested for automatic referrals to ensure children in both programs receive necessary services. Many analysts argue that the medical child support assignment and cooperation requirements, mandated in 1984, are no longer necessary for low-income families with noncustodial parents. They believe that these requirements add unnecessary confusion and barriers to Medicaid enrollment for eligible custodial parents. The Medicaid program requires custodial parents to cooperate with the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, but children remain eligible for Medicaid regardless of parental cooperation. Children not eligible for Medicaid may qualify for CHIP, which does not have a child support cooperation requirement. Streamlining the Medicaid and CHIP application process is challenging due to different program rules and requirements, leading to longer application processes and additional paperwork. The ACA's coverage provisions simplify the application/enrollment process by switching to Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for income eligibility in Medicaid. This standardizes income eligibility across states and reduces administrative costs. The ACA simplifies income eligibility for Medicaid by using Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and requires coordination between state Health Insurance Exchanges. The coverage provisions aim to ensure individuals are enrolled in a suitable plan based on their family income, but the collaboration process for eligible noncustodial and custodial parents is unclear. The Medicaid Eligibility Final Regulation (MEFR) requires states to administer programs in the best interest of applicants and beneficiaries, establishing an eligibility verification plan. States have the option to make final Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determinations based on the exchange's initial review or accept determinations made by an exchange using state rules. The regulation ensures a simple, coordinated, accurate, and timely eligibility determination process. The Medicaid Eligibility Final Regulation (MEFR) requires states to transfer information promptly for insurance affordability programs without further verification. MEFR Section 457.343 allows for a data-driven CHIP eligibility review using existing electronic account information. It mandates assessing individuals ineligible for CHIP for other insurance affordability programs and timely reporting of changes in circumstances. Health insurance exchanges will play a role in verifying access to employer-sponsored coverage starting in 2014. Exchanges need access to authoritative data sources for real-time verification of employer-sponsored coverage during enrollment. A comprehensive data source for verification does not currently exist. An interim strategy is needed to ensure affordable coverage, minimize burdens, and support eligibility determinations for advance payments of the premium tax credit. HHS has proposed allowing individuals to attest to their access to coverage for eligibility determination. HHS is considering proposing an interim approach for exchanges to verify individuals' access to affordable employer-sponsored coverage. This approach may involve comparing attestations to existing data sources like the National Directory of New Hires. Some challenges may arise due to the state-based nature of exchanges, especially for interstate cases. Before 2006, Congress believed noncustodial parents with private health insurance should cover their children to reduce taxpayer burden. However, low-income noncustodial parents often lack access to affordable employer-sponsored health insurance, making it impractical for them to provide coverage. Beginning in 2014, larger employers will be required to offer health insurance or face a penalty under the ACA. Some individuals will have guaranteed access to health coverage outside of employment. Many employers may still choose not to offer health insurance to their employees. Beginning in 2014, the ACA will require larger employers to offer health insurance or face a penalty. Small employers may still decline to offer health insurance, with workers having the option to purchase insurance through exchanges or enroll in Medicaid. The exchanges will also provide opportunities for individuals to access private health insurance with subsidies to make coverage more affordable. Individuals with household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level can obtain federally subsidized health insurance through the exchanges. The ACA prohibits coverage exclusions for preexisting health conditions for all individuals regardless of age, including children under 19. Health plans offering dependent coverage must extend it to children under 26. The ACA adds complexity to the CSE program but may increase health care coverage for U.S. children. Analysts suggest updating medical child support policies to align with ACA reforms. In 2011, 9.4% of children under 18 in the U.S. (7 million children) did not have health insurance, with those in poverty more likely to be uninsured. Data from 2008 showed 11% of child support-eligible children lacked insurance, indicating overlap with the child poverty population. 44% of child support-eligible children lived in low-income families, highlighting the need for updated policies to align with ACA reforms. The 2011 HHS report revealed that many child support-eligible children qualify for public health care coverage but are not enrolled. Efforts to enroll these children could reduce the number of uninsured kids. P.L. 111-3 (CHIPRA) included a program to incentivize states to find and enroll eligible children in CHIP, making enrollment easier. ACA provisions also require states to design programs to increase enrollment. The ACA requires states to develop technology-supported enrollment processes for Medicaid, CHIP, and the exchange to assist individuals in obtaining health coverage. States must create consumer-friendly application processes, coordinate across programs, and minimize upfront information and documentation requirements. The CSE agency should collaborate closely with Medicaid/CHIP to ensure children with access to private coverage enroll, reducing the number of uninsured kids. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius emphasizes the importance of enrolling uninsured children in Medicaid and CHIP through outreach efforts and simplification strategies. State CSE programs have been given flexibility to improve coordination with Medicaid and CHIP to enroll all eligible children by 2014. In the child welfare arena, accessible health care coverage is urged to be available. In the child welfare arena, it is important to have accessible, affordable, and stable health care coverage. State laws and the NMSN process ensure enrollment in a health care plan if available at a \"reasonable cost\" to parents. Federal regulations define \"reasonable cost\" as not exceeding 5% of the parent's gross income. The Consumer Credit Protection Act limits child support income withholding to 65% of a parent's disposable earnings. The average annual health insurance premium contribution for family coverage in 2012 was $4,316. A report on 2012 health care benefits showed that 6% of covered workers have no contribution for family coverage, 43% contribute less than a quarter of the premium, 37% pay between a quarter and half, and 14% pay more than half. In 2008, 24% of child support-eligible children were in families below the federal poverty level, 44% in families with income between 100% and 199% of poverty, 21% between 200% and 399% of poverty, and 11% in families with income of 400% of poverty level or more. A health plan contribution of $880 or more would be considered above \"reasonable cost\" for a mother with two children. Rising health insurance premiums and fewer employers offering health care benefits have impacted the 5% standard. The 5% threshold for employer-provided health insurance has been questioned due to rising premiums and fewer employers offering benefits. The final regulations on medical child support state that the cost of adding children to existing coverage or the difference between self-only and family coverage should be considered. HHS acknowledges that the full cost of a family health insurance plan may exceed the reasonable cost standard, making it less likely for parents to be required to provide coverage through private insurance. Some argue that low-income noncustodial parents should not pay more than 5% of their income for health coverage. States adjust child support based on who provides health insurance. High premiums can lead to issues. The high premium associated with health care coverage can lead to a substantial reduction in basic child support payments, leaving the custodial parent struggling to meet the child's needs. Failure to adjust child support orders accordingly may result in noncustodial parents accumulating unmanageable arrearages. The Medicaid program covers pregnant women and children up to age 18 with family income at or below certain levels, with the option for states to expand coverage under the ACA. Beginning in 2014, individuals without affordable employer-sponsored insurance or minimum essential coverage may be eligible for premium tax credits to purchase private insurance through the health insurance exchange. The Affordable Care Act sets insurance premium credits for individuals and their dependents, aiming to increase coverage for childless adults and parents, potentially benefiting uninsured children as well. The ACA sets insurance premium credits for individuals and families based on income levels, limiting premium contributions to 2.0% to 9.5% of income for those with modified adjusted gross income between 100% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level. Those with income above 400% of poverty are ineligible for premium credits. Only one parent can claim a child as a dependent for tax purposes under the ACA. The ACA allows only one parent to claim a child for tax purposes, affecting decisions on who can benefit from premium tax credits. Private health care coverage offers advantages over public coverage, but Medicaid or CHIP may be preferred in some cases due to lower costs and unlimited benefits for children with chronic conditions. The ACA allows only one parent to claim a child for tax purposes, affecting decisions on who can benefit from premium tax credits. Private health care coverage offers advantages over public coverage, but Medicaid or CHIP may be preferred in some cases due to lower costs and unlimited benefits for children with chronic conditions. EPSDT benefits are unlimited based on medical necessity. Securing medical coverage for children is a stand-alone goal according to OCSE documents. Health care coverage and medical child support are not synonymous. When the ACA is fully implemented, access to affordable health care coverage may be less of an issue. Policymakers might consider eliminating the establishment of health care. Policymakers may consider defining medical child support as noncustodial parents' payment of medical care costs. Federal government provides 66% funding for CSE program activities, requiring states to provide 34%. In the past, Congress offered higher federal financial participation to encourage vital CSE program activities. The 2003 report recommended enhanced federal funding at a 90% rate for medical child support activities to incentivize states. P.L. 105-200 established a revised incentive payment system for effective CSE programs, including a medical support incentive measure based on performance criteria. The 1998 law required a report on the medical support incentive measure to be submitted to Congress by October 1, 1999. However, due to data limitations, the use of a medical support performance measure was postponed. Currently, medical support data collected by states is not used to calculate incentive payments or penalties, and there are no immediate plans to incorporate it into the incentive payment system. The implementation of a medical support incentive measure has been delayed to assess the appropriate policy in light of the ACA. The CSE program's success in increasing child support collections is influenced by various factors, including the economy and employment rates of noncustodial parents. Despite the program's complexity, child support payments collected by CSE agencies have significantly increased over the years. Incentive payments provided to states are no longer matched with federal dollars, reducing their impact on the CSE program. The CSE program has seen a significant increase in child support collections over the years, from 111,000 in FY1978 to 1.687 million in FY2011. However, despite some success, the program only collects 20% of child support obligations when arrearage payments are considered. With the ACA mandating health insurance coverage from 2014 onwards, there are concerns about the program's ability to enforce medical child support. Additionally, without federal matching of state incentive payments, the CSE program may have less revenue available for its operations. Some commentators argue that the CSE program should focus on cash support rather than health insurance coverage. The IRS now administers the ACA mandate for individuals to purchase health coverage. Parents may become eligible for Medicaid under the ACA. Some parents may qualify for Medicaid or subsidies to purchase health insurance under the ACA. The custodial parent claiming the child as a dependent is responsible for ensuring the child has health insurance coverage and may receive subsidies on behalf of the child. Critics argue that penalizing custodial parents for noncompliance is unfair, especially if the noncustodial parent does not contribute to the child's medical costs. Some custodial parents can allow noncustodial parents to claim the child as a dependent for health insurance benefits, but there are restrictions for noncustodial parents living in different states. Coordination between health insurance exchanges and child support enforcement programs may be necessary for compliance with ACA requirements. Beginning in 2014, taxpayers must provide proof of health insurance on their federal tax returns. Those without qualified insurance will face penalties, with the IRS able to withhold tax refunds to collect. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program also withholds past-due child support from refunds, potentially creating competition for noncustodial parents' resources. The CSE program is mandated to enforce medical child support, including health insurance. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program enforces medical child support, including health insurance coverage. There may be overlap with the IRS in ensuring health insurance provision. Senator Russell Long questioned the fairness of taxpayers supporting children abandoned by fathers. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program aims to obtain child support from noncustodial parents to reduce public expenditures on welfare programs and help families remain self-sufficient. AFDC families were automatically eligible for Medicaid benefits in the early days of the program. The CSE program, under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, expanded its focus on obtaining health care for children by considering both parents' ability to provide medical support. This can be in the form of private health insurance, cash payments, or Medicaid/CHIP benefits, with parents responsible for co-pays and deductibles. Health care for children is a top concern for most Americans. The CSE program aims to ensure children have continuous access to health care by connecting them to various coverage options like Medicaid, CHIP, and employer-based insurance. President Obama's goal for health reform includes providing quality, affordable coverage to uninsured individuals. Improved health care access leads to better outcomes for children, including reduced infant mortality and increased immunization rates. New methods are needed to enhance health care provision for children. New methods are needed to help families access publicly funded health care for their children more effectively. Sharing data among programs can reduce administrative costs and improve access to benefits. Technology can break down silos between state health and human services programs, improving customer service and data exchange. The promise of interoperable computer systems is to streamline services for families and save taxpayers money. Data standards and electronic information exchange in the CSE program establish a common technological vocabulary and level the playing field for software vendors. Standardization requirements will create a common set of data elements for efficient government operations. The Commissioner emphasized the importance of exchange standardization requirements for interoperable systems in human services. The Affordable Care Act is driving states to create new computer systems for Medicaid and health insurance exchanges, offering a chance to integrate programs for better service delivery. States can now design and implement system modules for health and human services with enhanced federal funding until December 31, 2015. This integration aims to improve client outcomes and operational efficiency by standardizing information exchange between systems. The goal is to streamline applications, enrollment, interviews, and data sharing efforts. Efforts like automatic enrollment, e-signatures, and data sharing across programs aim to streamline assistance processes by reducing redundant eligibility screenings and applications. The ACA requires states to electronically verify eligibility information, leading to administrative savings. Individuals only need to provide information not already on record with the new beneficiary-focused system. The ACA is expected to expand health insurance coverage through new exchanges and Medicaid expansions. Questions remain on how it will impact medical child support, with suggestions to redefine medical support or involve the IRS in enforcement. The CSE program is facing challenges in serving custodial parents effectively. Suggestions include re-emphasizing the inclusion of medical expenses in child support orders and reallocating resources to help low-income noncustodial parents find employment. Federal involvement in financial child support stemmed from reducing expenditures on the AFDC program. Medicaid recipients must assign their medical support rights to the state, similar to TANF recipients assigning child support rights. The federal government's involvement in financial child support aimed to reduce costs in the AFDC program. The Medicare/Medicaid Anti-fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977 established a medical support enforcement program linking child support and medical support to recoup Medicaid costs for public assistance families. The 1977 law mandated states to require Medicaid applicants to assign their rights to medical support to the state. It also allowed for cooperative agreements between CSE and Medicaid agencies to pursue medical child support. Activities under these agreements must be funded by the Medicaid agency. Additionally, the law required state CSE agencies to notify Medicaid agencies of changes in private family health coverage for Medicaid-eligible individuals. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 required state agencies to include medical support in new or modified child support orders when health care coverage is available at a reasonable cost to the noncustodial parent. A 1993 study found that for workers with income below the poverty line and employer-provided family health insurance, 77% of the premium was paid by the employer. The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) published regulations in 1985 requiring state agencies to obtain medical support information for children in child support orders. The purpose is to increase private health insurance coverage for children and reduce Medicaid costs. If the custodial parent lacks adequate health insurance, the child support agency must seek court approval for medical support in support orders and inform the state Medicaid agency. The 1985 regulations require CSE agencies to enforce medical support ordered by court or administrative process, with states receiving federal funds for these activities. Prior to these regulations, medical support was pursued through optional agreements with Medicaid agencies. Functions included locating noncustodial parents, establishing paternity, and obtaining health insurance information for children. The 1988 regulations expanded medical support enforcement provisions, requiring CSE agencies to identify cases with potential for medical support and modify support orders accordingly. Additionally, agencies had to inform custodial parents about noncustodial parents' health insurance coverage for the child. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended provisions regarding health insurance coverage for poverty-level pregnant women exempt from cooperation requirements in establishing paternity and obtaining medical support. The exemption applies only to the father of a child born out of wedlock and specific entities. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended health insurance coverage for poverty-level pregnant women, exempting them from cooperating in establishing paternity and obtaining medical support. This exemption applies to the father of a child born out of wedlock and specific entities. The CSE agency only applies to the father and entities deriving liability from him. The pregnant woman must assign her rights to the state for support and cooperate in pursuing third parties liable for care and services. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (H.R. 2264) addressed the issue of health care coverage for nonresident children of divorced employees. It prohibited insurers from denying enrollment of a child under the parent's health insurance plan and ensured that employers were legally obligated to continue health care coverage for nonresident children as directed by the court. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 prohibited insurers from denying enrollment of a child under the parent's health insurance plan based on various reasons. It also required employers to continue health care coverage for nonresident children as directed by the court. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 required employers in the state to withhold employee's share of health insurance premiums for child support orders. Insurers were prohibited from imposing requirements on state agencies acting on behalf of eligible individuals. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 required insurers to provide information and payment directly to custodial parents for children with coverage through a noncustodial parent's insurer. State Medicaid agencies were allowed to garnish wages or withhold tax refunds from individuals obligated to provide health insurance for Medicaid-eligible individuals. Under the 1996 welfare reform legislation, Medicaid-eligible individuals who have received payment from a third party for medical services may have wages garnished to reimburse the state agency. Child support claims take priority over medical service costs. The legislation also expanded the definition of \"medical child support order\" to include court or administrative orders. The 1996 welfare reform law mandated that all orders enforced by the state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agency must include a provision for health care coverage. The 1998 Child Support Performance and Incentive Act established a standardized \"National Medical Support Notice\" for states to inform employers about enrolling noncustodial parents' children in employer-sponsored health plans. The \"National Medical Support Notice\" was developed to inform employers about medical support orders and must be accepted as a \"Qualified Medical Support Order\" under ERISA. States were required to use this notice starting in October 2001, with some delays due to state legislation. A completed notice is considered a \"Qualified Medical Child Support Order\" and must be honored by the employer's group health plan. P.L. 105-200 also established a Medical Support Working Group to address enforcement issues. The HHS Secretary was directed to develop a performance measure based on states' effectiveness in enforcing medical support obligations and make recommendations for its incorporation into the Child Support Incentive Payment System. P.L. 106-394, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 2000, allows federal agencies to enroll employees and their families in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program when ordered by a state court or administrative authority to provide health insurance coverage. Federal agencies can enforce child support orders for health insurance coverage. If an employee fails to provide coverage, the agency must enroll them and their dependents in a health benefits program. Retroactive enrollment changes may be made to comply with court orders. The agency will receive a National Medical Support Notice from the state child support enforcement agency. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 requires child support orders to include medical child support provisions, allowing enforcement against both parents for health insurance coverage and payment of medical expenses. States must consider parents' access to health insurance when enforcing these orders. The Administration for Children and Families at HHS issued final regulations on medical child support, including payment for children's medical expenses. Cash medical support or private health insurance is considered reasonable if it does not exceed 5% of the obligated parent's gross income. States must inform the Medicaid agency of new or modified court orders. The state CSE agency must notify the Medicaid agency of any new or modified court orders for child support that include health insurance or cash medical support for Medicaid applicants or recipients. Medical support collections are forwarded to the Medicaid agency if assigned to the state, otherwise, they are sent to the family. States provide medical support data to the federal OCSE. The state CSE agency provides medical support data to the federal OCSE, but the data are not audited for completeness and reliability. States may struggle to enforce medical child support orders if health insurance is deemed unaffordable. This could result in low enforcement rates for medical support orders. Enforcement of medical support orders may be challenging if health insurance is not available to the obligated parent at a reasonable rate. The data in the tables related to medical support should be used cautiously. In FY2011, the state CSE programs handled 15.8 million cases, with 12.8 million child support orders established. Reasons for not establishing orders include unknown parent whereabouts and paternity issues. Additionally, there were 2.8 million arrearages-only cases where past-due child support was owed. In FY2011, out of 10.0 million child support cases established, 8.1 million had medical child support ordered, with 3.3 million cases complying with the medical support order. Compliance with medical support does not guarantee health care coverage for the child. In FY2011, 88% of medical support orders stipulated health insurance coverage, with 31% compliance."
