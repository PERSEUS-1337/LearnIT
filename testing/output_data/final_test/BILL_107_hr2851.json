The Western Shoshone Judgment Roll will include individuals with at least 1/4 degree of Western Shoshone Blood, U.S. citizenship, and who are living at the time of the Act's enactment. Individuals already eligible for payments from other judgment funds are ineligible. The Secretary will establish the Western Shoshone Judgment Roll for individuals with at least 1/4 degree of Western Shoshone Blood, U.S. citizenship, and who are living at the time of the Act's enactment. Those already eligible for payments from other judgment funds are ineligible. Per capita payments will be made to each person listed on the roll. Per capita payments from the Western Shoshone Judgment Roll will be distributed directly to living competent adults over 19 years old, to heirs of deceased individuals, and administered for legally incompetent individuals and minors according to regulations. Per capita payments from the Western Shoshone Judgment Roll will be distributed directly to living competent adults over 19 years old in supervised individual Indian money accounts. Payments will be disbursed over 4 years in equal installments, starting at 25% of the principal plus interest. The first payment goes to those who turn 18 and are legally competent, with subsequent payments on their following 3 birthdays. All funds are subject to the provisions of Public Law 93-134. Any unpaid interest on shares held by eligible adults for 6 years will be added to the principal funds. Residual principal and interest funds after distribution will also be added to the principal funds. Receiving judgment funds does not waive any treaty rights. The waiver of any existing treaty rights under the \"1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley\" does not prevent Western Shoshone Tribe or individuals from pursuing other rights guaranteed by law. SEC. 3. DISTRIBUTION OF DOCKETS 326-A-1 AND 326-A-3. The funds from the judgment awards for the Western Shoshone Indians in Docket Numbers 326-A-1 and 326-A-3, along with funds from section 2, will be distributed to establish the \"Western Shoshone Educational Trust Fund\" for the benefit of the Western Shoshone members.

Funds will not be distributed on a per capita basis. An Administrative Committee will oversee the distribution of educational grants and assistance from the Western Shoshone Educational Trust Fund. The Committee will consist of representatives from various Shoshone tribes and organizations, each serving a term. The Committee members serve 4-year terms and appoint replacements if vacancies last over 60 days. The Secretary consults with the Committee on fund management.

The Committee may use a portion of interest funds for expenses, appeal jurisdiction can be with tribal court, and an accountant must prepare annual financial statements. The Committee compiles a list of approved individuals for grants or assistance in a fiscal year. The financial statement and list are distributed to Committee organizations, the Secretary, and available to Western Shoshone members upon request. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include the Administrative Committee, Secretary of the Interior, Trust Fund, and Western Shoshone members who meet specific criteria.
