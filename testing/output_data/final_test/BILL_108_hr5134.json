    "content": "SECTION 1. PROMPT CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN PETITIONS REQUESTING FEDERAL RECOGNITION AS AN INDIAN TRIBE. The Secretary must publish a proposed finding within 6 months and a final determination within one year of the enactment of the Act for each eligible tribe seeking Federal recognition. Tribes have the option to opt into an expedited procedure within 45 days of the Act's enactment. The Act allows potentially eligible tribes to opt into expedited procedures within 90 days of enactment, making them eligible tribes. The number of members in a tribe's petition for recognition is not a factor in the process. The Secretary may review the eligibility of individual members or groups listed in a petition. If the Secretary fails to publish a proposed finding or final determination within the required time period, the eligible tribe can seek a determination in court for recognition as an Indian tribe. The eligible tribe can seek a review in court if the final determination refuses to recognize them as an Indian tribe. No other petitions for recognition can be processed until the Secretary publishes a proposed finding for each eligible tribe. No changes in criteria for federally recognized tribes. Definitions for eligible tribe include initial application before 1988, \"Ready, Waiting for Active Consideration\" status in 2004, and notification to Secretary within 90 days of enactment. The potentially eligible tribe is defined as a tribe that applied for recognition before October 17, 1988, is listed as \"Ready, Waiting for Active Consideration\" by July 1, 2004, and has not notified the Secretary of their choice for expedited consideration. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or their designee."
