    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Embassy Design and Security Act of 2010\". Congress finds that embassies are a reflection of American values and should prioritize design, architecture, sustainability, technology, and security. The Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations has completed numerous diplomatic facilities since 2001, moving thousands of individuals into safer buildings. OBO has multiple building projects in progress, demonstrating its ability to construct facilities efficiently. Since the August 1998 embassy bombings in East Africa, United States diplomatic and consular facilities have faced increasing attacks. The Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations constructs safe and functional facilities for American diplomats to advance foreign policy and create secure communities worldwide. Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan outlined core principles in his memo for Federal Architecture. The core principles outlined in a memo by Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan for Federal Architecture emphasize the importance of providing distinguished facilities that reflect the dignity and stability of the American National Government. Avoiding the development of an official style and seeking advice from distinguished architects are key aspects, with the choice and development of the building site considered the first step in the design process. The General Services Administration's Design Excellence Program establishes policies for selecting architects and artists for commissions, ensuring high-quality facilities and artworks. The Energy Independence and Security Act defines a high-performance building as one that integrates various attributes for optimal performance. The 2009 American Institute of Architects and the Center for Strategic and International Studies have highlighted the importance of designing embassies that reflect unique site needs and avoid creating a perception of a fearful United States behind high walls. The commission emphasizes the importance of integrating security features into embassy designs to reflect new diplomatic needs and avoid creating a perception of a fearful United States behind high walls. The United States adopts design excellence to create secure, sustainable diplomatic facilities in support of foreign policy. A Design Excellence Program is established at the Department of State. The Secretary of State is tasked with developing a design excellence program for diplomatic facilities, prioritizing security, integrating sustainability practices, encouraging innovation in building design, and testing new technologies for potential value. The Secretary of State is required to establish a design excellence program for diplomatic facilities, including creating a manual to explain the program's mandate and implementation, and forming a high-level board to track progress semiannually. The design excellence program for diplomatic facilities includes reviewing progress, training staff, conducting post-occupancy evaluations, utilizing external research studies, involving fine arts advisors, and conducting concurrent reviews. The curr_chunk discusses the concurrent review of the Standard Embassy Design Program to integrate a new design excellence program and make necessary modifications. The curr_chunk introduces the establishment of an Architectural Advisory Board. The Secretary will reestablish the Architectural Advisory Board to advise on design standards, recommend architecture styles, review designs, balance security and openness, ensure energy efficiency, and select urban locations for diplomatic facilities. The Architectural Advisory Board will advise on design standards, recommend architecture styles, review designs, balance security and openness, ensure energy efficiency, select urban locations for diplomatic facilities, and construct new facilities with future growth needs in mind. The Board will consist of 5 members appointed by the Secretary from outside the US Government with expertise in architecture and design. Members must be appointed within 60 days of the Act's enactment and meet at least semiannually. The Architectural Advisory Board will consist of 5 members appointed by the Secretary with expertise in architecture and design. Members must meet at least semiannually and will be compensated for their duties. The Architectural Advisory Board members will be compensated in a manner similar to chapter 57 of title 5, US Code, with a limitation of 90 days per year. The Board is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. REPORT TO REVIEW THE STANDARD EMBASSY DESIGN PROGRAM. The Architectural Review Board will assess the Standard Embassy Design Program within a year of the Act's enactment. This assessment will include a review of the design template, cost-effectiveness of different design classes, flexibility of design, and alternative approaches for architects and engineers. The Standard Embassy Design Program aims to guide architects and engineers in designing embassies that meet specific site needs while incorporating standard design components. The program's effectiveness is evaluated in integrating security concerns, accommodating future personnel growth, incorporating sustainable design and energy efficiency standards, allowing public access, and ensuring overall design excellence. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations on integrating the Embassy Design Excellence Program with the Standard Embassy Design Program and necessary modifications to the SED Program. SEC. 7. MODIFIED SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR FACILITIES. Sense of Congress on Co-Location and Security Requirements: Congress believes that the Secretary should consider maximizing the use of embassy sites, balancing cost efficiency and security, and exploring alternative location arrangements without compromising security for US Government personnel. The appropriateness of security arrangements for US Government personnel is crucial, with a need for uniformly high security standards at all locations hosting US Government personnel. While the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 imposes a uniform perimeter distance requirement for diplomatic and consular facilities, a more nuanced approach may be needed to tailor security requirements to specific country contexts. Every country with diplomatic representation should have a modern, secure, safe, and functional facility. The Secretary of State should establish the Diplomatic and Consular Facilities Task Force to review and recommend modifications to existing regulations and procedures for implementing security measures at diplomatic and consular facilities. The Task Force, composed of 7 members, includes 4 senior career professionals from the Department of State and 3 professionals outside the US Government with expertise in construction and security. All members must be appointed within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Task Force is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act and will terminate upon submitting a report to Congress. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment, detailing the Task Force recommendations and their impact on US diplomatic and consular facilities. The Comptroller General will then submit a report to congressional committees within 120 days of the Secretary's report. The Secretary of State must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment, detailing Task Force recommendations and their impact on US diplomatic and consular facilities. The Comptroller General will then submit recommendations for improving security standards at these facilities to congressional committees."
