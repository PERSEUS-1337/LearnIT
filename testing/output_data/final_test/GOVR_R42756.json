    "content": "U.S. energy policy since the 1970s has focused on ensuring a secure energy supply, keeping costs low for economic growth, and protecting the environment. Import dependence, especially on oil for transportation, is a key concern. The debate also includes issues like global climate change due to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. The goals of U.S. energy policy include reducing consumption through energy efficiency, increasing domestic production of conventional energy sources, and developing renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels. The diversity of energy consumption and supply in the United States complicates these goals, with three major sectors for consumption and traditional reliance on fossil energy sources like petroleum, natural gas, and coal. In the residential/commercial and industrial sectors, electricity accounts for about 75% and 35% of energy consumption, respectively. Petroleum remains dominant in the transportation sector, with corn-derived ethanol replacing around 10% of gasoline consumption. Coal used to supply half of the national electricity generation but has declined to about 33% in 2015, while natural gas has risen to nearly equal levels. Nuclear fission provides about 20% of electricity, hydropower less than 10%. Generating electricity from coal emits roughly twice the carbon dioxide compared to natural gas. The role of government in energy markets is a key issue, with debates on intervention and conservation. Fission supplies 20%, hydropower less than 10%, while wind power has increased to almost 5%. Petroleum now contributes less than 1% to electricity generation. Energy consumption reduction through conservation and efficiency has been a major policy focus since the 1970s energy crisis. Federal programs set fuel economy standards for vehicles. Development of energy-efficient technologies, including Smart Grid for electricity distribution and hybrid vehicle battery designs, has received continued support. Grant programs for improving residences and appliance efficiency standards have also been ongoing, albeit controversial in tight budget times. Light bulb efficiency requirements have been a long-standing issue amidst efforts to reduce oil dependence. The increase in domestic production of crude oil from unconventional sources like the Bakken and Eagle Ford formations has raised concerns about environmental effects. This has led to a repeal of limits on exports of U.S.-produced crude, as part of the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Act was repealed on December 18, 2015, leading to extended moratoria on leasing for oil resources on federal land. Environmental concerns, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, have added to the controversy surrounding oil production and transportation. Projects like the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline have faced opposition due to potential environmental impacts. The Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline have faced opposition due to environmental concerns. Some argue against increasing oil production, as it delays the transition to renewable energy. Oil prices have been volatile since 2004, with speculation driving costs. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act aimed to address market manipulation but remains controversial due to global market influences. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established to address oil supply interruptions, but some argue it has been used to influence oil prices. Oil and gasoline prices have remained low since June 2014, with crude oil prices dropping from above $100 per barrel to below $50 per barrel. Since August 2015, crude oil prices have dropped significantly, leading to lower gasoline prices for U.S. consumers. The decrease in prices has raised concerns about the profitability of oil suppliers and the long-term impact on the oil industry and oil-reliant nations. Unlike the global oil market, the natural gas market in the United States is mostly domestic, with production increasing due to shale development. This has raised environmental concerns regarding groundwater effects. Shale gas development has raised environmental concerns about hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling's effects on groundwater. The potential increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports has sparked controversy due to the complex processing and loading facilities required. There is also debate over exporting energy resources like oil and natural gas and their impact on prices, supply, and energy security. The electric power sector has been independent of oil import dependence since the mid-1980s, but remains a key player in America's energy mix. Electricity plays a central role in America's energy mix, leading to controversies, especially regarding the coal industry. The Environmental Protection Agency's initiatives for tighter emissions restrictions on coal-fired power plants have sparked debate. Critics argue that these regulations could lead to excessive costs, plant retirements, and potential threats to electricity capacity reliability. Some in the electric power industry believe these concerns are exaggerated. The EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) finalized regulations to limit carbon dioxide emissions in the electric power sector, aiming for a 32% reduction by 2030. The plan has faced litigation, with the Supreme Court issuing a stay in 2016. The controversy surrounding the CPP stems from concerns about costs, plant retirements, and electricity capacity reliability. The Supreme Court stayed the CPP during litigation, rendering it unenforceable. Nuclear power faces opposition due to safety and waste concerns, but is supported for its lack of greenhouse gas emissions. Cost and safety issues, highlighted by the Fukushima accident, have raised doubts about expanding nuclear power. Developing alternative energy sources is another path to meet energy policy goals. Developing alternative energy sources is crucial to reaching the goals of energy policy. Congressional mandates have increased consumption of ethanol and biofuels, but the reliance on corn for fuel ethanol may impact food production and prices. Technology barriers exist for producing ethanol from non-food sources. Natural gas-powered vehicles are slowly being adopted due to recent increases in natural gas production, but barriers such as infrastructure development and cost difficulties remain. Replacing fossil fuels remains a key goal in the energy debate. Replacing fossil fuels is a key goal in the energy debate, extending beyond just the transportation sector. Initiatives focus on electricity production from renewable sources like wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Environmental concerns drive these programs, with nuclear power also considered as an alternative. However, the cost competitiveness of new nuclear power generators is questioned due to the influx of natural gas resources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005; P.L. 109-58) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140) introduced new regulations and standards in energy policy, including fuel economy targets and renewable fuels requirements. The program of energy project loan guarantees set up by EPAct 2005 became controversial after the bankruptcy of Solyndra in 2011. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) set new efficiency standards for appliances and light bulbs, with controversial implications. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in the 111th Congress included major energy policy provisions, such as expanding the loan guarantee program and increasing funding for renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy received significant funding in ARRA for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, including grants to states and investments in Smart Grid technology. In the 114th Congress, both the House and Senate are considering energy legislation. The Senate passed the Energy Policy and Modernization Act, while the House passed the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act. Both bills address energy efficiency, water conservation, electric grid cybersecurity, and review of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The House bill also includes electric grid physical security. The House and Senate energy bills address topics such as electric grid security, helium, critical minerals, energy storage, and loan programs. President Obama's Climate Action Plan directed EPA to propose carbon dioxide emission standards for power plants, leading to the Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) was subject to ongoing litigation with states and entities challenging or supporting the rule. The Supreme Court stayed the CPP in February 2016, and the U.S. Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in September 2016. Legislation was introduced in Congress to disapprove the rule, but the President vetoed it. Additionally, the House passed the Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015 to delay implementation. The House passed H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015, to delay the implementation of the Clean Power Plan. The Senate's S. 1324, the Affordable Reliable Electricity Now Act, has similar provisions. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act repealed the 40-year limitation on U.S. crude oil exports and extended energy tax incentives. United States exported 29 million barrels of crude oil to new destinations in the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia. Tax incentives such as production tax credits for wind and solar electricity, electric vehicle tax credits, and incentives for advanced biofuel production were discussed in the 114th Congress. The Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act was vetoed by President Obama in 2015, and the pipeline project was rejected by the Department of State in 2016. The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act aimed to give EPA regulatory jurisdiction over hydraulic fracturing, while the Safe Hydration Is an American Right in Energy Development Act of 2015 sought to make amendments related to energy development. The Safe Hydration Is an American Right in Energy Development Act of 2015 (H.R. 1515) and the Fracturing Regulations Are Effective in State Hands Act (S. 828) propose new regulations for hydraulic fracturing. The Obama Administration issued new fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for vehicle model years 2017-2025. EPA has authority to set GHG standards indefinitely, while NHTSA is limited to five-year increments. NHTSA has set standards for MY2017-MY2021 and proposed standards beyond that. A mid-term evaluation in 2017 will assess progress, revisit cost-benefit analyses, and propose new CAFE standards. Automakers are seeking changes to limit penalties under the CAFE program, despite compliance with GHG standards."
