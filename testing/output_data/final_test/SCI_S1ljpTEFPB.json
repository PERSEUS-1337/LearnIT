    "content": "Network pruning aims to increase sparsity in neural networks by zeroing out parameters to reduce architecture size and computational speed. Deep neural networks have achieved near-human accuracy in various applications, but over-parameterization can lead to complexity and overfitting. Training deep models with billions of weights requires significant computational power, making them impractical for low-power devices. Various methods have been proposed for creating more compact models, including traditional methods like model compression, network pruning, sparsity-inducing regularizer, and low-rank approximation. Structured pruning methods have been introduced to compress the architecture with significant computational efficiency. One critical aspect of interest in sparsity learning is maintaining accuracy levels. The paper discusses the reasons for accuracy drop due to excessive sparsity in the network and proposes a method to prevent it. The key is to understand the connection between sparsity and accuracy to control sparsity effectively. Different approaches like group lasso, structure scale constraining, and structured regularizing deep architectures are suggested for network pruning and feature selection. The paper proposes a supervised attention mechanism for sparsity learning to compress the model, prevent accuracy drop, and supervise sparsity operation. This method addresses the lack of control mechanisms in previous research efforts and aims to balance sparsity and accuracy effectively. The research proposes a supervised attention mechanism for sparsity learning to balance accuracy and sparsity effectively. It introduces a generic mechanism not limited by sparsity penalties or network architecture assumptions. The paper reviews related research efforts, introduces the attention mechanism to activate network sections, and provides experimental results showing prevention of severe accuracy drop at higher sparsity levels. The proposed method aims to address the severe accuracy drop in higher sparsity levels through network weights pruning and compression. Previous research efforts have focused on parameter reduction, with some achieving computational speedup through structure pruning. The curr_chunk discusses methods for training speedup and sparsity enforcement using 0-regularization and adaptive gradient clipping. The goal is to impose sparsity accurately and interpretably using the attention mechanism. Previous attention-based deep architectures have been proposed for image and speech domains. The curr_chunk proposes the use of guided attention to enforce sparsity in mapping targeted elements to desired distributions. The attention mechanism aims to control sparsity operation independently of model architecture or layer type while maintaining accuracy and compression objectives. The variance loss is suggested as an auxiliary cost term to achieve this goal. The proposed scheme introduces variance loss as an auxiliary cost term to enforce skewed distribution of weights for sparsity. It aims to keep a portion of weights dominant to control sparsity and ensure information transmission. The objective function combines variance regularization with cross-entropy loss to create a sparse structure in a parametric model. The model function is defined with regularization functions and weighting coefficients for losses. The variance function serves as a regularization term for parameters, aiming for higher variance as the objective. The addition of a new term to the loss function can increase model complexity by introducing a new hyper-parameter. The study expands the use of variance regularization to include sparsity supervision. The proposed approach suggests using a dependent parameter as the variance loss coefficient to prevent an increase in model complexity. Group sparsity is commonly used for feature selection by deactivating neurons in a cluster of weights. The group sparsity objective function can be defined based on the weights in each group. The proposed Structured Attention (SA) regularization adds an attention mechanism on group sparsity learning, focusing on predefined groups. This mechanism can be applied to any function as a sparsity objective, not limited to the suggested structured method. The proposed Structured Attention (SA) regularization adds an attention mechanism on group sparsity learning, focusing on predefined groups. The Guided Attention in Sparsity Learning (GASL) mechanism supervises attention towards mapping element values to a target distribution for sparsity imposition. The text discusses utilizing variational Bayesian inference for gradient computation to maximize variance in a vector. Inspired by previous work, additive random vectors are used for variance regularization. The task involves finding the optimal matrix M to maximize the trace of the vector V(\u03b8) for robust mini-batch optimization. The text discusses the importance of maximizing the trace of the variance matrix for robust mini-batch optimization. Utilizing additive random vectors can improve accuracy by supervising the attention mechanism. High variance of parameters can slow down algorithm speed and performance for sparsity enforcement. The text discusses the importance of maximizing the trace of the variance matrix for robust mini-batch optimization. The algorithm for random vector selection is declared in Algorithm 1, with the choice of V r highly correlated with V. The distribution pdf should be specified for the desired output distribution, with a preference for log-normal distribution due to its special characteristics. If the variance of the random vector V r is less than the main vector V, no additive operation will be performed. The GASL algorithm operates on structured attention for attention supervision, with a focus on the output channels of a convolutional layer. The combination of GASL and structured attention is visualized in Fig. 1, showcasing the output feature map and weights associated with each channel. This mechanism prevents the need for additive random samples if the [\u03b8] parameters variance is high enough compared to the V (\u03b8) vector, resulting in a practical speedup. The GASL algorithm focuses on structured attention for attention supervision in convolutional layers. The activation visualization shows the impact of attention-based sparsity enforcement on output channels. Three databases are used for evaluation: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Gradient clipping is employed to increase convergence speed without performance degradation. The method dynamically defines the gradient clipping range to address slow training convergence. In experiments, gradient clipping was used with a dynamic range defined by \u03b6/\u03b3. Hyper-parameters were selected through cross-validation. Two network architectures, LeNet-5-Caffe 10 and a multilayer perceptron, were employed. Group sparsity was enforced for feature selection. Results showed the superiority of the SA method over SSL in terms of accuracy. The function for both LeNet and MLP networks is the same, with the only difference being the addition of structural attention. Compared to previous work, we achieved higher sparsity levels with better accuracy for the MLP network and competitive accuracy for the LeNet network. Experiments were conducted using LeNet-5-Caffe and MLP architectures with specific numbers of filters and hidden units. Data augmentation techniques were applied during training. In the training phase, data augmentation was standardized, and center cropping was used for evaluation. Batch-normalization was applied after each convolutional layer. The learning rate started at 0.1 and decreased by a factor of 10 when the error plateaued. The GASL algorithm combined with SA showed high sparsity levels and competitive accuracy for Cifar-100. Training stopped after 300 epochs or if the error didn't improve for 20 consecutive epochs. For Cifar-10, good results were achieved for accuracy and sparsity. The proposed method excelled in achieving higher sparsity levels. The proposed method excelled in achieving higher sparsity levels for Cifar-100 experiments, showing performance superiority in accuracy. Different methods were compared at various levels of sparsity, with some methods outperforming the baseline. The method demonstrated robustness to hyperparameter tuning and prevented accuracy drops at high sparsity levels. The proposed method shows robustness to hyperparameter tuning and investigates the effect of tuning the variance loss coefficient on accuracy drop in Cifar-100 experiments. The results demonstrate the method's ability to maintain accuracy across different alpha values and sparsity levels, highlighting its robustness to hyperparameter selection. The method utilizes a guided attention mechanism for controlled sparsity enforcement, keeping targeted elements alive with the GASL algorithm. The GASL algorithm, used with structured attention, prunes unimportant channels and neurons in convolutional and fully-connected layers to maintain accuracy in high sparsity levels. The method is robust to hyperparameter selection and can be adapted to different layer types and sparsity objectives."
