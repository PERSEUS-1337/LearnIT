    "content": "The Act titled \"San Francisco Bay Estuary Ecosystem Restoration Act of 2002\" aims to restore the San Francisco Bay Estuary ecosystem. The Secretary of the Army, through the Chief of Engineers, can participate in critical restoration projects in the San Francisco Bay estuary area and adjacent watersheds. Project selection is based on recommendations from the Army Corps of Engineers and the California Department of Fish and Game for waterfowl habitat restoration. The Secretary may develop criteria and procedures for prioritizing critical restoration projects in the San Francisco Bay estuary area and adjacent watersheds, consistent with waterfowl habitat objectives. The criteria and procedures should align with the San Pablo Bay watershed restoration program. The San Pablo Bay watershed restoration program, outlined in the San Pablo Bay Watershed Restoration Framework Program Final Report, aligns with the Central Valley Habitat Joint Venture Implementation Plan for evaluating projects. The Secretary will prioritize projects for implementation under this section by consulting with public and private entities. The projects may involve dredged material reuse, fish screen installation, and habitat enhancement on Grizzly Island Wildlife Area in the Suisun Marsh. The Secretary will utilize existing studies and plans to identify project needs and priorities. The Secretary will prioritize projects for implementation by consulting with public and private entities involved in watershed planning and ecosystem restoration in San Francisco Bay estuary watersheds. Projects may be carried out after entering into agreements with non-Federal interests, including nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit entities, with consent from local government, may serve as non-Federal sponsors for projects. Cost-sharing requirements apply before implementing any project. Before implementing any project, the Secretary must enter into a binding agreement with the non-Federal interest, requiring them to pay 35% of the total project cost, provide necessary resources, and cover all operation and maintenance costs. The non-Federal share can be in cash or in-kind contributions. The Secretary will credit the non-Federal interest for providing lands, easements, rights-of-way, dredged material disposal areas, or relocations, funds from the CALFED Bay-Delta Program, and the cost of design and construction work integral to the project. The funds appropriated for the project will not be used to convert more than 10% of existing Suisun Marsh habitat types. A critical restoration project is defined as one that provides immediate and substantial ecosystem benefits. $50,000,000 is authorized for this section, with up to $20,000,000 available for critical restoration projects. $20,000,000 allocated for restoration projects in San Pablo Bay watershed and $10,000,000 for projects in Grizzly Island Wildlife Area in Suisun Marsh. Maximum of $10,000,000 for each project."
