    "content": "The Act titled \"National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare Act of 1997\" establishes a commission known as the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. The Congress acknowledges the importance of the Medicare program in providing healthcare coverage to senior citizens and individuals with disabilities. It is noted that the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is facing financial challenges, with projections of insolvency by 2001 due to spending exceeding revenue since 1995.
