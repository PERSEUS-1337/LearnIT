    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Farmington Wild and Scenic River Act\". Key findings are also included in the Act. The Farmington Wild and Scenic River Act authorized a study of two segments of the West Branch of the Farmington River for potential inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The study found both segments eligible based on their free-flowing condition and outstanding values. The towns abutting the Connecticut segment of the Farmington River have shown support for national wild and scenic river designation through town meetings and protective measures. A comprehensive management plan has been prepared for the segment. The Farmington River Study Committee adopted the Upper Farmington River Management Plan for the Connecticut segment, recommending its inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. No action was recommended for the Massachusetts segment without town support. The Colebrook Dam and Goodwin Dam hydroelectric projects, located outside the designated river segment, can continue operation without diminishing the scenic, recreational, and wildlife values of the designated area. SEC. 3. DESIGNATION. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is amended to designate a 14-mile segment of the Farmington River in Connecticut as a recreational river, to be managed by the Secretary of the Interior through cooperative agreements with the State of Connecticut and relevant political subdivisions. The Upper Farmington River Management Plan, dated April 29, 1993, and any amendments approved by the Secretary of the Interior, will fulfill the requirement for a comprehensive management plan under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. SEC. 4. MANAGEMENT. The Director of the National Park Service represents the Secretary on the Farmington River Coordinating Committee. The Secretary will offer cooperative agreements for the protection of the designated river segment to the State of Connecticut, political subdivisions, and the Farmington River Watershed Association. Other parties represented on the Committee may also enter into agreements consistent with the Plan. The agreements under this Act will support the protection and enhancement of the designated river segment. The Secretary can provide assistance for the Plan's implementation, but it will not be considered National Park Service administration. Water resources projects must be assessed for adverse effects. The proposed water resources project's impact on the designated river segment's values in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System will be considered in relation to the Plan. The Plan will be the primary source of information for maintaining instream resources and assessing compatibility between resource protection and water supply withdrawals. Zoning ordinances in towns along the river will also play a role in land management. The towns along the river, including those with \"river protection overlay districts,\" will be considered villages under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Federal acquisition of lands by condemnation will be prohibited in the designated segment. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The \"Committee\" refers to the Farmington River Coordinating Committee, the \"Plan\" is the Upper Farmington River Management Plan, and the \"Secretary\" is the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 6. FUNDING AUTHORIZATION. Sums are authorized for the Act's purposes, including amending the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The curr_chunk is about the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States, who also serves as the President of the Senate."
