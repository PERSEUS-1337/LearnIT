    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"MTBE Elimination Act\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that a single cup of MTBE can contaminate all the water in a 5,000,000-gallon well, MTBE easily transfers from gasoline to air to water, and exposure to MTBE has been linked to tumors and nervous system disorders in animals. Exposure to MTBE during pregnancy can lead to maternal toxicity. The Health Effects Institute reported in February 1996 that studies of MTBE support its classification as a neurotoxicant with possible adverse effects on a developing fetus. Higher levels of MTBE in the bloodstream are linked to symptoms like headaches, eye irritation, and nausea. MTBE also reduces the efficiency of technologies used to clean water contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. The costs of remediating MTBE water contamination in the United States could reach billions of dollars. Studies are ongoing to find cost-efficient solutions for cleaning drinking water contaminated by MTBE, but no engineering solutions have been found yet. Remediation of MTBE-contaminated drinking water can cost millions of dollars per municipality, with industrial cleanups averaging around $150,000. The reformulated gasoline program under the Clean Air Act has led to significant reductions in emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol is considered an effective fuel-blending component that reduces carbon monoxide emissions and provides high octane. Ethanol can help reduce the use of aromatics, lower emissions of toxic air pollutants, and provide air quality benefits. The Department of Agriculture found that ethanol production can be expanded to meet reformulated gasoline program needs in 4 years without significant price impacts. Research efforts should focus on infrastructure challenges to allow ethanol to meet program requirements as MTBE is phased out. The reformulated gasoline program is transitioning away from MTBE. Congress suggests providing assistance for testing and remediation of water contaminated with methyl tertiary butyl ether. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA and \"Eligible grantee\" as entities like federal research agencies, universities, and private research organizations. SEC. 4. USE AND LABELING OF MTBE AS A FUEL ADDITIVE. This section addresses the use and labeling of MTBE as a fuel additive. Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a fuel additive three years after enactment. Retailers selling gasoline with MTBE must label their fuel dispensing systems with information specified by the Administrator. The Administrator will establish a schedule for phased reduction in the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether as a fuel additive over a 3-year period. SEC. 5. GRANTS FOR RESEARCH ON MTBE GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION AND REMEDIATION. The Administrator will establish an MTBE research grants program within the EPA to fund research on cost-effective ground water testing methods, remediation procedures, and the effects of MTBE on human health. The Administrator will accept proposals for grants. The Administrator will seek, evaluate, and award grants based on merit, quality, and relevance. Priority will be given to proposals with matching funds. Grants will be awarded competitively and have a maximum term of 4 years. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2004. SEC. 6. REFORMULATED GASOLINE. The Congress finds that reformulated gasoline must contain a minimum of 2.0 percent oxygen to reduce emissions. Ethanol at a 10 percent blending rate provides a 3.5 percent oxygen content, leading to reduced volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, and toxic air pollutant emissions. The National Research Council found that carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles contribute significantly to ozone formation. Reducing carbon monoxide emissions positively impacts ozone air quality. Blending ethanol into gasoline increases volatility, requiring producers to reduce volatility at increased expense. The benefits of reduced carbon monoxide emissions on ozone air quality are not fully considered in the USEPA's reformulated gasoline compliance methodology. The EPA is directed to require a 0.5 pounds per square inch Reid vapor pressure allowance for reformulated gasoline with 3.5 percent oxygen to offset carbon monoxide emissions and improve ozone air quality. The EPA requires reformulated gasoline with 3.5 percent oxygen to have a 0.5 pounds per square inch Reid vapor pressure allowance to offset carbon monoxide emissions and improve ozone air quality. Any additional volatile organic compound emissions from this gasoline are not calculated for compliance with the Clean Air Act."
