    "content": "Latin America has made significant progress in political development over the past two decades, with most countries holding regular free and fair elections. However, challenges such as economic decline, poverty, violent conflicts, autocratic leaders, drug trafficking, and crime threaten political stability. The region experienced slower economic growth in 2002 and 2003, with Argentina and Uruguay being particularly affected. In 2002 and 2003, Latin America faced economic decline, with Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela experiencing deep recessions. However, by the end of 2004, the region rebounded with a growth rate of 5.5%, surpassing expectations. This economic downturn led to political pressure on elected governments in South America, with Bolivia and Peru facing violent protests. In Bolivia, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada resigned in October 2003 due to violent protests. Colombia dealt with challenges from drug trafficking organizations and guerrilla groups. Venezuela faced political polarization under President Hugo Chavez. Argentina's democratic system was stressed after protests led to a president's resignation in December 2001. President N\u00e9stor Kirchner implemented bold policy moves for human rights and institutional reform. President N\u00e9stor Kirchner's policy moves in human rights and institutional reform restored faith in the Argentine government. Central American countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua saw democratic institutions strengthen but faced rampant violent crime. Guatemala's 1996 peace accords ended a civil conflict, but substantive reforms were lacking. New Guatemalan President Oscar Berger took office in 2004, with hopes for improvement. In the Caribbean, Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide resigned amid armed opposition control. In Haiti, armed opposition groups took control of half the country, leading to President Bush deploying U.S. military forces to secure key facilities. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was established in June 2004. In Cuba, Fidel Castro maintained tight control over the Communist government. The human rights situation worsened in 2003 with the arrest of 75 dissidents. Congressional focus in the 108th Congress was on counter-narcotics efforts, security cooperation, and trade issues in Latin America. The annual foreign operations appropriations legislation funded foreign aid and influenced U.S. policy towards Latin America. Congress focused on trade, migration, border, and drug trafficking issues with Mexico. U.S. counter-narcotics efforts in the region supported Colombia and its neighbors. Security concerns heightened after the September 11, 2001, attacks, leading to increased cooperation on anti-terrorism. In the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, bilateral and regional cooperation on anti-terrorism issues increased. The United States expanded its assistance to Colombia to include counterterrorism support. In June 2002, an Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism was signed by the United States and other members of the Organization of American States to improve regional cooperation. President Bush submitted the convention to the Senate for approval in November 2002. U.S. officials emphasized the importance of trade in stimulating economic development in Latin America and aimed to strengthen trade linkages through free trade agreements, such as the bilateral FTA signed with Chile in June 2003. In June 2003, the US and Chile signed a bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA), followed by the completion of negotiations for the US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in December 2003. Additional bilateral negotiations led to Costa Rica agreeing to CAFTA in January 2004. The US also concluded negotiations with the Dominican Republic for a similar FTA in March 2004. All seven countries signed the US-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) on August 5, 2004. The US continued FTA negotiations with Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, aiming for Bolivia to join in the future. Negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by January 2005 faced challenges due to differences in approach. The US also supported regional development through foreign assistance programs. The US supported regional development in Latin America through foreign assistance programs administered by USAID, focusing on education, poverty reduction, health care, conservation, disaster mitigation, counter-narcotics, and HIV/AIDS prevention. The Peace Corps was active in the region, and US foreign aid to Latin America totaled around $1.6 billion in FY2004. In 2004, the United States provided $22.6 million in humanitarian assistance to Caribbean nations affected by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Tropical Storm Jeanne. Congress approved $100 million in emergency funding for the region. The Bush Administration's Millennium Challenge Account could increase U.S. foreign aid worldwide. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) could increase U.S. foreign assistance worldwide, including to Latin American nations with strong governance and economic policies. In 2004, Bolivia, Honduras, and Nicaragua were deemed eligible for MCA funding. Some Members of Congress proposed increasing assistance to combat poverty in Latin America, with a bill authorizing $500 million annually for a Social Investment and Economic Development Fund for the Americas. President Bush proposed a temporary worker program in 2004 to allow undocumented persons in the United States and foreign workers to work for three years with legal temporary status. However, the proposal faced opposition from those advocating for broader amnesty for undocumented workers and those against rewarding illegal residents. President Bush also met with hemispheric leaders at a Special Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico. The Summit of the Americas in Monterrey, Mexico in January 2004 resulted in the Declaration of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, focusing on economic growth, social development, and democratic governance. Key agreements included reducing remittance costs by half by 2008 and increasing lending to small enterprises. The Declaration did not include a U.S. proposal to bar corrupt officials from meetings or set a deadline for the FTAA agreement. Some observers criticized the Bush Administration for not paying enough attention to Latin America's economic and political stability, as the Administration focused on global anti-terrorism, the war in Iraq, and homeland security. They argued that instability in the region could impact U.S. exports, energy needs, and lead to increased illegal migration. The United States maintained an active policy towards Latin America, focusing on free trade, assistance to combat drug trafficking and terrorism in the Andean region. Congress is divided on the appropriate policy towards illegal narcotics in the region, with a historical focus on counternarcotics efforts. Success has been seen in controlling coca production in Bolivia. In the mid-to-late 1990s, coca cultivation expanded into uncontrolled areas of Colombia, leading to the production of high-grade heroin. The US Congress approved assistance to combat drug production and trafficking in Colombia through Plan Colombia and the Andean Regional Initiative. Colombia is a major source of cocaine production, with 80% originating from the country. The Clinton policy in Colombia included a significant increase in assistance to six neighboring countries. This funding supported antinarcotics efforts through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The 107th Congress authorized U.S. assistance to help Colombia combat threats from illegal armed groups funded by the drug trade. The 108th Congress continued to assess the effectiveness of U.S. aid in the Andean region. The Bush Administration's FY2004 budget request separated funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative and Foreign Military Financing. According to United States and Colombian officials, coca cultivation in Colombia dropped 15% in 2002 and 21% in 2003, marking the first reduction in acreage devoted to coca cultivation. Poppy cultivation also decreased by 24% in 2002. The goal of spraying 50% of the country's coca crop by the end of 2005 may have been achieved two years ahead of schedule. However, coca cultivation increased in Bolivia during 2002 and 2003, while Peru saw a 15% decrease in 2003. Critics argue that winning the war against drugs is futile as long as demand persists. The Bush Administration argues that the U.S. faces a threat from drug production and insurgent guerrilla organizations fueled by the drug trade in the Andean region. They believe that assisting Colombia is necessary to support its democratic government against drug-supported armed groups. Assistance to Colombia's neighbors is also deemed necessary due to the spillover of violence and potential resurgence of drug cultivation. Some critics argue that the Bush plan for Colombia overemphasizes military and counter-drug assistance, lacking support for human rights and peace processes. Concerns arise over U.S. involvement in Colombia's guerrilla conflict and ties to rightist groups with human rights violations. President Uribe's inauguration raised further concerns about his tolerance of rightist armed groups. An agreement was reached with the rightist paramilitary group AUC for disarmament by the end of 2005. President Uribe proposed conditional amnesties for illegal combatants who disarm. Critics doubt the effectiveness of U.S.-funded fumigation and development projects to reduce drug cultivation. The U.S. has provided significant funding to combat drug trafficking in Colombia since Plan Colombia in 1999. Since 2000, the US has provided $3.7 billion in assistance for counternarcotics efforts in Colombia. Congress granted expanded authority to use funds for a unified campaign against drug trafficking and terrorist organizations. In FY2004, $731 million was approved for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, with additional funding approved for FY2005. The funds support eradication of illegal crops, destruction of laboratories, and economic development. In FY2004, Congress approved $110 million in Foreign Military Financing for Colombia, used for training and equipping a Colombian Army brigade. The FMF request for FY2005 is $108 million. Congress has imposed provisions on human rights, aerial fumigation, and U.S. military personnel participation in combat operations. The cap on military and civilian personnel deployed in support of Plan Colombia was increased to 800 and 600, respectively, in the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) captured and killed multiple U.S. citizens in various incidents. The first case occurred in February 2003 when American contractors were involved in plane crashes and shootings by FARC members. Subsequent incidents in March and April 2003 resulted in more American casualties. Some contractors complained about the unsuitability of Cessna 208 aircraft for use in Colombia's mountainous terrain. Several air tractor crashes occurred while spraying opium poppies in Colombia, with some attributed to hostile fire. In August 2003, a U.S. citizen pilot was shot down, and in September 2003, a Costa Rican pilot was killed by hostile fire. The ELN claimed responsibility for one of the shootdowns. The Air Bridge Denial Program, aimed at intercepting drug trafficking flights, was suspended in Peru and Colombia following an accidental shooting down of a plane carrying U.S. missionaries in April 2001. Congress mandated safety enhancements before resuming the program. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in January 1994, its mixed and controversial reviews have led many Members of Congress to adopt a more cautious attitude toward future trade negotiations. This outlook was reflected in the debate over Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which continued for eight years before legislation permitting \"fast-track\" approval of trade agreements was passed in August 2002. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed in June 2003 and went into effect on January 1, 2004. The implementing legislation was passed by Congress in July 2003, with President George W. Bush signing it into law. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed into law by President George W. Bush on September 3, 2003. The agreement allows for immediate duty-free trade on 85% of consumer and industrial goods, with tariffs on farm goods and Chile's luxury tax on automobiles to be eliminated within four years. Tariffs on sensitive goods will be phased out over a period of up to 12 years. The agreement also clarifies rules on investment, services trade, intellectual property rights, labor, environment, and dispute resolution. There are no provisions on antidumping or countervailing duties. Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about certain provisions in the agreement becoming templates for future FTAs. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement was signed into law in 2003, allowing duty-free trade on most goods. Congressional hearings focused on labor, capital controls, and business entry. The U.S. also negotiated the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) with seven countries, signed in 2004. The U.S. negotiated the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) with seven countries in 2004. The agreement aimed to reconcile the needs of multiple U.S. trading partners within a regional framework, allowing each country to define its own market access schedules. If implemented, over 80% of U.S. consumer and industrial exports would become duty-free immediately. Over 80% of U.S. consumer and industrial exports would become duty-free immediately under the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). Tariffs on various products like information technology, agricultural equipment, and medical/scientific equipment would be eliminated within 10 years. Additionally, significant portions of U.S. farm exports to the region, including high-quality cuts of beef, cotton, wheat, soybeans, fruits, vegetables, processed food products, and wine, would become duty-free immediately. Tariffs on sensitive agricultural products would be phased out over 15-20 years, with some exceptions like sugar, white corn, potatoes, and onions. Other areas like services trade, intellectual property rights, investment, and government procurement also saw advancements. However, the DR-CAFTA faces political uncertainty, with opposition from some industry groups in the United States. DR-CAFTA faces political uncertainty in the United States due to opposition from industry groups and labor advocates. The Dominican Republic's passage of a revenue bill with a 25% tax on beverages containing high fructose corn syrup has jeopardized support for the agreement. The USTR has recommended to Congress that implementing legislation not include the Dominican Republic unless the tax is repealed. The fate of DR-CAFTA remains unclear. Negotiations for a bilateral FTA between the United States and Panama have been progressing quickly, with six rounds completed and a seventh scheduled. Panama's services-based economy sets it apart from its Central American neighbors, with agriculture and maritime issues posing challenges. The US aims to relax Panamanian restrictions on foreign professionals and is focused on government procurement, given plans to expand the Panama Canal. Unlike DR-CAFTA, textile trade is minimal, and labor concerns are less prominent. Panama also benefits from the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Panama is a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin Initiative's trade preferences from the US and seeks to solidify market access and investment benefits in the FTA. The draft agreement with the US is mostly completed, with sensitive market access and government procurement issues still pending. The agreement is expected to be finalized in early 2005, with implementing legislation to be introduced in the 109th Congress. The Free Trade Area of the Americas is a regional trade proposal among 34 nations aimed at promoting economic integration. The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) negotiations began in 1998 with the goal of reducing trade barriers. However, deadlines have been missed and disagreements between Brazil and the US, co-chairs of the Trade Negotiations Committee, have stalled progress. Brazil is unhappy with the US's refusal to discuss agricultural subsidies and antidumping legislation. The FTAA negotiations faced challenges due to disagreements between Brazil and the US over agricultural subsidies and antidumping legislation. To avoid an impasse, they jointly authored a Ministerial Declaration in 2003, allowing for different levels of commitments with common rights and obligations. Negotiations were on hold in 2004, but Brazil and the US have agreed to continue discussions. In 2004, FTAA negotiations were on hold, but Brazil and the United States agreed to restart them in January 2005. Both countries are seeking other Latin American nations to join sub-regional trade agreements. The region is moving towards integration through bilateral and sub-regional trade arrangements. After the 9/11 attacks, US focus on terrorism in Latin America increased, leading to enhanced cooperation through the OAS. In June 2002, OAS members signed an Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism. In June 2002, OAS members signed an Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism to improve regional cooperation. President Bush submitted the convention to the Senate in November 2002. The OAS reinvigorated the Inter-American Committee on Terrorism after 9/11, focusing on border security and counterterrorism intelligence. A Special Conference on Security in 2003 in Mexico City addressed new threats and challenges in the hemisphere. The OAS members addressed threats in the hemisphere and agreed on a cooperative approach. The State Department highlighted terrorist threats in Colombia, Peru, and the tri-border region of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Reports of an Al Qaeda presence in the tri-border region were uncorroborated. In 2004, concerns about potential Al Qaeda threats in Central America led to a terror alert in Honduras. A suspected terrorist cell leader was spotted in Honduras, and El Salvador received threats from an Islamic extremist group. There were reports of Al-Qaeda potentially using a Salvadoran criminal gang for attacks. In 2004, concerns about Al Qaeda threats in Central America led to a terror alert in Honduras. Reports suggested Al-Qaeda could use a Salvadoran gang to infiltrate the U.S.-Mexico border, but Secretary of Homeland Security denied any evidence of this. Interpol also dismissed claims of Al Qaeda links with Central American gangs as speculation. The United States provides Anti-Terrorism Assistance training and equipment to Latin American countries for improving security capabilities. In FY2002, $27.5 million was provided for the region, with $25 million for an anti-kidnapping program in Colombia and $2.5 million for the regular Western Hemisphere program. For FY2003, $3.6 million in ATA assistance was provided, with $3.3 million for Colombia. In FY2004, an estimated $2.6 million in ATA assistance was provided for the Western Hemisphere, while $5.2 million was requested for FY2005, including $1 million for the tri-border region of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, and $3.9 million for Colombia. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee report urged the Department of State to focus on training and equipment for countering terrorist financing and intelligence sharing for transitional crime. The U.S. Congress expressed concern about the investigation into the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association in Buenos Aires. Resolutions were approved urging Argentina to investigate the case thoroughly and seek U.S. law enforcement support. The U.S. Congress urged Argentina to thoroughly investigate the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires and seek U.S. law enforcement support. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America is negatively impacting economic and social development, with high infection rates in countries like Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, Guyana, and Belize. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America has high infection rates in countries like Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, Guyana, and Belize. The response to the epidemic involves support from governments, donors, organizations, and NGOs. USAID has been leading the fight against AIDS in the region since 1986, with funding increasing from $11.2 million in FY2000 to $33.8 million in FY2003. In FY2004, U.S. assistance for HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean region increased to $56.6 million, with a request for $86 million in FY2005. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act authorized $3 billion annually from FY2003 to FY2008 to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria worldwide. The focus is on 12 African countries, Guyana, and Haiti, with the possibility of adding more countries designated by the President. Members of Congress aimed to include more Caribbean countries in the legislation. The FY2005 Foreign Relations Authorization Act included provisions to add 14 Caribbean countries, but no final action was taken. Argentina, under President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, faced challenges in achieving economic growth and negotiating debt restructuring. Kirchner, a center-left Peronist, took office in May 2003 after winning 22% of the vote in a crowded presidential race. President Kirchner took office in January 2002 after the resignation of President Fernando de la Rua due to social protests over economic conditions. Despite the crisis, economic growth resumed, with a forecast of 7% growth in 2004. Kirchner's policies in human rights and institutional reform restored faith in the government. He also vowed to prosecute military officials for past human rights violations. Additionally, his government reached a stand-by agreement with the IMF in September 2003 after tough negotiations. Argentina reached a stand-by agreement with the IMF in September 2003, providing a credit line of $12.5 billion. The accord was praised for realistic fiscal targets. However, Argentina suspended the IMF loan program in August 2004 due to pressure on debt negotiations and economic reforms. Disbursement of $778 million was delayed, with talks expected to resume in December or January 2005 after progress in restructuring $100 billion in defaulted bond debt. Argentina's bond debt restructuring faced criticism from bondholders for the proposed debt reduction. A new proposal in June 2004 included payment of unpaid interest but was also criticized. The formal launch was delayed until January 2005. Despite meeting IMF targets, many Argentines have not seen improvements in living standards. U.S.-Argentine relations have been strong since 1983, but the tough U.S. stance during Argentina's crisis in 2001-2002 caused friction and increased anti-American sentiment. Despite strong bilateral relations, there have been irritants in the US-Argentina relationship, such as Argentina's closer ties with Cuba. US officials urged Argentina to work out a fair debt restructuring agreement for economic recovery. Congress expressed concern over the investigation into the 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires. Political unrest in Bolivia led to the resignation of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in 2003, succeeded by former Vice President Carlos Mesa. Protests by indigenous groups and workers over economic marginalization and gas exports to Chile resulted in 80 deaths. The new President faces challenges in governing a politically divided society. The new President of Brazil, Luis In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva, faces challenges in governing a politically fractured society and obtaining consensus on natural gas exports for economic development. His inauguration in 2003 marked a shift towards fundamental change while maintaining sound economic policies, with support from leftist and centrist parties. President Lula da Silva reached out to centrist parties in Congress, facing strains in alliances during his first two years in office. He pursued cautious economic policies, prioritizing hunger eradication through programs like Zero Hunger and Family Payments. His efforts led to lower inflation, a stronger currency, and improved credit ratings. Lula da Silva tackled long-standing issues by reforming the social security system and modifying taxes. In 2003, Brazil implemented reforms to make the social security system self-sustaining and modify the tax system. Economic growth was low at 0.3%, but it was expected to reach 3.5-4% in 2004. To protect against external shocks, Brazil extended a loan with the IMF, providing $20 billion in resources. Relations with the United States were positive, and President Lula da Silva focused on improving ties with neighboring countries. President Lula da Silva prioritized relations with neighboring countries in Mercosur, linked Mercosur with the Andean Community of Nations, and strengthened ties with the European Union, India, and China. During an official visit to Washington, D.C. in 2003, leaders resolved to create a closer bilateral relationship, focusing on cooperation in science, nuclear energy, HIV/AIDS treatment in Mozambique and Angola, and alternative energy sources. Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Brazil in 2004. In October 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Brazil for discussions on trade, hunger, and security matters, including Brazil's role in the U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping force in Haiti. The U.S. and Brazil have been involved in talks regarding the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), with Brazil pushing for measures to reduce agricultural subsidies and trade duties, while the U.S. argues for resolving agricultural issues in the Doha round of WTO talks. The FTAA talks stalled in September 2003 in Cancun, Mexico, led by Brazil's G-20 group pushing for reduced agricultural subsidies. Talks were revived in early 2004, leading to an agreement on August 1, 2004, for substantial reductions in trade-distorting agricultural support programs and improved market access. Brazil and the United States had divergent positions in the November 2003 FTAA talks in Miami, with Brazil arguing for action on agricultural subsidies in the Doha round of WTO negotiations. Brazil argued for deferring sensitive issues to WTO negotiations in the FTAA talks, including investment, services, government procurement, and intellectual property rights. A flexible formula called \"FTAA light\" or \"FTAA ala carte\" was agreed upon by Brazil and the United States in a mini-ministerial meeting. The Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) meeting in Puebla, Mexico in February 2004 failed to agree on common obligations, leading to the suspension of the TNC. Negotiations for the FTAA and a free trade agreement between the EU and Mercosur faced challenges in 2004. The TNC was suspended due to disagreements, and the EU-Mercosur talks broke down over access to services and agricultural products. Cuba under Fidel Castro maintained a communist regime with a worsening human rights record. Cuba's human rights record has deteriorated significantly since 2003, with economic struggles since the cutoff of assistance from the former Soviet Union in 1989. Despite some improvements since 1994, the economy remains poor. US policy towards Cuba includes economic sanctions and support measures for the Cuban people, aiming to promote democracy and human rights on the island. Several schools of thought exist on how to promote democracy and respect for human rights in Cuba, including advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, lifting some U.S. sanctions, or normalizing U.S.-Cuban relations. The Bush Administration's 2004 restrictions on travel to Cuba sparked reactions, and Congress showed continued interest in Cuba with various legislative initiatives on sanctions and human rights in the 108th Congress. Despite some provisions in FY2005 appropriations measures that would have eased Cuba sanctions, they were not included in the final omnibus appropriations measure. The House-passed FY2005 appropriations bills included provisions to ease sanctions on Cuba travel, family travel, educational activities, and commercial sales of agricultural and medical products. The Senate committee versions also had provisions related to Cuba travel restrictions. The Administration threatened to veto these bills. The 108th Congress showed concern about Cuba's human rights situation by approving resolutions, but no action was taken on bills to ease or tighten sanctions. Some bills aimed to repeal or fix laws prohibiting trademark registration related to confiscated assets in Cuba. The 108th Congress showed concern about Cuba's human rights situation by approving resolutions, but no action was taken on bills to ease or tighten sanctions. H.R. 4225 / S. 2373 aimed to conform with a World Trade Organization ruling regarding Cuban assets. The U.S. Coast Guard interdicted Cubans at sea, returning most to Cuba or transferring those at risk to Guantanamo for asylum in a third country. Cubans who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy has been criticized for encouraging risky migration. President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) has expressed views on Cuban migrants. President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) took office in 2004 to help the Dominican Republic recover from an economic crisis caused by banking failures. He pushed for tax increases to restart an IMF loan, including a controversial tax on fructose-sweetened drinks. Negotiations are ongoing to pass a budget that complies with IMF targets and repeals the tax. In 2005, the Dominican Republic faces the challenge of repealing a tax to comply with IMF targets and maintain its place in the DR-CAFTA. President Gutierrez, who took office in 2003, shifted to economic reform policies to gain support from the US and IMF. Despite economic growth, his power is limited by legislative gridlock, protests, and corruption allegations. President Gutierrez's party, the Patriotic Society Party (PSP), won barely 5% of the vote in the regional and municipal elections held on October 17, 2004. Despite forming new alliances with mid-size parties, including that of exiled President Abdal\u00c3\u00a1 Bucaram, to stave off impeachment proceedings, allegations of corruption within his administration persist. Ecuador continues to cooperate with the U.S. counter-narcotics program and has mobilized its military and police forces to help control spillover effects from the conflict in Colombia. Ecuador and the United States have a significant trade and investment relationship, with ongoing negotiations for an Andean Free Trade Agreement. Ecuador, along with Colombia and Peru, negotiated an Andean Free Trade Agreement. In 2004, businessman Tony Saca won the Salvadoran presidential elections, taking office alongside the first Salvadoran woman vice president. The new administration faced a divided legislature, with the FMLN holding 31 of 84 seats. President Saca achieved early legislative victories, including passing the 2004 budget and anti-gang violence legislation. President Saca of El Salvador, elected in 2004, faced opposition from the FMLN but achieved early legislative victories such as passing the budget and anti-gang violence laws. Despite some disapproval for sending soldiers to Iraq, he has worked with the US on issues like narco-trafficking and free trade agreements. Guatemala has been transitioning towards representative government since the 1980s. Guatemala transitioned from autocratic rule to a democratic constitution in 1985. A 36-year civil war ended in 1996 with the signing of the Peace Accords, leading to political, economic, and social reforms. President Berger aims to fulfill the Peace Accords, focusing on ending impunity, reallocating funds to basic services, and promoting indigenous participation in decision-making. President Berger's administration prioritizes fulfilling the Peace Accords, combating corruption, and implementing economic reforms. This includes new tax rates, funding for peace-related programs, and passing the free-trade agreement with the United States. Guatemala was removed from the Financial Action Task Force's list of non-cooperative countries in 2004 for progress in anti-money laundering efforts. The Task Force praised Guatemala for progress in anti-money laundering legislation. The US has restricted military aid since 1990 due to human rights concerns. The Berger Administration seeks to lift the aid ban by reducing military size and proposing reforms. However, human rights groups highlight the need for further reforms, citing ongoing human rights abuses and corruption. Human rights groups express concern about ongoing abuses, corruption among military officials, and delays in forming the CICIACS to investigate clandestine groups. Some argue that U.S. military aid should not be lifted until reforms are carried out and reparations made to civilian victims of the armed conflict. Guatemala has made progress in human rights, but issues persist. The armed conflict has ended, state abuses have stopped, and civilian control over the military has improved. However, security forces still commit violations with impunity, and racism and inequality remain. Concerns have been raised by the U.N., OAS, and U.S. about increasing human rights violations and lack of action by the government. In 2004, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights opened an office in Guatemala, succeeding the U.N. Verification Mission. U.S. aid to Guatemala has decreased by more than a third in the past three years, with Congress criticizing the reduction in staffing and funding for FY2004. The FY2005 consolidated appropriations act (P.L.108-447) continues to limit IMET for Guatemala to expanded-IMET, military justice reform, and respect for human rights. FMF remains prohibited, but prior year \"Military Assistance Program\" funds can be used for non-lethal defense items under certain conditions. Military activities must align with the 1996 Peace Accords, and cooperation with civilian authorities is required for investigations into human rights violations. The FY2005 consolidated appropriations act (P.L.108-447) imposes conditions on military assistance funds for Guatemala, including the establishment of CICIACS, transparency in military budget process, collaboration with the U.N., and efforts to combat narcotics trafficking. It allocates $6 million in Economic Support Funds and $1 million in Andean Counternarcotics Initiative funds for Guatemala, with $22.5 million earmarked for Child Survival and Health, and Development Assistance. The bill also supports anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala and Nicaragua. The political conflict in Haiti escalated leading to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's departure in 2004. An interim government led by Prime Minister Gerard LaTortue took over amidst ongoing violent protests. Concerns of a civil war or Haiti becoming a \"criminal state\" arose. Aristide went into exile in South Africa, with some supporters claiming he was forced out by the United States. Former soldiers demanded the restoration of the disbanded Haitian army, seizing control of towns and assuming security responsibilities. The political conflict in Haiti escalated in 2004, leading to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's departure. Supporters of Aristide began violent protests demanding his return, resulting in at least 55 deaths. The Bush Administration condemned the violence and armed gangs destabilizing the interim government. The Haitian National Police are struggling to maintain order, while the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti is understaffed and finding it difficult to carry out its mission. The UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti, with 8,000 troops and civilian police, is struggling to establish law and order. Congressional concerns include strengthening democracy, U.S. assistance effectiveness, human rights protection, security improvement, narcotics trafficking, migration limits, and humanitarian needs. U.S. aid was redirected through NGOs during the Aristide administration. The Bush Administration launched an initiative in 2003 to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission from mothers to children in Haiti, one of 14 countries in the program. USAID reports thousands of Haitian children are born with the virus annually. Aid is provided to the interim LaTortue government, with considerations for lifting the arms embargo against Haiti.
