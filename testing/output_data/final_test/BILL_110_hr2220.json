Many young adults and college students experience symptoms of mental illness, with a significant percentage diagnosed with depression. Suicide is a major concern, being the second leading cause of death among college students. Youth with mental illness often face bullying and social alienation, which can worsen their conditions. In 2005, a national survey of Counseling Center Directors found a 14 percent increase in severe psychological problems among students from 2000 to 2005. Additionally, a 2003 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed that out of 7,700,000 college students in the US, 526,000 experienced violent crimes, with a significant percentage possibly having a diagnosable mental illness. Research shows that mental health services provided by trained professionals can effectively treat mental illness. Confidentiality is crucial in the doctor-patient relationship, but in cases of significant risk to a student or others, it may be necessary to disclose information to protect their well-being. Common symptoms of mental illness can impair judgment and limit a person's ability to make rational decisions about their care. Parents and legal guardians of students may also play a role in their treatment. (9) Parents and legal guardians are crucial in providing help to a student with mental illness by offering support, medical history, coordinating care, and long-term follow-up. (10) The Federal Government mandates parental involvement in evaluating and treating special needs children in school, emphasizing the ongoing importance of parental participation even after the student turns 18. (11) FERPA, originally focused on student record confidentiality, includes exceptions for safeguarding student well-being. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) allows for the release of student records in emergencies to protect the health or safety of the student or others. However, school personnel without mental health training struggle to determine if a student is at risk, leading to delays in informing families even when there are concerns about student safety. Laws should support parent-child communication for proper mental illness treatment when necessary. SEC. 3. Mental health disclosures for student safety.

The institution will not be held liable for disclosing education records in good faith. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act allows educational institutions to disclose information to parents or legal guardians of dependent students without liability. This subsection does not prohibit institutions from taking necessary actions to protect student safety."
