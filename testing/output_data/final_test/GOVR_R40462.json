    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) provides broad nondiscrimination protection for individuals with disabilities in various areas. However, the ADA does not specifically cover the Internet, and the issue of coverage remains unresolved due to lack of Supreme Court and congressional action. The ADA was amended in 2008 to address Supreme Court decisions on disability definition but not Internet coverage. In 2010, hearings and rulemaking were held for Internet accessibility for individuals with disabilities. President Obama signed the Equal Access to 21st Century Communications Act, requiring certain Internet access for individuals with disabilities. The ARRA also included provisions for Health Information Technology but did not specifically mention Internet accessibility. The HITECH Act was included in P.L. 111-5 and directed the FCC to develop a national broadband plan. The FCC's plan recommended ensuring digital content accessibility. Recommendations included clarifying ADA obligations for commercial websites, addressing video programming accessibility over the Internet, and clarifying FCC's authority on video description rules. The ADA contains requirements for employment, state and local governments, and public accommodations. Title I prohibits discrimination in job application procedures, hiring, advancement, compensation, training, and other employment terms. The term employer applies to those with 15 or more employees. Title I of the ADA prohibits employment discrimination for individuals with disabilities in companies with 15 or more employees. To determine if an individual is qualified, it must be assessed if they can perform essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Reasonable accommodation must be provided unless it causes undue hardship. The ADA prohibits employment discrimination for individuals with disabilities in companies with 15 or more employees. Reasonable accommodations must be provided unless it causes undue hardship, which is defined as significant difficulty or expense. Factors considered include the nature and cost of the accommodation, financial resources of the facility, and type of operation. Discrimination in \"other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment\" is also prohibited. The National Council on Disability (NCD) emphasizes the importance of considering reasonable accommodations for job functions involving electronic communication. While no judicial cases specifically mandate website accessibility in employment, EEOC policies on telework suggest that lack of Internet access could be considered employment discrimination under the ADA. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in public entities. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in public entities, ensuring accessibility to services, programs, and activities. The ADA does not apply to the federal executive branch, which is covered by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. DOJ regulations require program accessibility for public entities, with exceptions for historic preservation. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in public entities, ensuring accessibility to services, programs, and activities. Public entities are not required to make changes that would fundamentally alter their services or create undue financial burdens. Case law on ADA application to the Internet under Title II is limited, but a court case involving the Atlanta transit authority highlighted accessibility issues, including information accessibility on their website. The court found that the information was not equally accessible to individuals with disabilities, even though some information was available by telephone. The court found that MARTA's website was not accessible to blind individuals using text reader software, violating the ADA mandate for communication accessibility. Efforts were being made to correct this issue, with the Department of Justice proposing rules for Internet accessibility in 2010. Samuel R. Bagenstos testified on the importance of accessible websites during April 2010 hearings. The Department of Justice has confirmed that State and local government websites are covered by Title II of the ADA, with guidance available for making them accessible. OCR and ED investigations have addressed access to class materials and resulted in required access. Title III prohibits discrimination based on disability in public accommodations. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, including hotels, restaurants, theaters, and more. Religious institutions are exempt, and there are limitations on nondiscrimination requirements. Failure to remove architectural barriers is not a violation unless it is \"readily achievable.\" Reasonable modifications are required unless they fundamentally alter practices. The Department of Justice issued a notice in 2010 proposing Internet accessibility under the ADA for private entities that meet the definition of public accommodations. Title III applies to Internet sites and services, and guidance may be issued for private businesses. The DOJ is considering issuing guidance on Internet accessibility for private businesses that are public accommodations under Title III of the ADA. The department's position on this was first stated in response to a congressional inquiry, emphasizing the need for accessible means of communication. The House Judiciary Committee also supports the application of ADA's accessibility requirements to private Internet websites and services. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, with a debate on whether it applies to the Internet. Courts are divided on whether public accommodations are limited to physical structures. The First Circuit ruled that public accommodations are not limited to physical structures in Carparts Distribution Center v. Automotive Wholesalers Association of New England Inc. The First Circuit ruled that public accommodations under the ADA are not limited to physical structures, including travel services that conduct business by telephone or correspondence. Congress did not intend to exclude services obtained over the phone or by mail from ADA protection. The First Circuit and Seventh Circuit both agreed that public accommodations under the ADA are not limited to physical structures. They emphasized that the ADA prohibits discrimination in various facilities, including those in electronic space, and that disabled persons cannot be excluded from using these facilities. The ADA prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, including electronic spaces, and ensures equal access for disabled individuals. The courts have ruled that the ADA goes beyond physical access, requiring full and equal enjoyment of goods and services for the disabled. The Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits limit public accommodations to physical places. In Stoutenborough v. National Football League, Inc., the Sixth Circuit rejected a case involving individuals with hearing impairments suing the NFL over the blackout rule. The court held that Title III's prohibitions apply to physical places, not broadcasts. Similarly, in Parker v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., the Sixth Circuit ruled that the ADA's nondiscrimination prohibition does not prevent an employer from offering a disability plan to employees. The Sixth Circuit ruled that public accommodations are limited to physical places, not benefit plans offered by employers. The Third and Ninth Circuits also held that a public accommodation must be a physical place, not a benefit plan. This was demonstrated in cases such as Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp. and Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. The courts emphasized that Title III of the ADA refers to physical locations as public accommodations. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that the ADA does not apply to virtual spaces like websites, as they are not considered \"places of public accommodation.\" This decision was based on the ADA's statutory language, which lists concrete places as covered entities. The court avoided expanding the ADA to cover virtual spaces, stating that it would create new rights. The district court's decision in National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation denied Target's motion to dismiss allegations that its website's inaccessibility impeded equal enjoyment of goods and services in stores. The court noted that the ADA's purpose is broader than physical access and covers aspects of the website connected to the retailer's store. The court required a \"nexus\" between Internet services and physical places for an ADA claim. The nexus approach covers businesses like Target but may not apply to online-only stores like Amazon.com. The National Council on Disability criticizes this approach, stating that distinctions based on physical connections will become untenable as more activities move online. The nexus approach in determining ADA coverage for online services may lead to more confusion and havoc than a clear exclusion of websites. The recent case of Young v. Facebook, Inc. involved a plaintiff alleging discrimination based on their bipolar disorder. The federal district court affirmed that Facebook, despite its online presence, is not considered a place of public accommodation under the ADA. The plaintiff's argument that Facebook's physical headquarters and gift cards sold in retail stores create a nexus to physical spaces was rejected. The court concluded that Facebook's Internet services do not have a nexus to physical places of public accommodation, as it does not own, lease, or operate retail stores. The ADA's application to the Internet is uncertain due to lack of specific coverage in the law and regulations, limited court decisions, and split opinions among lower courts. The ADA's application to online retailers is uncertain as there is no clear connection between Internet services and physical places of public accommodation. The DOJ has issued a notice to require accessibility for individuals with disabilities but has not finalized a rule on this issue yet."
