Congress finds that several religious minorities have been targeted and persecuted in various countries, including Baha'i leaders in Iran, Ahmaddiya Muslims in Pakistan, Afghan Christian convert Said Musa, and Iraqi Christians who were victims of a deadly attack in Baghdad. Iraq's Christian population, once 1.5 million in 2003, has halved due to violence. In 2010, a Christian mother was sentenced to death in Pakistan, a Coptic church in Egypt was attacked, and a Pakistani minister opposing blasphemy laws was assassinated. The Department of State's 2010 International Religious Freedom Report highlighted religious persecution in Uzbekistan and the Middle East, with minorities facing fines and jail terms. The Special Envoy for Anti-Semitism noted Holocaust glorification in Middle East media. Recent popular revolutions in the Middle East have left security vacuums, making religious minorities vulnerable to violent attacks, such as the torching of the Shahedin Church in Egypt. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has recommended that certain countries be designated as Countries of Particular Concern due to religious persecution, including incidents of violence against religious minorities in Egypt and destruction of Sufi shrines in Egypt by Salafi organizations. Many ancient faith communities are being forced to flee their lands. The United States Government requires an individual to focus on the critical situation of religious minorities in rapidly developing regions, in accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.
