    "content": "The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" aims to establish a more uniform and transparent process for the construction and operation of energy infrastructure projects at the national boundary of the United States, including oil and natural gas pipelines and electric transmission facilities for import and export purposes with Canada and Mexico. The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" requires a certificate of crossing for the construction and operation of cross-border oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities to Canada or Mexico, within 120 days of final environmental approval. The \"North American Energy Infrastructure Act\" mandates a certificate of crossing for cross-border oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities to Canada or Mexico, with the Secretary of State overseeing oil pipelines and the Secretary of Energy overseeing electric transmission facilities. The Secretary of Energy has additional requirements for electric transmission facilities. The certificate of crossing for cross-border electric transmission facilities must adhere to applicable policies and standards of relevant organizations. Exclusions apply to oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities for import/export of oil or electricity to/from Canada or Mexico. Exclusions apply to oil pipelines and electric transmission facilities for import/export of oil or electricity to/from Canada or Mexico if certain conditions are met, including having a permit issued or pending application until July 1, 2016. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act does not affect the application of other federal statutes to projects seeking a certificate of crossing for cross-border segments. SEC. 4 amends the Natural Gas Act regarding importation or exportation of natural gas to Canada and Mexico, setting a deadline for approval of applications. SEC. 5 addresses the transmission of electric energy to Canada and Mexico. The repeal of the requirement to secure orders under Section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act is accompanied by conforming amendments to state regulations and seasonal diversity electricity exchange procedures. The proposed transmission facilities will not impact the electric supply or coordination of facilities under the Secretary's jurisdiction. No Presidential permit required for oil, gas pipelines, or electric transmission facilities under various Executive Orders. Modifications to existing projects allowed. No certificate or permit is needed for modifications to existing oil, gas pipelines, or electric transmission facilities operating for import/export to Canada or Mexico. Effective date and rulemaking deadlines are specified. SEC. 8 specifies the effective date of sections 3 through 7 as July 1, 2015, and sets rulemaking deadlines for officials to publish proposed and final rules within 180 days and 1 year of enactment. SEC. 9 provides definitions. In this Act, the term \"cross-border segment\" refers to the part of a pipeline or transmission facility at the US border with Canada or Mexico. The term \"modification\" includes changes like ownership, volume expansion, or adjustments for flow. \"Natural gas\" is defined as in the Natural Gas Act, and \"oil\" refers to petroleum products. The terms \"Electric Reliability Organization\" and \"regional entity\" have specific meanings under the Federal Power Act. The terms \"Independent System Operator\" and \"Regional Transmission Organization\" are defined in section 3 of the Federal Power Act."
