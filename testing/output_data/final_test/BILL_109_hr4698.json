    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Disaster Relief Volunteer Protection Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to disaster relief efforts. The Congress finds that it is in the national interest to encourage individuals to volunteer to assist victims of national disasters. Existing laws exposing potential volunteers, their employers, and those who would use volunteers' services to compensatory and punitive damages for negligent acts discourages the provision of these services. Potential liability for acts of volunteers also discourages employers or business partners from permitting volunteers to provide disaster relief services. The fear of liability for punitive damages discourages entities from using volunteer services in national disasters and deters potential volunteers from providing relief goods and services. Fear of compensatory and punitive damages also deters volunteers from outside the disaster area from offering their services. Fear of liability for punitive damages deters foreign volunteers from providing disaster relief services outside the national disaster area. Any reduction in liability for volunteers, employers, and entities should maintain incentives to avoid harm and encourage volunteerism. Unwillingness to provide services due to uncertain liability impacts interstate commerce and travel. Employers and business partners are also hesitant to allow their employees to volunteer in disaster situations. The fear of liability for punitive damages deters foreign volunteers from providing disaster relief services. Unwillingness to accept services due to uncertain liability impacts interstate commerce and travel. Congress needs to provide uniform standards to address disasters in any state to clarify laws governing disaster relief efforts. The fear of liability for punitive damages deters foreign volunteers from providing disaster relief services, impacting interstate commerce and travel. Congress needs to establish uniform standards for disaster relief efforts to clarify governing laws. SEC. 3. DISASTER RELIEF VOLUNTEERS. Liability of Disaster Relief Volunteers: Volunteers are not liable for injuries caused during disaster relief efforts unless the injury results from willful misconduct or operating a vehicle without the required license or insurance. Employers or partners of volunteers are also not liable for their actions. Volunteers providing disaster relief services are not liable for any acts or omissions, and entities enabling volunteers are also not liable for their actions. Nonprofit organizations are not liable for injuries caused during disaster relief efforts unless due to willful misconduct. Governmental or intergovernmental entities donating disaster relief goods are not liable for any injuries caused by the donated goods unless due to willful misconduct. Additionally, punitive and noneconomic damages are limited unless clear and convincing evidence of willful misconduct is provided. In civil actions for injury caused by disaster relief services or goods, punitive damages are not awarded for willful misconduct by volunteers or governmental entities. In civil actions for injury caused by disaster relief services or goods, punitive damages are not awarded for willful misconduct by volunteers or governmental entities. Liability for noneconomic loss is determined in proportion to the defendant's responsibility. In civil actions, liability for noneconomic loss is determined by the percentage of responsibility of each party involved. The court will issue separate judgments against each defendant based on this determination. This section does not affect the protections granted to volunteers under the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. The section does not confer a private right of action or limit liability protections for disaster relief volunteers or governmental entities. A Supplemental Declaration may be issued by the President, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Secretary of Homeland Security for a Disaster Declaration, with temporal effects determined by them for public interest. The Supplemental Declaration for a Disaster Declaration may include geographic or other conditions deemed necessary by the President or Secretary. Licensing requirements do not apply to disaster relief volunteers unless they lack the necessary credentials. The Disaster Declaration may require disaster relief volunteers to provide services in any State as determined by appropriate authorities, or as specified in a Disaster Declaration or Supplemental Declaration. Definitions for Disaster Declaration are provided for clarity.
