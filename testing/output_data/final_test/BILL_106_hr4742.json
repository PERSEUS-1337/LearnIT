    "content": "The \"Cell Phone Consumer Protection Act of 2000\" establishes standards for quality of commercial mobile service and monitoring of complaints. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include new regulations for commercial mobile services, ensuring minimum standards for quality and performance, including connection, reception, and billing practices. The Commission will establish a complaint system for subscribers to register issues with their service. The Cell Phone Consumer Protection Act of 2000 requires commercial mobile services to establish a toll-free number for reporting complaints about service quality or performance. The FCC will designate '#FCC' as the toll-free number and provide transition periods for areas where the number is already in use. The FCC will maintain records of complaints made under the system established by the Phone Consumer Protection Act of 2000. Providers of commercial mobile services must include a statement in each subscriber's bill informing them of the toll-free number to register complaints with the Commission. The FCC will report complaints received every 6 months to Congress, detailing the number of complaints for each commercial mobile service provider. The FCC will report complaints every 6 months to Congress, detailing types of complaints received, such as dead spots, dropped calls, network busy signals, and improper billing practices. The report will be made publicly available on the Commission's website. This does not exempt mobile service providers from complying with consumer protection laws. The FCC requires mobile service providers to comply with consumer protection laws, including Federal, State, and local regulations. States can enforce additional oversight as long as it doesn't hinder Federal enforcement. Non-compliance with FCC requirements won't result in penalties under title V. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE AND REGULATIONS. The amendment made by section 2 will take effect after a 6-month period from the enactment of this Act. The Commission will issue necessary regulations to implement the amendment, which will also take effect on the same date."
