    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that gifted and talented students, regardless of background, require specialized services to fully develop their capabilities. These students, who are often underrepresented, have advanced academic abilities and unique educational needs that must be met with appropriate opportunities and experiences. Gifted and talented students have unique educational needs that are not federally mandated, leading to disparities in resources and services. To compete globally, more students need to achieve higher levels of education, especially highly capable students. The performance of 12th-grade advanced students in the United States on international assessments was among the lowest globally in physics and advanced mathematics. Elementary school students with academic gifts often master a significant portion of the school year's content before it begins. In 1990, only a small fraction of education spending in the US went towards elementary and secondary education. The purpose of the Act is to provide grants to States for programs supporting gifted and talented students in elementary and secondary schools in the United States.
