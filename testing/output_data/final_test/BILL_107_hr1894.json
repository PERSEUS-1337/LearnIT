    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Farmers to Africa and the Caribbean Basin Act of 2001\". Many African and Caribbean Basin farmers use outdated techniques, leading to poor crop quality and low yields. They are losing business to farmers in Europe and Asia who use advanced methods. Training is needed for these farmers in modern farming techniques to increase crop yields and quality. Increased yields of nutritious crops are essential for African and Caribbean Basin farmers. American farmers can provide valuable agribusiness expertise. A comprehensive agricultural skills training program is needed to improve knowledge of insecticide use, sanitation procedures, and modern farming techniques. This includes standard growing practices and recordkeeping for continual crop production analysis. The training program aims to enhance crop production, utilize modern farming equipment, expand small farms into agribusinesses through village banking systems, and market crop yields. Involvement of African-American and American farmers can improve access to African and Caribbean markets for US farm products and equipment. Existing programs promoting exchange of agricultural knowledge between American and foreign farmers have been effective in improving techniques and food security. Additional resources for farmer-to-farmer exchanges are warranted. SEC. 3. FARMERS FOR AFRICA AND CARIBBEAN BASIN PROGRAM. In this section, the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. An \"agricultural farming specialist\" is defined as an individual trained to provide information and support on various agricultural aspects. An \"eligible farmer\" is someone who owns or works on farm land in specific regions like sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean Basin, or other developing countries. The Farmers for Africa and Caribbean Basin Program is established by the Secretary to assist eligible organizations in bilateral exchange programs where American farmers and agricultural specialists share technical expertise with developing countries. The term \"Caribbean basin country\" refers to countries eligible for designation under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. The Farmers for Africa and Caribbean Basin Program facilitates knowledge sharing between American farmers and agricultural specialists with eligible farmers in developing countries. This includes maximizing crop yields, using agricultural risk insurance, expanding trade in agricultural products, enhancing food security, and alleviating hunger. Eligible grantees include colleges, universities, private organizations, and corporations. The Farmers for Africa and Caribbean Basin Program aims to train 1,000 farmers by 2005, with a focus on African and Caribbean Basin countries. Training will be provided in groups to encourage knowledge sharing and specialization in farming communities. The program will also collaborate with American businesses to utilize their industrial capabilities. The Farmers for Africa and Caribbean Basin Program aims to utilize commercial industrial capabilities of businesses in agriculture to train eligible farmers on state-of-the-art equipment and introduce them to insurance as a risk management tool. Eligible participants will be selected by grant recipients through an approved application process. Participating farmers must meet educational requirements and productivity targets. The grant period is 5 years, starting from October 1 of the first fiscal year with funds available. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006 for the Farmers for Africa and Caribbean Basin Program."
