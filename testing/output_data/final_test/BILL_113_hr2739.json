The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 mandates the relocation of Federal Government stations in the electromagnetic spectrum for auctioning, prioritizing relocation over sharing to ensure cooperation and coordination between entities. The Department of Defense stations are subject to specific relocation procedures outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. If relocation is not feasible, stations must be identified based on operational impact assessments to avoid jeopardizing essential military operations. The entity must identify stations in the transition plan to share electromagnetic spectrum with non-Federal users to avoid jeopardizing essential military operations. The transition plan must be submitted 240 days before competitive bidding. The transition plan must identify stations for sharing electromagnetic spectrum with non-Federal users to avoid impacting essential military operations. The plan should include the smallest exclusion zones necessary for military capability and allow for shared Federal and non-Federal use of the spectrum. Upon relocation of a Federal Government station, the President will withdraw or modify the assignment of electromagnetic spectrum to ensure efficient use. The electromagnetic spectrum between 1755 to 1780 megahertz is designated for Federal and non-Federal use. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Communications Commission."
