    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Tire Efficiency, Safety, and Registration Act of 2015 or the TESR Act. It includes Tire Fuel Efficiency Minimum Performance Standards. Section 32304A of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include regulations for Tire Fuel Efficiency Minimum Performance Standards. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator, will promulgate these standards. The Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish regulations for tire fuel efficiency standards for passenger car tires with different speed capabilities. The standards will be based on the rolling resistance coefficient measured using specified test procedures. The Secretary will ensure that new pneumatic tires for passenger cars meet minimum performance standards without disproportionately affecting high-performance tires with speeds over 149 mph. This subsection does not apply to light truck tires. The Secretary will promulgate regulations for tire wet traction minimum performance standards, ensuring passenger tire wet traction capability is maintained while improving tire fuel efficiency. The standards will be based on peak coefficient of friction and will not apply to certain types of tires. The Secretary will conduct testing to benchmark wet traction performance of tire models available in the US to tailor minimum performance standards for new pneumatic tires for passenger use. The Secretary will ensure compatibility and consistency among regulations for new pneumatic tires for passenger cars, excluding certain tire types. Compliance with minimum performance standards will not be diminished. The Secretary will promulgate regulations for new pneumatic tires for passenger cars within 24 months of the Act's enactment, ensuring wet traction performance is not compromised. SEC. 3. TIRE REGISTRATION BY INDEPENDENT SELLERS. Section 30117(b) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to require distributors or dealers of tires not owned by a manufacturer to maintain records of tire purchasers and lessors, including tire information and any additional records deemed necessary by the Secretary. The amendment to Section 30117(b) of title 49, United States Code, requires tire distributors or dealers not owned by a manufacturer to electronically transmit records to the manufacturer or its designee securely and at no cost to purchasers or lessors. This regulation may fulfill the requirements of paragraph (2)(B). The Secretary of Transportation will establish a searchable tire recall database with Tire Identification Number (TIN) and other criteria for consumer use."
