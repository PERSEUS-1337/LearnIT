The Social Security Act is amended to include self-disclosure protocols for entities or individuals to voluntarily disclose compensation arrangements with inadvertent noncompliance with subsection (a)(1). This amendment allows for disclosures to be submitted either through the self-referral disclosure protocol or the alternative protocol for technical noncompliance. Entities or individuals can voluntarily disclose compensation arrangements with inadvertent noncompliance with subsection (a)(1) through the self-referral disclosure protocol or the alternative protocol for technical noncompliance. The alternative protocol allows for withdrawal of disclosures from the self-referral disclosure protocol within one year of its establishment. The Secretary will establish an alternative protocol for technical noncompliance (APTN) within one year of enactment. This protocol allows entities to disclose arrangements in inadvertent noncompliance with subsection (a)(1) and pay a civil monetary penalty to resolve overpayments. The APTN protocol, established by the Secretary within one year of enactment, allows entities to disclose inadvertent technical noncompliance with subsection (a)(1) and pay a civil monetary penalty to resolve overpayments. Disclosure requirements must be met as specified by the Secretary on the public Internet website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Medicaid Services require disclosure of compensation arrangements in technical noncompliance with subsection (a)(1), how the noncompliance was resolved, and if the remuneration was fair market value. The Medicaid Services require disclosure of compensation arrangements that are not determined based on referrals or business generated between parties. The entity must sign a settlement agreement provided by the Secretary and certify the truthfulness of the information provided. The Secretary will accept or reject a disclosure based on its completeness, accuracy, and timeliness. Upon receiving a disclosure, the Secretary will notify the disclosing party and may request additional information. Upon acceptance by the Secretary, the disclosing party will be notified in writing. The disclosure may be rejected if the disclosing party fails to provide additional information requested by the Secretary or if the noncompliance disclosed does not meet the specified requirements. The disclosure will be accepted if the Secretary issues a written notice or if it is complete, accurate, timely, and meets all requirements after 180 days. The Secretary may accept a disclosure within 180 days if it meets all requirements. The entity can withdraw the disclosure before acceptance or rejection. Civil monetary penalties may apply for technical noncompliance. The Secretary imposes civil monetary penalties of $5,000 or $10,000 for disclosed inadvertent technical noncompliance with subsection (a)(1), depending on the timing of disclosure. The Secretary imposes civil monetary penalties of $10,000 for disclosure of inadvertent technical noncompliance with subsection (a)(1) submitted after one year but not exceeding three years from the initial noncompliance date. In cases of disclosure submitted after the 5th year, the date is 2 years from the initial noncompliance with subsection (a)(1). Special rule for entities withdrawing a disclosure from the self-referral disclosure protocol. The APTN is separate from the advisory opinion process. The Secretary must publish APTN information on the internet within one year of enactment. The Secretary will post information on the CMS website to guide stakeholders on disclosing and paying civil penalties for technical noncompliance with subsection (a)(1). Technical noncompliance refers to unsigned compensation arrangements. The arrangement was a holdover arrangement for a period longer than permitted by regulations or the written documentation is insufficient to satisfy the writing requirement of an applicable exception. The term 'inadvertent' is defined. The term 'inadvertent' means that an entity in a compensation arrangement was unaware of noncompliance. Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, does not apply, and the Secretary can implement provisions through program instruction."
