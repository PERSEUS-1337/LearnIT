    "content": "International law consists of rules and principles dealing with the conduct of states and international organizations. The United States recognizes international legal commitments as binding both internationally and domestically. The U.S. assumes international obligations through treaties or executive agreements, with primary responsibility allocated to the executive branch and Congress also playing a role. The United States recognizes international legal commitments through treaties or executive agreements. The Senate must provide advice and consent for treaty ratification, while Congress may authorize executive agreements. Implementing legislation may be required for treaty provisions to be enforceable in U.S. courts. Customary international law's impact on the U.S. is ambiguous, with incorporation into domestic law only in the absence of conflicting treaties or laws. This report introduces the role of international law and agreements in the United States. In the United States, international agreements can be in the form of treaties, executive agreements, or nonlegal agreements. Treaties in U.S. law require Senate approval and Presidential ratification to enter into force. The Treaty Clause in the United States Constitution gives the President the power to make treaties with the \"advice and consent\" of the Senate. Early Presidents consulted with the Senate during treaty negotiations, but modern practice sees the executive branch taking the lead in treaty-making. The President assumes responsibility for treaty negotiations, with the Senate maintaining an \"advice\" function through conditional consent authority. The Senate can impose reservations, declarations, and understandings on treaties, which the President must accept for ratification. The Senate can also propose amendments to treaty texts, requiring consent from all parties involved. The Senate can impose reservations, declarations, and understandings on treaties, which must be accepted by the President for ratification. Some international law scholars criticize the use of reservations, understandings, and declarations (RUDs) by the Senate, debating their constitutionality and impact on treaty obligations. Despite academic debate, RUDs have not been extensively discussed in courts, with the Supreme Court acknowledging the Senate's authority to attach conditions to its advice and consent. The United States frequently interprets treaty obligations in light of Reservations, Understandings, and Declarations (RUDs) attached to the instrument of ratification. Executive agreements, not submitted to the Senate, are considered valid international compacts under Supreme Court jurisprudence. Executive agreements have been used more frequently since World War II, with over 90% of US international agreements taking this form. They can be categorized into congressional-executive agreements, treaty-based agreements, and sole executive agreements. The President's authority to enter into these agreements can come from existing statutes, prior Senate-approved treaties, or independent presidential power. The constitutionality of congressional-executive agreements is a topic of discussion. The constitutionality of congressional-executive agreements is well-established, with both houses of Congress involved in the authorizing process through a statute. These agreements cover a wide range of topics, such as postal conventions, trade, and military assistance. Examples include the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Agreements made pursuant to treaties are also constitutional, although there may be occasional controversy over whether a specific treaty authorizes the Executive to conclude a particular agreement. The President has the authority to enter into sole executive agreements without the need for treaty or congressional approval. These agreements are based on the President's foreign affairs power and can be legally permissible even if Congress disagrees, especially in areas where the President has exclusive constitutional authority. The President can enter into sole executive agreements without treaty or congressional approval based on foreign affairs power. Congressional opposition may impact the legitimacy of the agreement if the President's authority is unclear. Examples include the Litvinov Assignment and the 1973 Vietnam Peace Agreement. Some scholars argue that modern executive agreements may not fit traditional categories, as they may lack a specific source of presidential authority. Advocates believe that as long as the President has the domestic authority and the agreement doesn't require changes to domestic law, identification of a specific authorizing statute is unnecessary. Opponents argue against this new paradigm of executive agreements. Opponents of the proposed new paradigm of executive agreements argue that it may not align with separation of powers principles, which typically require the President's international agreements to be authorized by the Constitution, a ratified treaty, or an act of Congress. The future prevalence of executive agreements with mixed sources of authority may hinge on executive practice and congressional reactions. There is ongoing scholarly debate over whether certain international agreements must be treated as treaties requiring Senate approval, or if congressional-executive agreements can be a constitutionally valid alternative. A key legal issue in this debate is whether the federal government, acting under a treaty, can regulate matters beyond the scope of a statute passed by Congress. The adjudication of congressional-executive agreements is rare due to standing issues. Certain international agreements are traditionally treated as treaties, including those related to defense, extradition, human rights, and taxation. State Department regulations outline the process for approval of international agreements. The criteria for determining the form of an international agreement include Congressional preference, Circular 175 procedure emphasizing care to avoid compromising constitutional powers, and Senate advice sought by the President. State Department modified the procedure to include consultation with congressional leaders on significant agreements. The United States may make nonbinding political commitments with foreign states, known as \"soft law\" pacts, which do not change legal obligations but hold moral and political weight. These agreements can serve as temporary measures or have lasting impacts on relationships, and the executive branch can enter into them without congressional approval. The executive branch of the United States can enter nonbinding political commitments with foreign states, known as \"soft law\" pacts, without congressional approval. These agreements, such as the 1975 Helsinki Accords, hold moral and political weight but do not change legal obligations. The State Department regulations presume international agreements to be legally binding unless there is clear evidence indicating otherwise. The Executive's authority to enter nonbinding political commitments with foreign states has been a subject of dispute between Congress and the Executive. In 1969, the Senate passed the National Commitments Resolution, defining a \"national commitment\" as requiring affirmative action by both branches of government through a treaty or legislative enactment specifically providing for such commitment. The National Commitments Resolution in 1969 defined a \"national commitment\" as the use of armed forces on foreign territory or a promise to assist a foreign country. This resolution, in the form of a Senate resolution, had no legal effect. Unlike legally binding international agreements, there is no statutory requirement for the executive branch to notify Congress of nonlegal agreements entered on behalf of the United States. State Department regulations do not provide clear guidance on consulting Congress when entering nonlegal arrangements. Congress is consulted when deciding on nonlegal arrangements instead of treaties or executive agreements. Congress oversees these arrangements through appropriations or other laws, limiting US actions. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 required congressional notification and review of the Iran nuclear deal. Iran agreed to restrictions on nuclear weapons production under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The JCPOA involved Iran pledging to refrain from certain nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief from the P5+1. Despite being nonbinding, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act allowed Congress to review the agreement before sanctions could be lifted. The impact of international agreements on U.S. domestic law depends on whether they are self-executing or non-self-executing. Some international agreements are considered \"self-executing,\" having the force of domestic law without congressional action. Non-self-executing provisions require implementing legislation for enforcement. The Supreme Court determines non-self-executing provisions based on intent or Senate conditions. Many courts and commentators agree that provisions in international agreements requiring the US to exercise authority assigned to Congress must be non-self-executing, needing implementing legislation for domestic legal effect. Lower courts have ruled that treaty provisions needing funds, creating criminal liability, or raising revenue must be non-self-executing. Until implementing legislation is passed, existing domestic law remains unchanged in the US. The status of non-self-executing provisions in international agreements in the United States is a topic of significant scholarly debate. While some argue that litigants can invoke non-self-executing provisions defensively in criminal proceedings, others contend that these provisions do not create any judicially enforceable rights in domestic law. The precise status of non-self-executing treaties in domestic law remains unresolved. In the international context, treaties and international agreements create rights and obligations between sovereign nations. The self-execution doctrine concerns how treaty provisions are implemented in U.S. domestic law, but does not affect the U.S.'s obligation to comply with the provision under international law. The U.S. acquires obligations under international law regardless of self-execution when a treaty is ratified or an executive agreement concluded. When an international agreement requires implementing legislation or appropriation of funds to carry out the United States' obligations, Congress is tasked with providing that legislation. The unresolved debate over whether Congress is obligated to enact legislation implementing non-self-executing provisions into domestic law continues, as it has not been addressed in a judicial opinion. In contrast, the Supreme Court has addressed Congress's power to enact legislation implementing non-self-executing treaty provisions in the 1920 case Missouri v. Holland. The Holland Court concluded that the treaty power can be used to regulate matters that the Tenth Amendment might reserve to the states, and Congress has the power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact legislation implementing the treaty into domestic law. The Holland Court upheld Congress's power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to implement treaties into domestic law, despite some questioning Justice Holmes's reasoning. The Tenth Amendment's federalism principles still impact challenges to U.S. treaties, as seen in the 2014 case Bond v. United States involving a criminal prosecution related to toxic chemicals spread on a mailbox. In Bond v. United States, criminal charges were brought under the Chemical Weapons Convention Act of 1998 despite the accused only suffering a minor thumb burn. The accused argued that the Tenth Amendment reserved the power to prosecute her crime to the states, but the Court ruled in her favor based on principles of statutory interpretation and federalism. The Bond Court concluded that the Chemical Weapons Convention Act did not apply to the jilted spouse's actions, citing principles of federalism and the Tenth Amendment. Treaties or executive agreements may conflict with U.S. state law, federal law, or the Constitution, with self-executing treaties being equal to federal law and superior to state law, but inferior to the Constitution. In cases of conflicting federal law, sole executive agreements may be inferior, while treaties and certain executive agreements equivalent to federal law follow the \"last-in-time\" rule. Non-self-executing treaties and executive agreements generally do not displace existing state or federal law without implementing legislation. Congress is responsible for transforming international obligations from non-self-executing treaties into domestic law. When analyzing international agreements for domestic application, U.S. courts have final authority to interpret the agreement's meaning. The Supreme Court aims to discern the intent of the nations involved by examining the text, context, and foreign language versions of the agreement. The Court also considers the broader \"object and purpose\" of the agreement. The Supreme Court has final authority to interpret international agreements for domestic application, considering the text, context, and purpose. Extratextual materials may be examined, but only if the text is ambiguous. The executive branch often interprets agreements outside of domestic litigation. Some interpretation questions may involve presidential discretion or be deemed political questions. In Charlton v. Kelly, the Court declined to decide if Italy violated its extradition treaty with the United States. The Court did not rule on whether Italy breached its extradition treaty with the US, as the President waived the right to respond to any violation by voiding the treaty. The executive branch's interpretation of agreements is often given weight, although not always followed by the Court. Congress also has the power to interpret international agreements through legislation. The Supreme Court has the final authority to interpret international agreements for domestic application. The Supreme Court examines sources reflecting the Senate and President's understanding of treaties at ratification. The Senate can influence treaty interpretation through advice and consent but post-ratification resolutions have no legal significance. The Constitution outlines treaty-making procedures but is silent on termination. The Court recognizes the President's power to conclude executive agreements. The President's power to terminate executive agreements has not been addressed by the Supreme Court. It is generally accepted that the President can independently terminate executive agreements without congressional approval. This principle also applies to political commitments made by the President. The President can unilaterally withdraw from commitments without Senate or Congress approval. The mode of termination for agreements may be dictated by treaties or statutes. Congress can also direct the President to terminate agreements, as seen in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. In the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, Congress instructed the Secretary of State to terminate an air services agreement with South Africa. There is a debate over the President's authority to unilaterally withdraw from congressional-executive agreements. The President may have the power to unilaterally withdraw from congressional-executive agreements, but some argue that Congress must approve termination for agreements involving exclusive congressional powers. This debate is ongoing, with limited litigation on the President's ability to terminate such agreements. Unlike executive agreements, terminating Senate-approved treaties has stricter constitutional requirements. The termination of Senate-approved, ratified treaties has sparked debate between the legislative and executive branches. Some argue that treaties should be terminated through a process involving the legislative branch, similar to how they are ratified. However, treaties differ from federal statutes in that they require Senate approval and cannot be rescinded by Congress alone. Some argue that the President may unilaterally terminate treaties with Senate's advice and consent, citing a historical instance in 1798 when Congress passed legislation to terminate U.S. treaties with France. This event is viewed as an anomaly, as treaties typically require an \"act of the legislature\" to be terminated. During the 19th century, the power to terminate treaties was shared between the legislative and executive branches. Congress often authorized the President to provide notice of treaty termination to foreign governments, with Presidents regularly complying with the legislative branch's direction. On rare occasions, the Senate alone passed resolutions authorizing treaty termination. During the 20th century, unilateral presidential termination of treaties became the norm, with occasional legislative authorization. Opposition from Congress was rare, but there were instances of Members seeking to block presidential action. In 1978, Members of Congress filed suit in Goldwater v. Carter to prevent President Carter from terminating a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan as part of recognizing mainland China. The Supreme Court dismissed the case without reaching the constitutional question, citing a lack of clear guidance in the Constitution and the political question doctrine. Justice Rehnquist's opinion in this case has influenced federal district courts to use the political question doctrine to dismiss similar cases. Customary international law is defined as a general and consistent practice of States followed from a sense of legal obligation. Nations must believe themselves legally bound (opinio juris) for a practice to constitute customary international law. Nations can avoid this law if they are persistent objectors or exempt themselves under American law. Under American law, the United States can exempt itself from customary international law requirements by passing a contradictory statute under the \"last-in-time\" rule. The impact of customary international law conflicting with domestic law appears limited. Courts may consider various sources to determine opinio juris, including treaties, UN declarations, and noncompliance with universal rules. Uncertainties arise in defining customary international law and establishing binding norms. Some rules can become jus cogens norms, which are peremptory and allow no exemptions. The United States can exempt itself from customary international law by passing contradictory statutes under the \"last-in-time\" rule. The relationship between customary international law and domestic law has become complicated in the twentieth century. The Supreme Court rejected the idea of a \"transcendental body of law\" in a landmark 1938 decision. Erie held that courts must rely on state or federal statutes for law, not a \"transcendental body of law.\" Some argue this excludes customary international law in U.S. courts, but others disagree. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed this issue. The status of customary international law in the U.S. legal system is debated, with some uncertainty on its role when not conflicting with federal statutes. Lower courts have consistently ruled in favor of federal statutes over customary international law in cases of conflict. There have been no instances of a federal statute being struck down for violating customary international law. The Supreme Court's pre-Erie jurisprudence suggests that federal statutes generally prevail over customary international law. Customary international law can influence how courts interpret domestic law under the Charming Betsy canon. Customary international law influences U.S. legal system through federal law incorporation, such as the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) granting federal court jurisdiction over tort claims. Federal statutes generally prevail over customary international law, but courts may interpret statutes to align with international law to avoid violations. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was established as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, granting federal court jurisdiction over tort claims by aliens for violations of treaties or the law of nations. In Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pena-Irala, the ATS was used to award a civil judgment against a Paraguayan police official for torture, setting a precedent for human rights claims in U.S. federal courts. Despite initial prominence, the expansion of ATS claims was short-lived. The ATS's expansion was limited by Supreme Court decisions like Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain and Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., which set boundaries on the statute's application. Sosa required claims to be based on international norms accepted by the civilized world, while Kiobel restricted suits involving foreign plaintiffs and defendants for conduct outside the U.S. The Supreme Court has narrowed the jurisdiction of the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) in recent decisions like Sosa, Kiobel, and Jesner, limiting its application to foreign corporations. This has raised questions about the continued relevance of the ATS, despite its incorporation of customary international law. The relationship between international law and the U.S. legal system is complex, with settled rules recognizing the Constitution's allowance for binding international commitments through treaties and executive agreements. The status of international law in the U.S. legal system is complex and unresolved. The scope of presidential power to make executive agreements, the role of non-self-executing agreements, and the division of power to withdraw from international agreements are ongoing debates. Congress plays a critical role in shaping the United States' international obligations."
