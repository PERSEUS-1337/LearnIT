    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the main federal aid source for elementary and secondary education, last reauthorized by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015. Title I-A program, funded at $15.5 billion for FY2017, assists educationally disadvantaged children with supplementary services in schools with high numbers of low-income students. Title I-A grants also come with requirements affecting various aspects of public education. The U.S. Department of Education determines Title I-A grants to local educational agencies based on four funding formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants. The Basic Grant formula is the primary vehicle for providing Title I-A funds, allocating the largest share of funds and reaching the largest proportion of LEAs. The Concentration Grant, Targeted Grant, and EFIG formulas in Title I-A provide additional funds to areas with high numbers or percentages of children from low-income families. Title I-A grants have become more targeted on areas with concentrations of poverty. Grant amounts are driven by the number of children from low-income families in an LEA, with changes to child counts having the largest effect on grant amounts. This report analyzes debates surrounding the Title I-A formulas. The report discusses debates on the Title I-A formulas, focusing on factors affecting grant amounts, favoritism towards certain LEAs and states, and the effectiveness of targeting funds on poverty concentrations. It complements a previous report on the history of the formulas and does not delve into operational details. For allocation specifics, refer to another CRS report. The report provides an overview of the history and design of the Title I-A formulas used to determine grant amounts, analyzes allocation patterns, discusses fund targeting, and includes appendices with additional data. Since FY1980, Title I-A funds have aimed to serve poor children in public and private schools through various formulas. The original Basic Grant formula considered low-income children and state per pupil expenditures. Additional formulas like Concentration Grants were later added to provide extra funding for areas with high poverty concentrations. During ESEA reauthorization in the early 1990s, new formulas (Targeted Grants and EFIG) were proposed to better target concentrations of poverty by providing more funding per child to LEAs with higher numbers or percentages of formula children. These formulas, along with Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas, are currently used to allocate funds. Periodically, a Special Incentive Grant formula incentivized state and local education spending on elementary and secondary education, last funded in FY1975. Figure 1 displays the years when the four formulas were authorized and funded, showing ESEA reauthorizations that made significant changes to them. Since FY1966, formulas under the program have been funded annually, even after authorization expiration. Changes in population and expenditure factors have significant implications for state and LEA grant amounts. Congress has adjusted formulas to target Title I-A dollars to areas with high poverty concentrations and provide additional funding to smaller states. Congress has adjusted Title I-A formulas to target funding to areas with high poverty concentrations and provide additional funding to smaller states through state minimum grant provisions. Modifications include hold harmless provisions to prevent LEAs from losing significant funding from year-to-year. Formula child counts and expenditure factors are key in determining allocation levels, with equity and effort factors also playing a role in one of the allocation formulas. The EFIG formula for Title I-A allocation includes estimated child counts, expenditure factors based on state APPE, effort factor, and equity factor. Funds are calculated at the LEA level under Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, and Targeted Grants, then adjusted for state minimum grant provisions. State grants are the total of LEA allocations, while EFIG calculates grants for each state and suballocates to LEAs using a different formula. The primary focus is on the design elements in Title I-A allocation formulas, specifically state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions. These elements play a significant role in determining grant amounts for states and LEAs. Grant awards are calculated based on child counts and expenditure factors, then adjusted to match available appropriations. LEAs must meet certain thresholds to be eligible for grants under specific formulas. The curr_chunk discusses the role of separate formula factors in determining Title I-A grant amounts, including the LEA hold harmless and state minimum grant provisions. CRS analyses suggest that grant amounts are primarily driven by formula child counts. Regression analyses in Appendix D are used to estimate the effects of formula factors on grant calculations. The curr_chunk discusses how formula child counts primarily drive Title I-A grant amounts, with a high percentage of variance explained by this factor compared to others like APPE. This is supported by regression analyses in Appendix D. The relationship between formula factors and Title I-A grant amounts is examined in Figure 2. LEAs with higher formula child counts generally receive higher grant amounts, but grant amounts can vary significantly even with the same expenditure, equity, and effort factors. The primary driver of Title I-A grant amounts is formula child counts, which can vary significantly between LEAs. In contrast, expenditure, equity, and effort factors are calculated at the state level and are the same for all LEAs in a state, with bounded limits on their variation. The formula child counts range from no formula children to over 350,000, while expenditure factors range from $3,600 to $5,400, equity factors range from 1.0 to 1.3, and effort factors range from 0.95 to 1.05. Formula child counts are the dominant factor in grant determinations, impacting funding for states and LEAs with large numbers of formula children. The equity and effort factors only affect grant amounts under the EFIG formula. Under current Title I-A formulas, changes in formula child counts have a larger impact on grant amounts than changes in state and local spending. Any adjustment to formula factors will cause a shift in grant allocations, with the size of the shift depending on the extent of the changes. Design elements of the formulas, such as state minimum grant provisions and LEA hold harmless provisions, also influence grant allocations significantly. State minimum grant provisions aim to support small states in operating robust Title I-A programs by redistributing funding from all recipients. State minimum grant provisions and LEA hold harmless provisions redistribute funding to support smaller states and provide stability in grant amounts. These provisions mitigate losses from changes in Title I-A formulas, increasing overall grant amounts while causing only a small decrease in funding for some recipients. The state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions redistribute funding to support smaller states and provide stability in grant amounts. Approximately 1 in 10 LEAs benefit from the state minimum grant provisions, but removing them would only shift less than 1% of Title I-A funds. An estimated 11% of LEAs are in states that receive a minimum grant, with 1,281 of these LEAs seeing a decrease if the provisions were removed. Removing the state minimum grant provisions would result in an estimated $64.7 million decrease in funds for 1,281 LEAs, with an average decrease of $51,000 or 15.03%. Individual LEAs could lose anywhere from $10 to $4.3 million, and the average grant per formula child would decrease by about $210. While 11% of LEAs benefit from these provisions, less than 3% of all formula children reside within them. If the hold harmless provisions were removed, an estimated 64% of LEAs would see a decrease in their Title I-A grant amounts, with losses ranging from less than $10 to $19.1 million per LEA. The average grant per formula child is estimated to decrease by about $60, resulting in a total decrease of $283.8 million for these LEAs, which is 1.92% of overall Title I-A funds. While a large percentage of LEAs benefit from the hold harmless provisions, they have a relatively small effect on overall grant amounts. If both the state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions were removed, 5,000 out of 8,749 LEAs would see a decrease in grant amounts, with an average decrease of $73,000 per LEA. The total decrease in funds for these LEAs would be an estimated $366.7 million, indicating a substantial impact on locales losing funds without these provisions. Removing the state minimum grant provision and LEA hold harmless provisions can significantly impact grant allocations, particularly affecting grants per formula child. LEAs in states with minimum grant amounts receive an average of $450 more per formula child compared to all LEAs, while LEAs with hold harmless provisions (but not in states with minimum grants) receive $30 less per formula child. LEAs in states with both provisions receive $10 less per formula child on average. Removing the state minimum grant provision and LEA hold harmless provisions would impact grant allocations, particularly affecting grants per formula child. LEAs in states with minimum grant amounts receive $450 more per formula child compared to all LEAs, while LEAs with hold harmless provisions receive $30 less per formula child. If both provisions were removed, estimated average grants per formula child in LEAs currently benefiting from them would be reduced by $60 to $1,210. The average grants per formula child in LEAs receiving state minimum grants or hold harmless provisions are estimated to decrease by $70 to $1,220. Wyoming, for example, would see a decrease from $2,650 to $2,030 if minimum grant provisions were removed, and to $1,410 if both minimum grant and hold harmless provisions were removed. The impact of hold harmless provisions depends on Title I-A appropriations levels. The report examines Title I-A allocation patterns to LEAs and states, addressing concerns about formulas favoring densely populated areas and wealthier states. Changes have been made to formula child counts and expenditure factors over time to address these issues. The debate continues on whether the formulas are more favorable to densely populated or less densely populated areas. Changes to the count of children in families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in the 1970s were made in response to the debate on whether formulas favor densely populated or less densely populated areas. Initially, AFDC children were fully counted in formula child counts in 1965, but in the 1970s, only two-thirds of eligible AFDC children were included. This change was later reversed to include the full count of eligible AFDC children. Additionally, there is a debate on the emphasis placed on the percentage versus the count of formula children in an LEA. The debate on the percentage versus the count of formula children in an LEA continues under current law, specifically in the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. These formulas have two weighting scales based on formula child rates and counts, which have remained unchanged since FY2002. The weights are applied in a stepwise manner to formula children in an LEA. The Targeted Grant formula for LEAs applies five sets of weights based on formula child counts and rates. These weights are used to calculate two weighted formula child counts, with the larger count determining grant amounts. For example, if an LEA has 2,000 formula children out of a total school-age population of 10,000, with a formula child rate of 20%, the weighted child count would be calculated to determine grant amounts. The Targeted Grant formula for LEAs uses weights based on formula child counts and rates to calculate two weighted formula child counts. In this example, the weighted child count is calculated under number weighting and percentage weighting. The total weighted formula child count is determined by combining the counts from both steps. The Targeted Grant formula for LEAs uses weights based on formula child counts and rates to calculate two weighted formula child counts. The weighted child count is determined by combining the counts from both steps, with higher weights applied to LEAs with the highest formula child rates. This weighting process may seem to favor less densely populated LEAs, but can actually be more beneficial to heavily populated LEAs. The Targeted Grant formula for LEAs uses weights based on formula child counts and rates to calculate two weighted formula child counts. The weighting process may seem to favor less densely populated LEAs, but can actually be more beneficial to heavily populated LEAs. The weights result in higher grants per formula child to LEAs with high numbers of formula children, high percentages of formula children, or both. LEAs with high numbers of formula children generally receive more per formula child than LEAs with high percentages of such children. The effect of the weighting scales on grants per formula child is illustrated in Table 3. Table 3 illustrates the estimated FY2016 Title I-A grants per formula child, showing that the majority of LEAs had their Targeted Grant and EFIG amounts determined based on the percentage weighting scale. LEAs using the numbers weighting scale had a higher grant per formula child compared to those using the percentage scale, with an average grant of $1,340 in FY2016. In FY2016, Title I-A grants per formula child averaged $1,340 for LEAs using the percentage weighting scale and $1,220 for those using the numbers weighting scale. The inclusion of an expenditure factor in the formula was debated, with proponents arguing for compensation for higher education costs and opponents claiming it favored wealthy states. The debate also centered on whether funds should be spread broadly or concentrated in areas of greatest need. In the late 1960s, Congress added a minimum to the expenditure factor in the Title I-A program, which allowed low-spending states to use national average per-pupil expenditure (APPE) to determine their expenditure factor. In the mid-1970s, an upper bound was placed on the expenditure factor, limiting high-spending states' grant determinations and adjusting the minimum expenditure factor. State APPE was capped at 80% to 120% of the national APPE. The APPE for states was adjusted based on national averages, with a minimum and maximum cap set at 80% and 120% of the national APPE. Congress introduced new formulas in 1994 to target Title I-A funds more effectively, including the EFIG formula which initially did not include the same expenditure factor as other formulas. The EFIG formula introduced two new factors for state education spending: an effort factor based on spending relative to personal income and an equity factor based on variation among LEAs. These factors aim to address disparities in funding and resources among states and incentivize reducing those disparities. The EFIG formula was enacted alongside the Targeted Grant formula, which included the same expenditure factor as Basic Grants and Concentration Grants. The EFIG formula was modified to include an expenditure factor similar to other formulas, benefiting higher-spending states more. However, changes over time have helped lower-spending states, with adjustments to the expenditure factor providing a boost to their funding. The EFIG formula was adjusted to benefit higher-spending states more, but changes over time have also helped lower-spending states by adjusting the expenditure factor for grant determinations and capping spending amounts for higher-spending states. The EFIG formula was adjusted to benefit higher-spending states more, but changes over time have also helped lower-spending states by adjusting the expenditure factor for grant determinations and capping spending amounts for higher-spending states. The grant per formula child varies based on state APPE levels, with lower-spending states like Utah and Arizona receiving the lowest grants, states close to the national average like Iowa and Washington seeing fluctuations based on expenditure factor bounds, and higher-spending states like Connecticut and New York receiving the lowest grants when expenditure factors have both upper and lower bounds. The current law expenditure factors, with both upper and lower bounds, have historically favored states with lower state APPE over those with higher state APPE. Any change allowing the expenditure factor to vary solely with state APPE would benefit states with higher APPEs and disadvantage those with lower APPEs. The Title I-A program aims to address the impact of low-income family concentrations on local education. The impact of low-income family concentrations on local educational agencies' ability to support adequate programs, particularly in targeting Title I-A funds effectively. There is a debate on whether larger grants should be given to LEAs with high numbers or percentages of formula children. This debate has evolved over decades through the addition of three formulas to the original Basic Grant formula. The Education Amendments of 1978 added Concentration Grants to Title I-A, providing extra funding to areas with high concentrations of low-income families. In 1994, two more formulas were added to target funds more effectively on areas with poverty concentrations. The Education Amendments of 1978 added Concentration Grants to Title I-A to provide extra funding to areas with high concentrations of low-income families. In 1994, the Senate Committee proposed a new formula (EFIG) to target funding more effectively on concentrations of poverty, alongside the existing Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas. This addition of Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG has improved the targeting of Title I-A funds on poverty concentrations. The addition of Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG formulas has improved the targeting of Title I-A funds on poverty concentrations. The allocation of FY2016 Title I-A funds via different formulas affects the distribution of funding to LEAs based on formula child rates. The distribution of FY2016 Title I-A funds through the Basic Grant formula shows that funds are targeted towards LEAs with higher formula child rates. LEAs in the 4th and 5th ranges receive the largest share of funds, while those in the 1st and 2nd ranges receive the smallest share. When combined with Concentration Grants, the targeting of funds is further improved, with LEAs in the 4th and 5th ranges receiving 43.00% of funds and those in the 1st and 2nd ranges receiving 38.00% of funds. The distribution of FY2016 Title I-A funds shows that funds are targeted towards LEAs with higher formula child rates. LEAs in the 4th and 5th ranges receive the largest share of funds, while those in the 1st and 2nd ranges receive the smallest share. The addition of Concentration Grants slightly improves targeting, with LEAs in the 4th and 5th ranges receiving 43.00% of funds. LEAs in the 3rd range receive a smaller share compared to those in the 2nd range. Overall, LEAs with the lowest formula child rates (1st and 2nd ranges) received 35.92% of Title I-A funds. LEAs with the lowest formula child rates received 35.92% of Title I-A funds, while those with the highest rates received 45.26%. The four formula strategy targets funds more effectively to areas with concentrations of formula children, utilizing weighting scales in the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas. In FY2016, Title I-A funds were distributed to LEAs based on different formulas. The Basic Grant formula showed little targeting of funds to areas with higher poverty rates, with the lowest and highest formula child rate ranges receiving similar percentages of funds. In contrast, Concentration Grants showed some targeting to areas with concentrations of poverty, with lower formula child rate ranges receiving a smaller share of funds. In FY2016, Title I-A funds were distributed to LEAs based on different formulas. The distribution of funds varied among the different ranges, with higher formula child rates receiving a larger share of funds. Concentration Grants showed some targeting to areas with concentrations of poverty, while Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas also allocated funds based on formula child rates. The distribution of Title I-A funds varied among different ranges, with higher formula child rates receiving a larger share. Targeted Grants and EFIG were more effective at targeting funds to areas with concentrations of poverty. The addition of Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG improved the targeting of funds to LEAs with higher formula child rates. The addition of State minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions to Title I-A improved the targeting of funds to LEAs with higher formula child rates. The share of funds allocated through Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas has increased since FY2002, enhancing the overall targeting of Title I-A funds. The inclusion of state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions in Title I-A may disrupt the targeting of funds on LEAs with higher concentrations of poverty by reducing grant amounts to certain districts. These provisions, added in the 1978 amendments, aim to protect funding for rural districts but may also serve other purposes valued by Congress. State minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions in Title I-A may serve other purposes valued by Congress, including providing small states with a larger grant and stability in grant amounts. These provisions have been used to gain support for changes to the Title I-A formulas by mitigating any losses. Figure 7 illustrates the targeting of estimated FY2016 Title I-A funds to LEAs under different funding scenarios, showing the share of funds provided to each range. If state minimum grant provisions were not applied, the targeting of Title I-A funds would slightly increase. LEAs with the lowest formula child rates would receive a slightly smaller share of funds, while LEAs with the highest formula child rates would receive a slightly larger share. The removal of state minimum grant provisions would have minimal impact on fund targeting. Conversely, if LEA hold harmless provisions were removed, fund targeting would decrease. If LEA hold harmless provisions were removed, the targeting of Title I-A funds would decrease. LEAs with lower formula child rates would receive a larger share of funds, while those with higher rates would receive a smaller share. The impact of removing hold harmless provisions on fund targeting is relatively small. Removing both state minimum grant and LEA hold harmless provisions does not improve the targeting of Title I-A funds on areas with concentrations of poverty. The impact of removing these provisions on fund targeting is relatively small. Appendix A. Estimated Title I-A Grants Table A-1 displays the estimated FY2016 Title I-A grants to states and state grants per child under different funding scenarios, including current law, no state minimum grant provisions, no LEA hold harmless provisions, and no state minimum grant or LEA hold harmless provisions. The formula child population used for grant determination includes children ages 5 to 17 living in poor families, institutions for neglected or delinquent children, foster homes, and families receiving TANF payments above the poverty income level. Children in poor families make up about 98% of the population. Table A-2 and Table A-3 show the 10 LEAs estimated to see the largest losses and gains, respectively, assuming no hold harmless provisions are applied. Table A-4 and Table A-5 show the 10 LEAs estimated to see the largest losses and gains, assuming no minimum grant provisions are applied. Table A-6 displays the estimated FY2016 Title I-A grants to states under different expenditure factors. Table A-7 displays the estimated FY2016 Title I-A grants to states and state grants per formula child under current law, calculated by ED and CRS. The Title I-A grant per formula child was determined by dividing the total grant amount by the formula child population. The estimated Title I-A grant amounts are calculated based on the child population formula. These estimates are for comparison purposes only and do not predict specific grant amounts for states or LEAs. Changes in provisions can impact grant amounts, especially at the LEA level. The analysis focuses on targeting Title I-A funds to LEAs with high percentages of formula children, showing improved targeting with the addition of Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG to Basic Grants. The analysis focuses on the improved targeting of Title I-A funds to LEAs with high percentages of formula children through Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG in addition to Basic Grants. Table B-1 shows the distribution of FY2016 Title I-A funds to LEAs based on formula child count ranges, indicating the share of funds provided to each range. Each range contains 20% of formula children, with the goal of more effectively targeting funds on concentrations of poverty. In FY2016, the distribution of Title I-A funds to LEAs based on formula child count ranges showed that Basic Grants were the least effective at targeting funds on concentrations of formula children. The share of funding increased as formula child counts increased under Concentration Grant, Targeted Grant, and EFIG formulas. LEAs with higher formula child counts received a larger share of funding compared to those with lower counts. The share of funding increases as formula child counts increase under Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG formulas. The distribution of funds indicates that Targeted Grants and EFIG formulas target funds more effectively than Concentration Grants, with LEAs with higher formula child counts receiving a larger share of funds. In FY2017, LEAs with the lowest formula child counts received a smaller share of funds under Targeted Grants and EFIG compared to Concentration Grants. The distribution of funds varied across the different formulas, with LEAs with higher formula child counts receiving a larger share of funds. In FY2017, Title I-A appropriations were allocated to LEAs through different formulas, with the Basic Grant formula receiving 42%, Concentration Grant formula 9%, and Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas each receiving 25%. There has been an upward trend in Title I-A appropriations since FY1980, with the largest percentage increases in the early 1990s and 2000s. Post-FY2001 increases have been divided between Targeted Grants and EFIG. The share of appropriations allocated through the Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas has been increasing, while the share allocated through the Basic Grant and Concentration Grant formulas has been decreasing. Tables D-1 and D-2 show the variance in grant amounts explained by different formula factors. Funds are initially calculated at the LEA level under the Basic Grant, Concentration Grant, and Targeted Grant formulas, while the EFIG formula calculates allocations for each state overall. For the analysis, grants under the EFIG formula are examined at the state level, while grants under other formulas are examined at the LEA level. R squared values for LEA grant amounts based on formula factors are shown in Table D-1, while R squared values for state level grants under the EFIG formula are provided in Table D-2. Each formula factor is analyzed individually to determine variance in grant amounts. The R squared value reflects the variance in Title I-A grant amounts explained solely by formula child counts. Selected acronyms used in the report are provided in Appendix E."
