    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Senior Nutrition Act of 2002\". Congress finds that senior citizens in the United States face high out-of-pocket medical expenses, especially for prescription drugs. Many Medicare beneficiaries lack affordable drug coverage, leading to difficult choices between medication and food. The commodity supplemental food program helps provide nutritious food to seniors in need. During fiscal year 2000, over 388,000 people participated in the commodity supplemental food program, with the majority being senior citizens. Senior citizens with household incomes over 130 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines are ineligible for supplemental foods. Eligibility requirements for the program should be modified to better serve senior citizens with high medical expenses. The commodity supplemental food program needs to be adjusted to allow more senior citizens to qualify for the supplemental foods provided. The eligibility of elderly persons under the commodity supplemental food program is being addressed. Amendment to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 includes changes to provisions regarding cheese and nonfat dry milk quantities to be provided to the Secretary of Agriculture annually. The curr_chunk discusses eligibility criteria for elderly persons to participate in a commodity supplemental food program, including age requirements and income guidelines. Additionally, it mentions the authorization of appropriations for the program. The curr_chunk authorizes appropriations for the commodity supplemental food program, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2003 to 2007 and additional funds as needed for 2008 onwards. None of the funds can be used to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for donated commodities. The curr_chunk includes amendments to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 related to the commodity supplemental food program. It modifies sections 5(a) and 5(g) by changing the language used by the Secretary."
