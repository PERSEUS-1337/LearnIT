    "content": "The \"Systemic Risk Mitigation Act\" is the short title of the Act. It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act defines \"average daily closing price\" as the average daily closing price of a credit default swap on long-term subordinated debt of a bank holding company over a 30-day period. The Board will develop a method to determine this price through regulations. \"Bank holding company\" has the same meaning as in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, but only includes companies with total consolidated assets. The term \"stress test\" refers to an evaluation designed by the Board to determine the financial stability of certain companies with total consolidated assets exceeding $50,000,000,000. The Board conducts stress tests to evaluate whether a bank holding company has sufficient capital to absorb losses in adverse economic conditions and meet systemically important obligations. Tier 1 capital is defined as per regulations prescribed by the Board. The Board conducts stress tests to evaluate if a bank holding company has enough capital to absorb losses in adverse economic conditions and meet important obligations. Tier 1 capital is defined as per regulations prescribed by the Board. SEC. 3 introduces a market-based trigger to determine the adequacy of capital. The market-based trigger requires a bank holding company to raise additional tier 1 capital if its average daily closing price exceeds 50 basis points. The company must submit an action plan to the Board within 14 days to address the capital deficiency. The bank holding company must implement a plan to address its capital deficiency within 30 days of Board approval. If the average daily closing price exceeds 50 basis points, the process must be repeated until it is less than or equal to 50 basis points. The company can appeal the Board's findings and request a stress test. After conducting a stress test, an appeal can toll deadlines until the appeals process concludes. If a capital deficiency is found, the process must be repeated until resolved. If the average daily closing price exceeds 75 basis points, certain actions must be taken. If the average daily closing price exceeds 75 basis points, the Board will notify the bank holding company and require an action plan. Dividends may be suspended, and receivership may be considered if the price exceeds 100 basis points. A stress test will be conducted by the Board. If a company has a capital deficiency after a stress test, they must submit an action plan within 14 days. If the average daily closing price exceeds 100 basis points, the Board will place the company into receivership. If a bank holding company fails to submit an action plan within the required time period, the Board will place the company into receivership. Holders of long-term subordinated debt will receive either 80 percent of the face value of the debt or the residual value of the company after other creditors' claims are satisfied. The Board mandates each bank holding company to issue and maintain long-term subordinated debt. Bank holding companies must issue and maintain long-term subordinated debt equal to or greater than 15 percent of total consolidated assets. Failure to meet this requirement requires a plan submission to the Board. This section will be effective two years after the enactment of the Act. The sections prohibiting proprietary trading and enhancing prudential standards are repealed under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act."
