It represents the executive branch in policy matters, including spectrum management agreements and transferring radio frequencies to the commercial domain through auctions. The NTIA administers grants programs like BTOP and PSIC, and is establishing requirements for a $135 million grant program to help states plan for a nationwide public safety broadband network. The agency also supports FirstNet and fulfills various responsibilities in federal spectrum management. The NTIA manages spectrum usage for federal agencies, collaborates with the FCC and Department of State on spectrum issues, leads interagency efforts on Internet policy, and works with NIST on the Department of Commerce campus in Boulder, CO. The NTIA collaborates with various federal agencies on research projects and grants, including the FCC, Rural Utilities Service, and Department of Homeland Security. They work with NIST, DHS, and FCC to provide expertise to public safety agencies using BTOP and PSIC funds for wireless networks. The Office of Spectrum Management administers NTIA policies to ensure effective spectrum use nationally and internationally. The Office of Spectrum Management (OSM) addresses federal government spectrum requirements, including public safety operations and satellite network coordination. It handles frequency assignment for federal agencies and provides spectrum certification for new radio communication systems. The Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD) supports NTIA's role as adviser on telecommunications policies. The Office of International Affairs (OIA) develops policies to enhance U.S. companies' global competitiveness in ICT sectors. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) provides technical support to NTIA in advancing telecommunications and information infrastructure development, enhancing domestic competition, improving U.S. telecommunications trade opportunities, and promoting more efficient use of the radio spectrum. The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) administers grant programs to further technology deployment in America and national priorities. Decisions on federal spectrum use are made through the Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC), which includes representatives from the U.S. military branches. The Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC) includes representatives from all branches of the U.S. military and federal agencies affected by spectrum management decisions. The FY2012 legislation provided $45.6 million to the NTIA for salaries and expenses, which was 9.6% higher than the previous year but 18.4% less than the Administration's request of $55.8 million. This increase is mainly due to the costs of administering the $4.4 billion Recovery Act program for broadband technologies and deployment mapping. The NTIA received $32.3 million for oversight programs in FY2012, with additional funding requests for new wireless broadband technologies and Internet privacy initiatives. The Public Telecommunications Facilities Program, which supported public broadcasting stations, was terminated in FY2011. The Administration proposed $46.9 million for NTIA salaries and expenses in FY2013, a 2.9% increase from the previous year. The Administration proposes $46.9 million for NTIA salaries and expenses in FY2013, a 2.9% increase from the previous year. Steps are being taken to increase radio frequency spectrum for mobile services like Internet access, due to the demand from smartphones and tablets. Policy proposals include clearing federal frequencies for commercial use, sharing frequencies with specific users, and improving federal spectrum management. The NTIA supports the Administration's goal of increasing spectrum capacity for mobile broadband by 500 MHz. A 10-year plan has been developed to identify bands of spectrum available for commercial wireless broadband service, including recommendations to make available 15 MHz of spectrum between 1695 MHz and 1710 MHz, and 100 MHz within bands from 3550 MHz to 3650 MHz. Additionally, two 20 MHz bands within 4200-4400 MHz are being studied for possible repurposing. The NTIA is evaluating the commercial use of spectrum in the 1755-1850 MHz band for possible repurposing at the World Radio Conference. Federal agencies are transferring spectrum to commercial license-holders in the 1710-1755 MHz band for international harmonization of wireless technology. The NTIA studied federal spectrum use in the 1755-1850 MHz band, with over 3,100 frequency assignments across more than 20 agencies. The NTIA evaluated spectrum use in the 1755-1850 MHz band, estimating an $18,098 million cost to clear federal users. Recommendations included sharing frequencies between federal and commercial users, with some frequencies cleared for auction. Congressional hearing challenged cost estimates, leading to GAO examination. Legislative action in 2012 updated spectrum provisions for commercial services. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 updated spectrum provisions for commercial use, requiring the NTIA to work with the FCC to identify bands for auction. Proceeds from auctions are deposited into a Public Safety Trust Fund, with funds appropriated for defined purposes. The NTIA is also responsible for creating and supporting FirstNet in building a nationwide broadband network for public safety communications. Grant program requirements for State and Local entities are established in consultation with FirstNet. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 updated spectrum provisions for commercial use, requiring the NTIA to work with the FCC to identify bands for auction. The NTIA, in consultation with FirstNet, will establish grant program requirements for a State and Local Implementation Fund. Additionally, the NTIA will administer grants and spectrum access for states not directly participating in the national network. The act addresses spectrum repurposing from federal to commercial use and defines compensation for reassignment. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 updated spectrum provisions for commercial use, requiring the NTIA to prioritize reallocation options for exclusive, non-federal uses through competitive bidding. A Technical Panel within the NTIA, consisting of three members qualified as radio engineers or technical experts appointed by key officials, is tasked with reviewing federal agencies' transition plans. Provisions regarding the Technical Panel and related procedural requirements, including dispute resolution, have been detailed by the NTIA. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences in Boulder, CO conducts research in this field. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences in Boulder, CO conducts core telecommunications research and engineering services to promote enhanced domestic competition, advanced telecommunications services, and more efficient spectrum use. Current focus areas include public safety communications interoperability, standards development for emerging devices, interference resolution, and secure federal record repositories. International standards for public safety are being developed to benefit public safety communications. The development and acceptance of international standards for public safety communications, led by ITS and NIST, aim to benefit from global economies of scale. Spectrum allocation is governed by international treaties, with a trend towards harmonizing allocations for commercial use worldwide. Harmonization allows for common frequencies globally, promoting a seamless, global communications market. The Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) auction in the United States in 2006 was the result of international spectrum harmonization agreements led by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). ITU ensures interference-free wireless communication globally through international agreements and a table of frequency allocations for 39 defined wireless services. The World Radio Conference (WRC) is a forum for negotiating international treaties on spectrum use, with the United States Table of Allocations maintained by NTIA. WRCs provide opportunities to revise regulations and frequency allocations in response to technological changes. FCC and NTIA handle U.S. positions on WRC agenda items, with input from federal agencies and the private sector. The World Radio Conference (WRC) is a forum for negotiating international treaties on spectrum use. NTIA and the FCC work with the private sector to address agenda items and submit recommendations to the Department of State. The Department of State coordinates the U.S. position for each WRC and leads the delegation. Preparation for each conference involves collaboration with affected parties, and the delegation includes representatives from the government and private sector. The most recent conference, WRC-12, concluded with the signing of a new treaty. The preliminary agenda for the next WRC meeting was approved during WRC-12, and WRC-15 will be held in 2015-2016."
