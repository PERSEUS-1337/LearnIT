    "content": "The \"Small Business Paperwork Amnesty Act of 2006\" allows for the suspension of fines for first-time paperwork violations by small business concerns. The \"Paperwork Reduction Act\" is amended to include provisions for small businesses, stating that civil fines will not be imposed for first-time violations unless serious harm to the public interest is determined. The \"Paperwork Reduction Act\" exempts small businesses from civil fines for first-time violations unless there is serious harm to the public interest, interference with criminal activity detection, violation of tax laws, failure to correct the violation within 6 months of notification, or a danger to public health or safety. The head of an agency may choose not to impose a civil fine on a small business if a violation is corrected within 24 hours of notification, especially if it poses a danger to public health or safety. Factors considered include all circumstances surrounding the violation. The head of an agency may choose not to impose a civil fine on a small business if a violation is corrected within 24 hours of notification, especially if it poses a danger to public health or safety. Factors considered include the nature and seriousness of the violation, the small business's effort to comply with laws and remedy the violation promptly, and whether the business has gained an economic benefit from the violation. If a small business violates a requirement related to information collection, the agency head must notify Congress within 60 days of imposing a civil fine without allowing 24 hours for correction. This provision does not apply to first-time violations by small businesses. The agency head must notify Congress within 60 days of imposing a civil fine on a small business for violating information collection requirements. The head of an agency cannot consider violations by other agencies when making this determination."
