    "content": "The \"Oil Subsidy Elimination Act of 2006\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to oil subsidies. The Congress finds that on April 21, 2006, the price of oil hit a record high of $75.17 per barrel, leading to gas prices exceeding $3 per gallon in many areas. The Energy Information Administration predicts a further 25 cent increase in gas prices. Oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, are making record profits, with a net income of $36.1 billion in 2005. In the third quarter of 2005, ExxonMobil set a record profit of $9.92 billion. Despite high energy prices affecting the American middle class, oil executives are receiving substantial compensation and retirement packages. Legislation passed in Congress gave billions in taxpayer dollars to the oil industry in the form of tax breaks, while the industry continued to make record profits. The top five oil companies testified that they did not need Federal tax incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. President Bush called for Congress to remove $2 billion of these tax breaks over a 10-year period, stating that energy companies do not require taxpayer subsidies for certain expenses. SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN LARGE INTEGRATED OIL COMPANIES. Revaluation of LIFO Inventories for Large Integrated Oil Companies in 2005 requires increasing the value of historic LIFO layers of inventories and decreasing cost of goods sold by the aggregate amount of increases. The taxpayer's gross income may be increased if the cost of goods sold exceeds the taxpayer's cost of goods sold for the taxable year. The layer adjustment amount is calculated based on historic LIFO layers and the number of barrels of crude oil represented by the layer. The section 29(d)(5) does not result in a change in accounting method or addition to tax under section 6655 for underpayments of estimated tax by an applicable integrated oil company. An applicable integrated oil company is defined as having a certain level of crude oil production and gross receipts. The elimination of amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures is proposed for major integrated oil companies. Expenditures for Major Integrated Oil Companies are exempt from certain tax provisions if they have a daily worldwide production of at least 500,000 barrels of crude oil. This amendment is effective retroactively to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Additionally, modifications to foreign tax credit rules apply to large integrated oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers. The amendment exempts expenditures for major integrated oil companies with daily worldwide production of at least 500,000 barrels of crude oil from certain tax provisions. It also includes modifications to foreign tax credit rules for large integrated oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers. The amendment exempts major integrated oil companies with daily worldwide production of at least 500,000 barrels of crude oil from certain tax provisions. It also modifies foreign tax credit rules for large integrated oil companies that are dual capacity taxpayers. The term 'dual capacity taxpayer' refers to a person subject to a levy of a foreign country or possession who receives a specific economic benefit from that country. The term 'generally applicable income tax' means an income tax imposed under the laws of a foreign country on income derived from that country. The term 'large integrated oil company' is defined as an integrated oil company with gross receipts exceeding $1,000,000,000 in a taxable year. The term 'large integrated oil company' is defined as an integrated oil company with gross receipts exceeding $1,000,000,000 in a taxable year. The amendments made by this subsection, which require an average daily worldwide production of crude oil of at least 500,000 barrels, apply to taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, except where contrary to any treaty obligation of the United States. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is repealed, including provisions related to temporary expensing for equipment in refining liquid fuels, determination of small refiner exception to oil depletion deduction, and amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be administered as if these provisions had never been enacted."
