The Secretary will establish the Ocean Energy Safety Institute to improve safety in the offshore oil and gas industry through collaboration with government, academia, and scientific experts. The Institute will function to develop research programs and provide technical assistance. The Ocean Energy Safety Institute aims to be a center of expertise in oil and gas technology, promoting dialogue and research collaboration among various stakeholders for safe and environmentally responsible offshore operations. It also aims to preserve knowledge, provide recommendations on best practices, and assist the Secretary in determining the best available technology for offshore oil and gas development. The Ocean Energy Safety Institute evaluates and certifies new technologies for offshore oil and gas operations, facilitates training for Federal workers, maintains an equipment failure reporting system, and provides recommendations on geological and geophysical sciences. The Secretary will establish an annual nonproducing lease fee for areas of the outer Continental Shelf under lease for oil or gas production where no production is occurring. The fee will be $1 per lease. The Secretary will establish a $1 fee per acre of land where oil or gas is produced for less than 90 days in a year. The fee will be used for Institute operations and regulations will be in place to prevent evasion.
