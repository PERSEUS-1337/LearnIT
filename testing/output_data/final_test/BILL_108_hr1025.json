    "content": "The Act titled \"National Estuarine Reserve System Act of 2003\" establishes the National Estuarine Reserve System. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 is amended to include the use of the National Estuarine Reserve System to enhance the management of coastal and estuarine resources through innovative technologies and techniques. The definition of resource stewardship is also expanded to include this implementation. The term 'resource stewardship' is defined as implementing methods to ensure long-term conservation of coastal and estuarine resources. The National Estuarine Reserve System is included in the Coastal Zone Management Act to enhance resource management. The National Estuarine Reserve System is part of the Coastal Zone Management Act to enhance resource management. The National Estuarine Reserve System, established under the Coastal Zone Management Act, aims to improve the understanding and management of coastal and estuarine resources by designating existing sanctuaries as reserves. The National Estuarine Reserve System, established under the Coastal Zone Management Act, designates areas as national estuarine reserves based on specific criteria outlined by the Secretary. These reserves must be representative estuarine ecosystems suitable for long-term research and contribute to the balance of the System. The National Estuarine Reserve System designates areas as reserves to provide long-term protection for resources, enhance public awareness, and improve management through research, education, and stewardship guidelines developed by the Secretary. The National Estuarine Reserve System designates reserves for long-term protection, public awareness, and management through research, education, and stewardship guidelines. This includes identifying coastal and estuarine management issues, establishing priorities, common principles, research methodologies, and performance standards. The guidelines for the National Estuarine Reserve System include establishing performance standards for measuring effectiveness in addressing coastal management issues and considering additional funding sources for research and stewardship efforts. The Secretary will consult with State representatives and members of the coastal and estuarine community to promote and coordinate research, education, and resource stewardship using the System. Activities related to coastal and estuarine resources must prioritize the use of the System. The Secretary may provide financial assistance through grants to coastal States for acquiring lands within the System and collaborating with other Federal and State agencies and programs for coastal and estuarine research, education, and resource stewardship activities. The Secretary may provide financial assistance through grants to coastal States for acquiring lands within the System for long-term management, reserve facilities, operating reserves, conducting resource stewardship, educational, and interpretive activities. This assistance can also support research and monitoring within a reserve. Financial assistance provided under this section may be used for acquiring lands within the System, reserve facilities, operating reserves, conducting resource stewardship, educational, interpretive, or training activities that align with research and education guidelines. The Secretary may impose terms and conditions to protect the interests of the United States, including requiring suitable title documents from coastal States for lands and waters acquired with such assistance. The financial assistance provided under this section can cover up to 50% of the costs for acquiring lands and waters for a national estuarine reserve. For other purposes like education, research, and monitoring activities, the assistance can cover up to 70-100% of the costs incurred. Financial assistance under this section can cover up to 100% of costs for System-wide activities, including monitoring equipment acquisition, data management, research programs, and fellowship programs. Assistance from recovered amounts for coastal zone damage can cover 100% of activity costs. The Secretary can enter agreements with nonprofits to solicit donations for reserve projects. The Secretary can solicit donations for reserve projects that align with the reserve's purpose and accept donations of funds and services for project implementation. Donations accepted are considered gifts to the United States for carrying out the section. The Secretary will evaluate the operation and management of each reserve periodically. The Secretary may suspend financial assistance for a reserve if deficiencies are found in its operation, management, research, education, or resource stewardship. The designation of an estuarine area as a reserve may be withdrawn if evaluation reveals significant issues. The Secretary may suspend financial assistance for a reserve if deficiencies are found in its operation, management, research, education, or resource stewardship. The designation of an estuarine area as a reserve may be withdrawn if evaluation reveals significant issues, such as the basis for findings no longer existing, inconsistent research or stewardship, or non-compliance by the coastal State. The Secretary is required to report every 2 years to specific committees on new reserve designations and expansions. The National Estuarine Reserve System allows for the expansion of reserves, conducts research, education, and resource stewardship programs, and provides evaluations periodically. Definitions for \"reserve\" and \"System\" are provided in the section. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 315 is specified for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The authorization of appropriations for grants under section 315 for fiscal years 2005 to 2008 is as follows: $36,000,000 for 2005, $37,000,000 for 2006, $38,000,000 for 2007, and $39,000,000 for 2008. Additionally, a limitation of $15,000,000 is set for grants for acquisition and construction for reserves."
