    "title": "AB 2807",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17052 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow an earned income tax credit against the \"net tax\" for taxable years starting January 1, 2015. The credit amount is determined based on Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, with adjustments specified in the annual Budget Act. The earned income tax credit is only available for taxable years with allocated resources for oversight. The credit percentage and phaseout percentage vary based on the number of qualifying children. The earned income amount and phaseout amount also differ depending on the number of qualifying children. The phaseout amounts for the earned income tax credit vary based on the number of qualifying children:\n- No qualifying children: $3,290\n- 1 qualifying child: $4,940\n- 2 or more qualifying children: $6,935\nCertain sections of the Internal Revenue Code are modified for joint returns, increased percentage for three or more qualifying children, and state-specific provisions. In lieu of Section 32(c)(2)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer's reportable gross income from self-employment for the taxable year shall apply. \"Reportable gross income from self-employment\" refers to gross income from a trade or business properly reported to the Secretary on an information return and reported on a written statement as required by the Internal Revenue Code. Section 32(c)(3)(C) is modified by substituting \"this state\" for \"the United States.\" For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, Section 32(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to increase the amount to $3,400. Any excess credit under this section can be used to offset other tax liabilities and the remaining balance will be refunded to the taxpayer from the Tax Relief and Refund Account. The Franchise Tax Board can establish rules for this section, exempt from certain requirements for implementing the credit for the 2015 taxable year. Refunded amounts will be treated like federal earned income refunds for benefit eligibility. The Franchise Tax Board will include scope, costs, and schedule changes for the California Earned Income Tax Credit in its next Special Project Report. The purpose of the credit is to reduce poverty among working families and individuals in California, with annual reports on the number of tax returns and individuals claiming the credit. The Franchise Tax Board will report on the number of individuals claiming the California Earned Income Tax Credit, average credit amount, distribution by dependents and income ranges, and estimates of families lifted out of deep poverty by the credit. The Franchise Tax Board will provide a report on the California Earned Income Tax Credit to various Senate and Assembly committees. The tax credit will be known as the California Earned Income Tax Credit and will apply for taxable years starting from January 1, 2016. Section 23153 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended accordingly. Section 23153 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to subject certain corporations to a minimum franchise tax from the date of incorporation or commencing business in California until dissolution or ceasing business operations in the state. This applies to corporations incorporated in California, qualified to do business in the state, or conducting business within California. Certain entities are exempt from the minimum franchise tax specified in Section 23153 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, including credit unions and nonprofit cooperative associations organized under specific conditions. Corporations subject to the minimum franchise tax must pay annually to the state a minimum franchise tax of $800, except for specific cases where the tax is $25. This includes inactive corporations formed for gold or quicksilver mining that have not done business within the state for a certain period. For taxable years starting in 1999, qualified new corporations must pay a minimum franchise tax of $500 annually to the state. The gross receipts of a corporation include those of all members in a commonly controlled group. The definition of \"Gross receipts, less returns and allowances reportable to this state\" includes gross receipts from business and nonbusiness income production. A \"qualified new corporation\" is a corporation incorporated in or qualified to do business in the state, starting operations after incorporation with estimated gross receipts of $1,000,000 or less. It excludes corporations previously operating as sole proprietorships or partnerships, and those reorganizing solely to reduce franchise tax. The subdivision does not apply to certain entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability companies, charitable organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, real estate mortgage investment conduits, and qualified Subchapter S subsidiaries. For taxable years starting between January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000, if a corporation pays $500 for the second year but exceeds $1,000,000 in gross receipts, an additional $300 tax is due. Corporations incorporating after January 1, 2000, are exempt from the minimum franchise tax for their first year. Certain types of entities are exempt from certain tax regulations, including limited partnerships, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, charitable organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, real estate mortgage investment conduits, and qualified Subchapter S subsidiaries. The minimum franchise tax does not apply to corporations reorganizing to avoid payment. Domestic corporations that dissolve and cease business are exempt from the tax. The tax increase imposed by the Legislature cannot exceed 10% per year. A small business corporation owned by a deployed member of the US Armed Forces is exempt from the minimum franchise tax if the owner is deployed and the corporation operates at a loss or ceases operation. The Franchise Tax Board can create regulations for this exemption, defining terms like \"ceases operation\" and \"deployed.\" Deployment excludes temporary duty for training or processing and permanent change of station. Operating at a loss means having negative net income. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020, a small business corporation with total income of $250,000 or less is exempt from the minimum franchise tax if it operates at a loss. Corporations subject to the minimum franchise tax must pay a minimum of $150 annually to the state starting January 1, 2017. The subdivision does not apply to certain entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability companies, charitable organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and real estate mortgage investment conduits. This act imposes a tax levy and takes immediate effect."
