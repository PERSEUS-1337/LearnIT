    "content": "The Air Force faces a significant challenge due to budgetary restrictions from the Balanced Budget Act of 2013. Program spending for F-35A and KC-46 procurement is substantial, while spending on RPAs is relatively small. The LRS-B program is projected to triple in spending over the FYDP. The Air Force's procurement budget faces challenges as newer programs are projected to triple in spending over the FYDP. Established programs like F-35A and KC-46 will continue to require substantial procurement spending. The LRS-B program, currently funded in the R&D budget, may eventually shift to the procurement budget, adding pressure on newer programs. The Air Force's procurement budget is facing challenges as newer programs are expected to triple in spending over the FYDP. This includes programs like CRH, PAR, T-X, and JSTARS Recap moving from R&D to procurement, creating a \"bow wave\" effect with increasing budgets trying to fit within a fixed budget. The charts show an increase in expenses for FY2018 and FY2019, followed by a drop in FY2020, but the Air Force modernization bow wave is not vividly displayed due to three reasons. The FYDP includes only six years' data, making it difficult to portray the effects of the bow wave. The Air Force manages current programs to stay under budget caps, resulting in flat spending. Without the caps, program budgets might show greater growth. Figure 1 shows virtually flat spending due to constraints on modernization accounts. The Air Force manages current programs to stay under budget caps, resulting in virtually flat spending. Some newer programs have been delayed, leading to additional costs for keeping older aircraft operational past their service lives. This results in costs being shifted to operations and maintenance budgets, highlighting challenges in modernization budgeting. The Air Force manages programs under budget caps, leading to flat spending. The end of budget caps in FY2021 may impact R&D programs timing for funding. The Air Force is banking on budget caps not being extended, increasing competition for procurement dollars. The F-35A and KC-46 programs will continue for decades, offering little relief. The significant growth of LRS-B in the R&D budget may challenge newer programs' schedules. Air Force plans show a surge in modernization spending in FY2018 and FY2019. Reductions in FY2017 could impact planned increases for FY2018 and FY2019. Choices to fit growing programs under a fixed budget include raising the topline or reducing programs. Details matter in how programs are reduced and which ones are affected. The BBA-mandated caps on defense spending end in FY2021, potentially impacting the Air Force modernization budget. Increasing the budget may require a larger share of the federal budget for defense or the Air Force, with priorities determining allocation to aviation modernization. Canceling or delaying programs can lead to capability gaps and cost growth. Possible spending reductions or deferrals that Congress may consider for the Air Force modernization budget include moving funds from other programs, which may impact current readiness. Retiring or reducing programs can lead to capability gaps and cost growth. Reducing older fleets and deferring major programs for modernization can create capability gaps in the Air Force. Some suggest reducing the annual F-35A acquisition to free up funds for other priorities. This could impact the Air Force's ability to carry out its missions. The Air Force faces capability gaps due to delayed modernization programs and increased costs of maintaining older aircraft. Deferring major programs like T-X, JSTARS Recap, CRH, and PAR could help manage program growth. However, prolonging the use of aging platforms would lead to higher costs and decreased capability. This is especially critical for the LRS-B program intended to replace the aging B-52s. The Air Force may face capability gaps if LRS-B is delayed, as it aims to replace the aging B-52s. The KC-46 program will provide new aerial refueling tankers, with a successor program called KC-Y planned. Deferring KC-Y could lead to capability gaps, decreased industrial base capability, and increased costs for eventual aircraft procurement. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) was created by Congress to fund the development of the SSBN(X) submarine, arguing that the strategic deterrence mission was a national one and not unique to the Navy. This fund was separate from the Navy's regular shipbuilding account to preserve Navy shipbuilding funds for other programs like LRS-B. The budget for weapon system development spans several decades, making it challenging to visualize future budgetary needs. Congress has mandated 30-year plans for shipbuilding and aviation programs, but the lack of detail hinders accurate projections. A shift to projecting 10 years in the future in the FYDP could help illustrate resource decisions needed to prevent future budgetary issues."
