The Congress acknowledges that teenage pregnancy is a critical issue in the United States, with the highest rate among developed nations. It has significant fiscal implications, especially for communities of color. The \"Communities of Color Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2010\" aims to address this issue through research projects for minority youth. Teen pregnancy rates increased for all racial/ethnic groups, with Hispanic teens having the highest rates. Research shows early parenthood has social, educational, and financial impacts, with low high school and college completion rates. Teen dating violence is linked to higher levels of unplanned pregnancy, with 1 in 5 teenage girls in the US reporting intimate partner violence. Promoting healthy relationships is crucial to prevent teenage pregnancies and unplanned pregnancies, as states report high levels of physical or sexual intimate partner violence. Demonstration grants are provided to reduce teenage pregnancies. The Secretary awards competitive grants to eligible entities for program interventions targeting youth in minority or immigrant communities to reduce teenage pregnancies and promote healthy relationships. Priority is given to projects in these communities, and funds can be used in various settings like schools, after-school programs, and health clinics. The Secretary awards grants to entities for programs targeting at-risk youth in areas like juvenile justice or foster care. Grant recipients must provide age-appropriate, evidence-based, culturally sensitive information. A portion of the funding is allocated for an independent evaluation of program effectiveness in changing attitudes and behavior. In this section, an eligible entity is defined as a State, local, or tribal agency; a school or postsecondary institution; an after-school program; a nonprofit coalition; a community or faith-based organization; or any other entity determined appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary will award grants for multimedia campaigns to educate the public on teenage pregnancy and related issues, with priority given to campaigns targeting minority communities. Grantees must provide information on preventing teenage pregnancy, healthy relationships, and may include information on preventing dating violence. Research on reducing teenage pregnancies is emphasized in this section. The purpose of this section is to support research on factors contributing to high rates of teenage and unintended pregnancy, explore strategies for addressing these issues through healthy relationships programs, and study the impact of violence and abuse on decisions about relationships and pregnancy. Grants will be provided by the Secretary through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for this research. The section supports research on teenage pregnancy in minority communities, relationships between pregnancy and health/school achievement, and interventions to reduce pregnancy. The section discusses effective interventions to reduce pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage, the variance in teenage pregnancy rates by location, population subgroup, level of acculturation, and socioeconomic status, as well as the importance of the physical and social environment in placing communities at risk. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of environmental factors in increasing rates of teenage pregnancy and dating violence abuse, as well as the significance of aspirations and motivations in influencing young people's risk of these issues. It also highlights the need for improved data collection on sexual and reproductive health, including teenage pregnancies among minority communities, sexual behavior, birth control sabotage, and teenage pregnancies among youth in foster care or juvenile justice systems. The curr_chunk focuses on research priorities related to teenage pregnancy, dating violence, and reproductive health among minority communities, including youth in foster care or juvenile justice systems. The Secretary is directed to prioritize interdisciplinary approaches in conducting research in these areas. The Secretary is directed to prioritize research that incorporates interdisciplinary approaches or a strong emphasis on community-based participatory research. SEC. 7. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
