    "content": "In this paper, a nonlinear unsupervised metric learning framework is proposed to enhance clustering algorithm performance. The framework integrates nonlinear distance metric learning and manifold embedding simultaneously to increase natural separations among data samples. The metric learning is implemented through feature space transformations using Coherent Point Drifting (CPD). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach over existing solutions in unsupervised metric learning. Cluster analysis is widely used in various fields to group data samples with similar features efficiently. The Euclidean distance is commonly used in clustering algorithms to measure similarities among data samples. However, learning a customized metric function from data samples can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. Unsupervised metric learning remains a challenge due to the lack of ground-truth label information. In this paper, the focus is on Unsupervised Metric Learning (UML) for clustering, aiming to increase data separability by projecting data samples onto a low-dimensional manifold. Different setups for low-dimensional manifolds have been explored in recent years, with methods like Principle Component Analysis and manifold learning solutions used for dimension reduction before applying clustering algorithms like K-means. Unsupervised Metric Learning (UML) focuses on projecting data onto low-dimensional manifolds to enhance data separability. Different manifold setups, such as Grassmann space and Wasserstein geometry, have been studied. Unlike traditional dimensionality reduction methods, UML considers clustering algorithms simultaneously. AML combines clustering and distance metric learning through a trace maximization problem solved iteratively. Each iteration involves data projection and clustering via kernel K-means. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of linear transformations in Unsupervised Metric Learning (UML) solutions and introduces a new nonlinear UML framework to address these drawbacks. The proposed framework aims to improve data separability by integrating nonlinear features. The proposed nonlinear UML framework integrates nonlinear feature transformation and manifold embedding to enhance data separability for K-means clustering. The model utilizes Coherent Point Drifting (CPD) for high-order yet smooth transformations, leading to well-separable sample projections. K-means is then applied on the transformed embeddings for label predictions. The proposed solution combines CPD-driven deformation and spectral embeddings to enhance data separability in unsupervised metric learning. It outperforms state-of-the-art UML methods on benchmark databases, showing promising performance for real-world applications. The paper details the CPD model, optimization strategy, and experimental results with synthetic and real-world datasets. The proposed solution combines CPD-driven deformation and spectral embeddings to enhance data separability in unsupervised metric learning. K-means clustering boundaries work best for linearly separable data sets, but fail for non-linearly separable ones. The CPD model is used to learn a smooth nonlinear transformation to make data linearly separable. The CPD model uses a Gaussian low-pass filter for regularization in estimating an optimal continuous velocity function to match U and V. K-means clustering partitions samples into groups by minimizing an objective function based on cluster means. The goal is to learn a spatial transformation to improve data separability. Our proposed CPD based unsupervised metric learning (CPD-UML) aims to learn a spatial transformation \u03a8 and clustering S1 simultaneously. By moving samples to new positions, we enhance the performance of K-means clustering by improving linear separability and utilizing an updated distance measure in the transformed feature space. The mean vector of instances in cluster S1c is denoted as c. The CPD deformation involves reformulating equations and defining a Gaussian kernel function matrix G for the transformation. The size of G is n-by-n. The mean of data instances within a cluster S1c is denoted as \u00b5. Using formulations involving a permutation matrix E, the equations can be rewritten. A cluster indicator matrix Y is defined as n-by-k orthonormal matrix. To reduce overfitting, a penalty term \u03bb||\u03a8||2F is added. The nonlinear CPD-UML solution involves a trace minimization problem with regularization parameter \u03bb. An EM-like iterative minimization framework is used to update transformation matrix \u03a8 and cluster indicator Y alternately. The optimal Y is computed using a spectral relaxation technique based on Ky Fan matrix inequalities. The spectral relaxation solution involves projecting data samples to a new K-dimensional space using the K largest eigenvectors of X T X. The cluster assignments are then computed using the K-means method. The optimization for \u03a8 involves a trace minimization problem with a smooth convex function. The gradient and Hessian matrix of the function show that J has a positive definite Hessian w.r.t. \u03a8, leading to a stationary point where the gradient is evaluated to 0. The convexity proof of J with respect to \u03a8 involves updating J through derivation steps to an equivalent form. The gradient of J with respect to \u03a8 is computed and rewritten to facilitate the proof. The eigenvalues of Y Y^T are all 1s based on a theorem, leading to the conclusion that the eigenvalues of Y Y^T are 1s. The eigenvalues of Y Y^T are all 1s, leading to the conclusion that the matrix M is positive definite. The Hessian matrix of J with respect to \u03a8 is symmetric with size (d * n) \u00d7 (d * n). The matrix M is positive definite, leading to the conclusion that the Hessian matrix H is positive definite as well. This implies that the objective function J is convex with respect to \u03a8, resulting in a unique global minimum solution \u03a8*. The optimal solution for \u03a8 can be obtained by solving a specific equation. The proposed CPD-UML algorithm is summarized in the provided pseudo-code. The CPD-UML algorithm utilizes a kernel principal component analysis framework to improve clustering performance. Experiments were conducted on synthetic and benchmark datasets, comparing with other unsupervised metric learning solutions. The two-moon synthetic dataset was used in the experiments. Our CPD-UML algorithm was tested with both linear and kernel versions, demonstrating improved separability of data samples compared to K-means. The clustering results show 99% accuracy in separating data samples via space transformations, as depicted in FIG1. Our nonlinear metric learning model deforms feature spaces in a smooth way to improve data separability. Various RBF kernels were applied on the two-moon dataset to simulate non-separable cases. Kernel K-means performance worsened with sub-optimal kernels. CPD-UML eases the search for an optimal RBF kernel by providing a supplementary force to kernelization. Our CPD-UML model enhances data separability by providing supplementary force under kernel spaces. Experimental evaluation on six benchmark datasets shows improved clustering results with sub-optimal kernels. Both linear and kernel versions of our approach were tested against baseline methods and competing solutions. In the experiments, AML, RPCA-OM, and FME were compared as competing solutions with kernel versions. NAML BID2 is the kernel version of AML, while RPCA-OM and FME were kernelized using the same strategy. RBF kernels were applied to all solutions, and datasets were split into seen and unseen data for evaluation. Clustering performance was assessed using 3-fold cross validation, with hyper-parameters searched within the same range as in previous publications. The regularization parameter \u03bb was a key parameter in the proposed approach. In the proposed approach, the regularization parameter \u03bb and smooth parameter \u03c3 were searched within specific ranges. The RBF kernel width was chosen for all methods. K-means clustering results were used as initialization clusters. Performance was measured using standard metrics over 20 runs. Results were evaluated using ground truth data from benchmark datasets, with a Student's t-test conducted for statistical comparison. Solutions were ranked based on a scoring schema from BID17. Our CPD-UML algorithm outperforms other methods in clustering performance and ranking scores. The kernel version approach achieves the highest ranking scores, showing significant improvements over baseline algorithms. The linear CPD-UML model also demonstrates effectiveness in nonlinear feature space transformation. The CPD-UML model learns a nonlinear metric and clusters data simultaneously using a smooth nonlinear transformation. Evaluations show its effectiveness on synthetic and benchmark datasets, with potential applications in computer vision and machine learning research."
