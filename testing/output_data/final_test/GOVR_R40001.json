    "content": "Members of Congress have varying views on international cooperation for climate change. Some believe it is crucial and support federal actions, while others are skeptical of the risks and costs involved. The United States has been involved in multilateral negotiations on climate change for over two decades. The report provides a U.S. perspective on United Nations negotiations, which began in 1990 to address concerns about human-induced climate change. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) highlighted the scientific and political concern about human-induced climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are very likely causing the observed climate change, with uncertainties remaining stable over two decades. The timing, magnitude, and implications of climate change are difficult to predict, posing challenges for international cooperation on how to address and share efforts to reduce risks. The rising GHG concentrations in the atmosphere pose a challenge for international cooperation. China has surpassed the United States as the leading emitter of GHG annually. Future growth in emissions is expected from industrializing countries like China, India, and Brazil. Negotiations focus on how to allocate efforts to reduce emissions. The primary issues for negotiation in 1990 remain the same today: reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system, sharing responsibilities among countries based on historic contributions and capacities, ensuring sustainable economic development and poverty eradication, facilitating adaptation to climate changes, and adapting international arrangements over time as science and capabilities evolve. The United States, along with Canada and Andorra, is not a Party to the Kyoto Protocol but is a Party to the UNFCCC, with obligations to reduce GHG emissions, report emissions, assist lower-income countries, and make binding commitments. Industrialized Parties to the Kyoto Protocol have committed to reducing GHG emissions, while most Parties have made voluntary pledges under the Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements. The 2011 Durban Platform aimed to end two-track negotiations and negotiate a single outcome with legal force applicable to all Parties post-2020. Funding for GHG reductions and adaptation is a key issue, with wealthy Parties pledging financing up to $30 billion during 2010-2012 and aiming for $100 billion annually by 2020 from various sources. Vulnerable developing countries had priority for the 2010-2012 funds. The 2010-2012 funds prioritized developing countries, exceeding the fast-start financing goal. However, the pathway to meeting the 2020 pledge remains unclear. The international climate change negotiations since 1990 culminated in the adoption of the UNFCCC in Rio de Janeiro. The U.S. Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, making the U.S. the fourth nation to do so. Further details can be accessed through the CRS website or by contacting CRS Inquiry. The UNFCCC was ratified by the United States in 1992, making it the fourth nation to do so. The treaty provides a framework for collaboration among 195 governments, but lacks measurable and enforceable objectives. Annex I Parties, including the US, committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The UNFCCC required Annex I Parties, including the US, to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Non-Annex I Parties also had obligations, with the 1997 Kyoto Protocol being a significant step towards meeting the treaty's objectives. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol aimed to reduce net GHG emissions of industrialized countries by 5.2% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The United States signed the protocol in 1998, but faced strong opposition in Congress. The Senate's \"Byrd-Hagel\" Resolution expressed opposition to the terms, leading to the protocol not being ratified by Presidents Clinton or George W. Bush. President George W. Bush announced in 2001 that the United States would not join the Kyoto Protocol due to the lack of GHG commitments by other large emitting non-Annex I countries and potential harm to the U.S. economy. As of November 1, 2012, 192 governments were Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Negotiations post-Kyoto Protocol focused on differentiation of commitments and assistance to developing countries, leading to the establishment of two tracks for further commitments under the UNFCCC in 2007. The Kyoto Protocol Parties (excluding the United States) mandated pursuing an amendment for commitments beyond 2012. A second track was established in 2007 to negotiate new GHG targets and actions for post-2012. The negotiation products were to be ready by the end of 2009 for decision at the COP and CMP meetings in Copenhagen. The convergence of the two tracks was unclear. The Bali Action Plan set key items for the \"Copenhagen\" negotiations on climate change post-2012, including mitigation, adaptation, financial assistance, technology transfer, and a shared vision. Provisions for monitoring, reporting, and verification were crucial, along with efforts to reduce GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Inter-sessional meetings in 2008 and 2009 saw little progress despite public and diplomatic expectations. The Copenhagen meetings in 2008 and 2009 did not meet high expectations for new GHG commitments from the United States and other countries, leading to concerns about the collapse of the UN climate change process. The Copenhagen negotiations in 2008 and 2009 did not result in significant new GHG commitments, leading to concerns about the collapse of the UN climate change process. Despite this, practical outcomes included a greater focus on transparency and recognition of political and economic barriers to setting aggressive international obligations. The Copenhagen Accord was seen as a \"paradigm shift\" towards a more country-driven approach in climate change negotiations. The Copenhagen Accord emerged as a political outcome, not a legal agreement, bridging differences but ultimately not adopted by all UNFCCC Parties. It outlined key actions on mitigation, adaptation, financing, technology, and deforestation, aiming to avoid temperature increases. The Copenhagen Accord outlined key actions on mitigation, adaptation, financing, technology, and deforestation with a long-term vision of avoiding temperature increases. It included financial pledges for \"fast start\" financing and a goal of $100 billion annually by 2020, with priority given to the most vulnerable developing countries. The Accord was associated with by 114 Parties to the UNFCCC by the end of 2010. In 2010, 35 non-Annex I Parties submitted NAMAs, while 42 others associated with the Accord. Some countries like Cuba, Cook Islands, Ecuador, Kuwait, and Nauru chose not to engage with the Accord. Meetings indicated potential retreat from Copenhagen Accord pledges, with low-income countries emphasizing pre-Copenhagen texts. Mexico hosted inclusive meetings in Cancun in 2010, restoring confidence in negotiations and leading to several decisions. The Cancun Agreements in 2010 restored confidence in negotiations and reiterated elements from previous agreements like the UNFCCC, Bali Action Plan, and Copenhagen Accord. They continued two tracks of negotiations for post-2012 commitments with nearly identical language on key points. Major elements included a long-term vision for greenhouse gas mitigation. The Cancun Agreements in 2010 emphasized the need for deep cuts in global emissions to limit the global temperature increase below 2\u00b0C. It also established the consideration of a more stringent goal to avoid exceeding a 1.5\u00b0C temperature increase. Additionally, it set up a Cancun Adaptation Framework and an Adaptation Committee to promote national adaptation plans and strengthen disaster risk reduction strategies. The work program may include options for risk management, such as a climate risk insurance facility. The Cancun Agreements in 2010 highlighted the importance of deep cuts in global emissions to limit the global temperature increase. It also established a framework for national adaptation plans and disaster risk reduction strategies. The current chunk discusses mitigation actions to be implemented by Non-Annex I Parties, reporting requirements for Annex I Parties, and the need for transparent reporting and international review of Non-Annex I Parties' mitigation efforts. The curr_chunk discusses national GHG inventories, mitigation actions, and support received, with a focus on domestic monitoring and international MRV. It emphasizes non-intrusive ICA of biennial reports and requests countries to reduce carbon losses from land uses, including REDD+, with international financing support. The AWG-LCA is urged to explore financing mechanisms for \"results-based actions\" to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation sustainably. Developing countries need support to manage forests sustainably and develop forest and carbon reference levels. \"Results-based actions\" must be fully measured, reported, and verified. Consideration of market-based mechanisms like emissions trading is suggested to help developed countries meet their GHG commitments. Developed countries commit to mobilize finance for adaptation, mitigation, technology, and capacity-building, with a goal of $100 billion annually by 2020. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) will play a key role in funding from various sources for vulnerable developing countries. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is governed by a board of 24 representatives from developed and developing countries to channel funding for adaptation and mitigation. A Trustee manages financial assets, while a Technology Mechanism supports actions on mitigation and adaptation. Intellectual property controversies are not addressed, and a review by the COP of the long-term global goal is scheduled to start by 2013. The Decision of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol noted GHG reduction pledges of Annex I Parties in accordance with the Copenhagen Accord. Japan, Canada, and others announced they would not participate in an extension of the Kyoto Protocol without GHG mitigation requirements for major emitters. The absence of commitments from top global GHG emitters was a concern among many delegations and stakeholders. The Cancun Agreements renewed confidence in the United Nations process, with many monitoring countries' follow-through on pledges. Some turned to other institutions like development banks and private fora as alternatives. The outcomes of Copenhagen and Cancun led to increased focus on national and sub-national efforts to address climate change. At COP 17 in Durban, Parties made notable decisions, including an agreement on GHG reduction pledges. At COP 17 in Durban, key decisions were made, including agreeing to a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and establishing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to negotiate a new agreement with legal force applicable to all Parties by 2015. Delegations from China, India, and other middle-income countries emphasized the importance of Annex I Parties meeting GHG reduction obligations and continuing the Clean Development Mechanism. Canada, Japan, and Russia insisted on including GHG reductions in any agreement. At COP 17 in Durban, key decisions were made, including agreeing to a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol and establishing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action to negotiate a new agreement with legal force applicable to all Parties by 2015. Canada, Japan, and Russia, along with other countries, emphasized the importance of including GHG reduction commitments from all major emitters in any agreement. The EU played a pivotal role in agreeing to a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol only if a clear roadmap to a new agreement with legally binding GHG reductions for all major emitters was set out. The Durban Platform mandate aimed to eliminate the classification of countries into \"developed\" or \"developing\" after 2020. The Parties also made decisions regarding the Green Climate Fund to finance mitigation and adaptation measures in low-income countries. The 18th session of the COP and the 8th Session of the CMP at the Doha Climate Gateway produced decisions on technology transfer, establishing reference levels for avoided deforestation, reporting safeguards for indigenous people, and increasing transparency in emissions-cutting actions. Agreements closed processes under the Bali Action Plan, leading to new paths forward under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. The Doha Amendment established a second commitment period for GHG targets from 2013-2020. Parties to the UNFCCC operate without rules on voting, requiring decisions to be made by consensus. Some Parties may block progress under the UNFCCC, as seen with the adoption of the Doha Amendment over objections. Questions arise on voting and consensus evolution. Past meetings aimed at reducing GHG emissions through various activities, including closing the gap to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C. Under the 2010 Cancun Agreements, over 85 Parties made non-binding pledges to reduce national GHG emissions, but comparing these pledges is challenging due to different base years and conditions. Work continues on clarification, comparability, and assistance to developing countries. Many non-Annex I Parties are working on low-carbon development strategies and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) addressing various policy objectives. The COP in Doha extended the work program on long-term finance for an additional year, addressing the \"mid-term gap\" from 2012 to 2020. Developed countries were encouraged to increase efforts to provide finance from 2013 to 2015. The Standing Committee on Finance (SC) was tasked with identifying options to mobilize financial resources. Industrialized countries were urged to provide resources to support mitigation, energy supply, water management, sanitation, and social development. Industrialized countries were urged to provide resources of at least the average annual level of the fast-start period for 2013-15. Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the EU Commission pledged $8.5 billion for the period to 2015. Developed countries delivered over $33 billion in fast-start climate finance between 2010 and 2012, surpassing the $30 billion pledge made in Copenhagen in 2009. Questions arose regarding the newness and additionality of the financing. The Standing Committee will continue to explore funding options like taxes on international aviation, shipping, and financial transactions for more reliable funding sources. The Standing Committee will prepare biennial reports on financial flows and methods for reporting. The Green Climate Fund progress was discussed, with some disappointment in operationalizing it. Parties selected Songdo, South Korea, as the host of the GCF. Discussions continued on the roles of the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network. Parties in the UNFCCC meetings discussed key issues such as intellectual property rights, 2015 agreement implementation, pre-2020 ambition for GHG emissions reduction, and the concept of \"balance\" between different priorities. Decisions in Doha included managing Loss and Damage through an institutional mechanism. Parties in the UNFCCC meetings agreed on a process to address \"loss and damage\" without assigning blame for past actions. They also discussed the roles of market and non-market mechanisms in the 2015 agreement. The Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol established a second commitment period with GHG reduction targets for 37 countries and the EU. Some countries, including Japan and Canada, did not agree to new targets, leading to disappointment over the level of ambition. The Doha Amendment established a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol with GHG reduction targets for 37 countries and the EU. Some Parties were disappointed with the low level of ambition for GHG reductions in this period. Only Annex I Parties with targets can transfer and acquire emission reduction credits from the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation. The Doha Amendment established a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol with GHG reduction targets for 37 countries and the EU. Parties can transfer and acquire emission reduction credits from the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation. Some countries are hesitant to acquire \"surplus\" AAUs as they do not represent real GHG emission reductions. Disagreements persist over the cancellation of unused AAUs from 2020. Observers note uncertainties in credit supplies and market demand under market mechanisms. Members of Congress may provide input to the Doha Platform negotiations aiming to avoid a 2\u00b0C increase in global average temperature. The United States faces pressure to provide financial assistance for GHG mitigation and adaptation in low-income countries. Congress may advise on the country's position at a world leaders' summit in 2014. Divergent views exist among Members of Congress on the importance of international cooperation for addressing climate change. The United States is a Party to the UNFCCC with certain obligations, drawing attention on the world stage. U.S. credibility is at stake due to unfulfilled commitments and lack of domestic consensus. The Executive Branch continues international negotiations while Congress provides oversight and input. The 113th Congress may engage on international aspects of addressing climate change, requiring cooperation to curtail human-induced climate change and facilitate successful adaptation. U.S. legislators seek assurance of comparable actions by major emitters before committing to actions. Key issues for Congress include compatibility with domestic policies, adequacy of appropriations, desirable form of agreement, and requirements for potential ratification and implementing legislation. Many Members of Congress are concerned about parity of GHG actions among major trading partners and potential competitiveness effects. Countries like China and Brazil are taking actions to reduce GHG emissions, while the US has implemented limits for motor vehicles and incentives for energy efficiency. The EPA has proposed carbon dioxide emission standards for electric generating units. The Administration believes existing programs, regulations, and expected EPA regulations will address GHG emissions. The Administration believes that with existing programs, regulations, and expected EPA regulation of GHG, the US will achieve its pledge of reducing emissions by at least 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. However, there are concerns that current measures may not be sufficient to achieve deep reductions in GHG emissions or increase carbon removal and sequestration rates. Major competitors are rapidly developing advanced energy technologies to reduce emissions and achieve additional policy objectives. Some countries are leading in inventing and manufacturing new technologies for global markets. Markets for alternative technologies are growing, while fossil fuel use may not decrease significantly in the next two decades. Congress may investigate how climate change policies impact national interests like technological competitiveness and energy security."
