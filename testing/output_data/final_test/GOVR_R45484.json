    "content": "The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) managed by FEMA is a key source of funding for federal domestic disaster relief programs outlined in the Stafford Act. It supports state, local, tribal, and territorial governments during overwhelming incidents, serving as a vital resource in the emergency management policy environment. Before the development of federal disaster relief programs, relief efforts were rare and sometimes considered unconstitutional. After the Civil War, domestic disaster relief became more common but was not seen as a federal obligation. The federal role in disaster response grew after World War II, with the establishment of standing programs and funding resources. Despite occasional concerns about management and budget impacts, federal disaster relief has remained popular and resilient. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is a key source of funding for general disaster relief programs, indicating the scope and taxpayer-funded aid provided. Understanding trends in federal government's role in disaster relief and associated costs is important for policy considerations. The report introduces the DRF, its funding history, and discusses congressional response and issues related to general disaster relief. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the primary source of funding for the federal government's general disaster relief program under the Stafford Act. Declarations of emergencies or disasters make governments eligible for assistance programs funded by the DRF. The federal government's disaster relief programs are funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) under the Stafford Act. In addition to FEMA, other federal departments like HUD, SBA, USDA, Army Corps of Engineers, and HHS play significant roles in disaster preparedness and recovery. The federal government's role in emergency response has evolved over the years, with a bottom-up approach starting from local governments and escalating to federal involvement when necessary. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) manages the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) which funds activities in five categories: 1. Major disaster declaration spending, including Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. 2. Pre-declaration surge activities for preparedness. 3. Emergency declaration activities. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) funds activities such as federal assistance for emergency services, Fire Management Assistance Grants for large wildfires, and ongoing disaster readiness and support activities. The DRF has been funded through its own appropriation within FEMA since FY1980. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has been funded through its own appropriation within FEMA's budget since FY1980. Initially under the heading \"Disaster Relief,\" it was later changed to \"Disaster Relief Fund\" in FY2012. DRF appropriations have historically been provided for general disaster relief, rather than specific presidentially declared disasters or emergencies. The funds are designated for carrying out the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, covering all past and future disaster and emergency declarations. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has been funded through its own appropriation within FEMA's budget since FY1980. The funds are designated for carrying out the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, covering all past and future disaster and emergency declarations. Previous versions of the appropriations language referenced general disaster relief rather than specific disasters. Specific disasters have been mentioned in appropriations, but funding was not directed to one disaster over others. Monthly reports on DRF spending are available on FEMA's website since P.L. 112-74 was enacted. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has been funded through its own appropriation within FEMA's budget since FY1980. Reports include information on DRF balances, actual and projected obligations for large-scale disasters, and estimates of the DRF balance through the current fiscal year. Federal disaster relief was historically minimal and narrow in scope, with a shift towards a federal role in disaster response emerging after World War II. The concept of a federal role in responding to disasters emerged, led by the President and funded in advance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was established in the 1970s, institutionalizing the federal role in disaster response, recovery, mitigation, and preparedness. The Stafford Act, funded by the Disaster Relief Fund appropriation, plays a central role in disaster relief programs. The Constitution provides little specific direction on disaster response. The federal government's involvement in disaster relief was limited in the early years of the country, with some ad hoc relief provided on a case-by-case basis from 1803 to 1947. Measures included refunds for goods destroyed in customs house fires and land grants for resettlement. Proponents argued the \"general welfare\" clause justified federal involvement, while opponents disagreed. Opponents of federal disaster relief argued that certain disasters were foreseeable and states should be prepared. They also believed it was improper for the government to use common funds for specific relief and that universal relief was unaffordable. Despite growing federal revenues, some in Congress still opposed federal assistance. President Grover Cleveland vetoed a bill in 1887 that would have provided aid to Texas farmers after a drought. President Grover Cleveland vetoed a bill in 1887 that would have provided $10,000 federal aid for seeds to Texas farmers after a drought. He argued that such appropriation was not warranted by the Constitution and believed that individual suffering should not be relieved by the government. Cleveland emphasized the importance of self-reliance and charity among citizens in times of misfortune, stating that federal aid could weaken national character. In 1881, Clara Barton founded the American National Red Cross (ANRC) to provide disaster aid from private funds. Legislation revised before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake tasked the ANRC with mitigating national calamities. President Theodore Roosevelt appealed for public assistance through the ANRC after the earthquake. The American Red Cross is best suited to handle relief efforts for the San Francisco earthquake. President Theodore Roosevelt urges the nation to donate to the Red Cross for organized and effective aid distribution. Private donations were the primary source of assistance, with Congress allocating $2.5 million for relief efforts. The American Red Cross played a major role in providing relief for victims of the San Francisco earthquake, with private donations exceeding $9 million in the years following the disaster. The Red Cross continued to lead nongovernmental disaster relief efforts as the federal government's role in disaster aid evolved over the 20th and 21st centuries. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the federal government became more involved in disaster relief. In 1947, P.L. 80-233 authorized providing surplus property for disaster relief. However, it was noted that this program would not be sufficient in the long term. Congress then made its first appropriation for general disaster relief in 1948. The President can provide emergency assistance for disasters in the US, upon certification by the governor of the affected state, with $500,000 available until June 30, 1949, to be spent as specified by the President. The President can provide emergency assistance for disasters in the US, upon certification by the governor of the affected state, with $500,000 available until June 30, 1949, to be spent as specified by the President. The state must enter into an agreement with a designated government agency to assure expenditure of funds for disaster relief purposes. Federal agencies are authorized to participate in emergency assistance within affected areas. The Disaster Relief Act of 1950 formalized the structure for federal aid in disasters, emphasizing the role of states in certifying the need and committing resources. Aid is meant to supplement state and local efforts, with federal agencies directed to participate in emergency assistance. Congress aims to provide ongoing assistance to alleviate suffering and repair essential public facilities in major disasters. The Disaster Relief Act of 1950 established federal aid in disasters, focusing on state certification of needs and resource commitment. Funding was initially limited to $5 million but later exceeded with supplemental appropriations. Annual appropriations were made available indefinitely, with a 2% cap on administrative expenses. The federal government's role in disaster relief expanded under the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. Under Kennedy and Johnson, federal disaster relief expanded with general programs in 1962, including territories and state facility repair grants. Specific legislation was still passed for major disasters like the Alaska earthquake, western floods, and Hurricane Betsy victims in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi in 1964 and 1965. Congress aimed to preserve the Disaster Relief Act of 1950 while providing special assistance for significant disasters. The Disaster Relief Act of 1966 replaced the 1950 Act, providing more assistance to public colleges and universities, and authorizing repairs to local public facilities. Some agencies felt the 1966 legislation was unnecessary. The Disaster Relief Act of 1969, enacted after Hurricane Camille, expanded the federal role in disaster assistance. The Disaster Relief Act of 1969 expanded federal disaster assistance, including temporary housing, food assistance, and funding for repair of public facilities. The Disaster Relief Act of 1970 consolidated previous legislation and made Camille-driven programs permanent. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 enhanced preparedness measures. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 improved preparedness measures by introducing emergency declarations for assistance in cases not meeting the \"major disaster\" threshold. The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988 renamed the Act as the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, allowing the President to declare emergencies for federal aid without a major disaster declaration. The Stafford Act and the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (DREAA) established minimum levels of assistance for disaster response and public facility repair. These laws, found in 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq., have been amended over the years, including through the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act and the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. The Stafford Act and the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (DREAA) set minimum levels of assistance for disaster response and public facility repair. The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-254, Division D) made amendments to the general disaster relief program. General disaster relief activities by the federal government are funded through supplemental and annual appropriations. Supplemental appropriations are requested ad hoc to address needs not covered in the annual process, while annual appropriations fund core government activities. Over 85% of net appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) come from supplemental appropriations. Annual appropriations fund government activities and are developed through the committee process. Continuing appropriations, known as \"CR,\" provide temporary budget authority based on the prior fiscal year to keep the government functioning. The Disaster Relief Fund originated from the Second Deficiency Appropriations Act in the 1940s, which provided funding for unanticipated needs during the fiscal year. The Disaster Relief Fund was established in the 1940s to address unanticipated needs during the fiscal year. In the 1980s, efforts were made to limit supplemental spending to cases of \"dire emergency,\" and in the 1990s, a special designation for emergency spending was created to adjust budget limits for necessary expenses. Congress used the emergency designation for disaster relief funding for the first time in FY1992. In FY1992, Congress used the emergency designation for disaster relief funding for the first time, providing budgetary flexibility in supplemental appropriations legislation. This practice continued until FY2000 when a clause appeared in the legislation. In FY2000, a clause in the appropriation allowed discretionary appropriations despite restrictions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 provided budget flexibility for disaster costs, leading to a decrease in supplemental disaster relief appropriations. General disaster relief funding began in 1948 and standalone authorization in 1950. Appropriations were provided for FY1952, FY1956-FY1958, and FY1962. Since FY1964, annual appropriations for general disaster relief have been provided each year, with only two exceptions. The adoption of a special designation for major disaster costs under the Stafford Act in the Budget Control Act of 2011 made it easier to allocate budget authority to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in the annual appropriations process. In the seven appropriations cycles since FY2012, more budget authority has been allocated for the DRF in annual appropriations. Since FY2012, more budget authority has been provided for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in annual appropriations measures than in the 63 prior cycles combined. FEMA now separates its annual appropriations request into major disaster costs and other DRF expenses. Major disaster costs receive a special \"disaster relief\" designation, allowing for adjustments to spending limits without triggering sequestration. The DRF also receives temporary replenishment from continuing resolutions. In FY1982, interim general disaster relief funding was provided in a CR through an \"anomaly,\" which allows for flexibility in funding during disaster response and recovery. FEMA may request special flexibility from OMB when responding to major disasters while operating under a CR. The Office of Management and Budget provides flexibility in funding through CRs for disaster response and recovery. An example is seen in the FY2019 CR, allowing funds to be apportioned for these activities. Appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund from FY1964 to FY2018 are shown, including gross and net totals. An inset graphic illustrates funding levels for outlier years and typical years. The figures display an increase in appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) starting in the 1990s, with significant rises in the early 2000s and again from FY2013. FY2005 remains the highest year for DRF appropriations, despite the surge in funding for the 2017 disasters. FEMA's budget justifications highlight that disaster activity is the primary cost driver for Major Disasters. The primary cost driver for Major Disasters is disaster activity, which influences year-to-year disaster relief appropriations. Other factors like programmatic changes and budget process adjustments may also impact funding. Federal involvement in disaster response occurs when lower levels of government are overwhelmed. The incidents leading to DRF expenditures vary in scale. The costs of disasters vary in scale, with some communities more prepared than others. The U.S. has seen an increase in billion-dollar weather-related disaster events, with 2016, 2017, and 2018 having 15, 16, and 11 such events respectively. As the population grows and severe weather patterns shift, disaster costs are expected to rise. The Disaster Relief Fund has seen sustained high levels of appropriations in recent years, with complex communities rebuilding disaster-damaged facilities and infrastructure. The contrast between the high-frequency, high-impact events of the 2010s and the relatively calm period of the 1980s is evident in the funding patterns of the DRF. The scope of federal disaster relief programs has evolved over time, incorporating assistance from specific disasters in the past. This evolution includes proactive declarations to reduce the impact of potential disasters and funding for disaster mitigation programs. The evolution of federal disaster relief programs now includes disaster mitigation programs aimed at reducing the long-term impact and cost of disasters. Programmatic expansions have led to increased general disaster relief appropriations, with demand growing rapidly as the number of declared disasters rose again. This evolution continues with reform legislation often following large disasters. The federal response to hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 drove interest in the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. Changes in budget processes have aimed to limit the impact of disaster relief spending, with budget controls implemented to ensure funding availability. Congressional budget processes have evolved over time, with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 placing limits on deficit and discretionary spending. The 1990 act established discretionary spending limits and allowed for emergency spending exceptions, including disaster relief appropriations. The Budget Control Act of 2011 reestablished spending limits and introduced a special designation for disaster costs. Funding for disaster relief is limited by a formula based on past spending, but there is no restriction on total disaster spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 adjusted the formula for emergency-designated spending on disasters, which will expire in 2021 along with discretionary spending limits. The impact on disaster relief appropriations seems to be more on the structure of total appropriations rather than the amount. The Congressional Budget Office noted a decrease in supplemental funding for disasters from the 1970s to the 1980s and an increase in the use of supplemental appropriations in the 1990s. In the 1990s, supplemental appropriations were increasingly used for disaster relief. Presidents Bush and Clinton requested less in regular appropriations than what was eventually spent on disaster-related accounts. Congress enacted supplemental appropriations during the fiscal year for emergencies, designated as emergency spending outside discretionary caps. Figures show an increase in funding provided in annual appropriations versus supplemental appropriations from FY2012. The addition of the disaster relief designation under the Budget Control Act enabled higher funding levels for disasters in annual appropriations bills, reducing the need for supplemental appropriations. Congress has provided emergency-designated relief for catastrophic disasters in supplemental appropriations. The responsibility for managing DRF appropriations has shifted among agencies as the general disaster relief function grew. The authority for directing federal agencies in disaster relief shifted among agencies over the years. In 1973, disaster relief powers were transferred from the Department of Defense back to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In response to the need for a more cohesive emergency management structure at the federal level, President Jimmy Carter created the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1978. This centralized disaster relief functions that were previously spread across multiple agencies into a single federal agency. In the early 1980s, FEMA's role included mobilizing federal resources, coordinating efforts with state and local governments, and managing public and private sector responses in disasters. FEMA justified its disaster relief appropriations by highlighting management, coordination, individual assistance, and public assistance activities. These activities were supported by various appropriations for FEMA. The FY1984 justification for disaster relief noted that budget requests were based on average projections, but actual requirements could change due to unpredictable factors. FEMA projected its needs for disaster relief in FY1986 based on past experience with disasters. The projected demand for disaster relief decreased from $350 million to $275 million between September 1984 and February 1985. In the late 1980s and 1990s, concerns about deficit spending led to budget controls being implemented. The FY1992 request highlighted the challenge of using past averages for disaster relief funding, as the FY1990 obligation exceeded the average annual amount by over $2 billion. The budget justification included a request for $30 million in savings through unspecified reforms. In FY1990, the obligation for disaster costs exceeded the average annual amount by over $2 billion due to Hurricane Hugo and the Lomo Prieta earthquake. The budget discussions in FY1994 and FY1995 justified the request based on prior-year activities and major disasters. FEMA used a five-year average for budget justifications in the 1990s and early 2000s, including disaster support costs. Certain very large disasters were excluded from the average, such as in FY1999. In FY1999, FEMA excluded costs of the Northridge earthquake and disaster support costs from the average. By FY2003, Northridge and the impacts of the 9/11 attacks were excluded. Justifications evolved in FY2009 to fund the five-year average obligation level for direct disaster activity, excluding extraordinary events. In FY2011, disasters costing less than $500 million were termed \"non-catastrophic disaster activity.\" In the 2010s, there was a debate on deficit spending and funding disaster relief programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 created caps on spending but exempted some costs of major disasters. A reserve fund of $500 million in FY2012 increased to $2 billion in FY2019 due to uncertainty around disaster relief availability. The reserve request increased to $2 billion due to uncertainty around funding for 2017 hurricanes. FEMA shifted to using a 10-year average for disaster relief requests. Congress explored ways to speed up fund availability for emergencies, including a proposal for a reserve fund. The Administration can request additional emergency funds through a supplemental appropriations bill, as seen in P.L. 103-75 for disaster relief in FY1993. The funds are contingent on an official budget request and designation as an emergency requirement. In FY2002, the Administration proposed a $5.6 billion National Emergency Reserve allowance for significant new disasters, alongside a request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) that included disaster support costs and funding for prior-year disasters. The concept of a budgetary reserve fund outside the DRF has been proposed in the past for broader non-Stafford disaster relief initiatives. The proposed $5.6 billion National Emergency Reserve allowance in FY2002 aimed to fund disaster relief programs at the Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior. The reserve would have been established in the budget resolution based on average annual spending on large events and allocated to appropriations subcommittees for emergency requirements. Criteria for allocation included events being sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and not permanent, with unused amounts rolling over to the next year. The proposal was not adopted, but the federal government plays a role in emergency management and disaster recovery, providing relief for individuals and support for mitigation efforts. The federal government plays a role in emergency management and disaster recovery, providing relief for individuals and support for mitigation efforts. FEMA's DRF appropriation funds a significant portion of the federal effort, supporting a defined role in disasters through separate laws and policies. Other departments and agencies like HUD, USDA, DOT, DOD, and SBA also fund various disaster relief and recovery programs. Despite the funding provided through the DRF, efforts have been made in the past to fund activities not covered by the current Stafford Act programs. The Stafford Act already covers a wide range of emergency management and disaster response activities. Making non-Stafford programs eligible for DRF funding could complicate funding streams and oversight. It would be more transparent for Congress to fund these programs through their existing appropriations. There is no special budgetary treatment for DRF appropriations, only for major disaster costs under the BCA. Shifting discretionary spending between appropriations subcommittees may not provide budgetary benefits as total spending remains the same. Reorganizing funding for disaster relief programs has been considered before but rejected by Congress. It is unclear if this would improve oversight or effectiveness of the programs. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) could be divided into separate appropriations for individual programs, potentially allowing for more specific congressional oversight but reducing flexibility. Funding requests are based on project spending in a fiscal year, with a 10-year average used for disasters costing less than $500 million. Previous administrations have requested additional reserve funds for disaster response and recovery. In the current budget environment, Congress is debating the appropriate level of reserves for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as disaster relief spending is expected to increase. While historically Congress has provided resources for major disasters as needed, discussions on deficit and debt may impact future funding decisions. The central question is whether disaster relief is a priority for the federal government. The federal government is debating the priority of disaster relief funding as costs increase. Budget controls have exceptions for relief efforts, but with the expiration of the Budget Control Act, limitations on disaster relief spending will change. The adjustment for disaster relief may have a significant impact as it has allowed funding without competing against other priorities. Congress may debate whether to limit disaster relief spending by changing the laws authorizing the programs funded by the DRF appropriation. Implementing relief limits or deductibles, larger nonfederal cost shares, or changes in the declaration process may be considered in more durable authorizing legislation rather than annually in appropriations legislation."
