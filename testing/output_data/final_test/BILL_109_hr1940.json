    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Melanie Blocker-Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act\". Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that affects many women during and after pregnancy. It can be categorized into three subgroups: \"baby blues,\" postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, and postpartum psychosis. \"Baby blues\" is characterized by mood swings, tearfulness, irritability, poor sleep, and vulnerability. Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders include symptoms like worsening baby blues, affecting 10-20% of new mothers. Postpartum psychosis symptoms involve losing touch with reality, paranoia, and rapid speech, striking 1 in 1,000 new mothers. Over 400,000 women experience postpartum mood changes annually, with baby blues affecting up to 80% of new mothers. The causes of postpartum depression are complex and unknown, possibly linked to hormone level changes after childbirth. Postpartum depression can be caused by various factors such as hormone level changes after childbirth, lack of support, marital strife, stressful life events, family history of depression, or previous history of depression or anxiety. It is a treatable disorder if promptly diagnosed and treated with a personalized regimen of care including social support, therapy, medication, and hospitalization when necessary. Unfortunately, postpartum depression often goes undiagnosed. Postpartum depression is often undiagnosed or untreated due to social stigma, the myth of motherhood, self-diagnosis challenges, shame, lack of understanding, and economic pressures. Untreated, it can lead to further depression, substance abuse, loss of employment, divorce, social alienation, self-destructive behavior, or suicide, impacting society through the infant's well-being. Child abuse, neglect, or death of the infant can have a significant impact on the infant's physical and psychological development, as well as disrupt the family. Research on postpartum depression and psychosis is being expanded and intensified by the National Institute of Mental Health. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the National Institute of Mental Health, is expanding research on postpartum depression and psychosis. Coordination with other national research institutes is required, and programs for postpartum conditions will be conducted or supported. The Director of the Institute will conduct or support research to expand understanding and find a cure for postpartum conditions. This includes basic research, epidemiological studies, diagnostic technique development, clinical research for new treatments, and information/education programs. Authorization of appropriations is provided for these purposes. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2006 through 2008.
