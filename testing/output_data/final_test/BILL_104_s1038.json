The Flat Tax Act of 1995 imposes a 15 percent tax on individuals' income exceeding the standard exemption amount. The standard exemption amount includes a basic standard exemption of $20,000 for joint returns and surviving spouses. The Flat Tax Act of 1995 sets standard exemption amounts for different filing statuses, including $20,000 for joint returns and surviving spouses, $15,000 for heads of household, and $10,000 for individuals not married or filing separately. An additional $5,000 exemption is allowed for each dependent with earned income. The Flat Tax Act of 1995 sets standard exemption amounts based on filing status. If the taxpayer's taxable year begins with an age below the exemption threshold, or if they have a child under 19 (or under 24 if a student), they qualify for exemptions. An inflation adjustment applies for taxable years starting in subsequent calendar years. For taxable years starting after 1997, dollar amounts in subparagraphs (B) and (C) increase based on the cost-of-living adjustment for that year. The adjustment is determined by the CPI for October of the previous year.

Excess deductions can be carried over to the succeeding taxable year, increasing the deductions specified in subsection (d) by the excess amount plus the product of the excess and the 3-month Treasury rate for the last month of the taxable year.
