    "content": "The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2013\" is cited as the short title. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include a new title VI on Debt Stabilization, introducing a debt stabilization process. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2013\" introduces budget targets for debt-to-GDP ratio, with a lower ratio for fiscal year 2016 compared to 2015 and a limit on exceeding the prior year's ratio in subsequent years. Reports are required annually on projected debt ratios, and the President's budget is influenced by these reports. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2013\" sets budget targets for debt-to-GDP ratio for fiscal years 2016 through 2024. The President's budget must include legislative recommendations if the ratios will be exceeded, and the Congressional budget resolution must include stabilization instructions if the ratios will be surpassed. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2013\" requires committees to recommend changes in laws to meet budget targets. It also prohibits considering budget resolutions that do not include directions to achieve the targets. Additionally, any changes in discretionary spending limits must be included in stabilization legislation. The \"Pay Down the Debt Act of 2013\" mandates committees to propose law changes to meet budget targets and prohibits considering budget resolutions without target directions. Stabilization legislation must include any changes in discretionary spending limits. If Congress fails to agree on stabilization legislation during a triggered debt stabilization process, bills increasing mandatory budget authority or decreasing revenues are not allowed in the House or Senate. The House of Representatives may waive a rule to consider a proposition subject to points of order. Debate on the proposition is limited to ten minutes per Member initiating a point of order and opponent. The question is decided without intervening motions except for adjournment or rising of the Committee of the Whole. Amendments to the question are allowed. The House of Representatives may waive rules for consideration, with debate limited to ten minutes per Member. Amendments are allowed, and the Senate requires a three-fifths vote to waive rules. The requirements of this title may be suspended during low growth if the Secretary of the Treasury notifies. The requirements of this title may be suspended if the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the President and Congress that the GDP growth is minimal or if a joint resolution deems the legislation harmful to the economy. This suspension does not apply to reporting requirements. If the Secretary of the Treasury notifies the President and Congress that GDP growth is minimal or a joint resolution deems legislation harmful to the economy, the requirements of this title may be suspended. After at least 6 months, the suspension will no longer be in effect for the first fiscal year. \"SEC. 602. CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS.\" If Congress fails to agree on a budget resolution by June 15 in a year when the debt stabilization process is triggered, any member can introduce a bill to achieve the budget target. The Congressional Budget Office will provide a cost estimate for the bill. The bill introduced must have a cost estimate for the specified time period and requires a certain number of cosponsors for expedited consideration in the House of Representatives or the Senate. The bill will be referred to a committee for reporting in the House of Representatives. The bill introduced must have a cost estimate and cosponsors for expedited consideration in the House or Senate. If a committee fails to report the bill promptly, it will be automatically discharged for placement on the calendar for consideration. The House must consider a motion to proceed with a bill within two legislative days after the proponent announces their intention. The motion must be made at a time designated by the Speaker and cannot be made after the House has already disposed of a similar motion. The previous question is automatically ordered on the motion without any other motions in between. The House must consider a motion to proceed with a bill promptly. If agreed to, the bill will be immediately considered without further motions. Points of order are waived, and debate is limited to 2 hours. Reconsidering the bill's passage is not allowed. In the Senate, the appropriate committees must report a bill without amendment within three session days after introduction. If the committee fails to do so or if the Senate is adjourning, the bill will be automatically discharged and placed on the calendar. After the bill is reported or the committee is discharged, any motion to proceed must be made within three session days. After a bill is discharged in the Senate, any Senator can move to consider it without debate. If the motion is approved, the Senate will immediately proceed to consider the bill without any interruptions. The bill will remain unfinished business until it is dealt with. The Senate limits consideration of a bill to 10 hours, with 1 hour for debatable motions. No points of order are allowed, and certain motions are not permitted. Amendments to the bill are prohibited. The bill referred to in paragraph (1) can have a provision struck from it during consideration in the Senate or the House of Representatives. If one House receives a bill from the other before passing its own bill, the received bill will supplant the original bill in the receiving House after the vote on passage. Title VI of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 introduces debt stabilization measures, including a definition of \"stabilization legislation\" aimed at reducing the deficit or public debt levels. This legislation requires certification by the chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate."
