    "content": "Since 1982, Congress has addressed concerns over equitable distribution of federal highway aid among states through rate-of-return guarantee provisions in surface transportation acts. Donor states, mainly in the South, Midwest, and fast-growing West, argue they receive less federal highway aid than their highway taxes contribute to the highway trust fund. They seek legislative remedies for fairer distribution. Since 1982, Congress has addressed concerns over equitable distribution of federal highway aid among states through rate-of-return guarantee provisions in surface transportation acts. Donor states, mainly in the South, Midwest, and fast-growing West, argue they receive less federal highway aid than their highway taxes contribute to the highway trust fund. They seek legislative remedies for fairer distribution. Donee states, on the other hand, have not opposed equity provisions but have resisted any reduction in their share of federal highway aid. Data from the Federal Highway Administration's annual Highway Statistics publication is used to designate states as either donor or donee based on their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA; P.L. 109-59) is set to expire on September 30, 2009, with proposals for reauthorization expected in the first session of the 111th Congress. A report discusses reauthorization issues, the donor-donee state debate, the Equity Bonus (EB) Program, and possible modifications for the upcoming reauthorization of SAFETEA. This report also highlights overarching issues related to the donor-donee state debate that may be of interest to Congress. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) under SAFETEA involves federal funds distributed to states for highway projects, with reimbursement for project costs after approval. FAHP includes formula and discretionary programs administered by FHWA. The discretionary programs under the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) are typically earmarked by Congress, while formula programs were created to fulfill policy needs. The Equity Bonus Program (EB) aims to make states' federal spending rates more uniform, but guaranteeing a designated return while keeping programs discretionary is challenging. Some highway needs, like federal lands roads, border infrastructure, trade corridors, and interstate maintenance, have federal aspects not fully addressed if Federal-Aid Highway Programs return to all states. Donor states have recognized the need for some states to receive a larger share of federal funds, as seen in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991. The equity program aims to address the issue of some states lacking resources to maintain their parts of the national highway network. Congress includes certain programs in the equity adjustments to improve states' rates-of-return while excluding others. The scope of the equity program, which has evolved since 1982, determines which programs are subject to these adjustments. The scope of the equity program is crucial for several reasons. The more inclusive the scope, the more costly the program, and earmarking programs within the scope does not provide new funds to states. Scope issues are further discussed in the \"Overarching Issues for Congress\" section. The highway account of the HTF is funded by various fuel taxes. The federal fuel taxes include taxes on gasoline, diesel, and special fuels, along with truck taxes such as a heavy tire tax, truck and trailer sales tax, and heavy vehicle use tax. Revenues from fuel taxes are distributed to different accounts, with most revenue collected from large corporations at the terminal level. The Treasury lacks data to allocate fuel tax to states accurately. FHWA estimates state shares by comparing fuel tax data to national consumption. This process determines each state's portion of national revenue from highway users. Estimates of total revenues from highway users are multiplied by state shares of gallons to calculate each state's payments to the highway account of the HTF. Data compilation takes time, usually over a year, resulting in two-year-old data used for attribution. Statistical issues affect rate-of-return guarantees, and using non-current data may skew state donor-donee ratios. State-by-state data may not always be accurate or up to date, and economic cycles can impact revenues and budgetary processes. The Equity Bonus and other equity adjustment proposals aim to achieve a specified \"share\" return based on two-year-old payments data. However, distribution equity is typically judged by Table FE-221 in the annual FHWA Highway Statistics Report, leading to criticism when dollar-for-dollar return data for the same year are released. Proposed revenue changes can also impact states' relative shares of payments to the Highway Trust Fund, potentially shifting donor states to donee states over time. The concern over federal spending benefiting other states' infrastructure more than their own has a long history, dating back to the 1800s. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin proposed a national network of canals and roads in 1808, but it was never funded due to opposition from Southern and New England states. Southern states believed federal grants would benefit other regions more, while New England states opposed funding for roads as they already had good infrastructure. In 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin proposed a national network of roads and canals, allocating $16.6 million for the project to address regional concerns. Despite this, the plan failed to gain sufficient support and federal government involvement in road building declined until the 1890s. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 established the first federal aid to roads program, sparking the modern donor-donee argument. Senator Lippitt presented a table to show the distribution of road aid among states, highlighting disparities in funding allocation. The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 established the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to fund the construction of the Interstate System (IS). Despite disparities in funding allocation among states, the bill was passed without major contention over the donor-donee debate. The 1956 Act led to the establishment of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) for funding the Interstate System (IS). The donor-donee issue was impacted by the HTF, attributing revenues from states' highway users to the fund. Concerns about fair return on tax payments resurfaced after the publication of Table FE-221 in the 1972 FHWA's Highway Statistics. The publication of Table FE-221 in the 1972 FHWA's Highway Statistics highlighted concerns about the state \"fair share\" issue regarding payments into and receipts from the Highway Trust Fund. Disparities in federal aid received for each dollar paid varied greatly among states, with Alaska receiving $8.34 and North Carolina receiving $0.52. The construction of the Interstate Highway System in the 1970s further emphasized the varying degrees of effort required by each state, potentially justifying the differences in state rates-of-return. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA; P.L. 97-424) aimed to address disparities in federal aid received by states from the Highway Trust Fund. It included provisions to ensure each state received a minimum core program allocation of 85% of its highway tax payments. Subsequent transportation reauthorization bills also made modifications to equity provisions to adjust rate-of-return guarantee percentages. The donor state argument is that each state should receive federal highway funding equal to the fees and taxes their highway users pay. Donor states feel they have been subsidizing the repair of donee state infrastructure, especially in the Northeast. They argue they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending like donee states. Southern and Western donor states claim they are fast-growing areas with equal or greater needs. Donee states argue for fairness in funding distribution. Donee states argue that fairness should not be separated from needs, citing reasons such as aging infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited financial resources. They also argue for federal funding for national highway networks and criticize donor states for not investing enough in their own infrastructure. Additionally, there is historical debate over the entitlement of states to a balance in federal tax distribution. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is the only federal program that considers rate-of-return criteria, which some argue constrains the federal government's ability to address changing national needs. Critics of the donor-donee framework point out that state and local priorities often take precedence over federal priorities, especially in terms of road improvements benefiting surrounding states. Some argue that construction projects funded by the 111th Congress should prioritize efficiency over equity, as construction companies from all over the nation bid for federally funded projects. The Congress faces challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless, especially with the Highway Trust Fund's revenue base being insufficient to fund both goals. The reauthorization bills for highway programs have included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares and provide equity between donor and donee states. This process requires increasing overall federal highway program size to meet donor state share requirements, which is costly. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA is the largest highway program, aiming to keep both donor and donee states content by giving more money to all states, especially donor states. The Equity Bonus program (EB) under SAFETEA is the largest highway program, costing $41 billion over five years. Finding funds for equity distribution is a major challenge in reauthorization. A guaranteed rate-of-return of 95% or higher may limit addressing federal transportation needs. Questions arise about the federal government's role as the minimum guarantee nears 100%. Some argue the need for a federal role is questionable if funds are only redistributed to states without federal involvement. The federal role in highway funding is questioned, as not all funding comes from highway user taxes. General fund money has been significant since 1956, leading to a ratio exceeding 1.0 for payments to the Highway Trust Fund. This inclusion of general fund money complicates the donor-donee debate, as highway user taxes do not support the general fund. This issue is discussed further in the \"Overarching Issues for Congress\" section of the report. Table 1 from the 2007 edition of Highway Statistics by the Federal Highway Administration provides data for the donor-donee state debate. It includes dollar amounts and percentages of payments into the fund and flow of funds from the Highway Trust Fund for FY2007 and FY1957 through FY2007. Ratios are calculated using dollar-in/dollar-out and percentage-in/percentage-out methods to determine donor or donee status. The dollar-in/dollar-out ratio is used to determine if a state is a donor or donee state based on payments made to and from the Highway Trust Fund. If a state receives as much as it pays in, its ratio is 1.0. If it receives less, the ratio is below 1.0, making it a donor state. If it receives more, the ratio is above 1.0, making it a donee state. For example, in FY2007, Alabama paid $680,178,000 into the fund and received $817,468,000 in apportionments and allocations. In FY2007, Alabama received $817,468,000 from the Highway Trust Fund, making it a donee state with a ratio of 1.20. Historically, Alabama has been a donee state with a cumulative ratio of 1.12 from FY1957 to FY2007. However, using the percentage-in/percentage-out calculation method, Alabama's ratio for FY2007 is 1.0, making it neither a donor nor a donee state. The authorization legislation has been drawing down the unexpended balance of the highway account, resulting in all 50 states receiving more than they paid in for FY2007. The excess of spending over payments at the national level for FY2007 was reflected in a ratio of 1.20. The cumulative grand total for FY1957-2007 was 1.12, mostly due to general fund monies spent over the life of the Highway Trust Fund. Some argue that the dollar-in/dollar-out method is misleading, as it can make donor states appear as donee states in years when the trust fund balance is drawn down. The \"relative ratio of apportionment and allocations to payments\" method calculates a state's percentage of total nationwide apportionments and allocations from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) divided by its percentage of total nationwide payments into the HTF. This generates a ratio to determine the true status of donor states compared to donee states. For example, in FY2007, Arizona had a ratio of 0.86 using this method, compared to a dollar-in/dollar-out ratio of 1.03. The percentage-in/percentage-out method calculates donor-donee status based on the ratio of what states receive to what they pay into the Highway Trust Fund. Even with recent fund drawdowns, the federal government has spent more on highways than has been paid in. The outcomes from differences in calculation methods for the Highway Trust Fund are significant. Using the dollar-in/dollar-out method for FY2007, all states had more money available than what their highway users paid. However, the percentage-in/percentage-out method showed 27 states below the 1.0 ratio. Historical data from FY1957-2007 had 13 states below the threshold. A 100% return on payments to all states is considered unrealistic due to administrative costs and certain programs not conducive to effective distribution based on state payments. Donor state advocates have pushed for changes during reauthorizations. During recent reauthorizations, donor state advocates have argued for a 95% rate-of-return for payments to the Highway Trust Fund. Some suggest a 0.95 ratio as a more realistic benchmark for donor state status. Using different calculation methods, the number of historical donor states varies. Economic conditions can shift states between donor and donee status, leading to counterintuitive results. For example, a donor state may become a donee state during an economic downturn. A donor state may become a donee state due to economic downturn reducing transportation tax revenues. Shifts in fuel use can also impact donor-donee status. The Equity Bonus Program is the current mechanism for equity in funding distribution. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a minimum return on their highway account payments, based on specific percentages for different fiscal years. The program applies to various transportation programs like the Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, and Surface Transportation Program. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees a minimum return on state highway account payments for various transportation programs like the Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, and other specific programs. These programs, along with the money allocated to them, are collectively known as the \"scope\" of the Equity Bonus Program. The program only applies its percentage guarantee to funding within its scope, leading some to view the guarantee as partial. The Equity Bonus Program guarantees a minimum return on state highway account payments for various transportation programs. The program includes \"hold harmless\" provisions for certain states based on specific criteria. Hold harmless states under SAFETEA include Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and others. The Equity Bonus Program sets annual percentage funding floors for certain states, ensuring they receive a minimum return on state highway account payments. The program includes \"hold harmless\" provisions for specific states like Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and others. The EB calculation process involves a series of calculations to bring each state's total apportionment into compliance with program provisions. The Equity Bonus Program establishes minimum funding floors for certain states based on their contributions to the highway account. Each state's share is calculated by their percentage of total payments, with a guaranteed 92% share. The dollar floor is determined by multiplying each state's average annual apportionments and High Priority Project amounts by 120%. This ensures that each state receives a minimum level of funding for FY2008. In FY2008, the Equity Bonus Program ensured that each state received a minimum level of funding by calculating the amounts needed to raise them to their required dollar floor levels. The total program size needed to bring all states up to their required share was $37,998,923,126, with a total EB distribution of $9,235,351,320. The Equity Bonus Program distributes funds to states through three categories: exempt from obligation limitation, subject to special no-year limitation, and subject to formula limitation. In FY2008, the EB distribution accounted for almost 25% of total apportionments, with funds allocated to core formula programs based on each program's apportionment ratio. The programmatic distribution increases amounts apportioned to core formula programs, with the first $2.639 billion going to the Surface Transportation Program. The Equity Bonus Program distributes funds to states through three categories, accounting for almost 25% of total apportionments in FY2008. The distribution of EB funds had unexpected consequences for some state DOTs and Members of Congress, reducing funding under core federal formula programs and negating penalties designed to discourage certain activities. These issues are discussed in more detail in the \"Overarching Issues for Congress\" section of the report. The donor-donee debate persists in the reauthorization of the program. The donor-donee debate in federal surface transportation programs reflects differing views and needs of stakeholders. Reauthorization bills since 1982 have included equity adjustments to distribute funds to states. The current issue of HTF sufficiency may impact historical funding solutions. Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $64.7 billion shortfall in the highway account of the HTF over the next seven years. The highway account of the HTF needs $64.7 billion in new tax revenues or general fund transfers to remain solvent. The major issues regarding the EB program are funding size and source. If highway user tax revenues are insufficient, the Treasury general fund may be the expected source. President Obama's budget proposes to make the entire DOT budget discretionary for scorekeeping purposes. The proposal to make the entire DOT budget discretionary for scorekeeping purposes is uncertain in its impact. Concerns have been raised that this change could lead to more general fund spending on highways. Changes to the equity provisions have been frequent in reauthorization bills, with potential increases in the guaranteed rate-of-return percentage and scope expansion favored by donor states. This would require a growth in program size or a reduction in funds going to donee states. The proposal to change the EB program could involve increasing the guaranteed rate-of-return percentage, which may require a growth in program size or a reduction in funds going to donee states. Congress could consider strategies such as phasing in the increase gradually, but this may lead to dissatisfaction among large donor states. Retaining, modifying, or eliminating \"hold harmless\" provisions could also be options to bring the percentage guarantee closer to 100%. To increase the percentage guarantee closer to 100%, weakening hold harmless provisions may be necessary. These provisions are crucial for retaining votes, especially in the Senate. There is a discussion about simplifying the EB calculation process by using total annual payments to the highway account to determine program size, which could align state payments more effectively. Using total annual payments to the highway account to determine program size could align state payments more effectively, but it may have disadvantages such as setting a ceiling on spending, forcing reductions in core program authorizations, and potential revenue declines leading to difficult decisions for Congress. One way to reduce the cost of the EB is to limit the number of programs covered by the guarantee, based on states' percent share return on payments to the HTF. This approach could ensure each state receives a certain percentage rate-of-return, such as 95%, by weighting all programs accordingly. Congress may need to adjust the scope of federal-aid highway programs to stay within budget. The EB proposes apportioning program funds to states based on their percent share of contributions to the HTF. This would ensure a guaranteed percentage share return without the need for an expensive equity program. 5% of revenues would fund program administration and other specific programs. The proposed funding approach for transportation programs would integrate a rate of return minimum without a separate equity program. This would simplify the process compared to the existing EB program, allowing Congress to set program sizes without impacting core programs. However, this approach may limit federal funding for policy priorities and could lead to inefficiencies in distribution. The distribution of funds based on a rate of return for transportation programs may lead to inefficiencies and opposition from states receiving less funding. There have been efforts to increase the minimum return percentage, but only a phased-in increase to 92% was enacted during the SAFETEA reauthorization cycle. In the current fiscal environment, it is doubtful that an equity program like SAFETEA EB could provide a 95% return. The minimum rate of return guarantee can only be maintained or modestly adjusted unless the EB framework is replaced or altered. Statistical analysis of the EB and proposals can be challenging due to uncertainties in future revenue and funding allocations. In the uncertain fiscal environment, the impact of changes in the Equity Bonus (EB) on equity guarantee calculations is unclear. The FHWA has the expertise to project these impacts, but future projections are based on uncertain assumptions. Congress could opt to eliminate the equity provision and rely on program formulas for highway fund distribution. Modifying core formula programs to weight them at or near 100% of states' contributions could be a solution, but it may face opposition from donee and donor states. The reauthorization debate on surface transportation funding has broad policy implications, including the federal-state partnership, program purpose, and budgetary issues. The partnership has evolved since the 1916 Act, with funding apportioned to state highway departments for construction and maintenance. The 50% federal match for highways reflected the equal partnership between state and federal governments. The Federal Aid-Highway and Federal-Aid Revenue Acts of 1956 greatly increased authorizations for the Interstate Highway System over 13 years, with a 90% federal match for construction. The Highway Trust Fund was established to support the system through raised transportation taxes, which were supposed to revert back in FY1973. Despite declining obligations for the Interstate System after 1967, increased obligations for non-interstate highway programs offset the difference. The federal match for non-interstate programs increased from 50% to 80% over the years, shifting financial commitment towards the federal government. States gained more control over spending choices under the FAHP. With SAFETEA, federal financial role increased, but state control over spending decisions also grew. The EB distribution diluted the impact of program apportionment. The enhanced federal financial role and increased state authority over spending decisions under SAFETEA have raised policy questions about the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP). Some argue that federal decision-making has become too limited, leading to calls for converting FAHP to a revenue-sharing or block grant program. State complaints about federal requirements adding to project costs and donor state dissatisfaction with funding rates further complicate the debate. The existing federal highway programs are popular with state DOTs despite donor state displeasure with rates of return. Most states have become donee states due to more spending than revenue. Donor state advocates argue for a percentage-in/percentage-out method to determine donor-donee status. The percentage-in/percentage-out method is used to determine highway funding distribution, with donor states arguing for fair share. Some suggest eliminating federal highway program and transferring responsibilities to states. Critics question the validity of this method in projecting funding amounts for donor states. The percentage-in/percentage-out calculation for highway funding distribution may perpetuate the donor-donee controversy. Significant amounts of money have been transferred from the Treasury's general fund to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) over the first 50 years of its existence, with some funds coming from general taxpayers rather than highway user fees. Transfers were made for various reasons, including compensating the HTF for lower ethanol tax rates. The HTF faces sufficiency problems and may receive general fund support for the FAHP. The use of general funds raises concerns about the donor-donee argument based on user fees. Some states like New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut are donor states for general fund expenditures despite being long-term HTF donee states. Congress approved $8.017 billion in general fund appropriation in September 2008. In September 2008, Congress approved $8.017 billion from the general fund for the highway account of HTF. The debate on how to credit general fund money across states could be significant. The American Recovery and Investment Act of 2009 allocated $27.5 billion from the Treasury general fund for federal-aid highway programs, with initial plans to distribute based on FY2008 obligation limitations. The distribution of stimulus highway funds in FY2008 was debated in Congress, with the Senate bill not reflecting an Equity Bonus distribution. Ultimately, P.L. 111-5 split the funds 50/50 between the House and Senate methods. The surge of general fund money for stimulus funding may prompt a reexamination of donor-donee calculation methodology. The debate over the distribution of stimulus highway funds in FY2008 led to a split of funds between the House and Senate methods in P.L. 111-5. The high rate of return percentage and broad program scope could limit federal programmatic responses to needs, especially for transportation infrastructure programs. The Equity Bonus distribution and donor-donee calculation methodology may need reevaluation due to the influx of general fund money for stimulus funding. The debate focuses on whether infrastructure needs inherently federal should be excluded from the Equity Bonus (EB) scope. Congress could redefine scope to designate programs serving federal purposes as inherently federal, leaving other programs within EB scope. Donor state advocates worry federal programs could reduce their rates of return. Earmarking federal-aid highway funds has increased recently. Earmarking federal-aid highway funds has increased recently, with almost $22 billion earmarked in SAFETEA, representing roughly 11% of the total contract authority. The issue of earmarking within and outside the scope of the Equity Bonus (EB) program emerged after SAFETEA passage. Earmarks were categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line,\" with informal terms used to distinguish programs subject to EB provisions. The SAFETEA Act includes earmarked programs listed in section 1104 (a)(2), with the High Priority Project program (HPP) being the only below the line earmark program. HPP received almost $15 billion in funding and allows Members of Congress to prioritize projects through the authorization process. However, HPP earmarks do not increase a state's total funding due to the Equity Bonus (EB) Program, which distributes funds across formula programs to ensure all states receive a minimum share. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program ensures all states receive a minimum share of funding, leading to states with fewer HPP earmarks receiving larger EB distributions. States with high HPP earmarks receive smaller EB distributions, resulting in a similar total amount received regardless of HPP funding levels. States relying more on HPP funds have less funding available for federal-aid highway core formula programs. In SAFETEA, above-the-line earmarked programs like National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement, Projects of National and Regional Significance, and Transportation Improvements provide additional funding to state DOTs without affecting core formula programs. Policymakers may need to decide on the allocation of funding for above or below the line programs in the upcoming reauthorization legislation. Money lost due to penalties, such as those for transferring Highway Bridge Program funds, is often replaced with Equity Bonus (EB) funds, ensuring a balance in funding distribution. Congress could consider adjustments to the earmarking process in future legislation. The EB funds balance out penalties, potentially affecting states' guaranteed share. There is a debate on applying a guarantee to payments to the mass transit account of the HTF, which receives revenue from the federal fuel tax. The Federal Transit Administration relies heavily on the mass transit account for funding. The Federal Transit Administration's funding comes from the mass transit account and treasury general funds, distributed to individual transit authorities by formula and earmark. States with large cities and fixed guideway transit systems receive more funding, with California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Pennsylvania receiving 53% of total transit obligations. Some states argue that FTA programs unfairly favor urbanized states, leaving their own transit needs unmet. Supporters of FTA programs argue that funding is unfairly distributed, with a focus on urban mass transportation. They believe that transit needs in rural areas are often ignored due to the emphasis on densely populated areas for efficiency. The debate over a transit minimum guarantee involves shifting funding to less populated areas, potentially leading to inefficiencies. Some argue it could allow states to redirect transit funds to highways, while others believe it would penalize urban areas that have invested in transit systems. Transit advocates stress the national benefits of urban mobility. The transit minimum guarantee debate may not have widespread support in current reauthorization cycles, but it could be an issue in the next cycle. California and New York could be major losers, as some states benefiting from the transit program also consider themselves highway donor states. A major funding shift would require significant changes to federal transit programs and could overturn the compromise of 1982. The Transportation Empowerment Act proposed devolving most of the federal highway program role to the states, with only certain programs remaining federal. This approach aimed to address the donor-donee controversy and reduce the federal gas tax over a four-year phase out period. The Transportation Empowerment Act proposed devolving most of the federal highway program role to the states, with only certain programs remaining federal. A four year phase out of 12 cents of the federal gas tax would have corresponded with the declining federal role. States would have had the option of replacing the declining federal taxes with gas tax increases of their own, giving them the freedom to spend on their own roads and transit systems as they saw fit. Despite some support, the proposal did not obtain broad support from many governors, state legislatures, or state DOTs, who were wary of the political implications of pushing large replacement gas tax increases through their state legislatures. Some argue for devolution to states in the highway program, questioning the federal government's role as a tax collector. Limited interest in changing federal role currently. Devolution seen as solution to funding distribution issues. STAA authorized increased funding for Federal-Aid Highway. STAA (P.L. 94-424) authorized increased funding for the Federal-Aid Highway system for FY1983-FY1986. It included a provision to ensure each state received a minimum allocation from core FHWA programs based on tax payments into the highway account of the HTF. These \"equity adjustment\" allocations could be used for core highway programs. The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) authorized the Federal-Aid Highway Program for FY1987-1991, retaining the 85% minimum allocation and revising the calculation to include allocated programs. Minor changes were made in the criteria for awarding discretionary program grants. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) reauthorized surface transportation programs, including Federal-Aid Highway Programs, for FY1992-FY1997, making significant changes to program structure and funding formulas. ISTEA expanded the mission of federal highway programs to include air quality, alternative transportation, and historic preservation, while also focusing on completing the remaining portions of the interstate system. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) reauthorized surface transportation programs, making changes to program structure and funding formulas. The Interstate Construction Program was renamed the Interstate Discretionary Program, with funds now a set-aside within the new National Highway System Program. Equity Adjustment Provisions were included to ensure a more equitable distribution of funds. ISTEA included provisions for a more equitable distribution of federal funds to states, such as the 90% guarantees for minimum allocations and new minimum payments guarantee. Donor states were identified based on projected contributions to the Highway Trust Fund compared to apportionments received. The ISTEA included provisions for a more equitable distribution of federal funds to states, such as the donor state bonus, hold harmless provision, and reimbursement for Interstate segments. Each state received additional funding to reach a set percentage, and $2 billion was authorized for reimbursement for Interstate System segments built without federal assistance. During the reauthorization debate for the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), dissatisfaction with equity provisions in the Interstate Construction Program led to challenges to the program paradigm. The debate included various views on donor-donee state issues, regional roles, and the federal government's role in completing the Interstate Highway system. Regional Conflict Over Funding Under ISTEA, Southern and Mid-Western States were mainly donor states while Northeastern, Pacific coast, and large Western States were mostly donee states. Donee states were generally satisfied with the distribution under ISTEA and supported legislation that adhered to the funding formulas. Donor states formed \"STEP-21\" coalition to guarantee a 95% return on their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. Regional differences outweighed party affiliation in the debate. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works saw regional differences trump party affiliation, with Republican leaders supporting the \"ISTEA works\" bill while others backed the Transportation Empowerment Act for devolving federal highway program roles to states. The latter bill proposed a phased reduction of the federal gas tax and maintaining only the Interstate System federally. The proposal to reduce the federal gas tax and shift highway program roles to states did not receive broad support due to concerns about political implications. The equity changes in TEA-21 were limited due to a significant increase in overall funding levels. The TEA-21 minimum guarantee included equity provisions to narrow the donor-donee divide, with a 40% increase in overall funding levels. States were guaranteed a percentage share of various programs, with a minimum 90.5% return on tax contributions to the highway account. The TEA-21 minimum guarantee ensured states received a minimum 90.5% return on their tax contributions to the highway account. States like Ohio were guaranteed a certain percentage share of contributions and a minimum share of apportionments for core formula programs. If a state's base share was below 90.5%, it was adjusted upward by \"squeezing\" down other states' percentages. Each state was guaranteed at least $1 million as part of the minimum guarantee. The TEA-21 Minimum Guarantee ensured states received a minimum 90.5% return on their tax contributions to the highway account. Each state was guaranteed at least $1 million as part of the minimum guarantee, with the lowest percent share used to determine total program funding needed for each state. The District needed a total FY2003 program size of $27.76 billion to achieve a 0.3860% share. Over $6 billion in Minimum Guarantee program funding was required. The first $2.8 billion of funds were administered as STP funds, with the remaining amount distributed to core programs. TEA-21 introduced changes to various transportation programs, including the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP), National Highway System (NHS), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ). Formula changes were made to benefit donor states, such as reducing the weight given to each state's share of Interstate Maintenance Program and creating a third weighted category based on annual contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. The Surface Transportation Program (STP) apportionment formula was also adjusted under TEA-21. The STP apportionment formula under TEA-21 was weighted based on state share of tax payments into the highway account of the HTF, total lane miles of Federal-aid highways, and total vehicle miles traveled on Federal-aid highways. The NHS apportionment formula was weighted by a state's share of diesel fuel used on highways. The resolution of the donor-donee debate was relatively amicable despite minor changes benefiting donor states. The TEA-21 authorization provided large increases in highway funding for all states by shifting revenues from the gas tax to the HTF in 1997. This alleviated concerns of donor states, but as TEA-21 neared expiration in FY2003, the donor-donee state issue resurfaced. A \"firewall\" was created to prevent highway account funds from being used for non-highway purposes. The TEA-21 Act ensured that spending from the highway account matched annual revenues, with Revenue Aligned Budget Authority distributed to maintain balance. This impacted funds available for the minimum guarantee program, funded on a \"such sums as necessary\" basis."
