    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 requires state and local agencies with peace officers to report data on all stops annually to the Attorney General. Deadlines for issuing reports vary based on the number of peace officers employed by each agency. The Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 mandates state and local agencies to report data on all stops annually to the Attorney General. The reporting must include details such as the time, date, location, reason for the stop, result of the stop, any warnings or citations issued, arrests made, and characteristics of the person stopped. The peace officer's actions during a stop must be reported, including asking for consent to search, conducting a search, seizing property, and collecting information for reporting. If multiple officers are involved, only one needs to report the required information. State and local law enforcement agencies are prohibited from disclosing personal identifying information of individuals stopped, searched, or subjected to property seizure. Data reported will be made public, except for the peace officer's unique identifying information, which will only be released as permitted by state law. The Attorney General, in consultation with stakeholders, will issue regulations by January 1, 2017, for data collection and reporting on racial profiling. Regulations will specify data to be reported and ensure uniform reporting practices across agencies. Regulations should align with federal data collection programs. All data and reports related to this section are public records open to public inspection. The definition of \"peace officer\" is limited to specific law enforcement agencies. \"Stop\" is defined as any detention or search conducted by a peace officer. Section 13012 of the Penal Code is being amended. Section 13012 of the Penal Code is amended to require the annual report to include statistics on offenses, characteristics of criminals and delinquents, and actions taken by law enforcement and judicial agencies, including those in the juvenile justice system. It also covers actions taken regarding minors in the juvenile court system. The annual report must include statistics on citizen complaints received by law enforcement agencies, including those alleging criminal conduct or racial profiling. The statistics should be broken down by type of profiling alleged and disposition categories such as \"Sustained.\" The annual report must include statistics on citizen complaints received by law enforcement agencies, including those alleging criminal conduct or racial profiling. The statistics should be broken down by type of profiling alleged and disposition categories such as \"Sustained.\" Additionally, the reports on complaints should be categorized as \"Exonerated,\" \"Not sustained,\" or \"Unfounded,\" and made available to the public for each individual law enforcement agency. The department is responsible for interpreting statistics and presenting information to guide legislative policies and actions related to criminals, delinquents, and crime prevention. The report must include statistics that are comparable to national criminal statistics published by federal agencies. The Racial and Identity Profiling Board (RIPA) analyzes statistics on complaints annually and incorporates them into its report as required by law. The reports do not reveal the identity of peace officers. The commission will provide guidelines and training for California peace officers on racial and cultural differences, emphasizing understanding and respect in law enforcement duties. The course of basic training for peace officers in California includes instruction on racial, identity, and cultural diversity to promote mutual respect and cooperation. The training development involves consultation with relevant groups and individuals. Definitions for terms like \"disability,\" \"gender,\" \"nationality,\" \"religion,\" and \"sexual orientation\" are provided, and \"cultural diversity\" encompasses various issues. \"Racial\" is defined as \"race or ethnicity,\" and \"stop\" is defined in relation to the Government Code. The Legislature acknowledges the risks faced by California law enforcement officers and appreciates their dedication to public safety. Racial or identity profiling is condemned as it undermines constitutional principles, community policing efforts, and erodes trust in law enforcement. The Legislature condemns racial or identity profiling as it undermines constitutional principles, community policing efforts, and erodes trust in law enforcement. Additional training is required to address discriminatory practices based on skin color, national origin, religion, gender identity, housing status, sexual orientation, or mental or physical disability. The enactment of this section does not resolve how the state should address racial or identity profiling. (e) \"Racial or identity profiling\" is the consideration of actual or perceived characteristics like race, color, ethnicity, and more in law enforcement activities, except when described in a suspect. Activities include traffic stops, searches, and arrests.\n(f) Peace officers are prohibited from engaging in racial or identity profiling. Every peace officer in the state must undergo expanded training on racial or identity profiling, as prescribed by the Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training. The training will be evidence-based and focus on patterns, practices, and protocols related to racial or identity profiling, including implicit bias. The curriculum will be developed in consultation with the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board and will cover topics such as identifying key indices and perspectives on racial, identity, and cultural differences in local communities. The curr_chunk discusses the negative impact of biases on law enforcement, the history of civil rights movements, obligations of peace officers in preventing discrimination, perspectives of local groups on police-community relations, and the prohibition of profiling. The curr_chunk introduces the requirement for peace officers in California to undergo refresher courses on racial, identity, and cultural trends every five years. It also establishes the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) to address profiling issues in law enforcement. The Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) includes representatives from various organizations such as the California Public Defenders Association, California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association, Peace Officers Research Association of California, and others specializing in civil rights, criminal justice, and policing. The Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) consists of religious clergy members and other members appointed by the Governor, President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and Speaker of the Assembly. Annually, RIPA analyzes data, law enforcement training, collaborates with law enforcement agencies, and conducts research on biases and law enforcement tactics. The Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) issues annual reports with detailed findings on racial and identity profiling, along with policy recommendations for elimination. The reports include disaggregated statistical data for each law enforcement agency and are posted on RIPA's website and the Department of Justice's website for public access. The first report was due by January 1, 2018. Annual reports by the Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) contain detailed findings on profiling and policy recommendations. The reports include statistical data for each law enforcement agency and are accessible to the public. The Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board (RIPA) holds three public meetings annually in different regions of California to discuss profiling and reforms. RIPA advises the Attorney General on stop data regulations and has uncompensated members who serve four-year terms. RIPA decisions require majority agreement, and cochairpersons are elected yearly. Each year, RIPA elects two cochairpersons. If the Commission on State Mandates finds this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts according to specified government code sections."
