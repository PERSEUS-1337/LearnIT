    "content": "In 1992, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish a federal water reclamation, recycling, and reuse program known as Title XVI. Administered by the DOI's Bureau of Reclamation, the program funds projects in western states and Hawaii. Interest in the program has grown due to cost-competitive reuse and desalination technologies. Program implementation has been contentious, with differing stakeholder views. DOI has taken steps to improve implementation, raising questions for Congress on consistency with priorities and the need for legislative attention. The Title XVI program, established in 1992, funds water reclamation projects in western states and Hawaii. Congress is considering authorizing additional projects and how to allocate funding among existing projects. The 111th Congress has not responded to Reclamation's funding criteria proposal or introduced legislation to change the program since 1996. Legislation enacted since 1996 has contemplated programmatic changes for the Title XVI program. Recent Congresses have held oversight hearings on projects and funding, with a backlog of $630 million for authorized projects. The Obama Administration has opposed additional project authorizations due to oversubscription but has supported the program, including water reuse initiatives and implementation under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The DOI has issued guidelines and funding criteria for the Title XVI program under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The program aims to streamline feasibility processes and prioritize project funding, with details on individual project statuses provided in the report. The Bureau of Reclamation's water reuse program, authorized in Title XVI of P.L. 102-575, supports projects in the 17 western states and Hawaii. It provides financial and technical support for the design and construction of facilities to reclaim and reuse wastewater or other impaired waters. Congressional authorization is required for permanent projects, while demonstration projects can be constructed under general authority. Title XVI of P.L. 102-575 authorizes water reuse projects in western states and Hawaii. Over 50 permanent projects have been authorized by Congress, with many located in areas prone to water conflicts. Projects have been authorized in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Hawaii. As of November 5, 2010, 53 Title XVI water reuse projects have been authorized, primarily concentrated in California. The total federal funding for these projects is estimated to be nearly $1.2 billion, with a backlog of approximately $630 million in 2010. Despite stimulus spending, the backlog has continued to grow. The Title XVI backlog has grown despite stimulus spending, with 42 out of 53 authorized projects funded by Congress. Reclamation has completed funding for 16 projects, with federal funding obligations nearly complete for three more projects. Nearly 80% of the projects have received some Title XVI funding. The light blue circles represent authorized projects that had not received Title XVI funding by the end of FY2010, with a total maximum design capacity of 747,558 acre-feet of water annually for all Title XVI authorized projects as of 2006. The Title XVI backlog continues to grow as project authorizations outpace funding. The Title XVI backlog continues to grow as project funding is outpaced. As of May 25, 2010, total funding reached $531 million, with $135 million from ARRA. Congress authorizes Title XVI projects more frequently, but outstanding authorizations are at $630 million. Concerns include program costs, impact on funding for other activities, and cost-effectiveness of water production. Issues fall into two categories: program implementation and structure. Issues related to the Title XVI program fall into two categories: implementation and structure, as well as broad policy issues. Reclamation has developed detailed evaluation criteria, but these documents are not official rules or regulations and lack criteria for competitively ranking or selecting projects. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes a lump sum allocation of $20 million based on proposed funding criteria. The Administration's budget request includes a lump sum of $20 million to be allocated based on proposed funding criteria for the Title XVI program. Stakeholder views on program scope and project assistance will impact decisions on policy issues, program criteria, project evaluation, and funding allocation. Funding for Title XVI projects is typically allocated by Congress through a separate line item in Reclamation's budget account. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes a lump sum of $20 million for the Title XVI program, which is allocated through a separate line item in Reclamation's budget account. This funding process has been a topic of debate in Congress, with efforts to restructure it to align more closely with other water resource project funding methods. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes a $20 million lump sum for restructuring Title XVI funding to align with other federal programs. There have been debates over the years about the allocation of funds for Title XVI projects, with differences in priorities between Congress and Reclamation. The budget request for FY2011 includes $29.0 million for Title XVI, with $9.0 million designated for specific projects and $20 million for Reclamation to allocate based on criteria focused on reducing existing diversions. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes a $20 million lump sum for restructuring Title XVI funding to align with other federal programs. There are debates over the allocation of funds for Title XVI projects, with differences in priorities between Congress and Reclamation. The proposed funding criteria aim to reduce existing diversions and address water supply issues in a cost-effective manner. It is uncertain if appropriators will grant the lump sum program funding to be allocated by Reclamation or if the authorizing committees will approve the proposal, which would shift Title XVI towards being managed as a program rather than individual projects. The USDA and other federal agencies have criteria, regulations, and competitive processes for selecting and funding projects. Congress appropriates money annually for these programs, with project funding allocated based on eligibility and selection criteria. The proposed criteria aim to manage nonfederal project sponsors' funding expectations and improve transparency in project selection. The Administration's proposal aims to improve transparency in project funding selection for the Title XVI program, potentially reducing Congress's role in appropriations decisions. Questions arise regarding the need for new program guidance and how different project phases should be funded. The Obama Administration opposes authorizing new Title XVI projects without completed feasibility studies or environmental reviews. Congressional authorization bills for such projects have been introduced, raising questions about funding prioritization and equity in project funding. The Obama Administration opposes authorizing new projects without completed feasibility studies or environmental reviews, raising questions about funding prioritization and equity in project funding. The House Natural Resources Committee and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee historically rarely authorized traditional water resource projects before completed feasibility studies. Questions arise regarding the effect of Reclamation's implementation of D&S on project feasibility study approval delays, the adequacy of guidelines and D&S for decision makers, and the balance between a streamlined process and taxpayer interests. Concerns also exist about authorizing projects before feasibility study completion leading to infeasible, non-cost-effective, or unproductive projects. The debate over the appropriate federal role in water supply development, specifically for municipal and industrial purposes, remains a key policy issue related to Title XVI projects. The question of balancing congressional oversight with executive branch decision-making in project selection is also a significant concern. The role of Reclamation in municipal water development projects, which are the focus of Title XVI projects, is under scrutiny due to outdated congressional policies from the Water Supply Act of 1958. The federal government's role in funding water supply development for municipal and industrial purposes, particularly through Title XVI projects, is a debated issue. Historically, federal water resource agencies focused on irrigation projects, while state and local governments played a primary role in M&I water supply development. This contrasts with the federal involvement in other water resource management areas like irrigation, flood control, and navigation. The federal government's role in funding water supply development for municipal and industrial purposes has evolved over time. While historically state and local agencies were responsible for M&I water supply development, Congress has occasionally provided federal funding for projects tied to meeting water quality standards or assisting rural areas. Additionally, in recent years, Congress has authorized DOI participation in water supply projects for small and rural communities. The federal government's role in funding water supply development has evolved over time. Congress has passed bills for site-specific projects and established the Title XVI program, but has not re-articulated long-standing policy since the 1958 Water Supply Act. There is a question about what qualifies as a Title XVI project and whether it should fund projects already covered by federal funding. Increasing demand for water, including for new energy development, is leading to conflicts in water management, especially in the western states. Pressures are mounting to reconsider federal support for water supply projects in \"reclamation\" states. Challenges to existing water management practices are influenced by demand factors like population growth and supply factors such as water source contamination. Drought conditions, climate change concerns, and fiscal climates in many states have exacerbated these challenges. The current fiscal climates and climate change concerns have led to increased interest in new water supply development and diversification. Pressure on water supplies in the West is likely to drive demand for federal assistance, potentially leading to an increase in Title XVI projects. Congressional concerns over water reuse as a draw on limited federal funds have also grown. The 111th Congress has yet to address Title XVI program management through legislation. The 111th Congress has not addressed Title XVI program management through legislation. If changes were to be considered, Congress would need to address questions regarding the urgency of water scarcity in the West, federal interest in the problem, efficiency of funding Title XVI projects, and other cost-effective options to promote water reuse. The 111th Congress has not addressed Title XVI program management through legislation. Congress would need to address questions regarding the urgency of water scarcity in the West, federal interest in the problem, efficiency of funding Title XVI projects, and cost-effective options to promote water reuse. The 111th Congress has not addressed Title XVI program management through legislation. Questions remain about funding efficiency, federal cost-share policies, program alignment with other federal activities, and the potential impacts of promoting water reclamation and reuse on water scarcity and growth in water-scarce areas. The future of Title XVI program management raises questions about federal investment in water-scarce areas and the allocation of funding. Reclamation's new criteria aim to address these issues, but Congressional approval is still pending. Growing water demands suggest continued interest in federal support for water reuse projects. Stakeholders may seek different solutions based on their perceptions of program problems. The report discusses the importance of Title XVI program criteria, project evaluation, and funding issues. There have been multiple amendments to Title XVI since 1992, with a total of 53 authorized projects. As of FY2009, active projects were yielding 245,111 acre-feet of water annually. Eleven projects remain unfunded. Eleven Title XVI projects remain unfunded, with Reclamation surveying sponsors to determine their status. Some projects have received federal funding from EPA and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Projects authorized before 1996 had total costs ranging from $152 million to $690 million. The federal share for Title XVI projects was limited to $20 million per project in 1996, with post-1996 projects ranging from $700,000 to $20 million. The three most expensive projects were authorized before the cap was implemented."
