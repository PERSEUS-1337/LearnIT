    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 12201.02 of the Welfare and Institutions Code states that the state maximum SSP grant for individuals will be increased annually to equal 112 percent of the federal poverty level. Section 1432 of the Health and Safety Code prohibits discrimination or retaliation against individuals who file grievances or complaints in long-term health care facilities. Entities that own or operate long-term health care facilities are prohibited from discriminating or retaliating against individuals who participate in investigations related to the quality of care. Violations of this provision may result in a civil penalty of up to $25,000, to be assessed through the administrative process outlined in Chapter 2.4 of the code. An attempt to expel a patient from a long-term health care facility or any discriminatory treatment of a patient who has filed a grievance within 180 days may be presumed as retaliation by the licensee. An attempt to terminate employment or discriminate against a healthcare worker who has filed a grievance may be considered retaliation by the licensee if it occurs within 120 days of the complaint. Discriminatory treatment of healthcare workers includes actions like discharge, demotion, suspension, or unfavorable changes in employment terms. Presumptions affecting evidence burden are outlined in the code. If a civil penalty is $1,000 or less, it is enforced as a class \u201cB\u201d violation without trebling the penalty. Penalties over $1,000 are treated as class \u201cA\u201d violations without trebling. Willful violations result in an infraction with a fine up to $20,000. Licensees face either a civil penalty or criminal fine. Long-term health care facilities must post notices about the right to request inspections, including anonymity and protection against retaliation. An employee or health care worker discriminated against in employment is entitled to reinstatement, reimbursement for lost wages/income, legal costs, and any court-deemed remedy under applicable laws. A discriminated medical staff member is entitled to reinstatement, lost income reimbursement, legal costs, and any court-deemed remedy. \"Legal costs\" include attorney's fees, litigation costs, and expert witness fees. \"Long-term health care facility\" refers to facilities defined under Section 1418. The section defines \"complainant\" as someone who files a complaint and clarifies that it does not limit other legal remedies. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
