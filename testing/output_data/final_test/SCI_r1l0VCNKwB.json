This study specifically addresses improving SR results for compressed JPG images found on the Internet. The proposed SR structure includes two components and a cycle loss to generate high-quality SR images from C-JPG files. This research offers a new approach to recovering information from C-JPG images, different from traditional noise elimination methods in SR models. The study focuses on enhancing Super Resolution (SR) results for compressed JPG images. It introduces a new approach using cycle loss in SR models to generate high-quality SR images. Experimental results demonstrate outstanding performance compared to existing methods in deep learning Super Resolution (DL-SR) algorithms. In this paper, a lossless SR model is proposed to improve the quality of images from low-quality compressed JPG inputs. The deterioration in C-JPG images poses a challenge for SR processing, especially in real-world conditions. The focus is on addressing the C-JPG SR problem to achieve better performance in high-level computer vision tasks. The C-JPG SR problem is a challenge due to the deterioration in images. Existing methods struggle with noise distribution and irrelevant LR-HR image information. Traditional interpolation methods are commonly used for LR images, requiring a reverse mapping in SR training. The C-JPG SR issue involves challenges with image deterioration and noise distribution. Traditional SR methods struggle with generating high-quality images from low-quality C-JPG inputs. Specialized analysis by K\u00f6hler et al. (2017) highlights the limitations of current approaches. However, SR models like SRGAN, EDSR, and RDN have shown success in learning from fixed down-scaled kernel image pairs. This study aims to create a more complex dataset by incorporating JPG format LR images. In this study, a more complex dataset is created by adding JPG format LR images to the training data. The training process consists of two components: a JPG recovering stage and an SR generating stage. The first part focuses on recovering LR images from their compression counterparts, while the second part learns the mapping between LR images and HR images. This integrated pipeline achieves super-resolution representation between C-JPG and HR images. In this study, an integrated pipeline for super-resolution representation between C-JPG and HR images is achieved through two sub-models. The research introduces a universal SR method for generating SR images from C-JPG inputs, surpassing traditional SR models. It also proposes a recovering model and an integrated SR model training pipeline with two-level data and a new loss function. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in surpassing traditional SR models. Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a widely researched task with various methods developed to achieve high-quality results. External and internal models are created based on different datasets and learning algorithms to improve SR image generation. Deep learning methods, particularly DL-SR, have revolutionized single image super-resolution (SISR) by focusing on learning the relationship between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images. The introduction of end-to-end DL-SR networks like SRCNN by Dong et al. (2014) has significantly outperformed traditional methods in peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR). Subsequent models such as FSRCNN (Dong et al., 2016) have further improved image generation capabilities. Various novel models have been developed for image generation in DL-SR, including FSRCNN, VDSR, SRGAN, EDSR, RDN, DBPN, ESRGAN, and RCAN. These models aim for higher accuracy and more photo-realistic results by extracting crucial features from low-resolution images. For example, VDSR utilizes global residual learning and multi-scale training, while SRGAN incorporates residual blocks inspired by ResNet and combines MSE and GANs loss functions. The EDSR model enhances photo-realistic super-resolution image generation by removing batch normalization, using L1 norm loss, and increasing channel numbers. However, RDN surpasses EDSR in accuracy by utilizing densely connected architectures. RCAN further improves accuracy by incorporating residual in residual blocks and channel attention mechanisms, making it the leading method in accuracy for single image super-resolution. Some researchers aim to build lightweight and accurate super-resolution models like CARN, s-LWSR, and FALSR. These methods reduce parameters and operations while maintaining decent performance. CARN uses cascading mechanisms and group convolution parts to improve feature representation. s-LWSR introduces a flexible SR model with additional information, while FALSR automatically searches for a lightweight and accurate SR model. These methods focus on solving the super-resolution problem using LR-HR image pairs. ZSSR proposes an unsupervised Zero-shot SR method to address the issue of undefined scale-kernel and degradation functions in real-world scenarios. It generates derived HR and LR images to learn the mapping between them using a simple CNN network. CincGAN introduces a cycle-in-cycle structure to tackle blind SR problems by processing inputs with noise to generate intermediate LR images with less noise. These LR images are then restored and scaled up with the help of a pre-trained SR model. In this paper, the authors propose a new method called UMGSR for super-resolution image generation. They introduce multi-gram losses to improve image quality and address the issue of low-quality LR images, such as low-quality C-JPG images commonly found on the Internet. The proposed method aims to generate realistic SR images by learning from raw image data. The SISR problem is formulated as y = F(x) + z, where F is the SR mapping and z represents irrelevant information like noise and blur. Most SISR models are trained on standard datasets with LR images directly downsampled from HR images, assuming z equals zero. The authors propose a new method, UMGSR, for super-resolution image generation, addressing low-quality LR images like low-quality C-JPG images found on the Internet. The SISR problem is redefined as y = F(x + w), with w representing missing information due to compression. The model consists of two stages: JPG recovering and SR generating, with specialized networks for each stage. Stage I focuses on rebuilding details from LR(C-JPG) to LR(normal) images. The authors designed a specialized network to learn the mapping between low-quality LR(C-JPG) and LR(normal) images. They compared the LR(C-JPG) and LR(normal) images, showing that the C-JPG version had lower quality but took up less storage space. The visual quality of the C-JPG image was less pleasant compared to LR. The C-JPG image, despite being smaller in size at 12K bytes, displays lower quality with mussy details like irregular shapes and blurry edges. This affects the visual contrast and can lead to an unpleasant feeling. To address this, an effective SR model, s-LWSR, is used to recover details in LR(C-JPG) images. The main body of the SR model involves stacking residual blocks to extract information intensively. Experiments have shown the powerful learning ability of this architecture in s-LWSR. The final stage includes a convolution layer to transform middle layers into final RGB layers, resulting in visually satisfactory LR images with smooth artificial traces. The SR generation benefits from the improved LR input quality derived from C-JPG in stage I. Additionally, a state-of-the-art SR method called s-LWSR is utilized in stage II for complementary tasks. The s-LWSR method leverages multi-level information from the front half of the model, stacking chosen layers to transfer low-level information to high-level layers. The upsampling stage in the model includes two subpixel interpolation layers for 4\u00d7 scale-up tasks. The s-LWSR method utilizes multi-level information and upsampling layers for scale-up tasks in SR generation. The framework includes JPG recovery and SR generation tasks with specific loss functions for each stage. In this paper, the s-LWSR method is described, which involves scale factor s and different components in the final loss function for C-JPG SR. Cycle loss, inspired by unsupervised style-to-style learning like CycleGAN, is used to maintain content while changing style features. The final loss function combines L1 losses with equal weight, including bicubic interpolation downsampling. The implementation details of the model are then discussed. The implementation details of the model include using DIV2K dataset for training with LR, HR, and C-JPG LR images. Data augmentation is applied by rotating and flipping images. C-JPG LR images are processed with different compression levels using pillow package in Python and MatLab2018. The model is trained using data augmentation by rotating and flipping images. The Adam optimizer is applied with specific parameters, and the model is trained over a set number of iterations. Evaluation is done using PSNR and SSIM on the Y channel of transformed YCbCr space. The recovering stage is crucial in the model, as shown in an ablation study. Removing it results in undesired artifacts and decreased PSNR and SSIM. A single model struggles to simultaneously solve SR and recover C-JPG images due to a large variance in supervised information among middle layers. The recovering stage is essential for the model, as demonstrated in an ablation study. Removing it leads to artifacts and lower PSNR and SSIM. The SR model is trained with clean intermediate inputs and HR pairs, showing that denoising alone is not as effective as our model in recovering details from compressed JPG images. In this paper, a lossless SISR model for low-quality C-JPG images is proposed, utilizing a redefined C-JPG SR pipeline with two integrated functional stages and cycle loss for consistency. The model outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods in learning representations for C-JPG SR tasks. Future work includes exploring other computer vision tasks with C-JPG image inputs."
