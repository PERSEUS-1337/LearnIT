    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Yellowstone Protection Act\". Congress finds that the January 22, 2001, rule phasing out snowmobile use in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway was based on law, scientific study, and public input. An environmental impact statement showed that snowmobile use negatively affects air quality, wildlife, and visitor enjoyment. The National Park Service concluded that snowmobile use should be restricted. The National Park Service found that snowmobile use violates its mission to manage parks for future generations and is inconsistent with environmental regulations. To maintain winter visitor access, the Park Service plans to use snowcoaches as an alternative mode of transportation. The final rule states that a snowcoach transit system in Yellowstone would reduce adverse impacts on park resources, improve public safety, and enhance public enjoyment in winter. Snowmobiles produce a significant amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions in the park, while their noise disrupts natural sounds at popular attractions. In Yellowstone, snowmobile traffic disturbs wildlife and causes carbon monoxide poisoning among park employees. Scientists have warned about the negative impact on the park's original vision of preservation for future generations. National Park Service regulations aim to prevent wildlife disturbance from snowmobile use. In Yellowstone, snowmobile traffic causes carbon monoxide poisoning among park employees. Rangers were issued respirators for the first time in park history. Public engagement in the environmental impact study process was extensive, with 4 opportunities for comment and 22 public hearings held. Public support for phasing out snowmobiles in National Parks has been growing, with over 70,000 comments received by the agency. A 4-to-1 majority favored the rule in early 2001, and more recently, 82 percent supported the National Park Service decision to phase out snowmobile use. Beginning on the date of enactment, the Secretary of the Interior must enforce the final rule to phase out snowmobile and snowplane use in Yellowstone National Park, the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, and Grand Teton National Park, as published in the Federal Register on January 22, 2001. The Secretary cannot alter or override any part of this rule."
