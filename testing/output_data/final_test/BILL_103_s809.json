    "content": "OPEN CONTAINER LAWS. The new section \"Sec. 161. Open Container Limitations\" amends Chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code. It states that the Secretary will withhold 5 percent of funds from states that allow open alcoholic beverage containers in motor vehicles on public highways. This does not apply to charter buses. The State is lawful in prohibiting open alcoholic beverage containers in charter buses with more than 10 passengers. Funds withheld before September 30, 1997, will remain available. Funds withheld before September 30, 1997, will remain available for apportionment to the State under specific conditions. Funds withheld under this section will remain available for apportionment to a State until the end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year for which the funds are made available. No funds withheld after September 30, 1997, shall be available for apportionment to the State. The Secretary shall apportion withheld funds to a State if the State enacts a compliant law. The apportioned funds will be available for expenditure until the end of the succeeding fiscal year. Funds apportioned under certain sections shall remain available for three fiscal years. Unobligated sums will lapse or be made available for projects. Noncompliance results in funds being withheld. The funds withheld under this section will lapse if a State does not have a compliant State law in effect. For funds withheld under section 104(b)(5), they will lapse and be used for projects according to section 118(b). Definitions for \"alcoholic beverage\" and \"motor vehicle\" are provided in this section. The term 'open alcoholic beverage container' and 'passenger area' are defined in this section. A conforming amendment is made to the analysis for chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code. \"Open container limitations apply to alcoholic beverages in passenger areas.\""
