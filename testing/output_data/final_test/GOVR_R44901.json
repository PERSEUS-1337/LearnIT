Committee rules govern actions in committee proceedings and are enforced by members. Senate cannot enforce committee rules on the floor later. Committees may have traditions affecting procedures. Committee rules govern actions in committee proceedings and are enforced by members. Senate cannot enforce committee rules on the floor later. Committees may have traditions affecting procedures, such as restrictions on second-degree amendments during markups. An overview of Senate rules related to committees is provided, followed by tables summarizing each committee's rules on various aspects like meeting day, hearing requirements, quorum, and investigations. Selected unique provisions in committee rules are also highlighted in Table 4. Committee rules are essential for governing actions in committee proceedings and are enforced by members. The Senate's standing rules provide specific requirements that each committee must follow, with rules generally published in the Congressional Record by March 1 of each Congress. These rules serve as a background for understanding each committee's individual rules governing key activities. Committee rules are crucial for governing actions in committee proceedings and are enforced by members. The Senate's standing rules require committees to publish their rules in the Congressional Record by March 1 of each Congress. Committees and subcommittees can meet during Senate sessions or recesses, with specific meeting time restrictions. Each committee must designate a regular meeting day and announce hearings at least one week in advance, with the option to waive this requirement for \"good cause.\" Committee meetings can be called by three members with a written request to the chair, who must schedule it within seven days. Meetings are generally open to the public unless closed for specific reasons. Information about meetings must be provided for inclusion in the Senate's schedule system, and public hearings may be broadcasted at the committee's discretion. Committees and subcommittees may set rules for media broadcasting. A vote in open session is needed to close a meeting. A quorum must be at least one-third of the membership, with a majority physically present for voting. Recordings of open hearings must be made public within 21 days. Committees can conduct hearings and make recordings available to the public online. Proxy voting may be allowed with certain conditions. Committees have the authority to investigate and issue subpoenas. The minority can select witnesses for hearings. The minority can select witnesses for hearings, and committees may report original bills and resolutions. A majority of the committee must be present to report a measure favorably, and written reports are not always required. Table 1 summarizes each committee's rules on meeting days, notice requirements, and witness selection. Committees often incorporate Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 4(a), which requires a week's notice for hearings unless there is good cause. Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 4(d) allows the minority to select witnesses for hearings. Rule XXVI, paragraph 4(d) allows the minority to call additional witnesses in certain situations, with some committees having their own rules that expand on this provision. Table 2 outlines committee rules on hearing and business quorums, as well as requirements for filing amendments before a markup. Some committees mandate the presence of a minority party member for conducting business. Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 7(a) requires a majority of the committee to be physically present to report out a measure or matter, known as a \"reporting quorum.\" Committees can set lower quorum requirements, but not less than a third of membership for other business. Some committees include additional requirements in their rules, such as having a member from each party in the reporting quorum. Committees must file first-degree amendments before meetings to allow negotiation and preparation. Some committees share filed amendments in advance for review. Proxy voting is not allowed for committee votes. Committees may not rely on proxy votes for absent Senators. Some committees allow proxy votes on motions to report, but these votes cannot count towards a reporting quorum. \"Polling\" is a method to assess committee positions without physical meetings, but cannot be used to report measures. Committees cannot use proxy votes for absent Senators, but some allow proxy votes on motions to report. Polling can be used for internal housekeeping matters, not to report measures. Senate Rule XXVI does not address committee consideration of presidential nominations, but some committees have specific rules for nomination actions. Committees may require nominees to provide information and establish timetables for action. Some committees also specify if nominees must testify under oath. Some Senate committees lack specific rules for investigations and subpoenas, but this does not prevent them from conducting such actions. Certain committees have unique provisions not found in other committee rules, as summarized in Table 4."
