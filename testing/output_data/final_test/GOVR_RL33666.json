There were extravagant claims about a \"new economy\" and easy ways to make money through equity investments, despite warnings from economists about a speculative bubble. Alan Greenspan, then-Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was also cautious about the market's situation. In the late 1990s, the stock market experienced rapid growth, especially in high-tech stocks, with the NASDAQ seeing a significant increase in prices. Alan Greenspan warned against \"irrational exuberance\" in 1996. By 2000, stock prices began to decline, leading to a recession in March 2001. The market crash was attributed to a bubble caused by psychological factors, speculation, or error rather than economic fundamentals. The housing market showed signs of a potential crash similar to past economic downturns, with house prices doubling since 1997 and increasing over 50% since 2003. While the house price index has not yet shown a national decline, recent data suggests a possible decrease in prices. Housing sales and residential investment have declined, along with rising mortgage delinquency rates, leading to financial turmoil in August. The rise in delinquency rates led to financial turmoil in August 2007 due to subprime mortgage-backed securities. There is debate on whether the housing market is in a bubble, with some arguing it is a bargain investment. Economists and policymakers are divided on whether the Federal Reserve should have raised interest rates to address the stock market bubble in the 1990s. The end of the housing boom has intensified the debate on responding to asset bubbles. The debate surrounds the Fed's ability to identify and address asset bubbles, which are seen as deviations from standard economic theory in competitive markets. This debate is crucial for Congress to oversee the Federal Reserve effectively. The \"efficient markets\" theory argues that bubbles cannot occur in competitive markets due to producers increasing supply when price exceeds marginal cost. Equities and homes markets fit the criteria of perfect competition, with millions of buyers and sellers, abundant information, and rapid price adjustments. Despite uncertainty in forecasting future values, standard theory rules out bubbles forming solely from this factor. The efficient markets theory argues that bubbles cannot occur in competitive markets due to producers increasing supply when price exceeds marginal cost. Standard theory predicts that systematic errors will not be made by market participants overall, and less skilled participants will eventually be driven out of the market. This rules out a large and protracted bubble similar to the one that developed in the 1990s. Economists argue that bubbles can occur in markets due to irrational behavior like herd mentality, overconfidence, and biased self-attribution. People tend to project past results into the future without considering fundamentals, leading to bubbles. As high returns persist, the belief in future returns grows, fueling the bubble. In the 1990s, equity prices rose due to fundamental changes like productivity growth, reduced inflation, and increased risk appetite. Financial professionals justified the price increases with optimistic assumptions, even though these changes did not fully justify the stock price surge. The book \"Dow 36,000\" argued that stock prices had not risen high enough based on fundamentals, contributing to the bubble. The curr_chunk discusses the fundamental explanations for the rise in house prices, including lower mortgage rates, innovations in mortgage markets, and perception of homes as desirable investments. However, there is a limit to how far these explanations can justify price increases, as seen in the significant price increase despite minimal changes from 2003 to 2006. The curr_chunk discusses the factors influencing housing prices, such as supply and demand dynamics, costs and benefits of ownership, and the difficulty in identifying a housing bubble. It highlights that price increases should reflect changes in these factors to avoid being considered a bubble. The housing market differs from the stock market in that supply responds to price changes with a lag and is constrained by a lack of open land. Factors like high transaction prices, lack of short selling, and buyers' limited expertise make the housing market less competitive. Projecting a home's future price is easier than a company's future earnings due to the tangible asset. The housing market is influenced by ownership costs compared to rents, with no national market but rather localized bubbles. Economic theory struggles to predict bubbles accurately, making it challenging for policymakers. Economist Randall Kroszner, a Fed governor, notes that historical bull markets were comparable in strength. Asset price bubbles do not directly impact GDP but influence economic behavior. For instance, rising stock prices may lead to increased investment spending by corporations. Similarly, developers may respond to higher housing prices by increasing the housing stock beyond market demand. Investment spending increased in response to rising equity prices, with a focus on the high-tech sector. After the stock market crash in 2000, investment spending declined. Residential investment also grew alongside house prices, reaching $597 billion in 2005. The housing boom led to a rise in residential investment, reaching $597 billion in 2005. Bubbles may cause a misallocation of resources, leading to inefficiencies in the economy. The dot-com bubble of the 1990s resulted in excessive investment in high-tech companies, while Japan's misallocation problem contributed to economic stagnation after the bubble burst. Economists debate the impact of the \"wealth effect\" on aggregate spending when asset prices rise and fall. Evaluating this effect is challenging due to the interconnected nature of asset prices and consumption. Some effects attributed to wealth, such as mortgage refinancing, are actually results of monetary easing. Additionally, attributing a wealth effect to housing is complex as it can make sellers richer while making buyers relatively poorer. The wealth effect on aggregate spending is debated by economists, with challenges in evaluating its impact due to the interconnected nature of asset prices and consumption. A Federal Reserve economist calculated that a stock market decline from 2000 to 2002 would reduce GDP growth by 0.36 percentage points, but this estimate is small and consumption grew more rapidly than GDP during the decline. Policymakers focus on the overall economy's ability to generate full employment rather than the fortunes of a specific industry. The importance of bubbles in the economy depends on their impact on overall health. If bubbles lead to recessions or financial crises, policymakers have a strong incentive to prevent them. A bursting bubble could cause difficulties in the financial system, leading to insolvency or illiquidity for large firms. Financial firms are interdependent, and trouble in one firm could spill over to others, disrupting the smooth functioning of the financial system. The Great Depression was caused by a crisis in the banking sector, leading to long-lasting financial problems. The Fed has since intervened to prevent financial unrest from spreading. In 2007, a liquidity crunch occurred due to falling house prices and rising mortgage rates, impacting mortgage-backed securities. The Fed restored liquidity, but the long-term effects on the financial system and economy remain uncertain. The 1929 stock market crash coincided with the Great Depression, but economists believe the severity was due to a contraction in the money supply and widespread bank failures. Japan's economic stagnation in the 1990s was attributed to tight monetary policy, banking sector problems, and structural rigidities. Policymakers' reactions to bubbles are crucial in influencing economic activity. The stock market crash in 1929 coincided with the Great Depression, attributed to a contraction in the money supply and bank failures. Japan's economic stagnation in the 1990s was due to tight monetary policy, banking sector issues, and structural rigidities. Recent experiences show that a bubble's impact on the economy may not be severe, as seen in the stock market decline in 1987 and 2000. The Federal Reserve's response, like easing monetary policy rapidly, can mitigate the effects of a bubble burst on the economy. Other factors may also contribute to causing a recession alongside the bursting of a bubble. The bursting of a housing bubble could have uncertain effects on the economy, as historical examples show sharp declines in local housing prices. It is difficult to judge the severity of the impact, especially since house prices are still rising. Historical examples show sharp declines in local housing prices during economic contractions, such as in California, New England, and Texas. It is uncertain whether these price declines caused economic difficulties or were a result of them. For instance, the Texas episode in the mid-1980s was attributed to a sharp decline in energy prices. Residential investment spending has fallen sharply in cases where housing prices stalled, but it accounts for a small share of GDP and cannot single-handedly cause a recession. The turmoil of August 2007 may lead to a recession if accompanied by broader financial distress or a significant wealth effect on consumption. Bubbles do not directly impact output or inflation as they are changes in \"paper wealth\" with no effect on goods and services prices. Measures like the CPI or GDP deflator are meant to capture changes in goods and services prices, not assets. Asset price increases may be a predictor of future inflation, but should not be included in measurements of actual inflation. Including asset prices in inflation measurements is debatable. While equity prices may not have a strong case, housing prices, which account for a significant portion of CPI, should be considered. The CPI currently imputes the cost of owner-occupied shelter based on rental prices, which does not reflect the impact of rising house prices on the cost of shelter. The cost of owner-occupied shelter is imputed in the CPI from rental prices, known as the \"rental equivalence method.\" However, during a housing bubble, the cost of owner-occupied shelter may diverge from rental properties, suggesting a more direct measure of housing costs is needed for accurate inflation measurement. The \"user-cost method\" provides an alternative approach by measuring the direct costs of providing shelter. The primary cost of housing for most homeowners is mortgage costs, which have been affected by lower mortgage rates and higher house prices in recent years. Comparing BLS rental equivalence measurement of inflation to inflation based on mortgage costs shows that shelter inflation rose faster than 5% per year in certain years when house prices and mortgage rates both increased. Shelter costs experienced deflation from 2001 to 2003 despite rising housing prices due to falling mortgage rates. The CPI measure of shelter costs has remained relatively stable, never exceeding 4.1%. In contrast, inflation based on mortgage costs surged while shelter inflation declined to 2.4% in 2004 and 2005. The user-cost method shows extreme volatility in price changes due to interest rate fluctuations, leading to large changes in mortgage payments. The Bureau of Labor Statistics prefers the rental equivalence measure in the CPI for its smoother signals of inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve's mandate is to maintain full employment and stable price inflation. It has the discretion to choose its strategy, with the ability to adjust short-term interest rates as its main tool. Giving the Fed additional goals could weaken its ability to achieve any specific goal. Therefore, a shift towards using monetary policy to address asset bubbles would only be justified if it was deemed as important as the current mandated goals. The growing chorus of critics called for the Fed to raise interest rates to address the stock market bubble in the late 1990s. However, the Fed's response was cautious, focusing on stability of prices of goods and services. Critics argued that the Fed's strategy of focusing on stable product prices was dangerous, as they believed the stock market bubble indicated an impending cycle of overheating and contraction. They criticized the Fed for waiting too long to act and questioned the discrepancy in its response to declining versus rising stock prices. The critics argue that attempting to burst the bubble could trigger a recession, as stated by Greenspan and echoed by Bernanke in 2002. They believe that identifying and preventing bubbles using monetary policy is challenging due to the Fed's inability to reliably spot them and the blunt nature of monetary tools. In a 1999 paper, Bernanke and Gertler demonstrated the impact of asset bubbles on the economy and argued that monetary policy should only respond to bubbles if they affect inflation. They suggested that once the inflationary effects are mitigated, the Fed should allow the bubble to persist. This argument countered critics who believed the Fed should actively burst bubbles to prevent recessions. The argument presented by Bernanke and Gertler in 1999 countered critics who believed the Fed should actively burst bubbles to prevent recessions. It suggested that the Fed should only respond to bubbles if they affect inflation, allowing the bubble to persist once inflationary effects are mitigated. This strategy aimed to address criticisms of Fed policy that underestimated the impact of bubbles on the economy. Eliminating bubbles is seen as a legitimate policy goal for economic stability, according to Fed economist Glenn Rudebusch. However, accurately identifying bubbles before they burst is a challenge, as they are usually only noticeable in hindsight. Identifying bubbles in advance is difficult as they are usually only visible after the fact. Acting on the assumption of a bubble goes against expert opinion and can be risky for the Fed. Uncertainty in bubble identification makes policy responses costly, as guessing incorrectly can lead to volatile economic outcomes. Fed must be unable to easily mitigate damage after a bubble bursts. The Fed must be unable to easily mitigate the damage after a bubble bursts. Lowering interest rates can offset a 20% decline in house prices, but pre-emptive action may be advantageous if the bubble leads to a financial crisis or misallocation of resources. The importance of avoiding a recession depends on the belief in misallocation of resources. Some advocate for letting recessions purge the system, while mainstream macroeconomic policy focuses on preventing recessions. Rudebusch suggests pre-emptive monetary tightening to deflate bubbles, but Greenspan is skeptical of its effectiveness. The belief that a small rise in interest rates could prevent economic bubbles is likely an illusion. Only a significant increase in rates, which could lead to a recession, would have an impact on a bubble. Asset prices may not respond to short-term rate changes if they do not affect long-term rates controlled by the Fed. For example, despite a rise in short-term rates from 2003 to 2005, long-term Treasury and mortgage rates only saw minimal increases. The Fed's belief that monetary policy can counteract the damage from a deflating bubble is central to its position on not interfering with a growing bubble. Interest rates have been reduced in response to sharp drops in financial markets during Greenspan's or Bernanke's tenure. The Fed responds to financial market declines by reducing interest rates. Chairman Bernanke emphasizes that it is not the Fed's role to protect lenders and investors from their decisions, but it must consider the economic impact of market developments. Critics argue that the Fed's approach to inflating and deflating asset bubbles is asymmetric. Critics argue that the Fed's asymmetric interventionary approach to asset bubbles increases moral hazard, encouraging excessive risk-taking and sowing the seeds of future crises. They suggest that allowing financial downturns to run their course and imprudent investors to take losses would lead to more efficient investment decisions in the long run. Fed's quick actions during price falls could potentially make future bubbles larger by reducing the payoff to investors betting against them. The moral hazard critique of the Fed's intervention in asset bubbles suggests that allowing financial turmoil to run its course could go against the goal of economic stability. Some argue that government intervention is necessary to provide enough liquidity, as it has characteristics of a positive externality. This argument is not mutually exclusive with the moral hazard critique. The Fed's intervention in asset bubbles may create moral hazard without corresponding regulations to offset the extra risk. Bubbles are hard to identify, but their impact on the economy can be significant, leading to volatility in investment and consumption. Ignoring bubbles can result in financial instability. The Fed faces criticism for not acting more aggressively to counteract bubbles in the economy, as true inflationary pressures may be greater than measured. Critics argue that raising interest rates to address bubbles could risk causing a recession. The Fed maintains that it will respond to bubbles as needed, but there is concern that they have underestimated the impact of bubbles on economic stability. The Fed has faced criticism for not aggressively countering economic bubbles, with debates on whether its interest rate policies would have been the same without potential bubbles. The Fed's response to stock market fluctuations in 1999 and 2000 is debated, with arguments for and against its policy effectiveness during the 2001 recession. The Fed faced criticism for not aggressively countering economic bubbles, with debates on its interest rate policies. Efforts to deflate the bubble earlier may have led to a recession. The economy showed few lasting scars from the stock market crash, with capital investment spending fully rebounding by 2003. Critics predicted a larger bubble than what actually occurred. Policy intervention may have been justified at some point, but critics' demands could have led to lost output gains. Critics argue that the Fed's reluctance to intervene in economic bubbles creates a moral hazard, as investors believe the Fed will bail out markets. The Fed's belief in using expansionary monetary policy to mitigate bubble bursts may not always be effective, leading to potential risks and larger bubbles forming."
