    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Francis W. Agnes Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2003\" and it aims to improve veterans' benefits for former prisoners of war. The \"Francis W. Agnes Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2003\" repeals requirements for minimum internment periods for presumption of service connection for certain diseases and dental care. It also adds additional diseases presumed to be service-connected under title 38, United States Code. The \"Francis W. Agnes Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2003\" repeals internment period requirements for presumption of service connection for certain diseases and adds new diseases presumed to be service-connected under title 38, United States Code, including heart disease, stroke, liver disease, diabetes (type 2), and osteoporosis. The Secretary can determine additional diseases warranting a presumption of service connection for prisoners of war. The Secretary can prescribe regulations for a presumption of service connection for diseases related to being a prisoner of war. Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War and sound medical information will be considered. The association between a disease and being a prisoner of war will be evaluated based on statistical significance, replicability, and peer review. The Secretary will determine if a presumption of service connection is warranted for diseases related to being a prisoner of war based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War. Positive association will be considered if evidence outweighs against it. Regulations will be issued within 60 days if a presumption is warranted, otherwise, a determination will be made within the same timeframe. The Secretary will publish a notice in the Federal Register within 60 days of determining that a presumption of service connection is not warranted for a disease. Proposed regulations removing the presumption must be issued within the same timeframe, with final regulations to follow within 90 days. Veterans awarded compensation or survivors receiving dependency and indemnity compensation for a disease under a presumption will continue to receive benefits. The Secretary will consult with the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War when implementing this subsection."
