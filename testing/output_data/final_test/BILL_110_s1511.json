    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine and Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2007\" defines marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy as electrical energy from various sources such as waves, tides, currents, free-flowing water in rivers, lakes, streams, and ocean thermal energy conversion. Excluded sources include energy from dams, diversionary structures, or impoundments for electric power purposes. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, will establish a program for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy research. This program will focus on developing and demonstrating technologies, reducing costs, increasing reliability, integrating into electric grids, and identifying opportunities for collaboration with offshore wind energy sources. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, will establish a program for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy research. This program includes identifying environmental impacts, addressing adverse impacts, providing public information, and developing standards for advanced systems engineering and technology transfer. $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2017 for this purpose. SEC. 4. ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL FUND. The Congress finds that marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies can reduce global warming gases, promote domestic energy production, and align with environmental protection. The Secretary of Energy will establish an Adaptive Management and Environmental Fund to support projects in this industry. Loans under this section support marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy projects, covering various costs. Recipients must allow access for environmental research, and results must be made public, with exceptions for protected information. The Secretary of Energy requires loan recipients to repay the loan with 2.1% interest over a maximum of 20 years after the project starts generating electricity. Repayment is based on the recipient's economic viability and ensures timely repayment. No repayments are due until the project generates net proceeds from electricity sales after covering project costs. Repayment of a loan made under this section will terminate if the project ceases commercial generation of electricity due to environmental impacts. Loan recipients must continue repayments for equipment costs utilized in subsequent projects. An adaptive management plan is required for a marine or hydrokinetic renewable energy project to receive a federal license or permit. The plan must be developed in consultation with relevant agencies to address protection, mitigation, and enhancement of various resources. An adaptive management plan for a marine or hydrokinetic renewable energy project must include specific objectives for resource protection, monitoring for compliance, provisions for project modification or removal if objectives are not met, and approval for incorporation into the federal license or permit. The Secretary of Energy will report to Congress when the supported technologies reach maturity, allowing for the expiration of programs. No new loans will be issued under this section after the report is submitted. SEC. 5. PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior, in collaboration with other agencies, will prepare programmatic environmental impact statements on the deployment of marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technologies in U.S. navigable waters. One statement will be created for each EPA region within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The programmatic environmental impact statements will evaluate the potential impacts of site selection on fish, wildlife, and habitat for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy technology projects. This section will not delay the consideration of any license or permit applications. Section 6 introduces a production credit for electricity generated from marine renewable sources. The amendment to section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code introduces a production credit for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy derived from waves, tides, and currents in oceans and tidal areas. The amendment to section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code introduces a production credit for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy derived from waves, tides, and currents in oceans, estuaries, and tidal areas. This includes free flowing water in rivers, lakes, and streams, as well as in man-made channels using nonmechanical structures for power production, and differentials in ocean temperature. Exceptions exclude energy sources described in previous paragraphs and those utilizing dams or diversionary structures. The amendment to section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code introduces a production credit for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy facilities. This includes electricity production from waves, tides, and currents in various water bodies, excluding energy sources using dams or diversionary structures. The definition of a qualified facility for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy is clarified as any facility owned by the taxpayer placed in service after the enactment date and before January 1, 2009. The production credit for marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy facilities applies to electricity produced and sold after the enactment date, in taxable years ending after such date. Investment credit and 5-year depreciation for equipment producing electricity from marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code allows for a 30 percent credit for equipment using marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy until January 1, 2018. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code modifies credits allowed for investment and production of energy property, excluding certain types of property. It also denies dual benefits for facilities producing electricity from gas derived from the biodegradation of municipal solid waste. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code modifies credits for investment in marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy property. The changes apply to property placed in service after the enactment date of the Act."
