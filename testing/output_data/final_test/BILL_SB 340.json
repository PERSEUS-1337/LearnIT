    "title": "SB 340",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2103 of the Family Code is amended to require full disclosure of assets and liabilities in divorce or separation proceedings. Each party must serve a preliminary and final declaration of disclosure unless waived. Section 2104 is also amended regarding the disclosure process. Section 2104 of the Family Code is amended to require each party in divorce proceedings to serve a preliminary declaration of disclosure, executed under penalty of perjury, including tax returns filed within the two years prior to serving the declaration. Perjury on the disclosure may result in setting aside the judgment. The preliminary declaration of disclosure in divorce proceedings must be served by each party, detailing all assets, liabilities, ownership percentages, and obligations. Proof of service must be filed with the court, and the declaration must be clear enough for an average person to understand. (d) A declarant can amend their preliminary declaration of disclosure without court permission, and proof of service of any amendment must be filed with the court. Along with the declaration, each party must provide the other party with a completed income and expense declaration, unless a current and valid one has already been provided. The petitioner must serve the other party with the preliminary declaration of disclosure within specific time frames, which can be extended by agreement or court order. The Family Code section 2107 is amended. Section 2107 of the Family Code is amended to address situations where one party fails to provide necessary financial disclosures in a divorce case. If the noncomplying party does not rectify the situation after a request, the complying party can file a motion to compel further response. To address noncompliance in a divorce case, the complying party can file a motion to compel further response, prevent the noncomplying party from presenting evidence on relevant issues, or request a voluntary waiver of disclosure rights. If a party fails to comply with this chapter, the court may impose money sanctions, including attorney's fees and costs, unless there is substantial justification or other circumstances make the sanction unjust. If parties fail to comply with disclosure requirements, the court will set aside the judgment. Failure to comply is not considered harmless error. The judgment can only be set aside at the request of the complying party, except in cases of actual fraud. Perjury in the declaration of disclosure or income statement can lead to the court ordering the exchange of disclosure declarations between parties. Declarations are not filed with the court unless ordered. Section 2110 of the Family Code is amended. Section 2110 of the Family Code is amended to allow for waiver of final disclosure requirements in default judgments. Preliminary disclosure by the petitioner is still required unless certain conditions are met."
