    "title": "AB 1766",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 222.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to ensure fair and impartial jury selection in civil jury trials. The court will examine prospective jurors, followed by oral questioning by counsel for each party to identify bias or prejudice. Additional questioning by counsel is allowed to ensure a thorough examination. To aid jury selection in civil trials, the court should provide complete names of prospective jurors to each party and allow brief opening statements by counsel before oral questioning during voir dire. The court has discretion in setting limits for counsel's examination during voir dire, considering unique case elements and juror responses. Unreasonable time limits should not be imposed, and blanket policies for time limits are not allowed. The court allows counsel to conduct voir dire without prior question submission, unless improper questioning occurs. Improper questions aim to influence jurors or discuss pleadings/law. Reasonable written questionnaires may be requested and evaluated before oral questioning begins. In civil cases, the court may allow counsel to examine prospective jurors outside the court's presence upon stipulation by all parties. In criminal cases, the court conducts an initial examination of jurors and may ask additional questions requested by the parties. The court provides the complete names of jurors to each party in a uniform manner for addressing during the trial. Before examining prospective jurors, the court advises them that in criminal cases, jurors will be addressed by their first name and the first initial of their last name or by their title and last name, not by their full names. Upon completion of the court\u2019s initial examination, counsel for each party can question prospective jurors orally. The court may limit questioning time and it should occur in the presence of other jurors in criminal cases. The court's discretion in conducting voir dire, including time limits for questioning jurors, will not lead to conviction reversal unless it results in a miscarriage of justice. Public access to juror information is not limited. This section is effective until January 1, 2022, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. Section 223 is added to the Code of Civil Procedure. In a criminal case, the court conducts an initial examination of prospective jurors and allows additional questions from parties. Counsel can question jurors orally, with the court having discretion to limit questioning time. Voir dire occurs in the presence of other jurors, and examination is only for the exercise of challenges. Examination of prospective jurors is conducted only to aid challenges for cause. The trial court's discretion in conducting voir dire, including time limitations and questioning, will not result in conviction reversal unless it causes a miscarriage of justice. This section becomes effective on January 1, 2022."
