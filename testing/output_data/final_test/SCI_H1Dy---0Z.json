    "content": "We propose a distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning at scale, decoupling acting from learning to enable agents to learn effectively from more data. The architecture relies on prioritized experience replay to focus on significant data, leading to improved performance in a fraction of the training time. In this paper, the focus is on scaling up deep reinforcement learning by utilizing larger computational resources. The use of models and larger datasets has shown promising results in algorithms such as Gorila, A3C, Distributed PPO, and AlphaGo. Despite the support for distributed training in frameworks like TensorFlow, research is still focused on improving performance within a single machine's computational budget. The paper describes an approach to scaling up deep reinforcement learning by leveraging more resources. In this paper, the focus is on scaling up deep reinforcement learning by generating more data and selecting from it in a prioritized fashion. The approach involves distributing the generation and selection of experience data, leading to improved results. The distributed architecture is used to scale up variants of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), achieving state-of-the-art performance on Atari games in less time compared to previous methods. The study focuses on achieving state-of-the-art performance on Atari games by scaling up deep reinforcement learning through distributed generation and selection of experience data. The framework shows improved results without per-game hyperparameter tuning, analyzing factors like replay capacity and data-generating policies. The use of Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent is discussed for speeding up training of deep neural networks. Parameter updates can be applied synchronously or asynchronously, with both approaches proving effective in deep learning. Nair et al. applied distributed asynchronous parameter updates and data generation to deep reinforcement learning. Asynchronous updates and parallel data generation have also been successful in a single-machine, multi-threaded context. Techniques like Distributed Importance Sampling and importance sampling for variance reduction have shown usefulness in neural networks. Prioritized Experience Replay is a technique used in reinforcement learning to improve data efficiency when training neural networks. It involves sampling non-uniformly from a dataset and weighting updates based on sampling probability to reduce bias and increase convergence speed. This approach can be extended to the distributed setting and can also rank samples based on their latest loss value for sampling probability. Prioritized experience replay is a technique in reinforcement learning that helps prevent overfitting and improves learning efficiency by focusing on the most 'surprising' experiences. It is used in various algorithms such as Prioritized Dueling DQN, UNREAL, and DQfD. In this paper, the Ape-X architecture extends prioritized experience replay to the distributed setting, showing scalability in deep reinforcement learning. Multiple actors generate experience in their own environments, adding it to a shared memory for the learner to update the network and priorities. The Ape-X architecture extends prioritized experience replay to the distributed setting, with multiple actors generating experience in their own environments. The actors' networks are updated periodically with the latest parameters from the learner. The algorithm is decomposed into two parts: acting in the environment and updating policy parameters by sampling batches of data from memory. The Ape-X architecture extends prioritized experience replay to the distributed setting, with multiple actors generating experience in their own environments. Learning involves sampling data from memory to update policy parameters. Actors run on CPUs to generate data, while a single learner on a GPU samples the most useful experiences. Network parameters are periodically communicated to actors. Shared, centralized replay memory is used, prioritizing useful data sampling. Priorities can benefit the whole system and can be defined in various ways. In the Ape-X architecture, priorities for new transitions are computed online by actors to ensure more accurate data in the replay memory. This approach avoids a myopic focus on recent data and leverages the actors' existing computations, enhancing the efficiency of the system. By batching all communications with centralized replay, the Ape-X architecture increases efficiency and throughput while allowing actors and learners to run in different data centers. Learning off-policy enables the system to combine data from distributed actors with different exploration policies, enhancing the diversity of experiences encountered. This approach can make progress on difficult exploration problems and can be combined with various learning algorithms. The study utilized a variant of DQN with components of Rainbow, including double Q-learning and multi-step bootstrap targets. The dueling network architecture was used as the function approximator. Off-policy Q-learning variants allow for flexibility in choosing data generation policies. In practice, the choice of behavior policy affects exploration and function approximation quality. Ape-X DQN uses multiple actors with different policies to generate diverse experiences. Actors use -greedy policies with varying values to balance exploration and prevent over-specialization. The framework is also combined with a continuous-action policy gradient system based on DDPG for testing generality. The Ape-X DPG setup is similar to Ape-X DQN, with separate policy and Q-networks optimized separately. The Q-network estimates action values and is updated using temporal-difference learning. The policy network outputs actions and is updated using policy gradients. The Ape-X DPG algorithm updates policy parameters using policy gradient ascent on estimated Q-values. Ape-X DQN achieves state-of-the-art results on Atari using 360 actor machines to feed data into replay memory at a rate of approximately 139 frames per second. Transitions are batched locally before being sent asynchronously in batches of 50 to the learner. The Ape-X DPG algorithm updates policy parameters using policy gradient ascent on estimated Q-values. Ape-X DQN achieves state-of-the-art results on Atari using 360 actor machines to feed data into replay memory at a rate of approximately 139 frames per second. Transitions are batched locally before being sent asynchronously in batches of 50 to the learner. The learner prefetches up to 16 batches of 512 transitions and computes updates for 19 batches each second, resulting in gradients computed for around 9.7K transitions per second on average. Memory and bandwidth requirements are reduced by compressing observation data using a PNG codec when sent and stored in the replay. The shared experience replay memory has a soft limit of 2 million transitions. The shared experience replay memory in Ape-X DQN is soft-limited to 2 million transitions. Data is sampled with prioritization and importance sampling. Performance comparisons with other algorithms are shown in FIG1. Ape-X DQN outperformed other baseline agents in both speed of training and final performance on Atari benchmark games. It also achieved higher performance in comparison to other agents on continuous control tasks. In the manipulator and humanoid domains, Ape-X DPG showed strong performance on four continuous control tasks. Using small, fully-connected networks with 64 actors, the agent achieved good results in tasks such as bringing a ball to a location and controlling a humanoid body for standing, walking, and running. The observation space is smaller than in the Atari domain, leading to efficient processing of transitions. Increasing the number of actors improved the agent's effectiveness in solving these tasks. The number of actors increases the agent's effectiveness in solving problems rapidly and reliably, outperforming a standard DDPG baseline. Ape-X DPG combined with distributional value functions successfully tackles continuous control tasks. Additional Ape-X DQN experiments on Atari games show improved performance with increasing numbers of actors. The performance consistently improved as the number of actors increased, without changing network parameters or update rules. The proposed architecture helps with deep reinforcement learning failure modes by promoting exploration. Prioritized replay ensures focus on important information for learning. The algorithm focused on investigating the replay memory capacity with 256 actors, observing a small benefit in using a larger capacity. The network was trained with 19 batches per second, processing approximately 9.7K transitions per second. Additional experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of recency of experience data and diversity of data-generating policies in scalability analysis. The distributed framework for prioritized replay in deep reinforcement learning achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks by gathering more experience data for better exploration and avoiding overfitting. The Ape-X framework can be applied to DQN and DPG, as well as other off-policy reinforcement learning updates. The Ape-X framework prioritizes sequences of past experiences over individual transitions, suitable for generating large amounts of data in parallel. It is beneficial for simulated environments and real-world applications like robotic arm farms and self-driving cars. However, it may not be directly applicable in situations where data is expensive to obtain. Overfitting is a concern with powerful function approximators, and generating more training data can help address this issue. Ape-X aims to improve exploration in large domains but may not be efficient in data-limited scenarios. Ape-X addresses the issue of exploration in large domains by generating diverse experiences and learning from the most useful events. The success of this approach suggests that simple exploration methods may be feasible for synchronous agents. The architecture of Ape-X demonstrates the practicality of distributed systems for deep reinforcement learning research and potential large-scale applications. The hope is that the presented algorithms, architecture, and analysis will accelerate future efforts in this direction. In the main experiments of Ape-X, the replay memory size is not adjusted with the number of actors, leading to more recent transitions in experiments with more actors. This on-policy behavior could explain the improved performance. To test this, an experiment was conducted with 32 actors replicating the replay memory replacement rate of the 256-actor setup by adding each transition 8 times. In experiments with 32 actors, transitions are added to the replay memory 8 times, but the performance does not recover compared to the 256-actor setup. Duplicating data can harm performance by reducing diversity in the replay memory. This suggests that recency alone does not explain the method's performance. In experiments with 32 actors, duplicating data primarily to exclude implementation effects. Each actor having a different factor may impact performance. Testing variations in policy selection mechanisms, results show full range of values slightly better than fixed set of 6. The frames received from the environment are preprocessed on the actor side with standard transformations. This includes greyscaling, frame stacking, repeating actions 4 times, and clipping rewards. The learner waits for 50000 transitions before starting learning. A Centered RMSProp optimizer with specific parameters is used to minimize the multi-step loss. Gradient norms are clipped, and the target network is updated every 2500 training batches. The critic and actor networks have specific layer configurations. The actor and critic networks have specific layer configurations. The actor network has a layer with 300 units, followed by a tanh activation, and another layer of 200 units. The gradient used for updating the actor network is clipped to [-1, 1]. Training utilizes the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001. The target network is updated every 100 training batches. Replay sampling priorities are based on absolute TD error and are sampled using proportional prioritized sampling with priority exponent \u03b1 sample = 0.6. Data is periodically removed to maintain a fixed replay capacity of 10^6 using proportional prioritized sampling with priority exponent \u03b1 evict = -0.4. The Atari experiments compared different data removal strategies. Exploration noise was added to actions in the DPG algorithm. Benchmarking was done in Humanoid and Manipulator domains in the MuJoCo physics simulator. Humanoid tasks included walk, run, and stand. Manipulator is a 2-dimensional planar arm. In the Manipulator domain, experiments were conducted with batch sizes {32, 128, 256, 512, 1024} and learning rates from 10^-3 to 10^-5. Larger batch sizes improved performance significantly, with clear benefits up to 512. However, increasing the learning rate to 0.00025 destabilized training on some games. Prioritization exponents \u03b1 were tested from 0.0 to 1.0, with consistent results within the range [0.3, 0.7]. The algorithm for experiments with many actors involved setting parameters to prevent overload and instability. TensorFlow BID0 was used for implementation, with distributed in-memory key-value store for replay data. Custom TensorFlow ops were used for adding, reading, and removing batches of data. The ops in core TensorFlow allow efficient addition, reading, and removal of batches of Tensor data. Ops for maintaining and sampling from a prioritized distribution over keys are also implemented, with priorities updated based on TD error. A background thread on the learner fetches sampled data from remote replay. The learner fetches batches of sampled data from the remote replay, decompresses it using the CPU, and buffers it in a TensorFlow queue for the GPU to train on. Actors maintain a circular buffer for n-step transition data, updating discounts and returns with each step. Constructed transitions are not directly added to the remote replay memory but combined with the latest state and value estimates to produce valid n-step transitions. The constructed transitions are stored in a local TensorFlow queue to reduce requests to the replay server. The queue is periodically flushed to compute absolute n-step TD-errors and initial priorities in batch. Q-value estimates for priorities are based on the actor's network parameters at the time of state acquisition. Each transition is assigned a unique key for tracking its origin. The remote replay memory stores transition tuples with actor and environment information. The replay server must handle requests promptly to prevent system slowdowns, with potential bottlenecks being CPU, network bandwidth, and data locks. CPU was identified as the main bottleneck in experiments, but was resolved by using large batches for requests and responses. It is important to consider these performance concerns when designing such systems. In distributed systems with many workers, interruptions or failures are inevitable due to hardware issues or shared resource conflicts. Stateful components must save work periodically to resume after restarts. Monitoring system speeds and considering all performance aspects is crucial for accurate analysis of results. In our system, actors can resume learning after interruptions, with a temporarily reduced rate of new data entering the replay memory. If the replay server is interrupted, data is discarded, and upon resuming, memory is refilled quickly. To prevent overfitting, the learner pauses training briefly until enough data is accumulated again. Progress stalls if the learner is interrupted, and in some games, scores are higher due to shorter episode lengths during training."
