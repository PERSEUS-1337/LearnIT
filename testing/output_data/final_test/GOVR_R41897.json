    "content": "The report analyzes employment trends in the private and public sectors in the United States from 1955 to 2013. Data from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey show a steady increase in both sectors, with the private sector adding 70.8 million jobs and the public sector growing by 14.8 million jobs during this period. From 1955 to 2013, public sector employment in the United States grew by 14.8 million jobs, reaching 21.9 million. During the 2007-2009 recession, private sector employment fell by 7.9 million jobs, while public sector employment increased by 272,000 jobs. However, from 2010 to 2013, private sector employment grew by 6.7 million jobs, while public sector employment decreased by 626,000 jobs. The share of public sector employment relative to total employment increased until 1975, but has since declined. During the recession from 2010 to 2013, public sector employment in state and local governments decreased. Local government employment saw the most growth, with an increase of 10.5 million jobs, while state government employment increased by 3.9 million jobs. Federal government employment also grew by 471,000 jobs. However, since the end of the recession, public sector employment has fallen, with local governments losing 521,000 jobs, state governments losing 129,000 jobs, and federal government losing 211,000 jobs. The share of total employment in local governments peaked at 11.4% in 1975, then fell and rose to 11.1% in 2009. By 2013, it decreased to 10.3%. State government employment peaked at 4.1% in 1975, dropping to 3.7% in 2013. Federal government employment increased from 2.3 million to 2.8 million from 1955 to 2013, but its share of total employment fell from 4.5% to 2.0%. Some union workers pay dues, while others may not. The number of American workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement has declined since 1979, from 23.5 million to 16.0 million in 2013. Some state and local government employees covered by a union contract are not required to pay dues. Federal workers covered by a union contract are also not required to pay dues. The data include all full-time and part-time wage and salary workers ages 16 and over. The number of American workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement has declined from 23.5 million in 1979 to 16.0 million in 2013. In 2009, a majority of workers under collective bargaining were in the public sector, but by 2013, the majority shifted to the private sector. Most public sector workers under collective bargaining are employed by local governments. In 2013, 38.7% of public wage and salary workers were covered by a collective bargaining agreement, compared to 7.5% of private sector workers. However, union representation has decreased in both sectors since 1983. In the private sector, union coverage decreased from 18.5% to 7.5% of wage and salary workers, while in the public sector, it fell from 45.5% to 38.7%. The largest decrease in union coverage in the public sector was in the Postal Service, dropping from 83.5% to 67.2%. In the public sector, workers represented by a union receive higher wages and better benefits. Greater unionization in the public sector could lead to higher pay compared to the private sector. Federal employees generally receive annual pay adjustments, with some workers able to bargain over wages. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 granted postal workers the right to bargain over wages and benefits. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 granted postal workers the right to bargain over wages and benefits. Air traffic controllers can also bargain over wages. The Tennessee Valley Authority allows employees to bargain over wages. The report examines characteristics affecting pay of private and public sector workers, including age, gender, education, and occupation distribution. Data is from the Current Population Survey and the Annual Social and Economic supplement. The analysis covers military personnel in civilian households from 1976 to 2013, focusing on working-age adults aged 18 to 64. It looks at full-time workers, defined as those working 35 hours or more a week, with a higher percentage in the public sector. In 2013, 81.6% of workers in this age group were employed full-time. The workforce in both private and public sectors is aging. The U.S. labor force is aging, with public sector workers generally older than private sector workers. In 2013, 51.7% of full-time public sector workers were aged 45-64, compared to 42.4% in the private sector. Federal workers are older than state and local government employees. The age gap between private and public sector workers has decreased since 2001. Older workers typically have more work experience. In 2013, the age gap between private and public sector workers had fallen to 9.3 points. Older workers generally have more work experience, which may result in differences in earnings between the two sectors. The share of jobs held by women has increased in both sectors, with women holding a higher share in the public sector, particularly in state and local governments. In 2013, women held almost three-fifths of full-time jobs in state and local governments (57.7% for both state and local governments), compared to approximately two-fifths in the federal government and private sector. The largest increase in the share of jobs held by women has been in state governments, with a 13.7 percentage point increase from 1976 to 2013. The share of jobs held by women in the public sector has increased more than in the private sector, with a narrowing pay gap between men and women. Public sector employees have higher education levels compared to private sector workers, with state and local government workers more likely to have a bachelor's degree. The CPS changed how educational attainment is coded in 1992, making data from 1992 and later not directly comparable to earlier years. For public sector workers, data on employment by level of government was collected starting in 1988. The percentage point changes in educational attainment discussed in this section are the sum of changes over two periods: 1976 to 1991, and 1992 to 2013. Educational attainment has improved among both private and public sector workers, with a larger increase in the private sector. From 1976 to 2013, the percentage of private sector workers with a bachelor's degree or better increased by 19.9 percentage points, compared to a 15.2-point increase for public workers. The largest gain in the private sector was among workers with a bachelor's degree, while in the public sector, the largest gain was among workers with an advanced or professional degree. Among workers with advanced or professional degrees, public sector workers saw a gain of 11.4 percentage points compared to 6.6 points for private sector workers. The largest increase in educational attainment was among federal employees, with a 17.0 point increase in bachelor's, advanced, or professional degrees. Higher education generally leads to higher earnings. The higher educational attainment of public sector workers, especially those with advanced or professional degrees, likely impacts the pay gap between private and public sector workers. Detailed occupational data shows that certain occupations are more concentrated in either sector. The analysis focuses on full-time wage and salary workers aged 18-64, excluding self-employed workers. In 2013, a larger share of public sector workers were employed in \"management, professional, and related occupations\" compared to private sector workers. This was partly due to more public sector workers being employed in \"education, training, and library\" occupations. In 2013, a larger share of public sector workers were employed in \"management, professional, and related occupations\" compared to private sector workers. Public sector employees in these occupations work mainly for state and local governments. The median weekly earnings of full-time workers in these occupations are higher than workers in other occupations. More public sector workers were employed in \"protective service\" occupations, while more private sector workers were in \"sales and related\" and \"production\" occupations. In 2013, union coverage was higher in the public sector than in the private sector across various major occupations. Only 7.9% of private sector employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement, with lower rates in legal and management occupations. In contrast, higher union representation was seen in education, construction, transportation, maintenance, and production occupations. In the public sector, 41.3% of full-time employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In 2013, union coverage was higher in the public sector than in the private sector across various major occupations. Among employees in education and protective service occupations, a majority were represented by a union. However, only 18.8% of public employees in legal occupations and 21.6% in management occupations were unionized. Detailed occupations may require similar skills, and the top 100 occupations in both private and public sectors are listed in the Appendix. In 2013, the top 100 occupations in the private sector accounted for 74.0% of total full-time employment, while in the public sector, they accounted for 83.9%. Pay differences between private and public sectors may vary based on detailed occupations. For example, chief executives are predominantly in the private sector, while first-line supervisors of retail and nonretail sales workers are mostly in the private sector as well. In the private sector, 97.7% of nonretail sales workers' supervisors are employed, while all police officers' supervisors work in the public sector. Chief executives likely earn more than mid-level managers, and union coverage is higher in the public sector. Metropolitan areas with populations of 1 million or more have a higher percentage of private sector workers. In 2013, workers in the private sector were more likely to live in metropolitan areas with 5 million or more people compared to federal workers. Private sector workers in the largest metropolitan areas accounted for 20.5%, while federal workers accounted for 12.9%. State employees were less likely to live in areas with 1 million people or more at 39.3%. In 2013, federal workers accounted for 12.9% of workers living in metropolitan areas with 5 million or more people. The appendix provides detailed information on employment and union coverage by occupation in the private and public sectors, including data on the top 100 occupations in each sector. In 2013, 56 common occupations were found in the top 100 occupations in both private and public sectors, with varying levels of union representation. For example, 1.8% of private sector \"managers, all other\" were covered by a collective bargaining agreement, while 19.1% of public sector workers in this occupation were represented by a union. Occupations common to both private and public sectors include managers, teachers, nurses, secretaries, accountants, janitors, and general managers. Some occupations had a majority of workers in the private sector, such as cashiers, laborers, drivers, and customer service representatives. Occupations common to both private and public sectors include receptionists, electricians, plumbers, and teachers. Some occupations, like sales and food preparation, were predominantly in the private sector. Occupations unique to the public sector include those in public safety, Postal Service, education, highway maintenance, government program eligibility interviewers, and legal occupations. Data analyzed from the Current Employment Statistics (CES). Data and Methodology This report analyzes data from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey and the Current Population Survey (CPS). The CES is an employer survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to count persons on employer payrolls. The CPS, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for BLS, provides national unemployment rate and labor market information from a sample representative of the civilian noninstitutional population. The survey is representative of the civilian noninstitutional population and excludes those in institutions or on active duty in the military. Approximately 55,500 households are interviewed monthly. Data on occupations and union coverage are from the monthly CPS, with an annual ASEC supplement for a representative sample of the US population, including members of the Armed Forces living in civilian housing units. The supplement for the Current Population Survey (CPS) is conducted in households not on military bases, with at least one civilian adult present. It excludes active members of the Armed Forces and those living in military barracks. In 2013, 75,500 households were interviewed. Data on private and public sector workers are from the ASEC supplement. The Census Bureau modifies age variables to protect confidentiality, leading to potential discrepancies in estimates between public users and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPS changed how educational attainment is recorded in 1992, now reporting if a person graduated from high school or college. This change makes estimates of high school and college graduates from 1992 to 2013 not comparable to earlier years. In the earlier period, completion of 12 years of high school did not necessarily mean graduation, and completion of 16 or more years did not necessarily mean receiving a degree. The changes in coding for educational attainment in the CPS in 1992 now differentiate between high school and college graduates. The discussion in this report on changes in educational attainment combines data from before 1991 and after 1992."
