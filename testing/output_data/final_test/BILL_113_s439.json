    "content": "The Act titled \"Career and Technical Education Facilities Modernization Act\" emphasizes the importance of high-performing facilities for vocational education. It recognizes the need for education to be relevant to real-world scenarios and to help students identify their interests and abilities. Many vocational school facilities are outdated and inefficient, hindering student performance. The Career and Technical Education Facilities section of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include definitions related to vocational education facilities. The term 'career and technical education' is defined as per the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006. 'Community college' refers to a junior or community college, or an institution of higher education that awards a significant number of degrees and certificates excluding baccalaureate degrees. The term 'eligible entity' refers to a local educational agency, community college, or other entity approved by the Secretary. A 'qualified project' involves modernizing, renovating, or repairing a facility to enhance STEM or career education for public school or community college students, which may include improving energy efficiency. The eligible entity can use the funds for improving the cost-effectiveness of delivering quality education, enhancing student, faculty, and staff health and safety, upgrading educational technology infrastructure, retrofitting buildings for career and technical education, and repairing or replacing equipment for educational purposes. The eligible entity can use the funds for improving educational outcomes, excluding new construction or routine maintenance costs. SEC. 5622. CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FACILITIES IMPROVEMENT.
