    "content": "The House and Senate have not reached agreement on a traditional budget resolution since FY2010. The sustained lack of agreement in recent years has led to calls for budget process reforms, including proposals to replace the concurrent resolution on the budget with a joint resolution requiring the President's signature. Other suggestions include biennial action on a budget resolution instead of annual action. Congress has not agreed on a budget resolution since 2009, but has established budgetary constraints through legislation like the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. These statutes provide enforceable budgetary parameters in the absence of a traditional budget resolution. This report explains how these provisions function as an alternative to a traditional budget resolution. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67) established a Congressional Budget as a substitute for a traditional budget resolution for FY2014 and potentially FY2015. The Act resulted from negotiations between the House and Senate Budget Committees and was enacted on December 26, 2013. The House and Senate each agreed to their own FY2014 budget resolutions prior to the Act. On October 16, 2013, the House and Senate agreed to convene a conference on S.Con.Res. 8 to resolve differences on the FY2014 budget plan. House and Senate leadership reached a two-year budget agreement on December 10, announced by Representative Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray. The House Rules Committee reported a special rule on December 11 for the consideration of the \"Ryan-Murray agreement\" using H.J.Res. 59 as the legislative vehicle. The special rule allowed House consideration of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement (BBA) and the \"doc fix\" amendment. Representative Paul Ryan motioned to send the legislative text to the Senate as a further House amendment to H.J.Res. 59, which was agreed upon by the House and Senate. The House's amendment to H.J.Res. 59 was concurred by the Senate after invoking cloture, and the legislation was signed into law on December 26, 2013. The Bipartisan Budget Agreement (BBA) modified spending caps and extended the mandatory sequester, including provisions related to congressional budget resolutions for FY2014 and FY2015. The Budget Act of 1974 allows Congress to adopt a budget resolution annually to set budget parameters for the upcoming fiscal year. These parameters are enforced by points of order, specifically through Sections 311 and 302 of the Budget Act. Section 311(a) prohibits the consideration of any spending measure that would violate budget limits once agreed upon. The Budget Act of 1974 enforces budget parameters through points of order, prohibiting spending measures that violate budget limits. Section 302(a) allocates spending amounts by committee and prohibits legislation that would violate these allocations. House and Senate Appropriations Committees receive allocations for one fiscal year, while other committees receive allocations for the entire budget resolution period. The Budget Act of 1974 enforces budget parameters through points of order, prohibiting spending measures that violate budget limits. House and Senate Appropriations Committees receive allocations for one fiscal year, while other committees receive allocations for the entire budget resolution period. Section 302(b) requires suballocation by subcommittee, and Section 302(f) bars consideration of spending measures breaching suballocations. When a budget resolution is not reached, prior year's multi-year budget levels remain in effect for enforcement. Changing economic conditions and technical factors may have made prior budget levels outdated for enforcing current policies. Without a budget resolution, there is no allocation of spending to the Appropriations Committees, leading the House and Senate to use simple resolutions to establish enforceable budgetary levels. Recently, updated budgetary enforcement has been provided for in statutory budget control legislation, allowing the chair of the Budget Committee to file a statement of budgetary levels in the absence of a budget resolution, which would be enforceable in the respective chamber. This process, known as a \"deeming resolution,\" allows the House and Senate to address enforcement issues using legislative procedures on an ad hoc basis. Section 106 of the BCA established enforceable budgetary levels in the Senate for FY2012 and FY2013 if Congress did not adopt a budget resolution. Section 111(a) of the BBA provides enforcement provisions for FY2014 and beyond. Sections 115 and 116 include similar provisions for FY2015 in the House and Senate. The constitutional authority of Congress allows it to include enforceable budgetary levels in any legislative vehicle it chooses, whether in chamber rules, a concurrent resolution, or a statute. This authority also permits Congress to waive its rules in certain circumstances, regardless of where the rule-making provisions are established. The Budget Act allows for budget resolutions to establish budgetary levels, which are enforceable regardless of where they originate. The FY2014 budget resolution in the Bipartisan Budget Act did not include specific dollar amounts but required the Chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees to file budgetary totals consistent with spending caps. Once filed, these totals are enforceable as if they were included in a budget resolution. The FY2014 budget resolution in the Bipartisan Budget Act did not specify dollar amounts or priorities in functional categories, but once filed by the Chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees, the levels became enforceable. This provision is similar to the one in the Budget Control Act, where certain budgetary levels were filed for enforcement purposes. The Bipartisan Budget Act specified budgetary levels that are enforceable, including overall spending, revenue, and committee spending allocations. However, it did not include all required levels such as deficit and public debt. The Act functions in place of a traditional budget resolution and refers to previous actions concerning budget resolutions. The Bipartisan Budget Act specifies enforceable budgetary levels, including overall spending and revenue allocations. It refers to previous actions concerning budget resolutions, with specific language in Section 113 ensuring the continuation of certain provisions and deficit-neutral reserve funds from previous Congresses. The Bipartisan Budget Act establishes enforceable budgetary levels for FY2014 and FY2015, with provisions that can be supplanted by future actions. Authority for these provisions in the House is in Section 115, and in the Senate in Section 116. This authority expires if a concurrent resolution on the budget is passed. The authority for budgetary levels in the Bipartisan Budget Act will expire if a concurrent resolution on the budget for FY2015 is agreed to by the Senate and House of Representatives. This language is similar to the provisions in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The variations in content, format, and structure may impact the privileged nature of a measure intended to be considered as a budget resolution on the House and Senate floor. The Budget Act allows for expedited procedures for a budget resolution on the House and Senate floor, but only if it meets specific qualifications. The Bipartisan Budget Act provisions in Section 111 set parameters for future budgetary legislation, including increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2014 to $520 billion and $492 billion, respectively. The Act required the submission of spending levels for appropriations committees consistent with these limits, which were enacted on January 17, 2014. The Bipartisan Budget Act increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2014. Section 111 specifies levels for mandatory spending and revenue, keeping them at current law levels. Chairs of Budget Committees submit statements with these levels, consistent with the May 2013 baseline adjusted for the Act's effects. Levels were filed in the House and Senate, becoming enforceable. The Bipartisan Budget Act increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2014. The BBA budget resolution included procedural provisions like points of order and adjustments. These adjustments allow the chairs of the Budget Committees to modify budget allocations in the future under certain conditions. The Budget Committee chairman can submit revised levels to the chamber if certain conditions are met, allowing policies to be considered without violating budget resolution levels. Adjustments and reserve funds must be deficit-neutral, requiring excess amounts to be offset to prevent increasing the deficit. The Budget Committee chairman can revise budget levels to avoid a point of order, with reserve funds not always needing to be deficit-neutral. They can allow spending or revenue levels to be breached if policy legislation meets reserve fund requirements. An example is a deficit-neutral reserve fund for a Farm Bill, allowing revisions to allocations for related legislation. The Agricultural Act of 2014, also known as the \"Farm bill,\" was considered by the House and Senate after the enactment of P.L. 113-67. The Senate revised budgetary levels for the FY2014 budget resolution to accommodate the Farm bill conference report. Mrs. MURRAY explains the authority to adjust enforceable levels in the Senate for a farm bill under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. The conference agreement on H.R. 2642, the Agricultural Act of 2014, fulfills the requirements for deficit-neutral reserve funds. The agreement on H.R. 2642, the Agricultural Act of 2014, fulfills deficit-neutral reserve fund conditions for a farm bill. Budgetary aggregates and allocations to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry are adjusted accordingly. Senators have concerns about adjustment provisions potentially allowing for legislative questions to pass with a simple majority instead of a three-fifths threshold. The committee chair is revising budgetary levels to prevent a point of order against legislation, impacting budgetary rules but not other procedural requirements. The BBA includes provisions for FY2015 budget resolution if not agreed upon by April 15, 2014. The BBA increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2015. If a budget resolution is not agreed upon by April 15, 2014, committee chairs will submit spending levels for FY2015. The BBA also specifies levels for mandatory spending and revenue in the absence of agreement. The BBA increased defense and nondefense discretionary spending caps for FY2015. If a budget resolution is not agreed upon by April 15, 2014, committee chairs will submit spending levels for FY2015, including mandatory spending and revenue levels consistent with the most recent baseline of the Congressional Budget Office. Congress can still act on a budget resolution for FY2015 regardless of the BBA's enforceable budgetary levels. The House Budget Committee, led by Representative Paul Ryan, enforced spending levels for FY2015 as per the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA). The Senate Budget Committee, chaired by Senator Patty Murray, also filed similar spending levels in the Congressional Record. Despite not reporting a budget resolution, the Senate may still consider one. Senate precedent discharges the Budget Committee if no resolution is reported by April 1. This led to the Senate Budget Committee being discharged of the House-passed budget resolution for FY2015. The House-passed budget resolution for FY2015 (H.Con.Res. 96) was received in the Senate and referred to the Senate Budget Committee on April 11. Any Senator can make a non-debatable motion to proceed to its consideration under Senate precedent."
