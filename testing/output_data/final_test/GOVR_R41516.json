    "content": "The President and Congress both play a role in federal spending and revenue policy. The budget decisions are made annually without considering long-term concerns or goals. Recommendations have been made to ensure the budget is sustainable over the long term. Some groups argue that the current budget process lacks focus on long-term sustainability, leading to avoidance of difficult decisions and hiding long-term effects. Recommendations have been made to modify the budget process to address these concerns and focus on long-term budgetary outlook. The report focuses on long-term budgeting challenges and proposals to increase its focus in the budget process, beyond the traditional 5- or 10-year window. The purpose of the budget window is to evaluate legislation's impact on the current budget outlook and adherence to rules. The 10-year budget window is used by Congress to consider current and future budget implications. The Congressional Budget Office provides a baseline projection for 10 years to assist in decision making. This baseline has been used since 1996 and serves as a starting point for the budget resolution agreement between the House and Senate. The budget resolution, an enforceable framework for annual budget decisions, typically spans a 5-year window but can extend up to 10 years. When Congress fails to reach an agreement, spending and revenue decisions are not clearly defined. The President's annual budget request includes a 10-year outlook, prepared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). OMB's budget projections cover the current law baseline, current policy baseline, and proposed policy projection over a 10-year period. The budget process lacks a long-term focus, leading to inaction on known fiscal issues. CBO and JCT provide estimates on legislation impact for Congress to consider. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires estimates to cover a five-year period for budget resolution compliance. The House and Senate have PAYGO rules to ensure deficit neutrality of new spending or revenue legislation. Members can raise a point of order to enforce the rules, which can be waived by a majority vote in the House or a three-fifths vote in the Senate. The House PAYGO rule must be re-adopted in each new Congress, while the Senate rule is set to expire in 2017. Statutory PAYGO, enacted in 2010, enforces deficit neutrality on new revenue and mandatory spending over a five-year and ten-year period. Statutory PAYGO enforces deficit neutrality on overall mandatory spending and revenue legislation enacted over the entire session. The President issues a sequestration order if a debit is recorded on the PAYGO scorecard, implementing across-the-board cuts in non-exempt direct spending programs. Amending statutory PAYGO would require new legislation. Data already exist to evaluate the country's long-term budget issues. Data already exist in publicly available formats to evaluate the country's long-term fiscal health, including projections and options for reducing the budget deficit. Long-term budgetary data is used for informational purposes to assist with congressional decision making, while rules affecting long-term outcomes are used for enforcement purposes.OMB's long-term projections are included in the primary government publications. The CBO periodically publishes The Long-Term Budget Outlook, focusing on projections up to 2035 with additional data available up to 2084. The report presents scenarios for federal spending, revenues, and debt under different assumptions, addressing budgetary pressures from aging demographics and healthcare costs. The report presents estimates of the \"fiscal gap\" and 75-year projections for current programs based on various variables. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) also produces a similar report on the long-term budget outlook. All agree that the budget is on an unsustainable path due to projected long-term growth in Medicare, Medicaid, and other factors. The unsustainable path is driven by projected long-term growth in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, not matched by revenue growth. Trustees issue actuarial estimates for the trust funds over 75 years, showing deficits between expenditures and income. The reports do not address the programs' impact on the overall budget. The Department of the Treasury's Financial Report of the United States Government provides a comprehensive financial outlook using accrual-based accounting methods. The report presents a balance sheet for the federal government using accrual-based accounting methods, including certain liabilities on a net present value basis. It does not consider future projected shortfalls of Social Security and Medicare as official liabilities but provides estimates of their long-term actuarial deficits. Existing enforcement mechanisms like PAYGO apply to shorter budget windows, with exceptions in the Senate regarding deficit-increasing reconciliation measures outside the budget resolution window. In the Senate, a three-fifths vote can waive rules on deficit increases exceeding $5 billion in any 10-year period from 2019 to 2058. In the House, legislation cannot increase Social Security benefits or decrease taxes beyond specified limits. Additionally, legislation causing a net increase in mandatory spending over $5 billion in any four consecutive 10-year periods after the budget window is not allowed. Large budget deficits have persisted over the past several fiscal years, with federal debt as a percentage of GDP rising from 36% in 2007 to roughly 62% by the end of 2010. Deficits are projected to continue growing beyond the 10-year budget window, potentially reaching nearly 90% by 2020 and 185% by 2035. This accumulation of debt would lead to increased interest payments, reduced national savings, and other negative economic impacts. The current process of budget deficits and debt accumulation raises concerns about reduced national savings, increased interest rates, and long-term fiscal challenges. Critics argue that delaying necessary changes exacerbates an already unsustainable outlook, making it harder to address future problems effectively. To reduce entitlement benefits for the elderly, a longer phase-in period would make it easier to exempt those already retired. The 10-year scoring window incentivizes legislation to be less costly within that timeframe, leading to provisions that may increase the deficit in the long run. For example, Roth IRAs generate short-term revenue but lose revenue in the long run due to tax exemptions on accumulated growth. Alternative perspectives on long-term budgeting suggest that the nation's fiscal challenges are well understood, with potential solutions already identified. The main challenge in addressing fiscal sustainability lies in the automatic nature of current revenue and mandatory spending policies, which are unsustainable in the long term. Merely shifting to long-term budgeting will not solve this issue. The key problem is reaching consensus on changes to revenues or spending, rather than just altering the budget process. Budget process reform cannot replace the tough decisions needed for long-term fiscal sustainability. The current deficit does not require detailed knowledge of the long-term budget outlook. Longer budget windows may be needed to address fiscal issues. Some believe that budget process reform is not the solution, as the problem lies in reaching consensus on changes to revenues or spending. If Congress adopts a budget process with a long-term focus, challenges include addressing automatic mandatory spending, revenue, projection uncertainty, and binding future Congresses to current goals. Mandatory spending makes up three-fifths of federal spending, with programs like Medicare and Medicaid being automatic. Integrating information for enforcing budget goals may be difficult. The federal budget faces challenges in addressing automatic mandatory spending and revenue, which make up a significant portion of federal spending. Changes to the budget process are needed to deal with the growth of these programs in the long run and ensure sustainability. The permanence of most mandatory spending and revenue laws poses a challenge in making necessary adjustments to meet long-term goals. The permanent nature of mandatory spending and revenue laws poses challenges for long-term budgeting due to fixed formulas leading to fiscal imbalance. Long-term projections for budget decisions are uncertain and sensitive to small changes in assumptions and economic factors, with substantial margins of error even over short periods of time. Small errors in structural factors can compound over time, leading to significant differences in long-term totals. Programmatic changes based on projections may result in over- or under-shooting fiscal goals. CBO estimates a 50% chance of the budget deficit being 0.5 percentage points of GDP higher or lower than projected for the current year, and 2.2 percentage points for five years in the future. Legislative spending increases in the past decade were mainly due to unforeseen events like 9/11, military outlays, natural disasters, and the 2008 financial crisis. Recent spending rises are linked to the economic downturn. Significant budget deficits have occurred in recent years due to economic downturns and legislation changes, leading to declines in revenues. Unpredictable events like the Great Depression and unforeseen emergencies make long-term budget projections challenging. Flexible mechanisms may be needed to address unexpected situations, but they could impact the overall goals of the budget process. Budget projections rely on simple rules of thumb, as more sophisticated projections are impractical for long-term planning. In long-term budget projections, assumptions include constant discretionary spending and revenues as a share of GDP, with healthcare spending initially growing faster than GDP but eventually aligning with GDP growth. Small changes to these assumptions can significantly impact outcomes over 75 years. For instance, federal healthcare spending is projected to increase from 5.5% to 10.9% of GDP by 2035, but varying growth rates could result in spending ranging from 8.7% to 11.5% of GDP. Incorporating long-term projections into official forecasts presents challenges due to differing rules of thumb. The official baseline rules of thumb differ from long-term projections, as simple extrapolations over 75 years would not reflect current policy. The 10-year baseline adjusts discretionary spending for inflation and allows tax provisions to expire, leading to challenges in binding future Congresses to budget plans. Congress may set plans for changes to future spending programs and the tax code to restore solvency, but future Congresses can change them. Without uniform objectives in the budget process, the President and Congress lack shared goals. Congressional interest in budget reform has increased due to budget deficits and public concern. President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, outside groups, and some members of Congress are proposing changes to the federal budget process to focus on long-term sustainability. These proposals aim to address issues with the current budget process, such as avoiding difficult long-term decisions, hiding the effects of budgetary decisions, and lacking incentives for deficit reduction. Proposals to address issues with the current budget process include extending the budget window, adopting a multi-year budget process, setting deficit targets, switching to accrual-basis accounting, and increasing budget decision transparency. Some suggest extending the budget window to 20 years for better insight into fiscal challenges and the effects of legislation beyond the current 5-10 year period. The current budget window overlooks the impact of spending and revenue provisions on the fiscal outlook. Currently, budget enforcement mechanisms like statutory PAYGO evaluate the effects of new provisions on the baseline over the next five or 10 years. To improve the long-term fiscal outlook, it may be necessary to extend budget projections beyond the current decade, considering the uncertainty associated with projections. Extending the budget window beyond 10 years should be approached with caution due to the potential for hiding costs of obligations or programs. Including projections beyond 10 years for informational purposes, not enforcement, could be beneficial. OMB, CBO, and Treasury already provide information up to 75 years that could be utilized. Budget reform advocates suggest a multi-year budget plan to achieve long-term goals. The current budget process includes multi-year information that is revised annually, allowing for flexibility in budget levels from year to year. Proposals for multi-year budget plans aim to establish consistent budget levels each year, potentially through a multi-year budget process or setting deficit targets annually. Proposals for biennial or multi-year budgeting aim to streamline the congressional workload by submitting budget proposals every few years, potentially covering multiple years in appropriation bills. Advocates argue that this approach would allow Congress to focus on other matters like executive branch oversight and long-term budget planning. Multi-year budgeting is seen as a tool for setting and adhering to deficit goals, but critics argue that it may be unrealistic to expect future Congresses to adhere to budgets set by previous ones. This could affect program implementation and delay funding decisions. Multi-year budgeting involves setting budget allocations for multiple years in advance, which could lead to avoidance of budget caps and increase contention during decision-making. One logistical issue is that all House rules, including the budget resolution, must be reaffirmed at the start of a new Congress. The House must reaffirm all rules, including the budget resolution, at the start of a new Congress. Future Houses may not adhere to previous budget goals, hindering a switch to a biennial budget process. Long-term budget reform proposals suggest setting deficit or debt targets for Congress and the President to follow. Targets can be in dollar terms or as a percentage of GDP, with GDP targets being more economically meaningful. Setting targets for deficit or debt in dollar terms or as a percentage of GDP poses challenges. Dollar targets face projection errors over time, while GDP targets add complexity and rely on lagging data. A hybrid system could mitigate these issues by using a percentage of GDP for long-term goals and converting current year totals into dollars annually. The choice between publicly held debt or unified budget deficit as the target is not crucial. In setting fiscal targets, the choice between deficit or debt targets is not crucial. Deficits lead to changes in publicly held debt. Annual deficit targets allow flexibility, while debt targets as a share of GDP accommodate economic growth. Enacting statutory fiscal goals may guide budgetary decisions. Enacting statutory fiscal goals can create national coherence in budget decisions, emphasizing a long-term solution to address the national debt. Congress and the President could agree on deficit targets or detailed spending and revenue proposals. However, an impasse in goal-setting could halt deficit reduction progress. The ambition of deficit or debt targets is a key consideration. Advocates debate the ambition of deficit or debt targets, with some favoring modest and gradual targets for easier achievement over the long term. They argue that more ambitious targets can lead to accounting gimmicks and may need to be revised later on. For example, the deficit targets set in 1985 were extended to 1993 instead of 1991. Advocates argue for more ambitious deficit or debt targets to address the fiscal imbalance effectively. They believe that smaller, gradual changes are disadvantageous as they only impact certain programs and lack political appeal. Comprehensive changes made at once are preferred to avoid a patchwork of legislative changes. The debate also includes whether to set a final target or interim targets for budget adjustments, with a final target providing more flexibility for unforeseen contingencies. Advocates argue for more ambitious deficit or debt targets to address the fiscal imbalance effectively. They believe that comprehensive changes made at once are preferred to avoid a patchwork of legislative changes. Setting annual deficit targets would require the President to submit a budget consistent with these goals, determined by the House and Senate budget committees based on CBO projections. The budget resolution would establish spending and revenue levels based on CBO projections, with committee allocations to meet savings targets. Enforcement mechanisms, such as a point of order, would ensure adherence to deficit levels. Congress may consider waivers for specific circumstances like war or recession. Instead of precise deficit targets, a longer-term goal with interim annual goals could be set. Setting a longer-term goal with flexible interim annual goals may be more effective in budget planning. Revisions to annual targets can be made if projections are incorrect, and strong economic performance could accelerate meeting the longer-term target. However, flexibility on interim targets could hinder the ultimate goal if used to avoid unpopular steps. Statutory deficit levels could serve as guidance or include enforcement mechanisms. Enforcement mechanisms for budget targets can range from setting long-term national goals to more severe measures like sequestration. Without explicit enforcement, targets may be ignored during difficult periods. Sequestration involves automatic spending cuts when targets are breached. The sequestration process has been historically used in budget processes with enforcement mechanisms like congressional points of order. However, relying solely on points of order may not be sufficient as they can be waived, and future Congresses could modify the rules. To ensure adherence to deficit targets, additional provisions, likely expedited congressional procedures, would be needed to compel legislative changes. Forcing Congress to agree on spending or revenue changes to meet targets is logistically challenging. The reconciliation process, established by the Budget Act, facilitates changes to spending, revenue, and debt-limit laws to align with fiscal priorities. It includes expedited floor procedures and has been used for deficit reduction. Some argue for safer enforcement mechanisms, like congressional points of order, to provide flexibility in emergency situations. Enforcement mechanisms like sequestration have also offered flexibility in specific economic and domestic scenarios. Sequestration has been used as an enforcement mechanism in budget and budget process reform, allowing for suspension in wartime or during a recession. If real economic growth is projected to be negative in two consecutive quarters, or if actual growth is below 1% in two consecutive quarters, deficit reduction provisions can be suspended through a joint resolution enacted by Congress. This mechanism was part of The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and continued in various forms until 2002. Sequestration is used to enforce Statutory PAYGO, where new legislation can trigger across-the-board cuts to non-exempt direct spending programs to offset deficits. The threat of sequestration forcing action has been disputed by those who experienced it under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The threat of sequestration is seen as less politically painful than specific spending cuts. Projection errors can undermine deficit targets, with only discretionary spending levels directly determined by Congress. Revenue and mandatory spending levels are influenced by statutory formulas and changing circumstances. Significant legislation has been enacted to meet annual deficit targets, but projection errors can lead to missed targets due to unexpected economic conditions. Enforcement mechanisms may be automatically applied or only to original budget resolutions. The enforcement of deficit targets applies to discretionary spending, mandatory spending, and revenue components, but the extent of enforcement and proportionality is unclear. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) created a \"firewall\" between discretionary and direct spending, setting caps for discretionary spending enforced by sequestration. PAYGO was established to enforce deficit reductions through changes to revenues and direct spending. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 limited Congress's ability to enact new direct spending and revenue legislation through sequestration. Critics argue that budget enforcement mechanisms like sequestration focus only on spending, not revenue, leading to unfair deficit impacts. Suggestions have been made for an automatic revenue surcharge to accompany a sequester, but implementing a sophisticated, proportional mechanism would require long-term alterations. Despite criticism for being formulaic, across-the-board enforcement mechanisms can be tailored to exempt certain areas. Under Statutory PAYGO, cuts can be tailored to exempt certain programs, reducing effectiveness for deficit reduction. Exemptions include Medicare payments, estate tax, AMT, and certain income tax cuts. Some programs are also exempt from sequestration, such as Social Security and Railroad Retirement benefits. Under sequestration, certain programs are exempt, including Social Security, Tier I Railroad Retirement benefits, federal employee retirement and disability programs, SSI, SNAP, CHIP, TANF, veterans' programs, net interest, refundable income tax credits, Medicaid, and unemployment compensation. In 2010, these exemptions accounted for about half of total federal spending. Sequestration can be tailored to shield non-exempt programs, with previous limits on Medicare reductions to 4%. Outlays and revenues are recorded on a cash-flow basis in primary federal budget documents. Critics argue that cash-flow budgeting hides the impact of entitlement programs for the elderly on long-term fiscal solvency, notably Social Security, Medicare, and parts of Medicaid. The primary source of the projected long-term fiscal imbalance is the growth in elderly entitlement spending without a corresponding increase in overall revenues. Switching from cash-flow accounting to accrual-basis accounting could capture the effects of future entitlement growth on the current budget. Switching from cash-flow accounting to accrual-basis accounting would record obligations as they are incurred, capturing the impact of future entitlement growth on the current budget. Accrual-based accounting is used by private corporations to record future pension and health benefits promised to workers. Switching to accrual-basis accounting for federal budgeting may not necessarily require the government to hold assets to back accrued future benefits, unlike private corporations who must do so to maintain solvency of benefit plans. Government can legislate changes to benefits at any time, while corporations cannot alter legally guaranteed benefits once contracted. Deficits in corporate plans must be made up over time by increasing assets, unlike the government which may not have the same requirement. A shift to accrual-basis budgeting would make the fiscal imbalance more visible, potentially increasing pressure to address it. This would move the shortfall in entitlement programs for the elderly to the present budget, with Social Security facing a $17.5 trillion shortfall and Medicare Part A facing a $6.9 trillion shortfall. According to the Social Security trustees, Medicare Part A has a $6.9 trillion shortfall and Medicare Part B has a $10.6 trillion shortfall in present value terms. Shifting to accrual-basis accounting may reduce transparency in the budget deficit and federal debt. Accrual-basis accounting for future entitlements can be manipulated due to uncertainty in assumptions about demographic and economic factors. Some argue it is unnecessary as the long-term fiscal imbalance is well-known and captured in other official measures. Accrual-based estimates are available in the Financial Report of the United States Government but do not include elderly entitlement programs as liabilities on the balance sheet. Transitioning to accrual-basis accounting raises technical questions about historical budget revisions and the potential need for presenting two sets of books. This switch could impact comprehension of budget issues for policymakers and the public. Transitioning to accrual-basis accounting raises questions about how to record elderly entitlement programs and whether to adopt a hybrid system. This change could improve budget transparency, leading to better understanding of long-term fiscal challenges and encouraging policymakers to address debt reduction goals. Making long-term budget information more prominent may garner public support for solutions and pressure policymakers to reach a consensus. The report discusses long-term budget proposals to increase transparency, such as a longer budget window and prominent debt targets. However, complex concepts like the fiscal gap and accrual accounting may hinder public understanding. Another suggestion is for the President to address the nation annually on progress towards fiscal goals and future plans. Budget projections show declining deficits over the budget window, but analysts argue that this gives a misleading impression of the long-term fiscal imbalance. The gradual growth in elderly entitlement spending leads to significant increases over time. Baseline deficit projections are downward biased due to calculation methods, resulting in higher revenue estimates and slower growth of discretionary spending. OMB and CBO use assumptions from budget enforcement legislation to compute baseline projections following current law. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) uses legislative and macroeconomic assumptions to estimate baseline projections under current law. Assumptions include constant discretionary spending, expiration of tax cuts after 2010, and lapsing of AMT patches. The baseline may omit military costs depending on enacted legislation. If misunderstood, the baseline could provide a misleadingly positive outlook on the fiscal situation. Congress could consider revising statutory assumptions for budget transparency. Congress could consider revising statutory assumptions for budget transparency to gain a more realistic picture of the budget deficit. While some argue that greater transparency is unnecessary due to the well-known fiscal imbalance, others believe the issue lies in a lack of consensus on how to solve the problem. Postponing a decision may be preferred by those affected, as potential solutions like higher taxes or lower spending are likely to be perceived as painful."
