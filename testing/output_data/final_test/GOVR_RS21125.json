They are responsible for protecting vessels and harbors from subversive acts under various acts and have duties in evaluating, boarding, and inspecting commercial ships. The Coast Guard, as part of DHS, is responsible for evaluating, boarding, and inspecting commercial ships approaching U.S. waters, countering terrorist threats in U.S. ports, and protecting U.S. Navy ships in ports. The Captain of the Port (COTP) oversees security and safety in each port area. FY2005-FY2008 funding for the Coast Guard's five homeland security missions is detailed in Table 1, with a request of about $4.5 billion for FY2008. Performance targets were met for two missions in FY2006 but not for the other three. Potential issues for Congress regarding the Coast Guard's homeland security operations include sufficiency of funding, assets, and personnel for both homeland and non-homeland security missions, budget allocation, interoperability with other authorities, compliance monitoring of security plans, and risk assessment and prioritization for ports. The Coast Guard assesses security risks to ports, prioritizes funding, completes foreign port security assessments, implements vessel-tracking systems, AIS, inland waterway security, and response plans for security incidents. DHS Inspector General's report highlighted challenges in balancing resources for homeland security missions, maintaining fleet readiness, and increasing resources for non-homeland security. The Coast Guard faces challenges in balancing resources for homeland security missions and increasing resources for non-homeland security missions. Despite dedicating more resource hours to homeland security missions since FY 2001, meeting performance goals remains difficult. The Coast Guard has been more successful in meeting goals for traditional non-homeland security missions, but there is still room for improved performance. The Coast Guard achieved only 26% of its homeland security goals, facing challenges in balancing resources for missions. Growth in total resource hours has leveled off, limiting their ability to respond to extended crises without additional assets. To improve performance, a comprehensive performance management system must be implemented, and experienced personnel must be available to meet increased workload demands. The Coast Guard has worked hard to meet maritime homeland security responsibilities, but there are areas for improvement in ensuring security plans are carried out vigilantly. A prototype port security system called Project Hawkeye in Miami aims to create a maritime equivalent of an air traffic control system. The Coast Guard's efforts to create a maritime security system in Miami, known as Project Hawkeye, have fallen short of expectations. Long-range surveillance cameras and radar have limitations in identifying vessels, hindering progress in defending against maritime attacks despite significant investments since 2001. The Coast Guard's Project Hawkeye in Miami aimed to track vessels for security purposes using radar and cameras. Sophisticated software would analyze data to identify potential threats, alerting officials to suspicious activity. The surveillance covered an area from Fort Lauderdale to the Florida Keys, helping monitor ships and security contractors. The Coast Guard's Project Hawkeye in Miami aimed to track vessels for security purposes using radar and cameras. However, the cameras are not powerful enough to track small boats approaching inlets, and the radar system is unreliable. The Automated Identification System, required for large ships, is not tamperproof, raising security concerns. The surveillance system in Miami for tracking vessels is incomplete, with the software system not yet installed and limited data being used. The Coast Guard has only assigned volunteers to handle the data due to its limited value. Expansion of the system to other ports has been delayed until at least 2014 due to challenges and lack of funding from Congress. The Automated Vessel Tracking System has been used by businesses worldwide, providing real-time information during emergencies like Hurricane Katrina. However, the Coast Guard is not utilizing the system as mandated by Congress, raising concerns about the effectiveness of tracking ships approaching U.S. ports. The Coast Guard must start a pilot program for a system to track 2,000 ships for maritime security and emergencies. Lawmakers suggest using the maritime industry's vessel tracking system instead of the current radio-based one. The proposed system, used by nonprofit maritime organizations for five years, uses satellite technology to monitor ships via emergency beacons for data on vessel name, owner, location, speed, and course. The vessel tracking system, created in 1999 by Yukon Fuel Co., allows tracking of ships' routes and monitoring of their activities. Secure Asset Reporting Services Inc. was formed to market the system, with only Evergreen Marine Corp. agreeing to test it so far. Many major shipping companies have yet to sign on to the system."
