The transition period starts after the general election in November and ends on January 20. This report focuses on succession procedures during the transition and the presidential election campaign period. The period between the first and second terms of consecutive Presidents is not considered a presidential transition. Presidential transitions in the past half-century have been characterized by high activity levels and improvisation as the President-elect's team finalizes personnel and policy arrangements within just over 10 weeks. The process becomes more complex when a new President replaces a retiring or defeated incumbent, or when there is a change in political party control of the executive branch. Succession and disability procedures for the President-elect and Vice President-elect are also important during this period. The disability procedures for the President-elect and Vice President-elect during the presidential election period and transition are based on political party rules, federal law, and constitutional provisions. Congress may need to make succession-related decisions in cases of death or disability. Vacancies in a national party ticket during the election campaign do not technically occur during the transition, but questions about party procedures may arise. During the presidential general election campaign period, if a major party nominee dies, resigns, or becomes disabled, party procedures would be invoked to designate a replacement candidate. Democrats vote per capita, while Republicans vote by state. This process ensures continuity in the campaign and transition period. In 1972, Democratic vice presidential nominee Senator Thomas F. Eagleton resigned, and Senator George McGovern selected R. Sargent Shriver as a replacement. In 1912, Vice President James S. Sherman died before the election, and Nicholas M. Butler was nominated as a replacement by the Republican National Committee. Butler's appointment had no impact on the election outcome. In 1912, Vice President James S. Sherman died before the election, and Nicholas M. Butler was nominated as a replacement by the Republican National Committee. Butler's appointment was non-controversial, and did not impact the election outcome. Theodore Roosevelt's candidacy split the Republican vote, allowing Woodrow Wilson to win with a large electoral college majority. If a President-elect or Vice President-elect were to die or leave the ticket, the parties would follow established rules to designate a substitute nominee. In the event of the presidential nominee's death, confusion and controversy may arise among electors, potentially leading to a fragmentation of the electoral vote. The historical record does not offer clear guidance on how such a situation would be resolved. Horace Greeley, the 1872 presidential nominee, died after the election. Most of his electors voted for other candidates, and Congress did not count the votes for Greeley. However, Ulysses S. Grant won the election with 286 electoral votes. The question of the validity of Greeley's electoral votes was not a major concern due to Grant's landslide victory. The electoral college process and the possibility of appointing a replacement candidate were also discussed during the transition period. Presidential electors are seen as free agents who can vote as they choose, even if instructed otherwise by their party. In the event of a candidate's death, electors have historically followed party instructions, but there is potential for faithless electors, especially in a closely contested election. The succession procedures would be invoked if a President-elect or Vice President-elect were to die or leave the ticket. The succession process in the event of a President-elect or Vice President-elect's death or departure from the ticket revolves around when the candidates officially become elected after the electoral college votes are counted and declared by Congress. Presidential electors meet in December to cast their votes, with Congress convening on January 6 to count the electoral votes and declare the results. Some commentators question if a President- and Vice President-elect can be determined before electoral college results are certified. However, others argue that once a majority of electoral votes are cast, the winning candidates immediately become the President- and Vice President-elect. This view is supported by the 20th Amendment, which states that if the President-elect dies, the Vice President-elect assumes the role. The report addresses the question of when a President-elect is determined, stating that the term refers to the person who receives the majority of electoral votes or is chosen by the House of Representatives. The 20th Amendment does not specifically address vacancies due to reasons other than death, but allows Congress to provide for such situations. The 20th Amendment covers succession in the case of the death of the President-elect, where the Vice President-elect would take over. It does not address other circumstances like resignation or disability. If a President-elect fails to qualify, the Vice President-elect can nominate a replacement under the 25th Amendment. If the circumstances constitute a \"failure to qualify,\" the Vice President-elect would act as President until a President qualifies. The Vice President-elect could potentially serve a full term if the President-elect is disabled, resigns, fails to regain health, or dies. The 20th Amendment does not cover the death, disability, or departure of the Vice President-elect, but the President would nominate a successor after being inaugurated. Congress can pass laws for situations where neither the President-elect nor Vice President-elect qualify. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 outlines the order of succession if neither a President nor Vice President is able to discharge their duties. The Speaker of the House of Representatives would act as President in such a scenario, followed by the President pro tempore of the Senate and the secretaries of the principal executive departments. Congress has the authority to pass laws for situations where neither the President-elect nor Vice President-elect qualify. During the transition period, concerns about presidential succession under the Succession Act have increased, especially after the 9/11 attacks. The President-elect, Vice President-elect, Speaker, and President pro tempore would be covered by Secret Service protection, but the question of who would step forward in the event of an attack remains. During the transition period, concerns about presidential succession under the Succession Act have increased, especially after the 9/11 attacks. The question of who would step forward in the event of an attack on officials in the cabinet, an important element in the order of succession, remains unanswered. Cabinet officers must be confirmed by the Senate to act as President under the Succession Act, raising the possibility of an open issue in succession if none are confirmed. One safeguard could be for some officials in the line of presidential succession to not attend the inauguration ceremony. Since at least 1984, a designated survivor from the President's cabinet has not attended the State of the Union Message for continuity in the presidency. This practice became more urgent after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Congress also designates Senators and Representatives to not attend for legislative branch continuity. The Speaker of the House or the President pro tempore of the Senate could potentially serve as designated survivors during the President's inauguration and other public ceremonies to ensure executive continuity. This would also avoid delays in confirming incoming cabinet nominees. Retaining outgoing cabinet officers or other alternatives could prevent gaps in the line of presidential succession. Retaining outgoing cabinet officers or having incoming nominees confirmed before the inauguration could prevent gaps in the line of presidential succession. Cabinet secretaries do not have set terms, so they could continue in office until the new administration is installed. The outgoing President could also submit the successor's nominations to the Senate after the new Congress convenes. The retention of incumbent cabinet secretaries or the pre-inaugural nomination and confirmation of new cabinet secretaries depends on cooperation between the outgoing and incoming administrations. In 2008, President-elect Obama retained Secretary of Defense Gates until a successor was confirmed. In 2008, President-elect Obama retained Secretary of Defense Gates to ensure continuity in the Defense Department during two overseas military campaigns. Secretary Gates was designated to serve as the designated successor during the presidential inauguration ceremonies on January 20th. During the presidential inauguration, it is crucial to have a duly sworn cabinet officer in place to ensure continuity. Succession procedures are governed by party rules, federal law, and constitutional requirements. Replacements of candidates have occurred three times in history, all during the election campaign period and addressed by party rules. The 20th and 25th Amendments anticipate most succession contingencies during the transition period between the electoral college meetings and the President's inauguration. In the post-9/11 environment, attention has shifted to the potential for a terrorist incident during the presidential inauguration ceremonies that could affect the line of presidential succession. Options for ensuring executive continuity include having the Speaker of the House or President pro tempore of the Senate absent from the ceremony, expediting confirmation of incoming cabinet officers, retaining outgoing cabinet officers, or ensuring a confirmed cabinet officer does not attend the inauguration. The successful implementation of cabinet options during presidential transitions depends on good will and cooperation between the incumbent President and his successor, as well as between political parties in the Senate. The 2008-2009 transition from the George W. Bush administration to Barack H. Obama's was smooth and cooperative, setting a positive precedent for future transitions."
