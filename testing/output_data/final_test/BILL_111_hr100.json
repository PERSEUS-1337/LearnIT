    "content": "The \"Commonsense Auto Recovery Act of 2009\" is also known as the \"Sales Tax on Purchase of Automobile\" section, which amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a credit for sales tax on the purchase of an automobile. The \"Commonsense Auto Recovery Act of 2009\" provides a tax credit for qualified State and local automobile sales taxes paid on the purchase of a qualified vehicle, with a limitation that the purchase price cannot exceed $50,000. The term \"qualified State and local automobile sales taxes\" refers to any general sales tax imposed on the purchase of a qualified vehicle. The term 'qualified vehicle' refers to a motor vehicle with no more than 2 axles. A 'qualified taxpayer' is defined as an individual or a person who employed an average of less than 50 employees during the taxable year. All persons treated as a single employer under specific sections shall be considered a single employer for this purpose. The credit allowed for any vehicle under subsection (a) shall be reduced to avoid a double benefit. The credit under subsection (a) for a vehicle is reduced by the deduction allowed under section 164 for the same vehicle in the taxable year. No credit is allowed if the taxpayer chooses not to apply this section. The credit for property subject to depreciation is treated as a general business credit. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year is treated as a credit allowable under subpart A. The credit allowed shall not exceed the sum of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the sum of other credits allowable under subpart A. The section applies to property purchased before December 31, 2010. Conforming amendments are made to various sections of the Code by adding references to section 30E. The section applies to property purchased before December 31, 2010. Amendments are made to section 6501(m) and the table of sections for subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code by adding references to section 30E. Sales tax on purchase of automobile under Sec. 30E applies to vehicles bought after December 31, 2008."
