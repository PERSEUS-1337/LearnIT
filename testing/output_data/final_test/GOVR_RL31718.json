    "content": "Qatar declared independence in 1971 and is a constitutional monarchy governed by the Al Thani family. Emir Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani succeeded his father in 2013, marking a planned transition of power. The country has a population of approximately 2.1 million, with only 15% being citizens. Qatar is a constitutional monarchy governed by the Al Thani family. The small native population is not politically active, while the expatriate population of over 1.7 million has no political rights. The emir holds significant authority, with restrictions on political parties and freedom of speech. Religious conservatives have social influence, and the military answers to the emir. Elections for a Central Municipal Council were held in May 2011. The emir of Qatar holds significant authority and appoints members of his extended family and other leading figures to a governing Council of Ministers. Emir Tamim inherited a nation that transformed into an ambitious regional power under his father's tenure. The leadership transition in 2013 signaled a broad shift in government leadership to accommodate the interests of others besides the emir and his immediate family. The new emir of Qatar emphasized a mix of continuity and change in the country's policies, highlighting independence, respect for diverse political trends, religions, and rejection of sectarianism. He stressed the importance of unity among Arab communities for social and economic progress based on citizenship. The United States and Qatar had a diplomatic dispute in the late 1980s over Qatar's black market procurement of U.S.-made Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. This led to a freeze in economic and military cooperation, with Congress approving a ban on arms sales to Qatar. However, relations improved after Qatar allowed coalition forces to operate from its territory during the 1991 Gulf War. In January 1991, Qatari armored forces assisted coalition troops in repelling an Iraqi attack on the Saudi Arabian town of Kafji. Qatar signed a defense cooperation agreement with the United States in June 1992, leading to close coordination in military affairs. The United States recognized Shaykh Hamad's assumption of power in June 1995 and welcomed Qatar's defense cooperation. President Obama congratulated Emir Tamim in June 2013, and Qatari-U.S. defense relations have expanded to include cooperative exercises and base access agreements. In December 2013, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel visited Doha, met with Emir Tamim, and signed a new 10-year defense cooperation agreement, followed by agreements for $11 billion in advanced arms sales. Qatar's commitment to regional peace and support for U.S. military operations are highlighted, despite maintaining ties to Hamas and others critical of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. In 2009, U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Joseph LeBaron described Qatar's policy as occupying a middle ground in the Islamic world to maintain relationships across the ideological spectrum. Qatar's balancing strategy with the U.S., Iran, and Saudi Arabia is expected to continue, potentially leading to differing stances on certain issues. The U.S. has provided counterterrorism assistance and loan guarantees for natural gas projects in Qatar. The Obama Administration has phased out foreign assistance to Qatar. Qatar has been receiving U.S. foreign assistance since 1996, but this has been phased out by the Obama Administration. Qatar donated $100 million to Hurricane Katrina victims and continues to invest in the U.S. Several U.S. universities have campuses in Doha. Congressional action related to Qatar is limited to defense programs and military sales oversight. In the 113th Congress, congressional committees monitor U.S.-Qatari trade ties. Resolutions commend Emir Tamim and call for protection of migrant workers in Qatar, especially in preparation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A Congressional Caucus on Qatari-American partnerships remains active. Qatar relies on external cooperation for security due to its small size and population. The country's armed forces are the second smallest in the Middle East, with mandatory military training for males aged 18 to 35. Qatar has shifted towards advanced U.S. weapons systems through major arms sales since 2012, including Patriot missile batteries and Apache attack helicopters. Secretary Hagel announced a $11 billion weapons sale during his visit to Doha in July 2014. Qatar's purchase of U.S. weapons systems, including Patriot missile batteries, Apache attack helicopters, and Javelin anti-tank missiles, in 2014 is the highest value sale of U.S. weaponry to date. This purchase aligns with the trend of increased interest in such systems in the region to defend against potential missile attacks from Iran. France has supplied most of Qatar's arms inventory, including fighter aircraft. Qatar invested over $1 billion in constructing the Al Udeid air base in the 1990s. The Army Corps of Engineers awarded over $100 million in Military Construction Air Force contracts for U.S. storage, housing, and communication facilities at the Al Udeid airbase in Qatar. This base serves as a hub for U.S. Central Command operations in the region, with nearby Camp As Sayliyah housing significant military equipment and command facilities. Qatar and the United States have invested in these facilities since the mid-1990s, forming the main hub of the CENTCOM logistical network in the region. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have further utilized these facilities. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased the use of U.S. and partner-nation facilities in Qatar. These facilities may need additional investment to meet current and future needs related to military operations against extremist groups. Congress has allocated over $457 million for military construction activities in Qatar from FY2003 to FY2011. U.S.-Qatari counterterrorism cooperation has improved, despite past support from a Qatari royal family member to Al Qaeda figures. The Administration's recent Military Construction requests have not included funding for Qatar-based projects. The U.S. State Department has praised Qatar's counterterrorism efforts since 9/11, despite the presence of Hamas, Taliban, and Al Qaeda members in the country. Qatari officials deny supporting extremist groups but maintain a policy of strategic ambiguity. Emir Tamim has stated that Qatar does not and will not support terrorist organizations. Qatar's air force joined coalition military operations against Islamic State targets in Syria in September 2014. The U.S. government has not accused Qatar of supporting terrorist organizations, but private Qatari citizens and individuals in Qatar are alleged to provide such support. In 2014, U.S. Treasury referred to Qatar as a \"permissive\" terrorist financing jurisdiction but acknowledged Qatar's cooperation in countering terrorism. The U.S. Ambassador to Qatar mentioned an active dialogue with Qatar on counterterrorism efforts. In 2012, Qatar improved its counterterrorist financing regime and disrupted illicit cash flows with the help of the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force. Ambassador Shell Smith noted progress in convincing Qataris to refrain from supporting extremist groups in Syria. The Qatari central bank operates a financial intelligence unit that monitors banking activity and collaborates with similar units globally. US officials believe Qatar could enhance controls on financial activities to combat terrorist financing, as Qatari-based fundraisers pose a significant risk. The Government of Qatar engages with international partners on terrorist financing and has improved oversight of foreign charities receiving Qatari contributions. However, enforcement of anti-money laundering/counterterrorist financing laws is lacking, with gaps in outreach and enforcement activities. The State Department recommends Qatar to continue efforts in implementing AML/CFT regulations effectively. Qatar should enhance its institutional capacity, increase investigations and prosecutions, improve terrorist financing-related reporting, and implement UNSCRs freezing regime effectively. The US government has designated individuals involved in funding terrorist groups in the Gulf region, including a Qatar-based ISIL financial facilitator. The U.S. government designated Qatari national Abdelrahman bin Umayr al Nuaymi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist for allegedly financing Al Qaeda. Qatar's approach to regional affairs involves mediating conflicts with various parties, some hostile to the United States. Qatar responded boldly to regional unrest in 2011 and embraced political change. Qatar responded boldly to regional unrest in 2011, embraced political change, and aligned with Sunni Arab members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Emir Tamim's leadership raises questions about Qatar's support for Sunni Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood. Qatar's stance on the conflict in Syria has evolved over time. Emir Tamim initially promoted dialogue but shifted to a confrontational approach as violence escalated in 2012 and 2013. In a speech to the UN in 2014, he condemned the Assad regime for genocide and called for support for the Syrian people against terrorism. Qatar's assertive diplomacy has faced regional criticism, but its agility and soft power, including Al Jazeera's influence, have been notable. Qatar's agility and soft power, particularly through Al Jazeera, have positioned it as a key player in regional unrest since 2011. Despite active foreign policy, critics argue that Qatar's regional diplomacy has yielded few tangible results, except for the 2008 Doha agreement in Lebanon. Qatar's reported support for Sunni armed groups in Syria challenges its traditional preference for engaging with all sides in disputes. The country's unique willingness to engage directly with armed groups, shown through hostage negotiations and prisoner exchanges in 2014, complicates assessments of the costs and benefits of its policies. In June 2013, Qatar facilitated the opening of a political office in Doha for the Afghan Taliban to engage in negotiations. However, the office was closed in July 2013 due to a dispute over its nature, with Afghan government authorities protesting the Taliban's use of certain symbols. Qatar took steps to address the issue by removing disputed placards and flags. Qatari officials took steps to remove disputed placards and flags after Afghan President Karzai criticized plans for a Taliban office in Qatar. Despite this, Qatar remains an intermediary with the Taliban and hosted five Guantanamo prisoners as part of a prisoner-exchange agreement. The prisoners have stayed in Qatar and committed to not engaging in military or terrorism activities. Qatari officials are monitoring them to ensure compliance. In October 2014, two leaders of the Haqqani Network were arrested in Afghanistan after visiting released Taliban members in Qatar. The Taliban claimed the arrests violated the prisoner release agreement. Critics argue that the incident shows the terms of release were not strict enough. Qatar supports negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, despite not having formal diplomatic ties with Israel. Emir Tamim stated Qatar's commitment to solidarity with brotherly nations. Emir Tamim of Qatar reaffirmed the country's support for the Palestinian people's legitimate rights, including Israeli withdrawal from 1967 Arab territories, establishment of an independent Palestinian State, and the right of return for refugees. Qatar backs the Palestinian bid for recognition at the United Nations and criticizes Israeli actions that hinder a two-state solution. Some observers see Qatar's diplomatic stance as supportive of Hamas, especially since Khaled Meshaal moved to Doha in 2012. In 2012, chief Khaled Meshaal moved from Syria to Doha at Qatar's invitation. Qatar and Turkey proposed a ceasefire during the 2014 Gaza conflict, which was rejected. Qatar's Foreign Minister criticized Israel as the aggressor and demanded the lifting of the blockade on Gaza. Gaza residents have suffered since 1967, deprived of basic necessities. Qatar has provided financial assistance for reconstruction projects in Gaza and supported the Palestinian people's resistance against Israeli occupation. Emir Tamim condemned Israel's military strikes in Gaza as a crime against humanity at the U.N. General Assembly in September 2014. Qatar has supported reconstruction projects in Gaza and provided aid, but there are allegations that this assistance may benefit Hamas. Some Members of Congress have criticized Qatar for supporting Hamas, while Qatari officials deny this and claim to support the Palestinian people. Emir Tamim hosted meetings between PA President Abbas and Hamas leader in August 2014. In August 2014, Emir Tamim facilitated meetings between PA President Abbas and Hamas leader Meshaal in Doha to unify Palestinian negotiating positions for a potential ceasefire with Israel. Meshaal expressed gratitude for Qatar's support towards the Palestinian cause, emphasizing that it is for the people and not just Hamas. Qatar's former and current emirs have actively supported Gaza through visits, construction projects, and hosting meetings in Doha. Qatar has a history of supporting Palestinian rights, hosting meetings between Palestinian forces and President Abbas, and leading talks to expand Arab economic ties with Israel. The country closed an Israeli trade office in response to the 2009 Gaza War and has not reopened it. Qatar's position on the Arab boycott of Israel follows the GCC's 1994 decision to end indirect boycotts while maintaining the primary boycott. The country has backed its diplomacy with increased financial resources. Qatar's active diplomacy is supported by significant financial resources and economic influence, with a nominal GDP growth from $35 billion to $185 billion between 2000 and 2012. The country's per capita GDP is the highest globally, with hydrocarbon exports leading the way. Non-oil and gas sector growth reached 9% in 2012, and the IMF expects this sector to contribute more to the government's revenue in the future. Qatar bases its annual budgets on an assumed oil price of $65 per barrel, making it well-prepared for fluctuations in oil market prices. Qatar's fiscal surpluses are expected to continue through 2015, but may decrease in size. The government invests surplus revenue abroad and increases public spending on infrastructure, housing, and health. Limited criticism exists on budget transparency and spending priorities. Questions have been raised about Qatar's long-term ability to attract private sector investment post-infrastructure projects. Officials remain confident in economic prospects despite concerns. Qatar remains confident in its economic prospects post-2008 downturn, using the opportunity to reassess lessons learned during the boom. The country faces challenges in managing infrastructure and services due to a significant increase in population. To address these challenges, Qatari authorities have implemented national development strategies for sustainable growth by 2030. Qatar's national vision document, Vision 2030, aims for balanced growth by 2030. Emir Tamim bin Hamad led the project as heir apparent. The country plans to invest over $65 billion in infrastructure, including housing, roads, water, airports, and shipping facilities. Despite having less oil reserves than other Gulf producers, Qatar boasts the third-largest gas reserves globally. Qatar Petroleum has increased crude oil output but currently produces around 700,000 barrels per day. Qatar has reduced oil production to around 700,000 b/d to invest in technology for field productivity. Japan and South Korea are top importers of Qatari oil. Qatar is expanding gas extraction and LNG production with foreign investment, including partnerships with U.S. companies like ExxonMobil. The Export-Import Bank of the United States has provided over $1 billion in loan guarantees for Qatar's gas production facilities. Qatar's yearly natural gas production has increased significantly. Qatar has become the world's largest exporter of LNG, with over 60% of exports going to Asian markets. The country's gas development projects, including the largest gas-to-liquids facility, are based in Ras Laffan. Qatar also owns LNG import terminals in various countries, including the United States. The country has paused its rapid expansion of natural gas projects to await clearer market signals. Limited off-shore exploration activities are now underway in Qatar, as global economic uncertainty and natural gas market changes complicate demand projections for energy exports. Regional unrest has led to new opportunities for growth, such as Jordan constructing an LNG import terminal at Aqaba. The value of U.S. exports to Qatar reached $4.95 billion in 2013, mainly consisting of transport equipment, manufactured goods, and machinery. U.S. crude oil imports from Qatar have declined. In 2013, U.S. exports to Qatar reached $4.95 billion, with a decline in U.S. crude oil imports from Qatar. Qatar has not entered into a bilateral investment, trade, or taxation treaty with the United States, but they did sign a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in 2004. Qatar has made significant investments in the U.S., including a real estate project in Washington, DC, and a deal with Qatar Airways to purchase 50 Boeing 777 airplanes worth over $19 billion. The leadership transition in Qatar has opened a new chapter in U.S.-Qatari relations, with a focus on expanding defense cooperation. Emir Tamim's government is pursuing a quieter approach to diplomacy, while facing scrutiny over relationships with Islamists and armed groups. Qatari policymakers are expected to prioritize policies that consolidate political and economic gains, aiming for sustainable growth. Expanding U.S.-Qatari defense relations under the new Emir signals a stronger commitment to invest in relations with the United States. Decision makers in the U.S. are debating how to maintain improved defense and counterterrorism relations with Qatar while addressing regional security, human rights, political reform, and labor conditions."
