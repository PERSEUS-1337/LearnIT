    "content": "The federal government imposes excise taxes on alcoholic beverages at the manufacturer and importer level in the U.S. These taxes have a long history and have been used to fund emergency spending and reduce budget deficits. There are debates on whether to raise or lower alcohol excise tax rates to generate revenue or benefit alcohol firms. The report provides a history of alcohol excise tax rates, a revenue analysis accounting for inflation, an overview of the alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry, and an analysis of the effects of excise taxes on negative spillover effects from alcohol consumption. It also examines how the distribution of these taxes impacts equity in the federal tax code. The report briefly summarizes relevant bills introduced in the 114th Congress regarding federal alcohol excise tax policy. Alcohol excise taxes have been driven by the need for additional revenue since 1791. Higher alcohol taxes are argued to reduce negative spillover effects on society, although this argument is less prominent compared to other \"sin taxes\" like tobacco. Congress enacted a comprehensive alcohol excise tax system in 1934 after the end of Prohibition to address federal budget deficits. The alcohol excise tax system was established in 1934 to address federal budget deficits during the Great Depression. Tax rates gradually increased from 1934 to 1951, funding spending for World War II and the Korean War. In 1985, the tax rate on distilled spirits was raised to $12.50 per proof gallon. The tax rates on wine were unchanged from 1951 until the passage of OBRA90 in 1990. The rates now range from $1.07 to $3.40 per wine gallon, with a small domestic wineries credit provided. Champagne and sparkling wine tax rates were not increased. The tax rates on beer were increased by the Revenue Act of 1951 and further adjusted by OBRA90 in 1991. The current rate is $18 per barrel for most brewers, with a reduced rate of $7.00 per barrel for small brewers producing up to 60,000 barrels annually. Brewers producing over 2,000,000 barrels must pay the full $18 rate on all production. The tax rates on alcohol beverages were set in 1991 and remain in effect. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau converts these rates into common package measures. Beer and wine are taxed at lower rates compared to distilled spirits based on their alcohol content. Beer is taxed at $18 per gallon, while spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon. Wine is taxed at $1.07 per wine. The excise tax rates on different types of alcohol vary, with liquor drinks taxed at approximately 13 cents per 1.5 ounce shot, wine at 4 cents per 5 ounce glass, and beer at 5 cents per 12 ounce can or bottle. The tax is deductible as a business cost, and manufacturers can reduce their taxable income. In the past, TTB has enforced two other forms of taxes on the alcohol industry: Floor stocks tax and Special occupational tax (SOT). Floor stocks tax is a one-time tax on untaxed inventories to prevent stockpiling before tax rate increases. SOT is imposed on manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, and retailers in certain industries. The Equity Act (P.L. 109-59) permanently repealed the Special Occupational Tax (SOT) for alcohol businesses, effective July 1, 2008. Despite being a small portion of TTB's tax collections, SOT was eliminated while recordkeeping and registration requirements remained. States and localities also impose their own excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, with varying rates by type of alcohol. Some states control sales through state-run retailers, with infrequent policy changes in alcohol excise tax rates. In FY2015, federal excise tax collections on alcoholic beverages totaled approximately $10.4 billion, with distilled spirits accounting for 55.1%, beer for 34.5%, and wine for 10.3%. The majority of alcohol excise taxes are collected on products manufactured in the United States, particularly beer. Differences in tax rates between states could lead consumers to cross state lines to purchase alcohol. Alcohol excise tax rates in the United States vary by type of alcohol, with historical shares ranging from 16%-27% for distilled spirits, 18%-32% for wine, and 5%-16% for beer. Tax rates are not adjusted for inflation, but past increases were meant to partially account for it. Despite rate increases, inflation-adjusted values have decreased over time. For example, a $10.50 tax rate on spirits in 1951 would be equivalent to $95.85 in 2015. Since the last alcohol tax rate increase in 1991, the inflation-adjusted value of tax collections on alcohol has declined. Nominal alcohol excise tax collections increased from $7.2 billion in FY1991 to $10.4 billion in FY2015, but after adjusting for inflation, real excise tax collections declined by 10.1%. Alcohol excise tax collections have also decreased as a share of all of TTB's excise tax collections over time. The decline in alcohol excise tax revenue collections as a share of all TTB excise tax collections is attributed to the decrease in real value of the alcohol excise tax rate over time, increases in tobacco product tax rates, and automatic inflation adjustments for firearms and ammunition taxes. Alcohol excise tax collections accounted for 57.7% in FY1990, increased to approximately 60% after tax rate increases in OBRA90, but dropped to 40.7% in FY2015. This decline was influenced by higher taxes on tobacco products in the late 1990s and 2009. The U.S. alcoholic beverages industry saw a peak in retail sales of $211.6 billion in 2014, with beer accounting for the largest share. The industry is characterized by market sales concentration and a high rate of new entrants in craft distilling, brewing, and winemaking. The alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry is dynamic, with a flux in the craft market. It is easier to estimate sales statistics than to track the net growth of firms. The Department of the Treasury's TTB publishes data on firms holding permits, but much of it requires a FOIA request. Industry trade associations provide alternative estimates due to classification issues and the rise of craft manufacturers. The alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry is dynamic, with a flux in the craft market. Industry trade associations provide alternative estimates of the number of firms operating in the industry, showing geographic concentration in states like California, Washington, New York, and Oregon. Alcoholic beverage manufacturers are more dispersed across states compared to cigarettes. Analysis of employment in the alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry is limited by methodological issues and a lack of data on importers. Total employment in the industry was 75,247 in 2014, accounting for less than 1% of total U.S. manufacturing employment. Net employment in breweries and distilleries has been flat or negative, despite the entry of craft manufacturers, while employment levels have increased among wineries. Efforts to adjust alcohol excise taxes raise questions about their impact on supply, demand, and social costs. Advocates for lower taxes argue that higher rates could lead to job losses and economic contraction in the industry. This section of the report delves into these issues in detail. Advocates for lower alcohol excise taxes argue that higher rates could lead to job losses in the industry. Economic theory suggests that excise tax increases are generally passed on to consumers in the long run, with prices being affected by the responsiveness of producers and consumers in competitive and imperfectly competitive markets. Multiple empirical studies support the notion that previous alcohol excise tax increases are usually passed along to consumers. Empirical studies show that alcohol excise tax increases are typically passed on to consumers quickly and in full. While producers may initially bear some of the burden, it is unlikely to result in significant job losses in the industry or at a macroeconomic level. Past changes in tax rates do not seem to have a clear impact on employment levels in the alcoholic beverage manufacturing industry. The decline in industry employment started in the mid-1980s and only began to reverse in the mid-1990s, with the 1990 tax rate increase not significantly affecting this trend. The decline in industry employment in the 1980s may have been influenced by technological advances and a general economic slowdown. Economists advocate for taxes and regulations on alcohol consumption to address negative spillover effects on society, known as externalities. Alcohol consumption is associated with negative externalities, leading to oversupply in the market without policies to adjust prices. Researchers have studied the negative externalities of alcohol consumption on various aspects such as motor vehicle crashes, public health, domestic violence, and crime, especially among youth. Some economists argue that alcohol excise tax collections from individual consumers are insufficient to cover the total societal costs imposed by alcohol consumption. Several studies highlight the complex social issues related to alcohol consumption from a public policy perspective. The Manning study focused on external costs of alcohol consumption, acknowledging the challenges in differentiating between excessive and non-excessive drinking. The Manning study averages external costs of alcohol consumption at 48 cents per ounce. Some argue that across-the-board tax increases may not be the best solution, suggesting prevention and treatment for alcohol abuse instead. Studies show a link between alcohol abuse and criminal behavior. Researchers have found that over half of inmates in prison for violent crimes or property damage had a history of alcohol treatment or disorder. Non-tax alternatives, such as changes to minimum legal drinking age laws, have been effective in reducing alcohol-related incidents. However, the effectiveness of some non-tax alternatives is debated among researchers. Research suggests that increasing tax rates on alcohol can effectively reduce negative externalities, such as drunk driving, as it impacts a wide range of consumers. Price elasticity measures show that alcohol price hikes can significantly decrease societal effects of problematic drinking, even among youth. Federal rate increases may be more effective than state increases to prevent consumers from seeking cheaper options across borders. Some argue for varying tax levels based on the social costs of different alcoholic beverage categories. Alcohol tax increases should be based on social costs, with beer bearing the largest share due to its link to excessive drinking. Consumers may switch to spirits and wine if beer prices rise. Tax equity is measured by vertical and horizontal equity, with a progressive tax system favoring higher-income households. Beer accounts for the largest share of alcohol sales in the US. A tax system can be progressive or regressive, with higher-income households paying a greater share of their income in taxes. Horizontal equity means households with similar abilities to pay should pay similar amounts in tax. Excise taxes, like alcohol excise taxes, are generally regressive, with lower-income households paying a higher share of their income in tax. Data on alcohol consumption serves as an indirect measure of excise tax impact on consumers. Consumption data on alcoholic beverages indirectly measures the regressivity of alcoholic beverage taxes. While lower-income households spend a higher share of their income on alcohol, overall spending on alcohol is more evenly distributed compared to non-alcoholic beverages or food. The excise tax on alcohol is likely more regressive than spending, as higher-income consumers tend to buy more expensive alcohol where the tax is a smaller component of the price. Alcohol excise taxes are less regressive than tobacco taxes. Different types of alcoholic beverages are taxed at varying rates, with distilled spirits taxed at 21 cents per ounce of alcohol, wine at 8 cents, and beer at 10 cents. The BEER Act proposed reducing federal excise taxes on breweries, with small brewers paying no tax on the first 15,000 barrels, $3.50 on barrels 15,001 to 60,000, and $9 per barrel for every barrel over 60,000. Larger brewers would see a reduction from $18 to $9 per barrel. The Small Brewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce Act of 2013 (Small BREW Act) proposed reducing the beer excise tax rate from $18 to $9 per barrel for larger brewers. Smaller brewers would pay $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels and $16 per barrel for production between 60,001 and 2 million barrels. Breweries producing over 2 million barrels would pay the full $18 rate. Breweries with an annual production exceeding 6 million barrels would not qualify for reduced tax rates. The Cider Investment and Development through Excise Tax Reduction (CIDER) Act aimed to maintain a $0.226 rate on hard cider and prevent higher tax rates on certain cider products. The CIDER Act aims to address issues with taxation on hard cider due to variations in alcohol and carbonation levels. It would allow hard ciders to contain up to 8.5% ABV and 6.4 grams of carbonation per liter. Several bills in Congress, such as the Distillery Excise Tax Reform Act of 2013, seek to reduce excise tax rates for small distillers. The Small BREW Act (H.R. 232; S. 375) aims to create parity with reduced excise tiers for small beer producers by introducing a graduated rate structure and raising the cap on eligible producers. This bill, along with others, represents a divide between small and large beer producers in the 114th Congress. The Small BREW Act proposes a reduced excise tax rate for small brewers based on production volume. The Fair BEER Act eliminates the reduced rate and introduces a new graduated tax rate structure for all brewers. The Distillery Excise Tax Reform Act aims to reduce the excise tax rate for distilleries. The Distillery Innovation and Excise Tax Reform Act (H.R. 2520) proposes reducing the excise tax rate to $2.70 per proof gallon on the first 100,000 proof gallons produced by distillers under a common control group. The CIDER Act was also reintroduced in the 114th Congress with different versions. In June 2015, legislators compromised on the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2015 (H.R. 2903; S. 1562) to benefit small and large beer producers. The bill included provisions to reduce excise tax rates for different types of alcoholic beverages, such as creating a three-tier excise tax rate schedule for brewers. The Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2015 includes provisions for different alcohol types: beer, wine, and distilled spirits. It proposes tax rates based on production volume, with adjustments for small wineries and distilleries. The Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2015 expands the hard cider category to include products with higher alcohol and carbonation levels, made from apple or pear juice. It also removes bonding requirements for smaller alcoholic beverage producers, allowing them to file excise payments quarterly. Additionally, the rum \"cover-over\" dates back to 1917 for Puerto Rico and 1954 for the U.S. Virgin Islands, providing transfers based on rum excise tax revenue. The rum \"cover-over\" dates back to 1917 for Puerto Rico and 1954 for the U.S. Virgin Islands, providing transfers based on rum excise tax revenue. President Obama signed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015, extending the rum cover-over through 2017 at a temporary rate of $13.50 per proof gallon. Legislation in the 114th Congress aims to reduce tax rates on alcoholic beverages, but increasing alcohol excise tax rates could be proposed to raise revenue or reduce negative externalities. Increasing alcohol excise tax rates could be proposed to raise revenue or reduce negative externalities. Policymakers could adjust the tax rate based on estimated costs of alcohol consumption to society, potentially increasing economic efficiency. Estimates show that current government tax rates are lower than the level needed to cover all external economic costs of alcohol consumption. Manning's 1986 estimate of 48 cents per ounce of alcohol would equal $1.02 in 2013 dollars. The combined federal, state, and local taxes are estimated to be between 25 cents and 28 cents per ounce in 2013 dollars. The current combined taxes on alcohol are significantly lower than Manning's estimated external costs of alcohol consumption. The Congressional Budget Office has proposed equalizing alcohol tax rates to raise revenue and address equity concerns. Increasing all taxes on alcoholic beverages to $16 per proof gallon equivalent could generate $64 billion in revenue over 10 years. This would result in significant differences in tax rates on beer and wine. The differences in tax rates on beer and wine would be significant under the proposed equalization of alcohol tax rates. Consumers may perceive excise tax increases differently based on the product, with wine often priced higher than beer. Price elasticities show that a 1% increase in the price of spirits, wine, or beer results in a decrease in demand for each respective product. The price elasticities of alcoholic beverages show that a 1% increase in the price of beer results in a 0.52% decrease in demand, while beer tends to be more inelastic than wine or spirits. The average combined excise tax rates on alcohol are estimated to compare with the level of taxation needed to correct for external costs of alcohol consumption. The average federal tax rate per ounce of alcohol is 15 cents, while the average state and local tax rate is 10 cents using only excise taxes and 13 cents when including revenue from state-run liquor stores. The U.S. Census Bureau data does not specify the type of alcoholic beverage taxed. The combined average tax rate per ounce of alcohol is approximately 25 cents with excise taxes only, and 29 cents when including revenue from state-run liquor stores."
