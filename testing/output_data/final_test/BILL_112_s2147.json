    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observing Act of 2012\". The United States is an Arctic Nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The region is home to an indigenous population relying on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife. Temperatures have warmed significantly, and the Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing and thinning, with estimates that the Arctic Ocean may be ice-free in summer within 30 years. These changes are impacting indigenous communities, ecosystems, and wildlife, while also opening up new areas for possible development in offshore oil and gas, commercial fishing, marine shipping, and tourism. Federal research programs focused on the Arctic lack coordination and cohesion. The lack of coordinated research in the changing Arctic Ocean hinders understanding of climate change impacts. Improved scientific understanding is crucial for developing effective climate change adaptation strategies. The purpose of the Act is to establish a permanent environmental sentinel program for research, monitoring, and observation in the Arctic Ocean. The purpose of observation activities in the Arctic Ocean is to promote a productive ecosystem and human uses of natural resources through understanding and monitoring, as well as to evaluate natural resource management for improved performance and adaptive management. The Act defines key terms such as \"Board\" as the North Pacific Research Board, \"Commission\" as the Arctic Research Commission, and \"Program\" as the Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program is established by the Board with input from the Commission. It includes long-term scientific research, monitoring, and observation activities related to marine ecosystems, fisheries, and wildlife populations in the Arctic. This program also involves expanding the Alaska Ocean Observing System in the Arctic. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program, established by the Board with input from the Commission, focuses on marine ecosystems, fisheries, and wildlife populations in the Arctic. Initial projects include research on Arctic fisheries and marine mammals, particularly their responses to loss of sea ice habitats. The Arctic Ocean Research, Monitoring, and Observation Program focuses on marine ecosystems, fisheries, and wildlife populations in the Arctic. It includes research on Arctic fisheries and marine mammals, their responses to loss of sea ice habitats, and reactions to disturbance. The program aims to establish the Alaska Ocean Observing System in the Arctic Ocean to provide comprehensive real-time data on physical, chemical, and biological conditions and environmental change. Additionally, a comprehensive Arctic Ocean science plan will be jointly prepared by the Board and the Commission, with recognition and coordination with other science plans and activities in the Arctic. The development of the Arctic Ocean science plan is informed by a synthesis of existing knowledge about the Arctic ecosystem, including ecosystem functions, sources of stress, ecosystem changes, and other relevant information. The plan will undergo initial review by the National Research Council and periodic updates every five years thereafter. The Board and the Commission, with input from the National Research Council, will review and update the plan for setting priorities and awarding grants under the Program. Grants will be awarded for research, monitoring, and observation activities, with a limitation on awarding grants until the required plan is prepared. Conditions, considerations, and priorities will be taken into account for grant awards. When awarding grants for research activities, the Board will prioritize projects in the Arctic and subarctic regions, focus on long-term cooperative projects addressing marine ecosystem needs, prioritize establishing the Alaska Ocean Observing System in the Arctic Ocean, and value local ecological knowledge. The Arctic Research Commission prioritizes research projects that incorporate local ecological knowledge, ensures data availability to the public, and considers annual recommendations for research priorities. The Arctic Research Commission reviews ongoing research activities and submits recommendations to the Board."
