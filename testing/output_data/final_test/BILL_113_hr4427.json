In 2012, US health care spending was $8,915 per resident, accounting for 17.2% of GDP. Expenditures surpassed $2.3 trillion in 2008, with chronic disease treatment costs making up over 75% of national health expenditures. The World Health Organization linked diet to chronic diseases, which cause 7 out of 10 American deaths annually. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke, strongly linked to dietary and lifestyle choices, contribute to over 50% of annual deaths. Approximately 81.1 million Americans have cardiovascular disease, with 2,300 deaths daily. In 2010, cardiovascular disease cost $189.4 billion, projected to triple to $818 billion by 2030. A healthy diet can reduce heart disease symptoms and reverse artery damage. Two-thirds of Americans are overweight, with one-third of children obese. In the United States, obesity is a significant issue with half of adults and one in three children being overweight. The country spent $190 billion on obesity-related health care costs in 2008. Additionally, diabetes affects 25.8 million Americans and costs the government $116 billion. Cancer claims the lives of approximately 570,000 Americans annually. The direct costs of cancer were $102.8 billion in 2010 and are expected to rise to $172 billion by 2020. Over 33% of cancers are diet-related and preventable with a healthful diet. Nutrition education for clinicians can help identify effective strategies for counseling and management. Physician counseling on weight loss increases the likelihood of patients attempting weight loss. Leading medical bodies recommend physicians address diet with overweight patients to increase physical activity, improve diet, and promote weight loss. Guidelines from organizations like the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association advise counseling on lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise for overweight and obese patients.
