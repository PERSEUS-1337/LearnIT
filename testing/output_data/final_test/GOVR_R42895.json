    "content": "Environmental issues, including air quality, were stalemated in the divided 113th Congress. Efforts to prevent the EPA from implementing new emission control requirements were dominant. EPA's regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and ambient air quality standards were of particular interest. Efforts in the House to restrain agency regulatory actions, including legislation like the REINS Act and Energy Consumers Relief Act, could impact new rules under the Clean Air Act and other statutes. A focus of congressional interest under the Clean Air Act has been EPA regulatory actions to limit greenhouse gas emissions. EPA has targeted six gases linked to climate change, with carbon dioxide being the most prevalent. Concerns have been raised about the economic impacts of GHG regulations, with some arguing that the case for controls has not been proven. EPA believes the Clean Air Act already requires action. EPA has already taken action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, following a 2007 Supreme Court decision. The agency made an endangerment finding in 2009 and established GHG emission standards for new vehicles in 2010. The auto industry supported national GHG standards to avoid state-by-state regulations. The EPA has implemented GHG emission standards for vehicles to avoid state-by-state regulations. A second round of standards for cars and trucks was agreed upon with the auto industry and stakeholders in 2012. Joint GHG emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks have also been established. The President directed EPA and NHTSA to develop a second round of standards in 2014. The President directed EPA and NHTSA to develop a second round of GHG emission standards for vehicles by March 2015. EPA reached a settlement agreement to propose GHG emission standards for power plants and refineries by specific deadlines, but has not fulfilled the terms of the agreements. Power plants and petroleum refineries are significant sources of GHG emissions in the U.S. The EPA proposed power plant New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) in 2012 but faced delays in finalizing due to public comments and concerns about CCS technology. Critics argued that the NSPS would hinder new plant construction. The President directed EPA to propose GHG emission standards for existing power plants by June 2014, with promulgation by June 2015. The emission standards for existing power plants were released on June 2, 2014, setting state-specific goals for CO2 emissions. The EPA proposed state-specific goals for CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel power plants in the Federal Register on June 18. The goals are based on four \"building blocks\" including improved efficiency at coal-fired power plants, substitution of natural gas for coal, zero-emission power generation, and demand-side energy efficiency. Two sets of goals were proposed: an interim set for 2020-2029 and a final goal for 2030 and beyond. States with high reliance on coal would have higher emission rates allowed, while those with natural gas capacity or renewable power requirements would have lower goals. The proposal was open for public comment until December 1, 2014. The EPA proposed state-specific goals for CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel power plants in June 2014, with a comment period ending on December 1. Legislation in the 112th and 113th Congress aimed to prevent EPA from implementing GHG emission requirements, with bills introduced and passed in the House but not the Senate. In the 113th Congress, the House passed H.R. 3826, which aimed to prohibit the EPA from implementing GHG emission standards for fossil-fueled power plants until certain conditions were met. This legislation was also incorporated into H.R. 2. Additional bills were introduced to prevent EPA from setting standards for existing power plants. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed challenges to EPA's GHG regulations, including emission standards for vehicles and permitting rules for stationary sources. The Supreme Court reviewed EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions triggering permitting requirements for stationary sources, with some limitations imposed (Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, June 23, 2014). The EPA has developed new regulations to address emissions other than GHGs from electric power plants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury. Coal-fired power plants are significant sources of air pollution in the US, emitting large amounts of these pollutants. EPA promulgated regulations for SO2 and NOx on August 8, 2011, and for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants on February 16, 2012. Power plants in the US are major sources of air pollutants, including 52 tons of mercury emissions and 3.6 million tons of nitrogen oxides. They also contribute to one-third of the country's anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with Clean Air Act regulations for power plants is complex due to varying requirements based on factors like location, construction date, and fuel type. This complexity makes it challenging for utilities to develop compliance strategies and for regulators to enforce regulations effectively. Power plants in the US face challenges in complying with Clean Air Act regulations due to varying requirements based on factors like location, construction date, and fuel type. Utilities have successfully limited or delayed regulations, particularly for older \"grandfathered\" plants. New air quality standards for ozone, fine particles, and SO2 will require further reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions. The controversy over New Source Review requirements for existing power plants has led to calls for comprehensive legislation addressing power plant pollution. This legislation would coordinate the reduction of major pollutants through a system of tradable allowances, similar to the acid rain program. Despite discussions and introduced bills, neither the House nor the Senate has taken action on this issue. The Bush and Obama Administrations considered using existing Clean Air Act authority after failing to obtain congressional approval for the \"Clear Skies\" bill. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) were established to regulate utility emissions in eastern states. EPA projected that most grandfathered generation capacity is located in the East, Midwest, and South. EPA projected that nationwide emissions of SO 2 would decline 53% by 2015 and NOx emissions 56% compared to 2001. The rule would result in $85 billion-$100 billion in health benefits annually by 2015, preventing 17,000 premature deaths. CAIR's benefits outweighed its costs, but it was challenged in court and vacated in 2008. The D.C. Circuit vacated the CAIR rule on July 11, 2008, citing flaws in EPA's methodology for establishing emission budgets and compliance deadlines. The court found the rule's fuel adjustment factors to be arbitrary and capricious, stating that no amount of tinkering could make it acceptable. On December 23, 2008, the court modified its decision on CAIR, allowing it to remain in effect until a new rule was established by EPA. EPA finalized a replacement for CAIR on July 6, 2011, called the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). CSAPR maintained the Phase 1 limits of CAIR and introduced new limits for the second phase in 2012 and 2014. The CAIR Phase 1 rules led to significant reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions from fossil-fueled power plants. CSAPR aimed to further reduce emissions with additional phases in 2012 and 2014, focusing on SO2 reductions. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) introduced new emission caps in 2012 and 2014, targeting a significant reduction in SO2 emissions to 2.4 million tons in covered states. Interstate trading of allowances is allowed within states, with limits to ensure compliance with emission caps. EPA also implemented a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) to expedite CSAPR's implementation by specifying emission budgets for each state. The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) aimed to control emissions from electric power plants, with states developing their own plans. EPA estimated the cost to the power sector at $800 million annually, with expected benefits of $120 billion to $280 billion, including 13,000 to 34,000 fewer premature deaths. Criticisms initially focused on implementation time frames and emission \"budgets\" adequacy. The adequacy of compliance time frames for Phase 1 of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule was questioned, with EPA defending the deadline as achievable without new equipment. Emissions of SO2 and NOx decreased in 2012 despite the rule being stayed, mainly due to utilities switching to natural gas. Concerns also arose regarding the emissions budgets for individual states, particularly Texas, which was added to the final rule after not being in the proposed version. EPA reviewed the budgets for some states post-promulgation. In the 112th Congress, legislation was considered to revoke the CSAPR rule, with the House passing H.R. 2401 and H.R. 3409. The Senate rejected a resolution of disapproval of CSAPR. Despite initial court victories, opponents of the rule were unsuccessful in Congress. The CSAPR rule initially prevailed in court, but was later vacated and remanded by the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals due to EPA's imposition of Federal Implementation Plans without giving states a chance to develop their own plans. The Supreme Court later reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision in 2014. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit's decision in 2014, supporting EPA's use of cost-effectiveness to allocate emission reduction requirements under the Clean Air Act. EPA requested the court to lift the stay on the rule's implementation, with a new compliance schedule set for 2015 and 2017. The Clean Air Act also allows EPA to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from electric generation units. Mercury emissions from electric generation units (EGUs) are a significant concern in the United States due to their adverse health effects. Mercury is a neurotoxin that can cause developmental issues and lower IQ in fetuses and children. Exposure primarily occurs through fish consumption, as mercury enters water bodies through air emissions and bioaccumulates in the food chain. All 50 states have issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury pollution. EPA is mandated to regulate mercury emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA was required to determine if regulating mercury from power plants under the Clean Air Act was necessary. Initially, EPA concluded it was necessary but later established a national cap-and-trade system for power plant emissions of mercury, known as the Clean Air Mercury Rule. The final cap was set at 15 tons of emissions nationwide in 2018. The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) aimed to reduce emissions by 70% from 1999 levels by 2018. Utilities could control pollutants or buy allowances from other plants. Early reductions could be banked for later use, delaying full compliance until after 2025. CAMR was challenged in court by New Jersey and other states, with a decision in February 2008. The D.C. Circuit, in a 3-0 decision on February 8, 2008, vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) due to the agency's failure to proceed with MACT regulations for electric generating units listed as a source of hazardous air pollutants. The court required the agency to either delist the source category or meet stringent criteria to protect public health and the environment, given that EGUs were responsible for a significant portion of mercury emissions in the U.S. at the time. The court found EPA's approach to controlling mercury unlawful, criticizing the cap-and-trade system for not addressing \"hot spots\" with high mercury emissions. Critics argued for stricter and faster regulations, which resonated with about 20 states. The court criticized EPA's cap-and-trade system for not addressing high mercury emissions \"hot spots.\" About 20 states implemented stricter requirements, with some demanding 80% to 90% mercury reductions before 2010. EPA responded with the Utility MACT or Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which received 960,000 public comments. MATS mandates coal-fired power plants to achieve a 91% reduction from uncontrolled emissions. The MATS rule requires coal-fired power plants to achieve a 91% reduction in emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants listed in the Clean Air Act Amendments. Power plants are the largest emitters of these pollutants, with the rule projected to also reduce fine particulate emissions and prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths annually. EPA noted that 56% of existing coal-fired power plants already have controls to meet the standards. The proposed standards under the MATS rule aim to bring older, poorly controlled power plants up to the emissions standards already met by a majority of existing units. Some plants may be retired by 2015 instead of investing in control technologies, resulting in a less than 2% decline in coal-fired generation capacity. Market forces, such as the low cost of natural gas, and other regulations may also impact coal-fired capacity in the future. The EPA projected annual compliance costs of $9.6 billion for the MATS rule, leading to a 3.1% increase in electricity prices for consumers in 2015. This would result in an average monthly increase of $3-$4 per household. The costs will mainly go towards installing scrubbers, fabric filters, activated carbon injection, and dry sorbent injection to reduce emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. The filter technology used to reduce emissions from coal-fired plants is not new and has been effective in reducing mercury emissions by 95% in other facilities. EPA estimates that a significant portion of coal-fired plants would have implemented this technology even without regulations. The benefits of the rule, estimated at $37 billion to $90 billion annually, far outweigh the costs, primarily due to the prevention of premature deaths and other health impacts. Opponents of the rule raised concerns about the three-year compliance window provided by CAA Section 112 for EGUs to install necessary equipment. EPA and the White House added provisions to the final rule to allow for additional compliance time if needed, with a presidential memorandum directing the agency to grant extensions as necessary. The EPA approved state permitting actions to provide an additional year for compliance if necessary for the installation of controls. A survey found that only 145 out of 1,400 affected EGUs requested additional compliance time. Out of the 1,400 EGUs affected by MATS, only 145 requested more compliance time. 133 requests were granted, 9 are pending, 2 were denied, and 1 was accommodated through a permit waiver. The MATS rule, like the CSAPR rule, has faced challenges in Congress and the courts. Bills in the 112th Congress aimed to nullify the MATS rule, impose the least burdensome alternative, and delay compliance with any replacement rule. The Senate rejected a resolution to disapprove the MATS rule under the Congressional Review Act. The Senate rejected a resolution to disapprove the MATS rule under the Congressional Review Act on June 20, 2012. The regulations were also challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in White Stallion Energy Center v. EPA. Petitioners focused on EPA's \"appropriate and necessary\" finding, arguing that the agency found few direct benefits from controlling mercury or other air toxics. The D.C. Circuit disagreed in a 2-1 decision on April 15, 2014. The D.C. Circuit Court upheld the agency's interpretation of the statute in the case Michigan v. EPA. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, but oral argument had not been scheduled. EPA agreed to reconsider portions of the MATS rule and modified the standards for mercury emissions from new coal-fired power plants. The EPA reconsidered the mercury standard in response to feedback from the Institute of Clean Air Companies and others, making new source standards for particulate matter and hydrogen chloride less stringent. These changes were based on the agency's conclusion that more emissions information was available than initially considered. The EPA stated that the adjustments would not significantly impact costs, emission reductions, or health benefits from MATS. On March 5, 2014, EPA requested a voluntary remand of the new source MATS standards to reevaluate them due to concerns about the methodology for small data sets. The remand will not immediately impact the 2013 standards, and few new plants subject to the rule are being built. Utilities and the industry have raised concerns about the cumulative impacts of EPA rules, including MATS, CSAPR, and proposed Clean Water Act rules. Many in the industry and opponents of proposed environmental regulations are concerned about the potential impacts on coal-fired power plants. They fear compliance will be costly and difficult, leading to electricity reliability issues as plants are retrofitted or retired. However, others argue that these concerns may be unfounded, as studies were conducted before the actual regulations were proposed. Many coal-fired units may need to be shut down for pollution control equipment installation, but there is excess generating capacity in the electric power industry. EPA regulations are just one factor affecting aging coal-fired power plants, which also face competition from more efficient natural gas units. The electric power industry is transitioning to more efficient natural gas units, which are cheaper to build and operate than coal-fired units. This shift may lead to the retirement of coal-fired plants if the cost of making them more efficient is higher than converting to natural gas. This can cause economic dislocation in specific communities. The transition to more efficient natural gas units in the electric power industry may lead to the retirement of coal-fired plants, causing economic dislocation in specific communities. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to address the cumulative economic impacts of EPA rules on clean air and waste management. The EPA rules on clean air and waste management were addressed in legislation during the 112th Congress. The legislation reinstated the CAIR rule, delayed the replacement for the MATS rule, and required the EPA to consider feasibility and cost in setting health-based air quality standards. The House passed similar provisions in H.R. 3409, but the Senate did not take action. In the 113th Congress, a modified TRAIN Act addressing emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks was introduced as H.R. 2948, but no action was taken. EPA proposed Tier 3 standards in May 2013 to further reduce emissions from motor vehicles, with final standards signed in March 2014. The Tier 3 standards, introduced in May 2013 and signed in March 2014, aim to lower sulfur content in gasoline to improve emission controls and introduce new technology. The standards require reductions in light duty vehicle emissions of 70%-80% and extend the useful life of emission control equipment to 150,000 miles. Senators from both parties raised concerns about the EPA rulemaking before its proposal. The EPA rulemaking on new fuel standards is being delayed due to concerns about potential price increases. Petroleum refiners dispute EPA's cost estimate, arguing that some refineries may face significant cost increases to meet the 10 ppm sulfur standard. The final rule includes a three-year compliance delay for small refiners and flexible programs for the refining industry. Auto manufacturers support the new standards but are wary of having to meet different state requirements. Lower sulfur fuel is deemed necessary for emission control improvements. The Tier 3 standards for vehicles and gasoline are supported by various groups and officials to help nonattainment areas comply with air quality standards. Without these tighter standards, ozone nonattainment areas in many states may need to impose more controls on local sources of pollution. Additionally, the EPA proposed new emission standards for residential wood heaters on January 3, 2014. The EPA proposed new emission standards for residential wood heaters, including stoves, pellet stoves, hydronic heaters, and forced air furnaces, to reduce air pollution caused by wood heaters. The proposal aims to establish standards for various types of wood heaters, as they contribute significantly to air pollution, especially in wintertime. The standards would only apply to new heaters, with a five-year grace period for the industry to comply with the most stringent regulations. The EPA proposed new emission standards for residential wood heaters, giving the industry a five-year grace period before the most stringent regulations take effect. The rule aims to reduce air pollution and could prevent 210 to 470 premature deaths annually, with health benefits estimated at $1.8 billion to $4.2 billion per year. Trade associations have mixed views on the proposed standards, expressing concerns about the potential costs imposed. The industry opposes the proposed emission standards for residential wood heaters, citing high costs and concerns about compliance certification. Members of Congress from affected areas have raised concerns about the rule's potential impacts. Legislation was introduced in Congress to limit EPA's authority, but no action was taken. The Obama Administration's EPA has reviewed national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) as required by the Clean Air Act. NAAQS set standards for air quality to protect public health and welfare, leading to monitoring, planning, and emission controls in nonattainment areas. Air quality has improved since the Clean Air Act's passage in 1970. Despite improvements in air quality standards, the goal of clean air remains elusive in many areas due to tightening EPA standards for pollutants like ozone and fine particles. Studies show that emissions of particulate matter and ozone have caused premature deaths in the United States. EPA is required to review and revise standards every five years to address the evolving understanding of air pollution's effects on public health and welfare. In 2005, air pollution caused 210,000 premature deaths in the United States. EPA reviews NAAQS and identifies areas with pollution exceeding standards. Millions live in nonattainment areas for ozone and fine particles. Health effects of pollutants are more serious than previously thought. EPA is engaged in reviews to address these issues. The EPA concluded that no areas exceeded the NAAQS for sulfur dioxide, but strengthening the standard could prevent 2,300 to 5,900 premature deaths annually. Additionally, 1.9 million people live in nonattainment areas for revised SO2 NAAQS. The lead standard should be lowered by 90%, affecting nearly 10 million people in areas with unhealthy levels of atmospheric lead. Reviews of all six pollutants have been completed since 2006, with standards becoming more stringent for five of the six. The next round of reviews has begun for each pollutant. The EPA has completed reviews of all six pollutants since 2006, with standards becoming more stringent for five of them. The current review of lead NAAQS proposes to retain the 2008 standard. The review of ozone NAAQS has sparked controversy since 2010, with a proposal for a more stringent standard in 2010. The EPA proposed a more stringent ozone standard in January 2010, lowering the primary standard from 75 ppb to 60-70 ppb. This proposal was based on recommendations from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and was one of the most controversial rules under consideration at the time. EPA is prohibited from considering costs in setting NAAQS but does prepare cost and benefit estimates for information purposes. The EPA proposed more stringent ozone standards in 2010, estimating costs of $19-25 billion annually for a 70 ppb standard or $52-90 billion for a 60 ppb standard, with benefits of similar amounts. EPA identified over 500 counties violating the NAAQS, compared to 85 under the 1997 standard. Delays pushed back the ozone review completion date multiple times. In 2010, the EPA proposed more stringent ozone standards with estimated costs of $19-25 billion annually for a 70 ppb standard. The final decision was sent to OMB for review in July 2011, setting a 70 ppb primary standard with a new form of secondary standard. The White House requested the withdrawal of the ozone standards in September 2011, citing ongoing work to update the science for reconsideration in 2013. State and local governments are being asked to implement a new standard that will soon be reconsidered. The withdrawal of the decision left EPA and state and local governments to implement the 2008 ozone standards, with most nonattainment areas already designated for the previous standard. EPA is proceeding with the five-year review of the 2008 standard. The EPA released a proposal to revise the 2008 ozone standard, with more stringent standards lowering both primary and secondary standards to 65-70 ppb. The final decision is expected by October 1, 2015, with most areas projected to reach attainment due to existing regulations on emissions. EPA states that 358-558 counties outside California would have monitors showing nonattainment based on current data. The EPA estimates that most counties outside California will reach attainment with a 70 ppb ozone standard by 2025, and a 65 ppb standard by 2025 through existing regulations. The cost of meeting these standards is estimated at $3.9 billion annually for a 70 ppb standard and $15 billion annually for a 65 ppb standard in states except California. California would have separate cost estimates of $0.80 billion to $1.6 billion annually by 2038. EPA's estimates are lower than earlier projections. The EPA's cost estimates for meeting ozone standards are lower than earlier projections. There is controversy over the methods used to estimate the benefits of proposed standards. Congress is likely to take a keen interest in the results of this review as it nears completion. Several bills introduced in the 113th Congress would impact the timing and authority of the EPA to set ozone NAAQS standards. These bills include provisions such as delaying standard revisions, requiring a certain percentage of counties to meet current standards before implementing stricter ones, and mandating EPA to consider feasibility and cost in setting new standards. Congressional interest in the review process is high. Since 2009, EPA has proposed and implemented regulations under the Clean Air Act, facing criticism for overstepping authority and underestimating costs. Several bills in the 112th Congress aimed to overturn regulations or limit EPA's authority. Notable regulations included those on greenhouse gas emissions, power plants, and NAAQS standards. The EPA revised the Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards for cement kilns and boilers, giving industries more time to comply with less stringent standards. Despite criticism, the EPA defends its regulations as necessary to comply with congressional mandates and emphasizes the benefits of pollution control. The EPA's pollution control standards are often challenged in court by industry and environmental groups, with states taking sides. Court decisions can influence EPA's agenda. Confirmation hearings for a new EPA Administrator, like Gina McCarthy in 2013, provide opportunities for Congress to revisit these issues. Gina McCarthy was confirmed as EPA Administrator on July 18, 2013, after a Senate committee review in April 2013. EPA's regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act and other statutes are discussed in CRS Report R41561."
