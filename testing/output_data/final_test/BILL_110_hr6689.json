    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The \"Chinook Nation Restoration Act\" recognizes the historical contributions of the Chinook Nation to the Lewis and Clark expedition. Despite being recognized as an Indian tribe in treaties, the Chinook people suffered land loss, poverty, and disease due to the United States' failure to protect them. The Chinook Nation faced poverty and disease in the 19th century. Congress intended to provide restitution through land allotments on Indian reservations, upheld by the Supreme Court. The Western Oregon Termination Act of 1954 named four Chinook tribes, leading to the termination of the Federal relationship with the Tribe. The Chinook Nation remains active in the Lower Columbia River and Willapa Bay area. The Chinook Nation has persevered, maintaining their language and culture despite neglect. Congress should restore their Federal tribal status. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n     Definitions for this Act:\n            (1) Member - enrolled Chinook Nation member.\n            (2) Secretary - Secretary of the Interior.\n            (3) Tribe - Chinook Indian Nation.\n            (4) State - Washington.\n            (5) State territorial waters - waters within Washington's limits. Federal recognition is extended to the Chinook Indian Nation, allowing them to receive federal services and benefits. Laws and regulations applicable to Indians will also apply to the Tribe and its members. The Chinook Indian Nation and its members are granted federal recognition, making them eligible for all services and benefits provided by the Federal Government to federally recognized tribes. The Tribe's service area includes specific counties in Washington and Oregon, and upon approval of their constitution and bylaws, they will have civil jurisdiction over members residing in the designated service area. The Chinook Indian Nation and its members are granted federal recognition under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1978, allowing them to receive services and benefits as if they were residing on a reservation defined in the Act. The Tribe must submit a membership roll to the Secretary within 9 months of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a constitution and governing body must be established. The Tribe must conduct an election to adopt a constitution within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Until then, the interim governing documents will be in effect. After adopting a constitution, the Tribe must elect a governing body within 6 months. The governing body of the Tribe will be elected according to the election procedures specified in the interim governing documents. SEC. 7. LAND IN TRUST. If a Tribe transfers land to the Secretary, the Secretary will take it into trust for the Tribe. The Secretary must negotiate with the tribal governing body to establish a reservation and develop a plan within two years. Consultation with state and local officials is required to address their interests. The Secretary must notify and consult with State and local officials and landowners adjacent to proposed reservation lands. Complete information on the plan, including restrictions, must be provided. Consultation includes discussing the size, location, and anticipated effects of the reservation establishment. The anticipated effects of the proposed reservation on State and local expenditures, tax revenues, services to the Tribe, Federal services, and future services provided by the Tribe to residents on or off the reservation will be considered in the plan developed in accordance with subsection (c) and submitted to Congress for approval. Upon tribal governing body approval, the Secretary submits the plan to Congress for distribution to relevant committees. The plan includes a detailed statement on how all interested parties were notified.
