    "content": "SECTION 1. INDIVIDUALS TAXED ONLY ON EARNED INCOME.\n\nThe tax imposed on individuals is equal to 20 percent of the excess of taxable earned income over the standard deduction. Taxable earned income is defined as earned income minus foreign earned income. The standard deduction is increased as well. For tax purposes, the standard deduction includes the basic standard deduction and additional standard deduction. The basic standard deduction amounts are $16,500 for joint returns and surviving spouses, $14,000 for heads of households, and $9,500 for individuals who are not married or heads of households. The additional standard deduction is $4,500 for each dependent for the taxable year. Inflation adjustments increase dollar amounts in subsections (b) and (c) for taxable years after 1995 based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The additional standard deduction for each dependent is $4,500 for the taxable year, with inflation adjustments increasing dollar amounts in subsections (b) and (c) for taxable years after 1995. Any increase not a multiple of $50 will be rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $50. Income tax deduction for cash charitable contributions.

The home mortgage deduction is limited to acquisition indebtedness. Paragraph (3) of section 163(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to define qualified residence interest and adjust the maximum amounts for deduction. MODIFICATION OF TAX ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES: Section 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to impose tax on business activities. Tax is imposed on every person engaged in a business activity at a rate of 20% of their business taxable income. The tax must be paid by the individual, partnership, corporation, or any other entity engaged in the business activity. Business taxable income is defined as gross active income minus specified deductions, with gross active income excluding investment income. Deductions include the cost of business inputs for the activity. The cost of business inputs for a business activity includes compensation for employees, tangible property costs, and the actual amount paid for goods and services. The tax code allows for the deduction of reasonable travel and entertainment expenses for business purposes, excluding purchases of goods and services for employees or owners. Excess deductions in one year can be carried over to the next year, increasing the deductions for that year by the excess amount multiplied by the 3-month Treasury rate. The 3-month Treasury rate is determined by the Secretary based on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity of 3 months or less. The amendments made by this Act will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
