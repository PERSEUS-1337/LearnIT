The Congress findings state that the Joint Declaration between the UK and China in 1984 provided for China to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, with a \"high degree of autonomy\" except in foreign affairs and defense. The Basic Law guarantees Hong Kong autonomy in executive, legislative, and judicial matters. The Basic Law of Hong Kong guarantees autonomy in executive, legislative, and judicial powers, prohibits interference from the central Government of China, protects rights to free speech, press, assembly, and religion, maintains Hong Kong's capitalist system, and affirms the applicability of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Basic Law of Hong Kong ensures autonomy in executive, legislative, and judicial powers, protects rights to free speech, press, assembly, and religion, and affirms the applicability of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Covenant provides for the selection of the Chief Executive and members of the Legislative Council through universal suffrage. The NPCSC decided in 2007 that Hong Kong could have universal suffrage for electing the Chief Executive in 2017 and the Legislative Council in 2020. Currently, the Chief Executive is chosen by a 1,200-member Election Committee, with candidates needing support from one-eighth of the members. In 2014, the NPCSC allowed universal suffrage for the 2017 Chief Executive election but limited voters to choosing from two candidates. The Hong Kong electoral reform plans limit voters to choosing from two to three candidates selected by a nominating committee controlled by pro-Beijing members. International standards guarantee the right to vote in genuine elections without unreasonable restrictions, leading to dissatisfaction among Hong Kong residents. Media reports indicate that Hong Kong police used tear gas and pepper spray against demonstrators on September 28, 2014, and allegedly failed to protect them from counter-protestors affiliated with gangs known as \"triads\". Accusations of excessive force by the police are under investigation. The United States has close ties with Hong Kong, with 60,000 US citizens and 1,400 businesses there. Hong Kong is the US 18th largest trade partner and 9th largest goods export market. Hong Kong's status as an international finance center with protected rights and freedoms has contributed to its stability and prosperity. The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 requires reports on conditions in Hong Kong of interest to the US. The last report on Hong Kong's democratic development was issued in June 2007. Failure to establish genuine democratic options by 2017 and 2020 would erode Hong Kong's autonomy. The United Nations Human Rights Committee reviewed China's compliance with international law in October 2014.
