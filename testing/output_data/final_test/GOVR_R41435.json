    "content": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) oversees three life insurance programs for servicemembers and veterans: Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI), Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI), and Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance (S-DVI). SGLI and VGLI are supervised by VAROIC in Philadelphia, with day-to-day administration by OSGLI, a division of Prudential. S-DVI is administered solely by the VA, providing access to insurance for those ineligible for private policies. The VA oversees three life insurance programs for servicemembers and veterans, providing group life insurance for those ineligible for private policies. These programs cover 7.1 million people with $1.3 trillion in insurance coverage. The report is structured into three sections detailing program overview, management, and policy issues. Congress established the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program in 1965. The Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program was established in 1965 under P.L. 89-214 to provide low-cost term insurance protection to Vietnam era servicemembers. Administered by the VA, the program offers coverage up to $400,000 for all eligible servicemembers. As of September 30, 2012, around 2.4 million uniformed service members were covered. The Veterans' Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2001 extended coverage to spouses and children of servicemembers under the SGLI program. The FY2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act added Traumatic Injury Protection Insurance to SGLI for short-term financial assistance to servicemembers with traumatic injuries. Full-time and part-time life insurance coverage are provided through SGLI for active duty servicemembers. Members eligible for coverage under the SGLI program include various uniformed service members, Ready Reserve/National Guard members, Individual Ready Reserve volunteers, cadets/midshipmen of military academies, and ROTC members during training. Members of the Reserves eligible for part-time coverage under SGLI include commissioned, warrant, and enlisted members of various branches, IRR members during one-day call-ups, PHS Reserve Corps, National Guard members under specific sections of Title 32, and ROTC members during training. The maximum coverage is $400,000, which is automatic for servicemembers entering active duty or reserve status. Coverage can be reduced in $50,000 increments. Members eligible for SGLI coverage can decline or reduce coverage by completing Form SGLV-8286. Proof of good health is required to obtain or increase coverage after previously declining or reducing it. Coverage is forfeited for servicemembers found guilty of specific offenses. Full-time SGLI coverage extends through active duty or qualifying reserve status, with 120 days of free coverage after separation. Disabled servicemembers and dependents may receive extended coverage for up to two years under certain conditions. The SGLI Disability Extension allows totally disabled servicemembers to keep their coverage for up to two years after separation. Full-time SGLI policyholders can convert their coverage to VGLI or a commercial policy upon release. Part-time coverage is only active during duty or training, with a 120-day free coverage period after separation. Servicemembers eligible for free 120-day coverage if disability occurs during duty. Beneficiary selection flexible. SGLI costs shared by servicemember and government. Spouse must be notified if not named beneficiary. The Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program involves servicemembers and the government sharing the cost of premiums. The government and Prudential cover all death claims. Premium rates are agreed upon by the VA and Prudential, with the current rate at 6.5 cents per month per $1,000 of coverage. Each branch of service is responsible for additional costs of claims due to military service hazards, paid by the Department of Defense. The VA actuaries study mortality rates of servicemembers to determine expected death claims. Excess claims result in extra hazard costs for each uniformed service. Prudential Insurance refunds excess funds to the VA if annual costs are lower than estimated. If costs exceed estimates, the VA reimburses Prudential from the revolving fund. Family Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) coverage is automatically issued to the servicemember's spouse and children, with the option to decline or reduce coverage. Proof of good health is required to increase coverage for spouses or children. Spouses of servicemembers on active duty or reservists can be insured up to $100,000. Spousal coverage under Family Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (FSGLI) can be insured up to $100,000, with premiums deducted from the servicemember's pay. Coverage can be converted to a commercial policy, and ends after specific events like termination of coverage or divorce. Children of servicemembers are considered dependents if they are unmarried and under 18, or permanently incapable of self-support before 18. This includes natural born, adopted, and stepchildren under the care of the servicemember. Children aged 18-22 enrolled in an approved educational institution are also considered dependents. They are insured for $10,000 each under the SGLI policy at no cost to the servicemember, with coverage lasting up to 120 days after separation. The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 added benefits for stillborn children born on or after October 10, 2008, under the FSGLI program. The FSGLI program now includes coverage for stillborn children born on or after October 10, 2008, providing a $10,000 payment to eligible servicemembers. TSGLI offers short-term financial assistance to servicemembers with traumatic injuries during active duty, with premiums of $1.00 per month automatically deducted from their pay. TSGLI program premiums are $1.00 per month, deducted from servicemembers' pay. Coverage includes total and permanent loss of sight, speech, or hearing, amputation of limbs, paralysis, and severe burns. Eligibility and conditions for payment are determined by the uniformed service. The Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-275) outlines qualifying injuries for Traumatic Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (TSGLI) payments, including amputations, burns, facial reconstruction, coma from traumatic injury, and more. Exclusions from TSGLI payment include injuries sustained during felony acts and losses caused by mental disorders or illnesses. Premiums for TSGLI are $1.00 per month and coverage includes various severe conditions. Eligibility and payment conditions are determined by the uniformed service. TSGLI benefits cover a range of injuries such as amputations, burns, and coma from traumatic injury. Exclusions include injuries from felony acts or mental disorders. Benefit amounts range from $25,000 to $100,000 based on injury severity. Retroactive benefits are available for injuries between October 7, 2001, and December 1, 2005. VGLI allows for the conversion of SGLI after separation from active duty. VGLI, administered by OSGLI, allows for the conversion of SGLI after separation from active duty. It is a five-year renewable term policy with a maximum coverage of $400,000. Policyholders can renew coverage every five years or convert to an individual commercial policy without proof of insurability. VGLI does not have cash value, loan options, or dividends. Eligible veterans include Ready Reserves/National Guard SGLI policyholders who are separated, retired, or released from assignment, as well as insured SGLI members being released from active duty or active duty for training. After separation from service, servicemembers have 120 days to apply for VGLI without evidence of insurability. If not applied within 120 days, they have an additional year to apply, but must provide evidence of insurability and initial premium. Servicemembers have a limited time to apply for VGLI after separation from service. The maximum coverage amount for VGLI is $400,000 for those who separated after September 1, 2005, and $250,000 for those who separated before that date. Coverage is issued in multiples of $10,000 and cannot exceed the amount of SGLI coverage the veteran had at the time of release from active duty or reserves. The Veterans' Benefit Act of 2010 allows VGLI policyholders to increase their coverage by $25,000 every fifth anniversary, up to a maximum of $400,000. Policyholders with coverage less than $375,000 can purchase an additional $25,000, while those with coverage over $375,000 can increase to $400,000. This option was available starting April 11, 2011. Starting on April 11, 2011, VGLI policyholders could increase coverage up to $400,000 without answering medical questions, as long as they were under 60 years old. Premium rates are based on age and coverage amount, ranging from $32 per month for those aged 29 or younger to $1,800 per month for those aged 75 or older. Various payment options are available for premiums. The VGLI program offers different payment options for premiums, with discounted rates available. As veterans age, premium rates increase, prompting some to reduce coverage to maintain costs. Policyholders can convert to individual commercial policies without proof of insurability as long as VGLI premiums are up to date. Once a veteran converts VGLI coverage to a commercial policy, renewal of VGLI coverage is no longer allowed. The conversion policy must be a permanent whole life policy, and spouses and children cannot be covered under VGLI. To convert, the veteran must choose a participating company, submit an application, obtain verification of coverage, and provide a copy to the agent. The Insurance Act of 1951 established the Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance program for veterans with service-connected disabilities. S-DVI offers permanent or five-year term policies with up to $10,000 in coverage. Policies are issued with \"RH\" in front of the policy number and are nonparticipating. S-DVI is the only VA life insurance open to new policyholders. The Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance program (S-DVI) is available to veterans with service-connected disabilities. Eligibility criteria include being released from military service under honorable conditions, having a service-connected disability rating, and applying within two years of receiving the rating. Ratings range from 0% to 100%, with 0% indicating the presence of a disability but not qualifying for compensation. Under the Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance program (S-DVI), veterans with service-connected disabilities are eligible for coverage regardless of their disability rating. Premiums are based on rates from 1951 and waived for totally disabled veterans. Congressional appropriations supplement premium payments due to insufficient funds from veterans with severe disabilities. Premiums for S-DVI coverage under the Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance program are supplemented yearly by congressional appropriations. Premiums increase with age, but \"RH\" term premiums were capped at the age 70 renewal rate to provide financial relief for older veterans. However, \"RH\" premiums are higher than standard commercial rates due to outdated mortality tables from 1941. This discrepancy was highlighted in a hearing during the 111th Congress, where it was noted that the current mortality tables are almost 70 years old and do not reflect the improved life expectancy of disabled veterans today. Life expectancy has improved over the past 60 years, leading to lower premium rates for S-DVI coverage. Legislation is recommended to base premiums on the 2001 CSO Mortality Table. Some policyholders may be eligible for premium waivers if they have total disability before age 65 lasting six months or longer. The Veterans' Benefits Act of 1992 and 2010 provide supplemental coverage for S-DVI policyholders who are totally disabled. The maximum coverage amount increased to $30,000 in 2011. Premiums cannot be waived on the additional supplemental coverage. To be eligible for Supplemental RH, policyholders must be under 65, have a waiver of premiums on their basic S-DVI policy due to total disability, and apply within one year of the waiver grant. In 1959, Congress passed legislation for Gratuitous S-DVI (or ARH) to protect veterans who became incompetent due to a service-connected disability and died before applying for S-DVI. This program issues posthumous lump sum payments to a preferred class of a veteran's relatives. Applicants must apply within two years of the veteran's death. Gratuitous S-DVI provides a $10,000 lump-sum payment to veterans' families within two years of the veteran's death. If the claimant is mentally or legally incompetent, they have one year after regaining competency to apply. The payment is made to the widow/widower, children, or parents of the insured in that order. VA began overseeing servicemember life insurance programs in 1919. The VA offers various life insurance programs for servicemembers and veterans, including S-DVI, SGLI, and VGLI. S-DVI was established in 1951 to provide insurance for veterans with service-connected disabilities. In 1965, following S-DVI, Congress authorized the establishment of SGLI, with the VA Administrator purchasing group life insurance from Prudential Insurance Company of America. VGLI, available since 1974 under P.L. 93-289, allows former servicemembers to convert SGLI after separation from active duty. The Advisory Council on Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, established in 1965, reviews SGLI programs and advises the VA Secretary. In 1974, the Advisory Council also began reviewing the VGLI program. The Council includes six members: Secretary of the Treasury as chairperson, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of the Office of Management. The VA Regional Office in Philadelphia supervises the SGLI and VGLI programs, while the day-to-day operations are handled by OSGLI in Roseland, NJ. Proceeds can be paid as a lump sum or periodic payments over 36 months, with options for single check/electronic transfer or Alliance Account. Alliance Account is an interest-bearing account similar to a checking account for beneficiaries to access funds. The beneficiary of the S-DVI program receives proceeds deposited in their name and a draft book for writing drafts up to the full amount. Drafts cannot be used for point-of-sale purchases but must be deposited into a checking account. Alliance Accounts are not offered under S-DVI, which is administered by the VA. S-DVI beneficiaries may receive lump-sum checks or monthly payments. SGLI or VGLI policyholders can access death benefits early through the Accelerated Benefit Option if terminally ill. The Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO) allows terminally ill policyholders to receive up to 50% of their coverage in $5,000 increments. The S-DVI program does not have an ABO, but beneficiaries can access personalized financial counseling through the Beneficiary Financial Counseling Service (BFCS) provided by FinancialPoint. FinancialPoint offers personalized financial assistance to beneficiaries, including help with estate planning and retirement savings. S-DVI policies have a maximum face value of $10,000, which has not been increased since 1951. Policyholders cannot purchase additional coverage, and only a small percentage of eligible veterans are insured under S-DVI. The lowest area of veteran satisfaction was the maximum amount of S-DVI insurance coverage authorized for purchase. Critics argue that the program fails to provide adequate protection as it has limited basic coverage to $10,000 since 1917. Brian E. Lawrence of the Disabled American Veterans highlighted the importance of the $10,000 coverage for military members to support their families in case of death. In the early 1900's, the S-DVI program offered insurance coverage ranging from $4,900 to $6,000. Veterans with total disabilities are eligible for premium waivers, but only a small percentage have $30,000 in coverage. Most participants have $10,000 in coverage, while the VGLI program offers up to $400,000. Congress appropriates funds to subsidize the S-DVI program for disabled veterans. Increasing coverage for veterans in the S-DVI program would require a corresponding increase in appropriations to prevent a shortfall due to total disability waivers."
