    "content": "The \"Protect Small Business Jobs Act of 2014\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Section 558 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require agencies to provide notice to small businesses before imposing sanctions, allowing a grace period of 15 days for response. The amendment to Section 558 of title 5, United States Code requires agencies to provide notice to small businesses before imposing sanctions. The small business has a 6-month grace period to remedy the violation, with a possible 3-month extension upon application. After this period, the agency will reassess if the sanction is still necessary, and if not, waive it. The amendment to Section 558 of title 5, United States Code requires agencies to provide notice to small businesses before imposing sanctions. If an agency determines that a sanction may be imposed on a business, they must provide notice at least 11 business days before taking further action. If the same sanction could not have been imposed 10 business days before the notice, the agency must waive the sanction. The amendment to Section 558 of title 5, United States Code requires agencies to provide notice to small businesses before imposing sanctions. The period of delay for further action under subsection (d) applies only once to a business for any single rule. It also applies to subsequent violations of the same rule until the end of the delay period. However, it does not apply to violations that pose imminent danger to individuals. Small businesses can appeal sanctions imposed by agencies and seek review under chapter 7. The amendment to Section 558 of title 5, United States Code requires agencies to provide notice to small businesses before imposing sanctions. Each Federal agency must submit an annual report on the implementation of subsection (d), including deferral of action and waiver of sanctions on small businesses. The Ombudsman will include agency reports in the annual report to Congress and a summary of findings. The terms 'consumer price index' and 'CPI adjusted gross receipts' are defined for this section. The term 'CPI adjusted gross receipts' is defined as the amount of gross receipts adjusted for inflation. The term 'Ombudsman' refers to the Small Business Act's definition. 'Small business' is defined as a business entity with less than $10,000,000 in gross receipts in the previous year. Small businesses are defined as entities that meet one of the following criteria: have fewer than 200 employees, had CPI adjusted gross receipts of less than $10,000,000 in the previous calendar year, or are considered a small-business concern under the Small Business Act."
