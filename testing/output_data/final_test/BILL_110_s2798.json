    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Global Autism Assistance Act of 2008\". Congress finds that the occurrence of autism spectrum disorders has increased from 1 in 500 to 1 in 150 between 1996 and 2006. Autism is a complex neurological disorder that affects social interaction and communication in individuals to varying degrees of severity. The prevalence of autism is increasing globally, affecting individuals uniquely with varying severity. Coexisting medical issues and aggressive behavior may be present. The rise in autism diagnoses poses challenges for families, healthcare professionals, and educators. Developing countries struggle to address the needs of the growing autistic population. Approximately 2,500,000 people in China and 2,000,000 in India have autism spectrum disorder, with a large number being children. Early intensive educational services before age 5 can lead to significant improvements. Efforts in the United States focus on early diagnosis and services. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening children for autism twice before age 2, even without symptoms. Early screening and services for autism are lacking in developing countries, where United States expertise could significantly aid children and families for small costs. The term \"autism\" in this Act refers to all conditions within the autism spectrum disorders. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development will establish the \"Global Autism Assistance Program\" to support autism treatment in developing countries and train professionals working with children with autism. Eligible regions will be designated in consultation with autism organizations. The Administrator will designate regions in developing countries needing assistance with autism and select a nongovernmental organization to implement the Global Autism Assistance Program by awarding grants to local service providers and advocacy groups. The Global Autism Assistance Program will award grants to local service providers and advocacy groups focused on autism. The selected nongovernmental organization will provide technical assistance to support its mission. Grant funds can be used for activities such as education and outreach to the public and support for families affected by autism. The Global Autism Assistance Program will provide support to families through online resources and educational materials. It will also offer funding to educational institutions and clinics for the development of children with autism. The Global Autism Assistance Program provides funding to clinics and medical centers with proven records in addressing autism for operating expenses and specialized equipment. It also includes translating relevant publications into local languages spoken in eligible regions. Local service providers or advocacy groups can submit applications for grants under this program. The implementing nongovernmental organization selected under the Global Autism Assistance Program shall establish a screening board, known as the \"Project Advisory Board\", to review and evaluate applications from local service providers or advocacy groups. Voting members will be appointed to the board. The implementing NGO will appoint at least 7 voting members to the Project Advisory Board, including 2 parents of individuals with autism and 1 medical professional. The Project Advisory Board for autism will consist of at least 7 members, including 2 parents of individuals with autism, 1 medical professional, 1 teacher of individuals with autism, and 1 individual who has autism. Members serve for 1 year and can have up to 3 consecutive terms. They can continue to serve until a successor is appointed. The Project Advisory Board for autism consists of at least 7 members with specific roles. The implementing organization appoints members based on selection criteria to ensure objectivity, balance, and experience in the developing world. Non-voting members may also be appointed. The Administrator appoints non-voting members to the Project Advisory Board as deemed appropriate. The implementing organization, in consultation with the Board, establishes the \"Teach the Teachers Program\" to train health and education professionals to work with youth with autism. The \"Teach the Teachers Program\" conducts 2- or 3-day workshops and biomedical conferences in designated regions to train parents, health professionals, and specialists on autism interventions, nutrition, metabolic issues, and behavioral analysis. The \"Teach the Teachers Program\" conducts workshops and conferences to train individuals on autism interventions, nutrition, metabolic issues, and behavioral analysis. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2009-2011 is provided for carrying out these activities."
