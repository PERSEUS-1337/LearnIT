    "content": "The United States faces national security threats including intercontinental ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction by terrorists. Recent debates focus on domestic terrorism, organizational aspects, budget priorities, and intelligence collection. Recommendations include a greater military role and new structures to combat various threats. The paper outlines current legislation and policies governing the military's role in domestic terrorism crises. The evolving terrorist threat has become more dangerous and challenging to counter, with attacks now lacking clear political objectives. The terrorist attacks of the 1970s and 1980s had clear political objectives, while the terrorism of the 1990s focused on causing massive casualties without specific political goals. Recent attacks like the World Trade Center bombing in New York City and the Oklahoma City bombing show a shift towards indiscriminate violence. The use of weapons of mass destruction is a growing concern in modern terrorism. The threat of terrorism has evolved to include the possible use of weapons of mass destruction by groups like al Qaeda. Recent reports indicate an increasing vulnerability of the United States to terrorist attacks. Terrorism has evolved to include the use of weapons of mass destruction by groups like al Qaeda. Terrorists aim to instill fear, undermine government authority, and potentially provoke overreactions. The United States is a prime target due to its superpower status. There is a growing concern about terrorists using WMDs in the U.S. The United StatesCommission on National Security/21st Century warns of the possibility of a WMD attack on American soil in the next quarter century. The Aum Shinrikyo terrorist group's 1995 chemical attack in Tokyo highlighted the devastating potential of WMDs, despite the challenges in causing mass casualties. Terrorists may now possess the means to harm the public significantly. The United States Commission on National Security/21st Century warns of a possible WMD attack on American soil in the next 25 years. A former al Qaeda member revealed the terrorist group's global corporate structure with multiple businesses and bank accounts. Al Qaeda demonstrated its ability to conduct undercover transactions by purchasing a US military jet for transporting weapons to Sudan. The CIA and National Intelligence Council predict future security threats, including asymmetric attacks and internal conflicts based on religious, ethnic, and economic factors. The United States faces increasing threats from internal conflicts and the potential use of weapons of mass destruction by state and non-state belligerents. The likelihood of WMD being used against the US or its interests overseas is growing, with chemical and biological threats becoming more widespread. Terrorists may attempt to use such weapons, posing a significant risk to US interests and allies. The potential consequences of failing to prevent terrorist attacks, including those with weapons of mass destruction, would be devastating for the United States. The long-lasting economic and psychological damage could be the terrorists' greatest victory. Experts emphasize the importance of being fully prepared to deter or intercept such attacks by force if necessary. Crisis and consequence management are key components of current U.S. policy on combating terrorism. The foundation of current U.S. policy for combating terrorism is Presidential Decision Directive 39 (PDD 39), signed in June 1995. PDD 39 outlines three objectives: reduce vulnerabilities to terrorism, deter terrorism, and respond rapidly and decisively. Lead Federal Agencies are designated for international and domestic terrorism policy, with the Department of State (DOS) handling overseas terrorism and the Department of Justice (DoJ) responding to attacks on U.S. soil. FEMA leads federal efforts to deal with the consequences of terrorist attacks, particularly those involving weapons of mass destruction. Presidential Decision Directive 39 (PDD 39) focuses on preventing terrorist acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). PDD 62 reinforces PDD 39 and clarifies agency roles in combating terrorism, with the Department of Defense playing a supporting role. National Security Presidential Directive-1 (NSPD-1) organizes the National Security Council under President George W. Bush's Administration. The National Security Council under President George W. Bush's Administration reorganized interagency working groups into policy coordination committees (PCC). The PCC handles terrorism and WMD issues, with the FBI designated as the Lead Federal Agency for crisis management of terrorism threats in the United States. The federal response to a terrorist incident involves a coordinated effort between federal, State, and local agencies, including the Department of Justice, FBI, FEMA, DoD, Department of Energy, EPA, HHS, and DHS. Local authorities are usually the first to respond to emergencies, with federal involvement determined as necessary. The federal government will decide on the extent of coordination and intervention in response to emergencies or threats, considering factors like the nature of the incident, potential consequences, and local authorities' capabilities. Federal intervention may occur sooner if a WMD is involved, with primary authority assigned to the federal government to prevent and respond to terrorism. The FBI may seek assistance from the Department of Defense in such cases. The National Security Council (NSC) is central to coordinating the US government's response to domestic terrorism threats. It consists of various committees like the Principals Committee and the Counterterrorism and National Preparedness Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) to make policy decisions. The PCC has subordinate groups to coordinate specific policy areas, including the Counterterrorism and Security Group (CSG) for foreign terrorism prevention and response. The NSC has various committees to coordinate policy for preventing and responding to terrorism threats, both domestically and internationally. Subordinate groups like the Preparedness and Weapons of Mass Destruction Group, Information Infrastructure Protection and Assurance Group, and Continuity of Federal Operations Group handle specific policy areas. When a terrorist threat is identified, the appropriate group formulates recommendations for the Counterterrorism and Preparedness PCC, which then provides policy analysis for the Deputies Committee. The Deputies Committee ensures proper analysis of issues for the Principals Committee and NSC. FBI initiates threat credibility assessment for terrorist threats, designates an OSC as incident manager, and acquires resources for response priorities: preserving life, preventing threatened acts, and minimizing risk. The FBI manages crisis response through a Joint Operations Center (JOC) to coordinate law enforcement activities during emergencies. The JOC facilitates the participation of various federal, State, and local agencies to counter threats or incidents with a flexible and graduated response. The FBI's Joint Operations Center (JOC) quickly accommodates other agencies in responding to terrorist threats. The Strategic Information Operations Center (SIOC) in Washington D.C. coordinates national-level support for terrorism incidents, especially for nuclear, biological, or chemical threats. DoD and other agencies provide liaison officers to the SIOC during WMD incidents. The FBI's Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG) was established in 1994 to provide tactical and investigative expertise in major terrorist incidents. The CIRG can deploy crisis managers, hostage negotiators, behavioral scientists, psychologists, surveillance assets, and agents to augment local teams. The Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) is the tactical centerpiece of the CIRG, headquartered in Quantico, Virginia. The Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) is part of the FBI's Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG) based in Quantico, Virginia. It consists of 91 Special Agents and is a national-level tactical team that can deploy within four hours. The team is trained to operate in chemical or biological environments and can deploy in segments or as a whole unit depending on the crisis severity. Additionally, the Domestic Emergency Support Team (DEST) is a rapidly deployable interagency team that supports the FBI's crisis management efforts with experts from various agencies like DOE, HHS, EPA, FEMA, and DoD. The FBI Director requests activation of the DEST for on-scene advice, including nuclear, biological, and chemical expertise. The Secretary of Defense authorizes deployment of DEST aircraft and personnel. The team provides interagency crisis management assistance and information management support to ensure connectivity with national-level decision-making. The DEST provides expert advice on explosive devices and components, including chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological dispersal devices. They have technical expertise and equipment to operate in contaminated environments for threat sampling, intelligence collection, and evidence collection during domestic crises involving WMD. DoD is authorized to develop and maintain plans to respond to terrorism threats, including the use of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Department of Defense provides military assistance to civil authorities in emergencies involving terrorism and WMD. DoD Directive 3025.15 outlines policy guidelines for supporting civilian law enforcement agencies in the 50 states and territories. The Department of Defense provides military assistance to civil authorities in emergencies involving terrorism and WMD. DoD Directive 3025.15 outlines policy guidelines for supporting civilian law enforcement agencies in the 50 states and territories. When evaluating requests for assistance, DoD considers criteria such as legality, lethality, risk, cost, appropriateness, and readiness. The FBI identifies four situations where the military may assist in domestic law enforcement involving terrorism, including providing technical support, interdicting events, restoring law and order, and abating consequences of terrorist acts. The Secretary of Defense provides military assets for crisis response and consequence management in WMD threats or incidents upon the Attorney General's request. Military involvement in direct law enforcement is focused through the establishment of U.S. Northern Command in 2002. The Posse Comitatus Act, established in 18 U.S.C. Section 1385, prohibits military involvement in direct law enforcement activities such as arrests, searches, and investigations. However, the military can provide logistical support, training, and other forms of assistance to civilian law enforcement agencies. The military can provide technical support and assistance to law enforcement agencies, including explosive ordinance disposal and WMD expertise. The Secretary of Defense approves requests for lethal support, counterterrorism operations, and WMD situations under specific statutory authorities. This includes support for emergency situations involving chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. Prohibited Transactions Involving Nuclear Materials. Military personnel, equipment, and technical assistance can be used in non-hostile emergency situations that pose a serious threat to the US. Assistance is authorized when civilian expertise is insufficient, DoD capabilities are critical, and federal law enforcement would be impaired without DoD assistance. Attorney General can request DoD assistance for nuclear materials under 18 U.S.C. Section 831. 10 U.S.C. Section 382 authorizes military assistance in situations involving chemical or biological weapons. The military units and personnel will be under the military chain of command, with the senior on-scene federal law enforcement official able to request support directly from the senior military commander. Disagreements between the officials will be resolved by the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General. The military commander determines technical assistance procedures based on priorities such as protecting human life and preventing the use of weapons. Military units providing technical assistance to federal law enforcement authorities will not be armed unless specifically requested and authorized in advance. Members of military units, armed or not, will not be placed in hostile fire situations and can only use force in self-defense. Self-defense is defined as reasonable, necessary, and proportional force to defend oneself and the unit against hostile intent or acts, including deadly force if necessary. The military can provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies in dealing with suspected WMDs, including expert advice and assessment. This assistance can be given under certain legal provisions, allowing the military to help in making areas safe for operations. The military can assist law enforcement in dealing with suspected WMDs by monitoring, containing, disabling, or disposing of them before a search. They can also handle suspected biological, chemical, or nuclear materials and participate in questioning suspects when necessary. Military personnel can assist law enforcement in dealing with suspected WMDs by providing specialized equipment, operating vehicles, and conducting searches for hazardous devices during emergencies. They may also clear areas of booby traps and handle criminal evidence encountered during searches, with procedures determined by the FBI and senior military commander for safety. The military can provide technical assistance for safety when dealing with suspected WMDs, ensuring preservation of forensic evidence. Federal law enforcement officials are responsible for disposing of the device, with approval needed from the Secretary of Defense if DoD assistance is requested by the FBI through the Attorney General. Transportation of the WMD is not considered technical assistance and requires separate authorization and funding. The disposal and transportation of WMDs must be authorized and funded under different authority, considering the specific nature of the device. Evidentiary imperatives and reimbursement for military assistance provided by DoD are evaluated separately under relevant statutes. DoD requires personnel to be adequately trained for assisting federal law enforcement agencies, including specialized training for defeating WMD devices. The Department of Justice provides orientation on military participation in evidence search and seizure. Military personnel supporting law enforcement are trained in rules of engagement. When military personnel are authorized to be armed during their duties, they must follow specific guidelines when assisting civil law enforcement. This includes deploying a tactical military force in response to domestic law enforcement emergencies involving terrorism and WMD. The primary scenarios for military involvement are in situations threatening government continuity or public safety beyond law enforcement capabilities. The focus is on addressing public safety threats that require more than traditional law enforcement functions. The President has the constitutional authority to deploy the military in domestic situations involving terrorism or WMD threats, even outside of statutory limitations. This includes using military force to repel attacks or ensure public safety in cases of national survival or government continuity. The Insurrection Statutes (Title 10 U.S.C. Sections 331-334) outline the legal framework for such actions. The Insurrection Statutes (Title 10 U.S.C. Sections 331-334) authorize the President to seek military assistance in domestic situations involving rebellion, unlawful obstruction, or terrorism/WMD threats. This allows the military to operate outside traditional support to law enforcement and Posse Comitatus Act prohibitions. The President can deploy active military forces to suppress an insurrection against state authority when requested by a state legislature or governor. The President can take unilateral action under the Insurrection Statutes if state authorities cannot control violence, invoking Sections 332 and 331. This allows for military assistance in domestic situations involving rebellion or obstruction of federal law. The process involves issuing a proclamation to disperse and commanding individuals to cease unlawful activities. The President can use the Insurrection Statutes to authorize military force to suppress violence in a domestic situation. This would involve issuing a proclamation for individuals to cease unlawful activities and coordinating with the Secretary of Defense and Attorney General. If needed, the Department of Defense could provide tactical assistance through a Joint Special Operations Task Force for domestic terrorism incidents. The FBI may request DoD support for domestic terrorism incidents if their assets are overwhelmed or if the threat involves WMDs. The Attorney General will consult with the Secretary of Defense to determine the need for military assistance, following similar criteria as in technical assistance situations. The FBI Director can also deploy the emergency support team if necessary. The Director requests the Attorney General to deploy the emergency support team to the incident site. The DoD component of the team includes liaison officers familiar with military units for potential support in domestic terrorism situations. Authorization from the Secretary of Defense is required for launching the team. Military liaison officers can report directly to DoD for contingency planning. The JSOTF commander is integrated into the FBI JOC command group for tactical knowledge. Precautionary steps like prepositioning limited military forces near the incident site may be taken by DoD. When federal military assistance is needed, the OSC notifies the FBI Director, who informs the Attorney General. After consulting with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General advises the President to deploy military forces. The Attorney General coordinates activities with federal, State, and local agencies, and when presidential approval is granted, the FBI notifies the OSC. The Attorney General advises the FBI, who notifies the OSC. The Secretary of Defense advises the military task force commander for operational control transfer. Military authority takes over the tactical phase when the OSC relinquishes command. The OSC can revoke military authority before the assault phase if deemed unnecessary. After the incident is resolved, the military commander returns authority to the OSC for evacuation to a relocation site. The FBI will provide military members with constitutional and procedural safeguards, including military counsel if needed. They will also protect the identity of military members and sensitive tactics used during operations. The decision to use active military forces in the US, especially against American citizens, is a complex issue with legal and political implications. Several intelligence and terrorism experts argue that the use of WMD by terrorists is a serious threat to national security. The effectiveness of current crisis management policies in combating terrorist incidents, especially those involving WMD, needs to be analyzed. Critical issues in U.S. terrorism policy and domestic terrorism response capabilities have been explored recently. Recent national-level commissions have explored factors that could significantly impact the nation's crisis response capabilities. Experts emphasize the importance of a comprehensive national strategy linking policy with agencies responsible for domestic terrorism. Some suggest utilizing the full range of DoD capabilities for domestic crisis response, while others propose creating a new agency for \"homeland defense.\" Additionally, proposed congressional oversight roles are seen as crucial for a more effective response to domestic terrorism. The current national strategy for terrorism is viewed as fragmented and lacking cohesion. The United States lacks a comprehensive response capability for terrorism on American soil due to differing definitions of terrorism among agencies like the State Department, Department of Justice, and DoD. This hinders coordination in combating terrorism, with varying priorities between law enforcement and national security perspectives. The United States lacks a comprehensive response capability for terrorism on American soil due to differing definitions of terrorism among agencies, hindering coordination in combating terrorism. Military forces are used to prevent, deter, or interdict terrorist acts, but there is a lack of clear national objectives and priorities in executing terrorism policy. Threat and risk assessments for possible WMD use by terrorists could help in determining funding levels and program allocations. The U.S. military can support domestic crisis response under current statutory authority. The military can support domestic crisis response under current statutory authority, but coordination with federal law enforcement remains a challenge due to confusing regulatory authorities. The military's capabilities in responding to limited terrorist attacks are debatable, with potential for success in interdicting events or responding when the FBI is overwhelmed. Different statutes govern the use of the military in domestic situations, depending on the type of threat. Having clear legal authority in place beforehand could streamline military involvement while respecting civil liberties. Some in the Department of Defense question the legitimacy of using crisis response forces domestically, citing concerns about readiness for national defense. Reduced force structure and shrinking budgets make it difficult for the military to focus on tasks outside of their primary mission. Concerns are raised about the military's use in domestic situations and its impact on civil rights. Clarifying laws regarding the military's role in domestic crisis response could improve resource allocation and protect civil liberties. Studies and legislative initiatives suggest new governmental structures to address these issues. The proposed new governmental structures aim to address the fragmented approach to homeland security, focusing on combating terrorism issues. Recommendations include creating an independent homeland defense agency or reorganizing existing structures. The formation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 resolved many debates, with a focus on consequence management rather than crisis response. Many proposals suggest creating a new agency for a unified national framework to combat terrorism, coordinating activities of multiple government agencies. Supporters believe this would enhance the federal response by utilizing all available resources. However, some argue that the FBI's current operational capabilities for crisis management, with support from the DoD, are effective. The FBI has a strong relationship with military crisis response forces and conducts successful exercises for domestic terrorist incidents. The administrative process for military involvement in domestic situations can be complicated, but existing processes for terrorism crisis response are effective overall. Congress has been proactive in addressing challenges related to combating terrorism. Recent legislation like the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program has enhanced domestic consequence management capabilities. Proposals to create an Office of Terrorism Preparedness and a new Deputy Attorney General for Combating Domestic Terrorism were not approved in the last Congressional session. Congressional oversight of the $11 billion combating terrorism budget is challenging due to the complexity and rapid growth of programs. Congressional oversight of combating terrorism budget is divided among key committees in both houses. Proposals suggest creating a special joint committee with experienced staff to streamline oversight and develop a coherent national plan. Reviewing current statutes and legislation related to domestic combating terrorism is also recommended. Experts agree that the United States is vulnerable to terrorism, with a focus on facilitating cooperation among federal agencies. While the use of a WMD is considered less likely, the consequences of an attack could be massive. Current U.S. policy for domestic terrorism lacks coherent focus, with recent proposals centered on consequence management. The military is prepared to support law enforcement in crisis response. The military is ready to assist law enforcement in crisis response with technical or tactical support. Changes in NSC policy may take time to impact operational issues. Enhancing national strategy on domestic terrorism, clarifying military authority, and improving congressional oversight would strengthen crisis response capabilities."
