    "content": "The tax treatment of businesses in the United States varies depending on their organizational structure. Subchapter C corporations face double taxation, being taxed at both the corporate and individual levels. Other forms of organization, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, subchapter S corporations, and LLCs, are taxed only at the individual level. This report provides an overview of the tax treatment of major business types in the United States, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, C corporations, subchapter S corporations, and LLCs. It does not cover all issues related to these business types or discuss the tax treatment of other organizational forms like trusts, RICs, and REITs. Recent interest in different business types is driven by proposals to reduce the corporate tax rate. The revenue loss from a reduced corporate tax rate could be offset by repealing or reducing certain business tax incentives. Pass-throughs may face a tax increase as most incentives are available to all businesses, not just corporations. A reduction in the corporate tax rate without a corresponding reduction in the individual tax rate could lead to more firms incorporating to benefit from the lower corporate rate. The top individual tax rate was increased above the top corporate rate in late 2012 due to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. This tax disparity could be reduced by moving towards a more uniform business tax environment to prevent inefficient allocation of resources. The current tax disparity between corporate and individual tax systems could be reduced by integrating them or subjecting pass-throughs to corporate tax. In tax year 2013, there were approximately 33.2 million corporate and pass-through tax returns filed, with sole proprietorships making up the majority at 72%. S corporations accounted for 13%, LLCs for 7%, C corporations for 5%, and partnerships (excluding LLCs) for 3%. Figure 2 shows the share of net business income generated by different business types between 1980 and 2013. The share of business income generated by various business types between 1980 and 2013 showed a decline in C corporations' share until the mid-2000s, followed by a spike after the 2004 corporate tax holiday. Since 2008, corporate income has been trending upward, while S corporations, partnerships, and LLCs have also seen an increase in their share of income. Sole proprietorships may have decreased in importance as income generators. The decline in C corporations' share of business income between 1980 and 2013 was followed by a spike after the 2004 corporate tax holiday. Since 2008, corporate income has been trending upward. C corporations are separate entities from their owners and incorporate under state law by filing articles of incorporation. A C corporation is a separate legal entity from its shareholders, providing limited liability. It offers various benefits such as no restrictions on the number of shareholders, classes of stocks, types of shareholders, or their citizenship. C corporations can easily raise capital globally through stock exchanges. C corporations can raise capital globally from investors and are taxable entities subject to corporate income tax. Corporate profits are taxed at the corporate level before being distributed to shareholders, leading to double taxation. Total income is computed by aggregating business income sources and deducting expenses to arrive at taxable income. To calculate taxable income, corporations deduct business expenses such as salaries, bad debts, and advertising costs. They can also deduct interest paid to bond holders. Corporations may need to compute income tax liability twice - once using regular corporate tax and again using the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), paying the higher of the two. The AMT ensures a minimum rate of taxation by limiting deductions and credits. A sole proprietorship is a basic form of business organization where the owner's liability is not limited. Business income is reported on the owner's individual tax return and taxed at individual income tax rates. Personal and business assets can be used to settle legal judgments against the business. Limited liability protection is not provided as in other forms of business. Business income for a sole proprietor includes net profits and retained earnings, with the owner responsible for paying the self-employment tax at a rate of 15.3%. This tax consists of a Medicare tax (2.9%) and a Social Security tax (12.4% on the first $127,200 in 2017). Partnerships involve at least two partners who share profits, losses, deductions, and credits. Partnerships are established under state laws and can be formed by individuals, trusts, corporations, or brokers. Common types of partnerships include general partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and limited partnerships. In a general partnership, all partners are liable for business actions and debts. Limited liability partnerships offer protection from the actions of other partners, while limited partnerships have general and limited partners. A limited partnership (LP) consists of at least one general partner and one or more limited partners. General partners manage the business and are liable for debts, while limited partners have limited liability. Partnerships are not taxed directly; instead, tax items pass through to partners based on the partnership agreement. Business income is taxed at individual income tax rates if there are no corporate partners involved. When a partnership has a corporate partner, the income allocated to that partner is reported on the corporate tax return. The partnership agreement determines the final allocation of tax items to each partner, distinguishing between ordinary income and separately stated items. Separately stated items include capital gains and losses, dividends, tax-exempt interest, rents, royalties, deductions, charitable contributions, foreign taxes paid, and special allocation items. Partners in a partnership receive ordinary income which includes income, gains, losses, and deductions. They may also receive guaranteed payments for their contributions, such as health insurance, which are fixed and deductible as business expenses. These payments are considered ordinary income and may be subject to self-employment tax. S corporations elect pass-through tax treatment under Subchapter S of the IRC. By electing S corporation status, a business can combine legal and business advantages of a C corporation with tax advantages of a partnership. Criteria for S corporation status include being incorporated in the U.S., issuing only one class of stock, having no more than 100 shareholders who must be individuals or certain entities, and filing a timely election with the IRS. Certain entities like banks, insurance companies, and possession corporations are ineligible for S corporation status. Each shareholder must consent in writing to the election. When electing S corporation status, shareholders must file a timely election with the IRS and each shareholder must consent in writing. Shareholders agree to report and pay tax on their shares of income. The election can be revoked with consent from shareholders holding over 50% of outstanding shares. S corporations do not pay corporate-level income taxes and pass through operating income and loss to shareholders. Separately stated items like portfolio income, capital gains, and losses retain their character in the hands of shareholders. An S corporation allows for income allocations to be reported by shareholders on their own returns, with income taxed at the individual level. Shareholders receive pass-through income from the corporation, with allocations being proportionate to ownership due to the restriction on issuing only one class of stock. Shareholders providing services are considered employees and the corporation can deduct wages and salaries as expenses, while also handling employment taxes. S corporations must pay employment taxes and withhold income and payroll taxes for employee-shareholders. The IRS requires \"reasonable compensation\" to be paid to shareholder-employees before dividend distributions to avoid tax reclassification. Compensation should match market rates for services provided to prevent tax issues. The tax implications for S corporations include recognizing built-in-gains, potential corporate income tax, and taxes on passive investment income. Shareholders may be taxed on built-in-gains exceeding corporate tax owed. Taxes may also be imposed to recapture previous benefits from investment credits or inventory methods used by the C corporation. A converted corporation's gross receipts may be subject to a corporate income tax on passive investment income, such as dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and capital gains. Limited liability companies (LLCs) offer a blend of partnership tax treatment and corporate liability protection. C corporations distribute income to shareholders based on stock rights, while S corporations have constraints on income allocation. S corporations and LLCs are separate entities from their shareholders or members, providing liability protection. LLCs can have an unlimited number of members and multiple classes of ownership interests. LLCs were created to avoid being taxed as corporations by lacking certain corporate characteristics. Wyoming was the first state to allow LLCs in 1977, followed by Florida in 1982, with all states enacting LLC laws by the mid-1990s. In 1997, the IRS issued \"check-the-box\" regulations allowing companies to choose their tax classification by checking a box on a form. A single-member LLC can be taxed as a C corporation or sole proprietorship, while a multimember LLC can choose between partnership or C corporation taxation. Businesses cannot change their classification within 60 months of making this election."
