    "content": "During the 113th Congress, the Obama Administration announced delays in enforcing certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act to allow the public time to prepare for compliance. This raised questions about how courts handle administrative delays. The report will discuss legal principles for judicial review of delays in meeting statutory deadlines and enforcing laws on the public. It will also address whether the Administrative Procedure Act applies to these delays. Statutory deadlines for implementing rules or completing adjudications can arise from specific actions required by Congress. Delays in enforcement of statutory requirements by agencies are another type of delay, where agencies announce non-pursuit of non-compliance for a period. The legal effect of the underlying law remains during these delays. The agency may delay enforcement of statutory requirements, allowing violations to remain unlawful but not taking action until a certain date. This enforcement delay is assessed based on standards under the APA. The context of the delay may influence how the court evaluates it. The APA does not set specific time limits for agency action, but requires agencies to conclude matters within a reasonable time. Courts can compel agency action if it is unreasonably delayed. Individuals have a cause of action for unreasonable delays, but only for actions the agency is legally obligated to take. The Supreme Court has stated that a claim for unreasonable delay can only be brought against an agency for actions it is legally required to take. If the decision to act is within agency discretion by law, no claim can be made. An agency must be legally obligated to act to establish a claim of unreasonable delay. Cases typically involve an agency failing to meet a statutorily mandated deadline, such as promulgating rules or completing adjudications within a specified time frame. Courts may compel an agency to act if it misses a statutory deadline, using the TRAC factor test to assess the situation. This test considers factors such as congressional indications for speed, health risks from delay, agency priorities, prejudiced interests, and fair treatment of parties. Courts use the TRAC factor test to determine if agency action should be compelled when a statutory deadline is missed. There is no set rule for how long is too long to wait for agency action, and courts consider various factors in each case. Congress may include \"hammer\" provisions in statutes to address missed deadlines, with consequences varying from establishing a regulatory scheme to implementing the agency's proposed rule. Congress may include \"hammer\" provisions in statutes to address missed deadlines by agencies, such as withholding funding or mandating that proposed rules go into effect if final rules are not promulgated on time. These provisions can force agencies to act quickly but can be challenging to establish. In addition to hammer provisions, Congress can use political pressure, hearings, and the appropriations process to urge agencies to act more urgently. Administrative delays are common when agencies struggle to meet statutory deadlines, but they differ from situations where agencies use enforcement discretion. Federal agencies have the discretion to decide when to enforce statutes against regulated parties, known as administrative enforcement discretion. This flexibility in enforcement actions is derived from the President's duty to faithfully execute laws and the APA's directive for courts to avoid reviewing discretionary agency decisions. Enforcement activities may include penalties or other actions. Federal agencies have the discretion to enforce statutes against regulated parties, which may involve penalties or other actions. Courts have historically deferred to agency decisions on non-enforcement actions, citing agency discretion as not subject to judicial review under the APA. The Supreme Court case Heckler v. Chaney established that agency decisions not to prosecute or enforce are generally within the agency's absolute discretion. The Heckler v. Chaney case established that agency enforcement decisions involve a complex balancing of factors within the agency's expertise. Agencies are better equipped to prioritize enforcement actions, and their decisions not to take action are generally immune from judicial review. The Heckler v. Chaney case established that agency enforcement decisions are generally immune from judicial review, but exceptions may apply when the substantive statute provides guidelines for enforcement or when the agency abdicates its responsibilities. Lower federal courts have had limited opportunities to clarify these exceptions. The court's dismissal of a challenge to an agency's decision for lack of jurisdiction does not imply approval of the agency's action. The Heckler case acknowledged Congress's authority to limit an agency's enforcement discretion. Congress can limit an agency's enforcement discretion by providing clear standards, overriding the agency's inherent discretion in enforcing federal law. Courts require explicit intent from Congress to curb agency discretion, as seen in the Heckler Court's ruling on the FDA's enforcement under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDCA did not limit the FDA's discretion enough for court review of non-enforcement decisions. The Act gave the Secretary authority to investigate but did not mandate enforcement for every violation. The Court found that the Act's enforcement provisions left complete discretion to the Secretary on when and how to enforce. In a previous case, the Court ruled that a statute had removed agency enforcement discretion. In Dunlop v. Bachowski, the Court found that a statute had removed agency discretion in enforcing a union election challenge. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act requires the Secretary of Labor to investigate complaints and bring civil actions if probable cause is found, rejecting the argument of unreviewable administrative discretion. The factors for the Secretary's decision are limited and clearly defined. The L-MRDA requires the Secretary of Labor to investigate complaints of election violations and file suit if probable cause is found, removing agency discretion. The decision to bring suit is based on a straightforward factual determination, not beyond judicial supervision. The Supreme Court confirmed this in Heckler, distinguishing it from the FDCA by providing clear guidelines for enforcement. The language in federal statutes must define how and when agencies exercise enforcement discretion to override the presumption against review of non-enforcement decisions. Simply stating that an agency \"shall enforce\" a statute without clear guidelines is not enough to permit review. The Supreme Court in Heckler suggested that this presumption may be overcome if the agency explicitly adopts a different approach. The Supreme Court suggested that the presumption against review of non-enforcement decisions may be overcome if an agency has consciously adopted a policy amounting to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities. The Court cited Adams v. Richardson, a case involving the Secretary of HEW's failure to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court disagreed with the Secretary's claim of \"absolute discretion\" in enforcing Title VI, stating that the law requires specific enforcement procedures and that the Secretary's non-enforcement amounted to an abdication of statutory duty. The court found that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) had failed to enforce Title VI effectively, leading to a dereliction of duty reviewable in the courts. The court disagreed with HEW's reliance on voluntary compliance and stated that a complete non-enforcement policy could be subject to judicial review. In Schering Corp. v. Heckler, the D.C. Circuit held that FDA decisions on non-enforcement actions may not be reviewable. However, agency policies of widespread non-enforcement are more likely to be subject to review, as seen in Crowley Caribbean Transportation v. Pena. The court distinguished between single-shot non-enforcement decisions and an agency's general enforcement policy, stating that the latter is reviewable. The court in Crowley Caribbean Transportation v. Pena held that an agency's general enforcement policy is reviewable if it is expressed as a formal regulation, articulated in a universal policy statement, or delineates the boundary between enforcement and non-enforcement for a broad class of parties. This is because general enforcement policies are abstracted from specific facts and are more likely to interpret substantive statutes directly, rather than being based on individual enforcement decisions. The agency's broad policy against enforcement may be subject to review if it amounts to an abdication of its responsibilities. Clear reasons for enforcement decisions are more easily reviewable when formally articulated in a broadly applicable policy. Whether notice and comment rulemaking is required for delaying enforcement depends on the declaration being considered a \"rule\" under the APA. The declaration's classification as a \"rule\" under the APA determines if notice and comment procedures are necessary. Courts struggle to differentiate between guidance documents and legislative rules, with the latter creating new laws or duties. A rule is legislative if it implements statutory authority. A legislative rule under the APA is necessary for enforcement actions or conferring benefits. Courts distinguish legislative rules from guidance documents based on their binding effect. Guidance documents, considered a type of agency rule, do not require notice and comment procedures. Guidance documents inform the public on how an agency intends to carry out certain functions without creating new legal obligations. They are distinguished from legislative rules by their non-binding nature and do not require notice and comment procedures. In some cases, agency statements on enforcement priorities can be considered guidance documents. Agencies may choose not to enforce certain laws in specific situations, exercising administrative discretion. This decision is discretionary and does not create new legal obligations. The IRS issued Notice 2013-45, stating it would not enforce the \"employer mandate\" of the ACA in 2014 to allow for input from employers on effective implementation. This decision falls under agency discretion and does not impose new legal obligations. The IRS issued Notice 2013-45, stating it would not enforce the \"employer mandate\" of the ACA in 2014 to allow for input from employers on effective implementation. This decision falls under agency discretion and does not impose new legal obligations. The Notice encourages voluntary compliance with information reporting provisions. The IRS announced final regulations implementing the employer mandate in February 2014, providing for \"transition relief\" from the employer mandate tax. The IRS provided transition relief from the employer mandate tax for qualifying employers who meet certain requirements by certifying their eligibility. This relief imposes a legal obligation on employers to provide certification for tax treatment. Informal rulemaking procedures are required for this type of relief, where an agency imposes obligations on parties benefiting from the delay. When an agency fails to meet a statutory deadline for a required action, no rulemaking is needed. The agency may face legal action to compel the action."
