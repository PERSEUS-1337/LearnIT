    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rare Earths Supply Technology and Resources Transformation Act of 2010\" or the \"RESTART Act\". Congress finds that rare earths are crucial for clean energy technologies and defense systems, playing a vital role in reducing dependence on foreign oil and advancing cleaner energy sources. Rare earths are also essential for various high-tech applications in computing and pollution control. The United States relies on imports for nearly 100 percent of its rare earth needs despite having 15 percent of the world's reserves. China produces over 97 percent of rare earths globally and is reducing exports due to domestic demand and environmental regulations. The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology plans to ban the export of certain rare earth metals, while the United States is heavily reliant on imports for rare earth production and lacks a strategic reserve. The United States aims to establish a self-sufficient rare earth industry for national security, including mining, processing, and manufacturing. Currently, the US relies on imports and cannot reclaim rare earths from scrapped products, leading to dependence on other countries for these materials. There is an urgent need to identify the current global market situation regarding rare earths, the strategic value placed on them by foreign nations including China, and the supply-chain vulnerabilities related to rare earths and products containing rare earths. SEC. 3. ACTIONS TO PROMOTE RARE EARTH DEVELOPMENT. The United States policy aims to expedite permitting and projects for domestic rare earths exploration and development. A Rare Earth Policy Task Force is established within the Department of the Interior, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, with members including the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture. The Rare Earth Policy Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, includes members such as the Secretary of Agriculture, Defense, Commerce, State, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. The Task Force's duties include monitoring and assisting Federal agencies in expediting permits and actions to accelerate projects for domestic rare earths exploration and development. The Rare Earth Policy Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, aims to increase investment in domestic rare earths exploration and development by reviewing laws and policies that discourage such activities. They also assist Federal agencies in expediting permits for mining operations. The Rare Earth Policy Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, aims to promote investment in domestic rare earths through expedited permit reviews and coordination of actions. Annual reports are submitted to key committees detailing successful procedures for increasing investment in domestic rare earths. The Rare Earth Policy Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, aims to increase investment in domestic rare earths. The Task Force identifies legal requirements that may hinder project implementation and provides recommendations to advance the policy. Judicial review is not affected by this section, which is intended to improve federal government management. The curr_chunk states that a provision does not create any enforceable right or benefit against the United States or any other person. This is in the context of improving federal government management and increasing investment in domestic rare earths as identified by the Rare Earth Policy Task Force chaired by the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. ASSESSMENT OF RARE EARTH SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITY. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other relevant departments, must assess the domestic rare earth supply chain, identify critical rare earth elements for clean energy technologies and national security, and submit a report to Congress within 180 days. They must also establish a stockpile within one year. The Secretaries of Defense, Commerce, State, and the US Trade Representative must report to Congress on whether critical rare earth materials for clean energy technologies and national security should be stockpiled, assess legal authorities for procurement, and provide recommendations on stockpiling criteria. The term \"stockpile\" refers to a strategic reserve of rare earth oxides, storable forms of rare earths, and alloys for clean energy technology and national security purposes in the United States. Loan guarantees are provided for the domestic rare earth supply chain. The Secretary of Energy will issue a report and guidance to industry on obtaining government loan guarantees for reestablishing a domestic rare earth supply chain, supporting clean energy technology and defense supply chains in the United States. SEC. 6. DEFENSE-RELATED PRODUCTION OF RARE EARTHS. Sense of Congress: The United States is facing a shortage of rare earth materials crucial for defense and energy supply chains. There is an urgent need to prioritize projects under the Defense Production Act to support the reestablishment of a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 180 days detailing past, current, and future projects supporting the domestic rare earth supply chain. If no projects are in progress or planned, a justification must be provided. The United States is facing a shortage of rare earth materials crucial for defense and energy supply chains. There is a lack of projects to support a domestic rare earth supply chain, particularly in critical segments of the market. The United States is experiencing a shortage of rare earth materials essential for defense and energy supply chains, with a lack of projects supporting a domestic rare earth supply chain, especially in critical market segments. SEC. 7. SUPPORT FOR DOMESTIC RARE EARTH SUPPLY CHAIN. Congress emphasizes the need to support innovation, training, and workforce development in the domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Energy, Interior, Commerce, and Defense should allocate funds for research and development to various institutions and organizations in this sector. The Department of Energy, Interior, Commerce, and Defense should prioritize funding for academic institutions, Government laboratories, corporations, not-for-profit entities, and industry associations that will use domestically produced rare earths and associated materials. SEC. 8. RESTRICTIONS.\n\nNo recipient of appropriated funds for supporting the reestablishment of a domestic rare earth supply chain can divest funded resources or assets to foreign-owned entities without approval from the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and Commerce. Recipients must comply with section 2538 of title 10, United States Code, when using funds related to rare earth materials.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"alloy\" refers to a solid solution of elements in a metallic matrix, while \"alloying\" is the process of melting metal to create a metallic matrix. \"Clean energy technology\" pertains to technologies that improve energy efficiency, diversify energy sources, and enhance energy security in the United States. The term \"rare earth\" refers to chemical elements from lanthanum to lutetium in the periodic table. Rare earth oxide processing involves converting the oxide into usable metals and alloys for manufacturing. The term \"rare earth\" includes lutetium (atomic number 71) and the chemical elements yttrium and scandium. Refining rare earth involves separating and purifying it to commercial grades of oxides or salts."
