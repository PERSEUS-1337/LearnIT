    "content": "The current U.S. policy towards Burma involves a mix of engagement and sanctions, aiming to pressure the military junta to release political prisoners and transition to a democratic government. Recent political developments in Burma may signal changes that could impact U.S. policy. The controversial campaign period in Burma saw allegations of harassment, intimidation, and election fraud. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest six days after the election. The SPDC-backed USDP won the majority of parliamentary seats. The new parliament convened in Nay Pyi Taw to select a new President and government ministers. On March 30, 2011, Senior General Than Shwe dissolved the SPDC, and Thein Sein became Burma's new president. The US criticized the elections as flawed and not free or fair. The international response to Burma's political developments has been mixed. Some countries, like Australia, Canada, and the EU, criticized the flawed election process, while ASEAN and China welcomed the election results. The debate over the effectiveness of U.S. policy towards Burma has been sparked by the new government's installment. The debate over recent political events in Burma revolves around the shift of power from the military to a civilian government or if the military still controls the country. The effectiveness of U.S. policy towards Burma and the priorities of U.S. goals are also key issues. Congress has played a significant role in formulating U.S. policy towards Burma, particularly through sanctions. The 112th Congress may take legislative action on Burma policy, following the tightening of sanctions by the 110th Congress in response to the 2007 protests. The 110th Congress tightened sanctions on Burma in response to the 2007 protests, passing the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008. Previous Congresses had also passed sanction-tightening measures following anti-democratic actions by the SPDC. Scholars have questioned the sustained U.S. interest in Burma, with sanctions first imposed in 1988 after a brutal suppression of a protest movement. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma since 1988 to pressure the ruling military junta over human rights violations and promote democracy. Despite being accused of serious violations, Burma's sanctions are stricter than those on North Korea, even though it holds little strategic importance for the US. Burma's natural resources are attractive to energy interests. The United States has imposed sanctions on Burma since 1988 to pressure the ruling military junta over human rights violations and promote democracy. Despite Burma's natural resources being attractive to energy interests, the country's strategic importance to the US is limited. The US has pursued a policy towards Burma for over two decades with little success, leading to a debate on the effectiveness of sanctions and engagement with the military leaders. Some commentators criticize U.S. efforts to coordinate policies with other countries towards Burma, citing different priorities and questioning the effectiveness of sanctions. They suggest that past coordination efforts have not met desired goals due to issues with policy conduct, sanctions not being strict enough, and dialogue lacking clear intent. Some analysts believe that U.S. policies towards Burma have not been successful due to a lack of flexibility in allowing other nations to pursue different approaches. There are differing views on the changes within Burma, with some seeing them as cosmetic and others as flawed but real, suggesting that with support, they could lead to improvements in human rights. The United States could consider selectively removing sanctions and increasing bilateral interaction to promote democracy in Burma. The Obama Administration announced a change in U.S. policy towards Burma in September 2009, adding elements like direct dialogue. The 112th Congress may take actions regarding U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration announced a change in U.S. policy towards Burma in September 2009, adding elements like direct dialogue with the SPDC on promoting democracy and human rights, and cooperating on international security issues. The policy aims to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma that respects human rights by pressing Burma's military leaders to release political prisoners, end conflicts with ethnic minorities, and initiate a credible internal political dialogue with opposition leaders. The Obama Administration and Congress generally agree on U.S. policy goals in Burma, but disagree on priorities and strategies. Key questions include short-term vs. long-term changes and the balance between sanctions, direct talks, and coordination with other nations. Several Executive Branch officials are responsible for implementing U.S. policy towards Burma. The relevant U.S. laws designate key officials to carry out sanctions against Burma. Past Presidents have delegated sanction-related authority to various government officials. Current officials involved in U.S. policy towards Burma include Kurt Campbell and Joseph Yun. Future U.S. policy towards Burma will be coordinated by Derek Mitchell, the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. Mitchell's role, created by the JADE Act of 2008, involves coordinating U.S. policy towards Burma, consulting with foreign governments, and engaging with Congress on the matter. Mitchell's advocacy for a new U.S. policy towards Burma aligns with the approach outlined in the JADE Act. The Obama Administration's policy towards Burma, similar to a 2007 proposal, maintains sanctions until reform is seen. Additional sanctions may be imposed if needed, or sanctions could be lifted if Burma meets specified criteria. Other policy changes, such as using \"Myanmar\" instead of \"Burma,\" could also be considered to address irritations from the SPDC and Burma's military. In 1989, the country's name was officially changed to Myanmar. The Obama Administration's new Burma policy led to direct discussions with SPDC officials, including meetings with Prime Minister Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi. Assistant Secretary Campbell visited Burma in 2010 for further discussions with SPDC officials and NLD leaders. In May 2010, Campbell visited Burma and met with SPDC officials, NLD leaders (including Aung San Suu Kyi), and ethnic minority groups. In December 2010, Deputy Assistant Secretary Yun also met with SPDC officials, Aung San Suu Kyi, and ethnic minority groups. Yun visited Burma again in May 2011, meeting with government officials and opposition leaders to discuss progress in bilateral relations. The Obama Administration is waiting for concrete steps towards democratic governance, human rights, and the release of political prisoners from the Burmese government. Bilateral talks have focused on establishing relations and discussing the current situation in Burma, but there is no indication that the SPDC and Tatmadaw are willing to consider direct changes. The Obama Administration is waiting for concrete steps towards democratic governance, human rights, and the release of political prisoners from the Burmese government. Talks have not shown willingness from the SPDC and Tatmadaw to engage with opposition groups, hindering national reconciliation. The U.S. focus has shifted towards the release of political prisoners and human rights improvements, but progress remains limited. The administration continues to consult with the international community, including ASEAN, China, and India, to push for desired changes in Burma. ASEAN, United States, and India have all called for free and fair elections in Burma. The Obama Administration's efforts to consult with the international community on Burma policy have not been clear. It may be unrealistic to expect other nations to adopt a similar policy of \"pragmatic engagement\" with Burma. The objective may be to agree on necessary changes in Burma and the role each nation and the United Nations can play in fostering those changes. U.S. sanctions targeted solely at Burma are specified. U.S. sanctions targeted solely at Burma are specified in five federal laws and Presidential Executive Orders. These laws include Section 138 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990, Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and Section 570 of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, 1997. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (BFDA) and The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008 impose sanctions on Burma, including import bans, asset freezes, visa bans, and financial restrictions on officials. These laws require certification of human rights and democracy standards and restrict the import of products containing Burmese jadeite and rubies. The JADE Act mandates reports to congressional committees on sanctions implementation. Four Executive Orders impose sanctions on Burma, including asset freezes and financial restrictions on officials. President Bush expanded sanctions on Burmese officials and entities in 2008. He later issued a limited waiver in 2009, citing national interest. The sanctions include visa bans, financial restrictions, and asset freezes on selected individuals. Sanctions on Burmese officials and entities include visa bans, financial restrictions, asset freezes, import prohibitions, and investment bans. Enforcement is managed by various U.S. government agencies. The U.S. enforces sanctions on Burmese officials and entities through visa bans, financial restrictions, asset freezes, import prohibitions, and investment bans. The restrictions on Burmese products are managed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while enforcement of assistance restrictions is the responsibility of designated U.S. representatives. Sanctions laws allow for humanitarian aid and assistance in natural disasters, with provisions for waivers by the President. The President can waive sanctions on Burmese officials if it goes against the national interest of the United States. The U.S. provided over $85 million in aid after Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and $1.5 million after Cyclone Giri in 2010, ensuring the funds went to international organizations. Aid to Burma is often distributed in neighboring countries like Thailand to support Burmese refugees. USAID provides humanitarian assistance to Burmese refugees in camps along the Thailand-Burma border, focusing on combating diseases, education programs, strengthening community-based organizations, and supporting human rights organizations. Funds are allocated through grants to international and local NGOs. USAID allocates funds through grants to international and local NGOs for humanitarian assistance in Burma and Thailand. In October 2010, USAID posted a solicitation for a Personal Services Contractor (PSC) to serve as Burma Country Program Manager. The Obama Administration has expressed frustration with the results of its Burma policy. The Obama Administration expressed disappointment with the lack of results from their efforts in Burma, citing frustration with the Burmese leadership's unresponsiveness in high-level meetings and the ineffectiveness of current sanctions. Other nations' reluctance to coordinate Burma policies also hinders progress. The Obama Administration is considering a possible rebalancing of its Burma policy due to disappointment with the current approach and the formation of a new government. Special Representative Mitchell may seek to restructure the strategic approach towards Burma. The year 2010 was eventful for Burma, with natural disasters and conflicts between the military and insurgent groups. In 2010, Burma saw significant events including national elections on November 7 and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, which was seen as a potential step towards national reconciliation. The elections were criticized for not being free or fair, raising doubts about the country's return to civilian rule. Burma's first parliamentary elections in 20 years were held on November 7, 2010. Candidates from 37 political parties, including the USDP and NDF, competed for seats in the Union Parliament and Regional Hluttaws. The NLD was barred from participating, leading to complaints of harassment and limited media access. Opposition leaders and international observers criticized the election laws imposed by the SPDC. Observers criticized the SPDC-imposed election laws and reported varying assessments of the election. Claims of serious voting irregularities, including ballot box stuffing and delivery of unexplained \"advance votes,\" were made. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed deep disappointment, stating that the electoral process was severely flawed and repressed fundamental rights. The electoral process in Burma was criticized for being flawed and repressing fundamental freedoms, leading to elections that were not free or fair. The USDP won by a landslide, securing a supermajority in both houses with the support of military-appointed seats. The USDP/military bloc holds a supermajority in both houses, allowing them to amend Burma's constitution. The NDF opposition party won 16 seats, while ethnic minority parties won 10 or more seats but not enough to control any Regional or State Hluttaws. International response to Burma's 2010 elections was mixed, with criticism of the SPDC's actions. President Obama criticized Burma's elections as flawed and not meeting international standards. India's Prime Minister did not comment, while Vietnam and China welcomed the election as a step towards democracy. Indonesia called for reconciliation. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on November 13, 2010, after being detained since August 2009. Her sentence of three years in prison was commuted to up to 18 months of house arrest by SPDC leader, Senior General Than Shwe. International observers saw her trial as an attempt to reduce her influence in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Since her release, her movements have been closely monitored by Burmese authorities. Since her release, Aung San Suu Kyi's movements have been closely monitored by Burmese authorities. She has met with U.N. and U.S. officials, traveled outside of Rangoon for the first time, and focused on educating herself on the situation in Burma. She has refrained from international travel due to fears of not being allowed reentry into Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi has been actively involved in educating herself on the situation in Burma, holding meetings with the NLD leadership, directing the reformation of the NLD, and reaching out to the international community to express her views. Her release from house arrest was cautiously approved by the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration cautiously approved Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest release, calling for the release of all political prisoners in Burma. The new Union Parliament began its transition in early 2011 with restrictive rules set by the SPDC. The main tasks included selecting Burma's President and Vice Presidents, speakers for both houses of parliament, and confirming appointments. The parliament successfully completed the selection of speakers, confirmation of ministerial nominations, and adjourned on March 30, 2011. Senior General Than Shwe dissolved the SPDC, transferred power to the new government, and appointed General Min Aung Hlaing as Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese military. The various parliaments of Burma met for the first time on January 31, 2011, in Nay Pyi Taw. The second session of the Union Parliament is scheduled to begin on August 22, 2011. The parliamentary meetings, governed by strict SPDC rules, include limitations on attire, media contact, and speech content. Questions must be pre-submitted and can be edited by the Speaker. Violators face prison time or fines. The Union Parliament elected Thein Sein as President and Tin Aung Myint Oo and Dr. Sai Mauk Kham as Vice Presidents. The selected speakers for the Lower and Upper Houses are former SPDC members Thura Shwe Man and Khin Aung Myint. The Speakers for all 14 Regional and State Hluttaws are USDP members, with 10 being former generals in the Tatmadaw. Thura Shwe Man and Khin Aung Myint urged chamber members to avoid lengthy debates and focus on serving the people's interests. Early assessments of Burma's new Union Parliament have been mixed. Meetings often last only a few minutes, earning it the nickname 'the fifteen-minute parliament.' Members have used their limited ability to submit questions effectively, forcing government ministers to address issues not typically discussed in the media. The new constitution limits the Parliament's power, giving the President and his cabinet broad powers with limited oversight from the legislative branch. The Union Parliament in Burma has limited oversight over the executive branch but can appoint and impeach the President, Vice Presidents, and government ministers. The Burmese military has autonomy beyond budgetary control. The Union Government, consisting of the President, Vice Presidents, and Ministers, is responsible for domestic and foreign policies. They have the power to set policies, propose the national budget, and conduct foreign affairs, subject to Parliament approval. The President has additional powers not commonly found in other countries. The President in Burma has unique powers, making them a powerful political figure. However, they can be impeached by the Union Parliament if they overreach. Thein Sein, born in 1945, had a military career before becoming Prime Minister and overseeing the drafting of Burma's new constitution. Thein Sein, a former military leader in Burma, played a key role in the country's political transformation. He is seen as a moderate figure within the ruling party but has ties to the previous oppressive regime. Despite health issues, he has the potential to guide Burma towards a more democratic future if he can effectively manage the government and avoid conflicts. Thein Sein, a former military leader in Burma, is the President under an oppressive governance system. He has heart problems and may have been reluctant to accept the Presidency. The Vice Presidents are Tin Aung Myint Oo and Dr. Sai Mauk Kham. Tin Aung Myint Oo, a former General, was nominated by the military members of the Union Parliament. He is a graduate of the Defence Services Academy and served in the Army. Tin Aung Myint Oo, former General and Vice President, resigned from his position with the SPDC and the Army. He was chairman of the Trade Policy Council and is considered a \"hardliner.\" There are reports of him trying to undermine President Thein Sein's authority and a power struggle with Lower House Speaker Shwe Mann. Sai Mauk Kham, also Vice President, is a physician and advocate of Shan culture. Sai Mauk Kham, Vice President and advocate of Shan culture, has close ties with Tin Aung Myint Oo. He was chosen to represent an ethnic minority in the government but is expected to have limited power. The cabinet under President Thein Sein consists of 30 Ministers, with a strong presence of former military officers from the SPDC government. The cabinet under President Thein Sein consists of 30 Ministers, with a significant presence of current or past military officers. The military's dominance in the government is not surprising given its historical influence. The National Defence and Security Council (NDSC) holds significant powers, especially during emergencies, with 11 members including the President, Vice Presidents, and the Commander-in-Chief. The National Defence and Security Council (NDSC) in Myanmar consists of key government officials, including the President, Vice Presidents, and military officers. The NDSC holds significant powers during emergencies, allowing the President to declare national emergencies transferring power to the Commander-in-Chief for up to one year. The NDSC assumes legislative, executive, and judicial power until the emergency is over. The NDSC in Myanmar assumes legislative, executive, and judicial power during emergencies, allowing the military to potentially topple a government challenging its role. The constitution also allows for the declaration of regional emergencies to control regional governments. In 2011, there were reports of plans to create a \"State Supreme Council\" as the top governmental body. In 2011, there were reports of plans to create a \"State Supreme Council\" in Burma, consisting of key military and government figures. The council was rumored to have ultimate power, despite being technically unconstitutional. Political observers in Burma had differing opinions on the validity of these reports. The creation of the State Supreme Council in Burma, though technically unconstitutional, could be legalized through the combined votes of the USDP and the military in the Union Parliament. This political shift has led to significant changes in the military leadership, with General Min Aung Hlaing appointed as the new Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services. General Min Aung Hlaing, appointed as Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services in Burma, is known for his hardline stance and loyalty to Than Shwe. He formed a new national intelligence unit for domestic political and security affairs, demonstrating his powerful role in the Burmese government. The Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw in Burma has significant authority, appointing members of Parliament and key ministers. In times of national emergency, the Commander-in-Chief assumes all executive, legislative, and judicial power. There have been changes in senior military positions, with Lieutenant General Soe Win replacing Vice Senior General Maung Aye as Deputy Commander-in-Chief. The political landscape in Burma is shifting with new military appointments following the November elections. Regional commanders are now assigned administrative responsibilities, potentially reducing their economic power. It remains to be seen how the new military officers will adapt to this change and if Chief Ministers can effectively control their regions. The power struggle between regional commanders and Chief Ministers in Burma has intensified. Several regional commanders have been reassigned or dismissed due to corruption allegations. The People Military Service Law now mandates military training and service for all Burmese citizens. The People Military Service Law in Burma mandates military training and service for all citizens, with exemptions for certain groups. The reduction of privileges for Tatmadaw families and the creation of a military draft are seen as efforts to professionalize the military and reduce its political powers. The Tatmadaw's political powers have been a point of contention among analysts, with some skeptical of any plans to transform the military. The culture of Burma's military, characterized by loyalty and privilege, may hinder significant changes. The military has historically used oppression to maintain control, suppressing opposition and maintaining a privileged status. Analysts suggest that the SPDC and Tatmadaw view the country as an army of occupation. The Tatmadaw is seen as an army of occupation in Burma, with uncertainty surrounding potential changes in human rights under the new Union Government. There are mixed signals of government control loosening and authoritarian rule tightening. The military's actions, especially since the first Union Parliament meeting, suggest a continuation of past human rights violations, prompting calls for a U.N. Commission of Inquiry. The U.S. and 15 other nations support the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry (COI) under the U.N. General Assembly, Security Council, or Human Rights Council for Myanmar. The COI has not been endorsed by other ASEAN member nations, China, India, or Japan. Reports from the UNHRC, U.S. Department of State, and human rights organizations highlight severe human rights abuses under SPDC rule in Myanmar. Human Rights Watch and Freedom House reported extensive human rights violations in Burma under the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). The SPDC controlled all branches of government, suppressed basic rights, and committed abuses with impunity. Common violations included arbitrary detention, torture, and murder of Burmese citizens. The supporters of human rights violations in Burma include arbitrary detention, disappearance, torture, and murder by the Tatmadaw and other security forces, restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, limitations on freedom of association and assembly, denial of citizenship to ethnic minorities, discrimination in education and employment, falsification of election results, displacement of certain ethnic minorities, condoning of violence against women, and seizure of property. The SPDC in Burma has been involved in various human rights violations, including condoning violence against women, child labor, forced labor, trafficking in persons, denial of workers' rights, corruption, and indifference to reports of violations. Their constitution guarantees liberties but with conditions. The constitution in Burma guarantees liberties subject to conditions related to law and order, community peace, and public morality. It also upholds existing laws, including ones used by the SPDC to detain political opposition. The Unlawful Associations Act, originally a British law from 1908, prohibits membership in unlawful associations. The Law Relating to the Formation of Organizations requires organizations in Burma to register with the government. The SPDC created security forces with legal authority to monitor and detain individuals engaged in undesirable activities. The military in Burma has full autonomy under the new constitution, allowing them to abuse human rights with impunity. The Ministry of Home Affairs, controlled by the SPDC, monitored and detained political activists and human rights organizers. Military Security Affairs in the Ministry of Defense repressed civil and economic freedoms. The USDA, before becoming a political party, acted as a \"neighborhood watch\" for the SPDC. Security agencies screened mail, monitored communications, and conducted illegal raids. It is uncertain if the Union Government will continue human rights abuses or adopt a new policy. Ex-military officers hold high positions in the Union Government. The presence of ex-military officers in key positions of the Union Government does not indicate significant changes in human rights policies. The Network for Human Rights Documentation\u2013Burma reported 167 cases of violations in the first three months of 2011, including forced labor, property confiscation, and child soldier conscription. Reports of ongoing human rights abuses in Burma persist. The Burmese government has been accused of human rights violations, including tightening regulations on Internet cafes and shutting down a news agency for alleged inaccuracies. Government troops in the Mon State were reported to be using civilians as \"human shields\" to avoid attacks. Other abuses include arbitrary detention of political and labor organizers and rape of minority women. The Burmese government faces accusations of human rights violations, including the arbitrary detention of political and labor organizers, rape of minority women by soldiers, and financial harassment of NGOs. Signs of growing impatience with Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD are evident, with the Ministry of Home Affairs warning the NLD to comply with the law regarding their activities. The NLD is facing criticism from the government, with veiled threats against Aung San Suu Kyi and her party for not accepting the 2008 constitution. The author accuses the NLD of making unreasonable demands and being influenced by external elements contrary to the people's interests. The author expresses concern about potential chaos and riots during Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's national tour. Despite warnings from the Ministry, she traveled to Pagan without incident. The new government has shown potential improvements by allowing the ICRC to resume visits to Burmese prisoners and lifting pre-publication censorship on certain categories of publications. Despite potential improvements in the new government's policies, all weekly journals, monthly magazines, and books in Burma still need to submit drafts to the censorship board. The human rights situation in Burma remains poor, with the country being designated as one of the nine most repressive in the world. Over 2,000 political prisoners are still held in detention, and rights violations against citizens, including ethnic minorities, continue. In Burma, political prisoners, including NLD members, ethnic group representatives, monks, students, and dissidents, face harsh conditions. President Thein Sein commuted death sentences to life in prison and reduced prison terms by one year, leading to the release of 55 political prisoners out of 14,578. Previous amnesties by the SPDC also had few political prisoners released. About 20 political prisoners in Insein Prison started a hunger strike after the latest amnesty announcement. Insein Prison hunger strikers demand better conditions and treatment for political prisoners. Some placed in \"punishment cells\" for their demands. SPDC and new government deny existence of political prisoners in Burma. Senator McCain was told the same during his visit. The International Human Rights Council reports 2,000 political prisoners in Myanmar, with discrimination against ethnic minorities by the Burman SPDC. Tensions arise from ethnic-based militias in eastern and northern Burma. The Burmese military has been in conflict with ethnic-based militias for the past 60 years, leading to internal displacement and refugee crises in Southeast Asia. The fighting escalated in 2011, causing more refugees to flee conflict areas. The military's attacks on the militias were in response to their refusal to become Border Guard Forces under Tatmadaw authority. Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1948, Burma has struggled to maintain national unity due to tensions between the majority Burmans and over 100 ethnic minorities. The Burmese military targeted various ethnic militias, leading to ongoing conflicts with little government intervention. The Panglong Agreement, signed by Aung San (Kyi) and ethnic minorities, aimed for autonomy in Frontier Areas. However, after Burma's independence, the agreement collapsed, leading to the rise of ethnic-based militias and conflicts with the Burmese military. The military junta's aggressive campaigns in 1962 caused a refugee crisis in Southeast Asia. In the 1990s, the Burmese military offered cease-fires to ethnic-based militias in exchange for autonomy. Some militias accepted, leading to a decade of relative peace. However, in 2004, General Khin Nyunt resigned and was immediately arrested. General Khin Nyunt resigned for health reasons and was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 44 years in jail on corruption charges. Burma's senior intelligence officers were also arrested, and the intelligence bureau was disbanded. The SPDC adopted a more hardline stance towards militias, leading to the detention and long jail sentences of ethnic opposition group leaders. Efforts to establish a ceasefire continue, with ongoing talks between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army. Aung San Suu Kyi called for an immediate ceasefire in a letter to President Thein Sein and ethnic-based militias on July 28, 2011. The Ethnic Nationalities Council (ENC) welcomed Aung San Suu Kyi's offer of assistance in ending hostilities, proposing a second Panglong Conference with ethnic minorities, NLD, and the Union Government. However, the SPDC, Union Government, and Tatmadaw rejected the proposal. Renewed fighting has led to a new wave of refugees fleeing conflicts in eastern and northern Burma. A new wave of refugees is fleeing conflicts in eastern and northern Burma. Over 10,000 people have moved near or across the border with China to avoid skirmishes between the Tatmadaw and the KIA in Kachin State. In southeastern Burma, more than 15,000 Karen have crossed into Thailand to escape fighting between the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army and the Burmese military. Tension is rising between the Union Government and China and Thailand due to the refugee crisis. China is pressuring Burma to stop assaults on the KIA, while Thailand is urging the Union Government to control the Tatmadaw to reduce the flow of refugees. Talks are being held between Thailand and Burma on repatriating Burmese refugees living in camps. The UNHCR report states that Burma is the world's fifth largest source of refugees, with over 415,000 Burmese refugees and 62,000 internally displaced people in the country. Many refugees live in camps along the borders with Bangladesh and Thailand, with over 141,000 in Thai camps, mostly ethnic Karen. Talks are being held with Burma on repatriating refugees. The camps in Bangladesh and Thailand house over 28,000 Burmese refugees, mainly Rohingyas. Malaysia has 15,000 registered Burmese refugees, while over 200,000 unregistered Rohingyas are in Bangladesh. India hosts over 80,000 Burmese refugees, mostly Chin escaping religious persecution. Smaller numbers of Burmese refugees are also found in Cambodia. Burmese refugees face challenges in resettlement efforts, with many at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation. Allegations of human trafficking and extortion of Rohingyas by officials in Malaysia and Thailand have drawn attention. Economic statistics for Burma are deemed unreliable, with the Central Statistical Organization lacking expertise to obtain accurate data. Burma also has a significant underground economy. Burma's economy includes an extensive underground sector, with citizens engaging in unrecorded work to improve their standard of living. The government keeps parts of the economy secret, such as the true value of natural gas and oil proceeds, to avoid sanctions and scrutiny. Despite being one of the poorest countries globally and the poorest in Southeast Asia, reliable data is scarce. The UNDP ranks Burma 132nd on the human development index, with widespread poverty affecting the rural population. 19% of the population is undernourished, and 32% of children are malnourished. The UNDP household survey showed a decrease in poverty from 32% in FY2005 to 26% in FY2010 in Burma. However, some observers doubt the survey due to unreliable census data. The country's economic woes are attributed to mismanagement by the SPDC, described as a \"kleptocracy\" where profitable industries are controlled by SPDC members. In 2010, the SPDC privatized government assets, transferring them to leaders and supporters before dissolution. The SPDC transferred ownership of rubber plantations, jade mines, and gold mines to junta leader Than Shwe and his family, contributing to Burma's reputation as one of the world's most corrupt countries. Corruption is widespread at all levels of society, with regional military commanders allegedly receiving payments from legal and illegal businesses. President Thein Sein's agricultural development program has been derailed by bribery and extortion. Poverty and corruption have helped the SPDC maintain power in Burma. The high level of poverty and corruption in Burma helped the SPDC maintain power by providing incentives for young men to enlist in the military. The additional income obtained through graft and extortion also contributed to loyalty. However, the privatization of government assets and appointment of Chief Ministers may have reduced these incentives. The Union Government faces economic challenges of increasing growth and decreasing inflation. Burma faces short-term economic challenges of increasing economic growth and decreasing inflation. Unofficial estimates suggest slower growth compared to other Southeast Asian nations, impacting the standard of living due to high inflation and rising food prices. The economy grew modestly in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, supported by agriculture recovery and government investments. Southeast Asia's recovery from the global financial crisis also contributed to Burma's growth and reduced inflationary pressures. Burma's economy saw growth in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, with inflation estimated at 8.2% and 7.3% respectively. In FY2011, the country experienced a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) totaling nearly $20 billion, mainly from China, Hong Kong, and Thailand. Most of the FDI went into oil, natural gas, power, and mining projects. However, some analysts believe the actual FDI amount may be lower than reported. Analysts suggest that the recent increase in inward FDI has weakened the impact of U.S. economic sanctions. Conflict in Burma, possibly linked to investment projects, has disrupted construction work and may deter new investments. The ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) could drive economic growth in Burma, with tariffs set to be eliminated for all member nations by 2015. There are concerns about Burma's readiness to adapt to tariff changes. President Thein Sein outlined his vision for Burma's economy, emphasizing the need for national industrialization to boost development, create employment opportunities, and increase per capita income. He proposed a market economy with government control over certain aspects, focusing on agriculture, industrialization, infrastructure, and education as key priorities. The new government in Burma aims to ensure reasonable prices for agricultural produce and provide microfinancing to the rural population. President Thein Sein plans to attract inward FDI for industrialization through special economic zones, like the one in Dawei Township. Critics question the President's economic priorities, advocating for a greater focus on poverty reduction. Some Burmese economists, like U Myint, advocate for poverty reduction, good governance, government accountability, and the elimination of corruption. Others suggest adjusting Burma's overvalued exchange rate to attract more inward FDI. Concerns also arise over worker rights violations by SPDC, Tatmadaw, and foreign investors. Additionally, Burma's ties with North Korea, particularly military exports, are causing unease globally. The military ties between Burma and North Korea, including trade in technology and equipment for nuclear weapons and missiles, are seen as a threat to regional security. Allegations of chemical weapons use by the Tatmadaw have raised concerns about Burma possessing such weapons. This trade may violate U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. Relations between the two countries have a rocky history since Burma's independence. The U Nu government of Burma supported the U.N. resolution on the Korean War but did not recognize North or South Korea as the de jure government. Despite maintaining relations with both Koreas, the ruling junta showed a bias towards North Korea. Trade between Burma and North Korea consisted mainly of industrial goods for food and raw materials. Relations were severed in 1983. Relations between Burma and North Korea were effectively severed in 1983 when North Korean agents detonated a bomb in Rangoon, killing 21 people in an apparent assassination attempt. Burma ordered the closure of North Korea's embassy and expelled its diplomatic corps. Official contact was reestablished in 1996, driven by Burma's interest in acquiring North Korean military equipment due to its similarity in design and cheaper cost compared to Chinese supplies. North Korea's willingness to conduct barter trade was also attractive to the Burmese junta. The flow of military equipment from North Korea to Burma expanded to include various weapons and technology. Burma showed interest in a nuclear weapons program with assistance from North Korea and Russia, but deals fell through. An estimated 1,000-2,000... In 2007, Burma's nuclear program with Russia collapsed, leading to talks with North Korea. Burmese military officers trained in Russia reported a nuclear program with North Korean assistance. Secret shipments and allegations of a nuclear weapons program in Burma emerged. In 2010, a report by DVB provided evidence of Burma's nuclear activities. The authors presented evidence of Burma's undisclosed nuclear program, possibly aiming to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon. Despite concerns, experts are skeptical about the reported involvement of North Korea in Burma's nuclear weapons program. Kelley's article in Foreign Affairs in May 2011 discussed the hypothesis of Burma-North Korea cooperation in the nuclear field, with some evidence of Burmese interest in ballistic missiles. Concerns about a Burmese nuclear program were raised due to defector reports, and Secretary Clinton expressed worry about potential nuclear technology transfer from North Korea to Burma in a 2009 interview. The U.S. is concerned about the transfer of nuclear technology from North Korea to Burma, extending to other weapons technology. In May 2011, the USS McCampbell intercepted a Belize cargo ship suspected of carrying weapons technology from North Korea to Burma. Requests to inspect the ship were denied, and it returned to North Korea. Political events in Burma have sparked discussions on U.S. policy towards the country, with scrutiny on existing sanctions and engagement policies. The debate on continuing existing sanctions in Burma focuses on their effectiveness in achieving U.S. policy goals of a democratic government and human rights. Discussions also examine the impact on Burma's economy and the behavior of its leaders. The effectiveness of U.S. sanctions on Burma is being debated in an international context where few nations follow the U.S. approach. Concerns have been raised about the enforcement of sanctions. Analysts have differing views on whether to lift or tighten sanctions, while some advocate a \"wait and see\" approach. The objectives of U.S. sanctions on Burma are to promote democracy, protect human rights, and release political prisoners. The sanctions aim to hold accountable those responsible for repression while minimizing harm to the general population. Debates continue on the effectiveness of sanctions, with differing views on enforcement and whether to lift or tighten them. The release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the parliamentary elections reinvigorated the debate on sanctions in Burma. Ethnic-based parties and the Democratic Party called for the end of sanctions to aid trade, investment, and technology development in ethnic areas. The National Democratic Force also advocated for the removal of \"non-targeted\" sanctions. The NLD reviewed sanctions on Burma, dismissing claims that they caused economic hardships for the people. They argued that sanctions targeted the military junta and their associates, not ordinary citizens. The NLD concluded that sanctions were effective in promoting political change in Burma. The NLD reviewed sanctions on Burma, arguing they were effective in promoting political change. Discussions were held with leading sanction nations to modify sanctions. The New Light of Myanmar criticized the review, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the United States. ASEAN called for the removal of sanctions to encourage political reconciliation in Burma. The International Crisis Group (ICG) report in March 2011 supported the removal of sanctions on Burma, citing harm to the people, undermining economic reforms, and reinforcing imbalances. However, a Washington Post op-ed warned against lifting sanctions, suggesting targeting rulers' finances and applying pressure on neighbors instead. The Economist acknowledged sanctions' limited effectiveness but proposed a different approach. The United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Burma, with the US having a more extensive regime. There are calls for a calibrated approach to lifting sanctions, considering the political reforms in Burma. Coordination of sanction regimes with other nations is unclear. The EU's goal for Burma is to establish a legitimate, democratically elected civilian government that respects human rights and rebuilds relations with the international community. Sanctions were imposed in 1996 due to the junta's failure to respect election results, lack of democratization progress, human rights violations, political prisoner detentions, and reluctance to engage meaningfully. EU sanctions against Burma have become stricter over the past decade and a half, with measures including arms embargo, visa bans on Burmese officials, asset freezes, and restrictions on imports and investments in certain sectors controlled by the government. These sanctions do not completely ban trade and business. EU sanctions against Burma have tightened over the years, including arms embargo, visa bans, asset freezes, and restrictions on certain sectors. In mid-April 2011, EU foreign ministers renewed most sanctions for 12 months but suspended the visa ban and asset freeze for 22 civilian officials. Critics fear this may lead to further easing of sanctions and create a gap between U.S. and EU measures. The EU's decision to relax sanctions on Burma in response to the 2010 election and the installation of a nominally civilian government has sparked debates on engagement versus isolation and pragmatism versus morality. Critics argue that the new Burmese government is civilian in name only, highlighting a potential gap between U.S. and EU sanctions policies. The EU's adoption of sanctions requires unanimous agreement from all member states, but there is skepticism among European policymakers about their effectiveness. Critics argue that European firms in Burma violate the spirit of sanctions, and enforcement is uneven as each member state is responsible for enforcement. Doubts about sanctions are amplified in Burma due to the commercial activities of countries like China, India, and Thailand. Many European policymakers believe that building economic, business, and cultural ties is more effective than sanctions in influencing change. The EU shows a preference for engagement in international relations, with a focus on dialogue and high-level visits to problematic regimes like Burma. The EU has resumed high-level official visits in anticipation of access to senior levels of the Government and key opposition figures in Burma. Some observers caution that economic interests may masquerade as pragmatic engagement in debates about EU sanctions on Burma. Advocates for relaxing sanctions reportedly have corporate interests in timber, energy, and mining in the country. Arguments about pragmatism and engagement are part of EU debates on sanctions. The EU debates on sanctions involve arguments about pragmatism and engagement, with policy outcomes influenced by a mix of factors including collective values and a sense of right and wrong. The 1992 Treaty on European Union emphasizes a values-based foreign policy supporting democracy and human rights. EU decisions on sanctions carry a moral component and prioritize consultation with partners and multilateral action. Stakeholder input is considered, including civil society, opposition groups, ASEAN members, and regional partners. The EU and the United States may not always agree on international sanctions, but their approaches towards Burma remain compatible and complementary. The EU adjusted its Burma sanctions regime in April 2011, maintaining unanimous support for extensive sanctions with added flexibility for constructive engagement. Sanctions have been suspended for 12 months and can be reinstated based on developments. Australia and Canada also have significant involvement in the issue. Australia and Canada have imposed targeted sanctions on Burma, with Australia's sanctions including an arms embargo, travel restrictions, and financial service restrictions on Burmese officials. Canada's sanctions, effective since December 13, 2007, include bans on goods exports and imports from Burma, with exemptions for humanitarian assistance. Canada has imposed sanctions on Burma, including a freeze on assets, a ban on new investments, and prohibitions on financial services and exports. China, India, Japan, and other ASEAN countries do not impose sanctions on Burma, with China rejecting calls for sanctions in the past. India and Russia blocked a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an end to political repression in Burma. India resists U.S. pressure for sanctions due to concerns about Chinese influence. Japan suspended foreign assistance to Burma in 1998 but has provided fluctuating humanitarian aid since. Japan has provided limited assistance to Burma and has called for political and economic reforms. ASEAN's position on Burma is complex due to internal differences among its members and the ASEAN Charter's principle of non-interference. The other nine ASEAN members have varying political systems and have different perspectives on Burma. ASEAN members have differing stances on Burma, with some supporting democratic reforms while others favor non-interference. In 2011, ASEAN called for sanctions on Burma to be lifted, and Burma requested to chair ASEAN in 2014. The United States opposes this until significant political improvements occur. The issue was discussed at the 18th ASEAN Summit in May 2011, but no decision was made. The issue of Burma's request to chair ASEAN in 2014 was discussed during ASEAN meetings in 2011, with a final decision expected at the 19th ASEAN Summit in November 2011. There are concerns about the enforcement of U.S. sanctions on Burma and the lack of coordination with other nations' policies. The existing U.S. sanctions regime on Burma is complex, with provisions in multiple laws and Executive Orders. Enforcement has been questioned for lacking rigor and thoroughness, attributed to reasons like resource constraints and geopolitical concerns. Some elements of the sanctions regime have raised legality issues within U.S. government agencies. The State Department has failed to enforce Section 6(b) of the 2003 Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which requires the posting of banned individuals' names on its website. Critics question the legality of the Department's interpretation, citing privacy concerns for visa applicants. The 2008 JADE Act expands the list of sanctioned Burmese officials and requires the Treasury Secretary to prohibit certain financial services to those on the visa ban list. The President must consider data from other countries and entities applying sanctions against Burma. The Act also mandates sufficient resources for identifying potential sanctioned persons. The 2008 JADE Act expands the list of sanctioned Burmese officials and requires updates to be sent to congressional committees. President Bush limited the list to those on the SDN List, leading to criticism that the Act's effectiveness was reduced. Critics argue that the Treasury Department has devoted less effort to identifying and adding Burmese individuals to the SDN List. The USCB list includes individuals who support the Burmese military or government but are not on the SDN List. Critics argue that existing sanctions on Burma are not effectively enforced, leading to a lack of influence on the behavior of the government and military. Improved enforcement and possibly additional sanctions are deemed necessary. Improved enforcement and possibly additional sanctions are necessary for U.S. sanctions on Burma to be effective. Coordination with other nations, such as China, India, Thailand, and ASEAN, is crucial to imposing sanctions on those responsible for human rights abuses in Burma. The President should negotiate an international arrangement to prevent the trade in Burmese jadeite and rubies. The Special Representative for Burma will consult with China, India, Thailand, Japan, ASEAN, and the EU to coordinate policies. The Secretary of State will coordinate with the EU on visa bans. The creation of the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma aims to improve international coordination efforts. There are debates surrounding the effectiveness of bilateral talks with Burmese officials, with some believing it is necessary for achieving U.S. objectives, while others see it as rewarding an oppressive government. The Obama Administration has faced criticism and support for reengaging in communications with Burma. The Obama Administration has faced frustration in meetings with Burmese officials before the creation of the Union Government. Recent talks have shown some progress, but sharp differences in perspective remain. Burmese officials view recent events as progress towards \"disciplined democracy\" and request the removal of sanctions, which the Obama Administration does not see as warranted. Congress has played a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma over the past 20 years by imposing sanctions in response to the Burmese military's actions, such as the brutal suppression of the 8888 Uprising and the failure to respect election results. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 was passed in reaction to the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders. The 112th Congress may play a role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma through oversight, passing new legislation, publicizing issues, and serving as a channel of communication with Burmese officials and interest groups. U.S. sanctions laws on Burma remain in effect. The 112th Congress has a role in overseeing U.S. sanctions laws on Burma, with two resolutions introduced for renewal. The House passed H.J. Res. 66, but the Senate has not taken action. Executive Branch agencies must provide reports on sanctions enforcement to selected congressional committees. The 112th Congress may request special briefings or hold hearings to evaluate U.S. policy towards Burma, potentially modifying existing sanctions and conditions for engagement. This requires a comprehensive assessment of the current situation in Burma to advance U.S. policy goals. The 112th Congress may consider modifying existing sanctions on Burma, including the possibility of removing some sanctions through new legislation or presidential authority. The Obama Administration has discussed current sanctions with Burmese officials, who also seek changes such as renaming the country to Myanmar and relaxing travel restrictions for their UN delegation. Additionally, new or stricter sanctions could be imposed by Congress. The 112th Congress may consider modifying existing sanctions on Burma, including the possibility of removing some sanctions through new legislation or presidential authority. Among the additional sanctions previously considered are a total ban on merchandise trade with Burma, broadening the import ban to cover all trade with Burma, expanding the list of banned materials, and imposing an arms embargo. The United States could advocate for an international embargo on the trade of military equipment with Burma and prohibit investments in Burma by U.S. persons. Suggestions include making Section 5(c) of the JADE Act mandatory to apply more pressure on other nations to adopt a similar policy towards Burma. The United States could implement various measures to impose sanctions on Burma, such as closing correspondent accounts, prohibiting government contracts, and removing trade preferences. These actions would aim to pressure other nations to adopt similar policies towards Burma. The United States could consider implementing sanctions on Burma, including supporting an international investigation into allegations of international crimes against civilians. Factors to consider include Burma's new government and the need for reformulating U.S. policy towards Burma. The situation in Burma is complex, with ongoing conflicts between the Tatmadaw and ethnic-based militias. Aung San Suu Kyi's future treatment and the political landscape post-2010 elections are uncertain. Reports required under U.S. Burma sanctions laws outline information distribution and reporting requirements. Appendix C provides a breakdown of Burma's November 2010 election results by political party. Appendix D lists Burma's current Ministers and their portfolios. Appendix E lists Burma's active ethnic-based militias. Burma's active ethnic-based militias are categorized into Non-Ceasefire Groups, Ceasefire Groups That Rejected Border Guard Force Status, and Ceasefire Groups That Accepted Border Guard Force Status. Key groups include the Karen National Union (KNU), Wa National Organization, and Democratic Karen Buddhist Army. Ceasefire groups in Myanmar include Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, Karen Peace Force, Karenni Nationalities Peoples Liberation Front, Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army-Kokang, New Democratic Army-Kachin, and various other local militia groups."
