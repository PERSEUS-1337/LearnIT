    "title": "AB 1508",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14211 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to require that at least 25 percent of funds under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014 be spent on workforce training programs for adults and dislocated workers starting in 2012. This can be achieved by using base formula funds or a combination of base formula funds and leveraged funds. Beginning in 2016, local workforce development boards must spend at least 30 percent of funds from the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act on workforce training programs for adults and dislocated workers. This can be achieved by using base formula funds or a combination of base formula funds and leveraged funds. Training services that count towards this requirement include occupational skills training and on-the-job training. Training programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act include on-the-job training, workplace training with related instruction, skill upgrading, entrepreneurial training, incumbent worker training, transitional jobs, job readiness training, adult education and literacy activities, and customized training with job commitment. Local workforce development boards can receive a credit of up to 10 percent of their adult and dislocated worker formula fund base allocations for training services. This credit can be applied towards minimum training requirements and leveraged funds include Federal Pell Grants, programs authorized by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, trade adjustment assistance, and Department of Labor National Emergency Grants. The funding sources available for training services include trade adjustment assistance, Department of Labor National Emergency Grants, employer and industry match funds, joint labor-management trust match funds, employment training panel grants, and supportive services defined by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds can be used for supportive services and transitional employment for individuals enrolled in training under the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Additionally, other local, state, or federal funds can be used for training or supportive services for individuals enrolled in the Act for reporting and tracking purposes. The state board can approve other public or private funds for training and supportive services for individuals enrolled in the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. Credit for leveraged funds is given if records are kept by the local workforce development board and costs are independently verified. Training participants must be coenrolled in the Act's performance monitoring system. The local workforce development board has the option to use leveraged funds for training requirements, with the responsibility of covering recordkeeping costs. The Employment Development Department will assess each board's compliance with expenditure requirements and provide individual calculations. A local workforce development area must submit a corrective action plan to the Employment Development Department if it fails to meet expenditure requirements within 90 days. The definition of \"program year\" is consistent with federal regulations. This act is deemed urgent for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. Making changes to the training mandate before local workforce development boards submit their plans in March 2017 is crucial for providing access to job, skill development, and business services for communities in the state."
