    "content": "The Act of 1997 is titled the \"Imported Fire Ant Control, Management, and Eradication Act.\" Congress finds that imported fire ants infest 13 southern and southeastern States, covering over 275,000,000 acres. The annual impact in Texas is estimated at $300,000,000, with $67,000,000 affecting the cattle industry. In Georgia, the annual impact is $46,000,000, including $12,000,000 on households. In Georgia, the annual impact of fire ants is estimated at $12,000,000. Row crop farmers in southern Arkansas experience average annual losses exceeding $1,100 due to fire ants, while catfish farmers in Arkansas face losses of around $20,000 annually. Homeowners in Arkansas are impacted by fire ants to the tune of $106,000,000 yearly, and paper mills in Arkansas suffer losses of $3,000,000 annually. Additionally, 25 counties in North Carolina are infested with fire ants, and the annual impact on Tennessee is estimated at $1,330,000. In Mississippi, the annual impact of fire ants is $12,326,000, including a significant impact on the cattle industry of $9,217,000. Alabama also faces an annual fire ant impact. The annual fire ant impact on Alabama is estimated at $16,000,000, while in Louisiana it is estimated at $23,818,250, including an impact on the feed grain industry. Demonstrating fire ant control methods can help property owners reduce costs associated with fire ant damage. The National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 is amended to include a new section, 1419B, focusing on research grants for imported fire ant control, management, and eradication. This initiative aims to address the significant economic impact of fire ants on states like Alabama and Louisiana, where costs associated with fire ant damage are substantial. The Secretary will establish a National Advisory and Implementation Board on Imported Fire Ant Control, consisting of 12 experts in various fields appointed from academia, research institutes, and the private sector. Board members will not receive compensation but will be reimbursed for necessary expenses. The National Advisory and Implementation Board on Imported Fire Ant Control will terminate 60 days after submitting the national plan to the Secretary. The Board will provide initial grants for research projects related to controlling imported fire ants, selecting 4 to 13 projects within a year of the proposal request. The National Advisory and Implementation Board on Imported Fire Ant Control will award $6,000,000 in grants for 4 to 13 research projects on controlling imported fire ants. Projects must be completed within 5 years. Subsequent grants will be evaluated based on the outcomes of the initial projects. The National Advisory and Implementation Board on Imported Fire Ant Control will award $6,000,000 in grants for 4 to 13 research projects on controlling imported fire ants. Projects must be completed within 5 years. The Secretary will select 2 projects for additional research with a grant of $4,000,000 each. The National Advisory and Implementation Board on Imported Fire Ant Control will award grants for research projects to prepare a national plan for controlling imported fire ants. Projects must be completed within 2 years. The Board will evaluate and select projects for the national plan. The National Advisory and Implementation Board on Imported Fire Ant Control will award a grant of up to $5,000,000 for the final preparation of a national plan for the control, management, and possible eradication of imported fire ants. The plan must be completed within 1 year of receiving the grant and submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary will then report the national plan to Congress within 60 days."
