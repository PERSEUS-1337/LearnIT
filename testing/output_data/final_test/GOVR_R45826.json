    "content": "Congress establishes advisory commissions for various purposes, such as providing expert advice on complex issues and generating policy recommendations. Commissions are authorized to hold hearings, conduct research, and deliver their findings in written reports to Congress. For example, the 9/11 Commission was created to investigate the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and submitted its findings in a final report to Congress and the President. The commission ultimately submitted a final report to Congress and the President with 48 policy recommendations. Commissions require funding to meet their goals, and factors like hiring staff and reimbursing travel expenses can contribute to overall costs. Funding and amounts received by commissions vary, and the duration of a commission can significantly impact its cost. This report analyzes funding methods, amounts provided, and fund utilization by past congressional commissions. A congressional commission is defined as a temporary, advisory entity appointed by Congress, differentiating it from other types of commissions. The report analyzes funding methods, amounts provided, and fund utilization by past congressional commissions established between 1989 and 2018. The report analyzes funding methods and utilization by past congressional commissions established between 1989 and 2018. Congressional commissions may be commemorative or noncommemorative, with the majority being noncommemorative and focused on conducting studies, investigations, and providing expert advice on public policy issues. Only the original funding method specified in the commission's legislation is considered, without reflecting any subsequent amendments. A smaller number of congressional commissions, approximately 12%, have been created to oversee the commemoration of a person, group, or event. Commemorative commissions coordinate celebrations and events to coincide with milestones. The scope and duties of commemorative commissions differ from noncommemorative ones, affecting funding needs. Figures on commission funding mechanisms are analyzed separately. Commission funding mechanisms for commemorative and noncommemorative commissions are broken out separately. Congressional commissions are funded through authorizations of appropriations, federal agency funding, or private donations. The majority of commission statutes specify how funding should be provided, either through separate appropriations legislation, existing department funds, or solely by appropriations. Commission statutes vary in funding mechanisms, with some specifying dollar amounts for appropriations while others identify funding sources without specific values. Approximately 42% of commission statutes authorized appropriations, with most specifying a dollar amount. Some statutes limit the time period for funds availability, while others do not. Approximately 42% of commission statutes authorized appropriations, with most specifying a dollar amount for expenses. Provisions for funding mechanisms varied, with some statutes identifying specific fiscal years for appropriations. Funding may be provided in appropriations acts, and some statutes authorize the use of otherwise appropriated funds. Some commission statutes authorize the use of appropriated funds for commission expenses, with varying methods of funding specified. This approach is more common among noncommemorative commissions than commemorative ones. Specific dollar amounts for commission expenses may or may not be identified in these statutes. The S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 established the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence with up to $10 million in funding from the Department of Defense. In contrast, the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission did not specify a dollar figure for funding. The commission may receive funds upon request from the chairman, and can also operate using nonappropriated funds and private donations. For example, the 400 Years of African-American History Commission and the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission were authorized to accept gifts, services, and property, with all expenditures made solely from donated funds. Federal funds cannot be used for these commissions. The commission can accept donations, including money, property, and volunteer services, to carry out its duties. Statutes authorize commissions to receive donations to facilitate their commemorative functions, such as the Thomas Jefferson Commemoration Commission and the Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary Commission. Federal funds cannot be used for these commissions. The funding for congressional commissions can vary greatly, ranging from several hundred thousand dollars to several million dollars. The availability of funds and resources can impact a commission's ability to fulfill its duties effectively. The funding levels for congressional commissions vary widely, impacting their ability to fulfill duties. Data on past funding amounts is scattered, with no comprehensive source. CRS analyzed appropriations acts since the 101st Congress to identify specific dollar amounts allocated to commissions. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) analyzed appropriations acts to identify specific dollar amounts allocated to commissions. The data may be approximate due to limitations, such as not reflecting the total available funding for commissions and potential funding from sources other than appropriations. The Congressional Research Service analyzed appropriations acts to identify specific dollar amounts allocated to commissions, which may not reflect the total available funding or funding from sources other than appropriations. Committee reports accompanying appropriations bills may provide details on how appropriated funds are to be spent. When allocating funds to commissions, appropriations acts may refer to the statute creating the commission instead of its name. This can lead to search results being excluded if conducted using the commission's name. Continuing resolutions may also provide funding without specifying activities by name, potentially omitting amounts available to commissions. Appropriations acts may also set maximum funding levels. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY1994 set a maximum funding level for the Commission on the Social Security \"Notch\" Issue. Tables display data on amounts specified in appropriations acts for noncommemorative and commemorative commissions. Amounts are provided in both nominal and constant 2019 dollars. Amounts provided to commissions vary widely, ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Commissions may use funds for various expenses such as paying commissioners, staff, consultants, and travel costs. Policymakers may find it useful to understand how commissions utilize their funds for designing new commissions or overseeing existing ones. This report analyzes expenditure data for congressional commissions that reported their expenditures in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) database. FACA requires formal reporting, administration, and oversight procedures for committees advising the executive branch. Congressional commissions vary in the amounts provided, and understanding how they utilize funds can be beneficial for policymakers designing or overseeing commissions. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) database contains expenditure data for congressional commissions, with some subject to FACA and reporting to the General Services Administration (GSA). Twenty out of 153 identified commissions reported expenditures across categories like personnel and travel costs. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) database contains expenditure data for congressional commissions, with some subject to FACA and reporting to the General Services Administration (GSA). Twenty out of 153 identified commissions reported expenditures across categories like personnel and travel costs. Expenditures were further disaggregated by federal commission members, nonfederal commission members, federal staff, and consultants. The total reported expenditures of each commission were calculated, including costs for commissioner pay, staff pay, consultant pay, travel and per diem expenses, and other expenses. Differences in costs and expenditure patterns may exist between FACA and non-FACA commissions. Data accuracy and completeness in the FACA database have not been independently verified by CRS. Table 4 in the FACA database shows reported expenditures of 20 congressional commissions, including total spending, breakdown by categories like commissioner pay, federal staff pay, consultant pay, travel expenses, and other costs. Expenditures varied from $286,851 to $13,855,998, with federal staff and consultant pay often making up a significant portion of the spending. Expenditures for congressional commissions mainly consist of federal staff and consultant pay, with travel expenses ranging from 2% to 34% of total spending. Some commissions do not compensate their members, while others allocate up to 29% of their budget for member payments. These commissions play a crucial role in informing Congress, providing expert advice, making policy recommendations, and organizing commemorative activities. Funding for these commissions comes from various sources. The cost of congressional commissions varies depending on scope, duties, and duration. There is no comprehensive data on funds allocated or how they are used. Better data on funding and expenditures could help policymakers create and oversee future commissions. Congress could require periodic financial reports from commissions to improve transparency. Congress has required commissions to submit periodic financial reports detailing income and expenditures to keep informed of commission operations and resource utilization. However, these reporting requirements may burden limited commission time and resources."
