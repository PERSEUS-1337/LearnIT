    "content": "Both H.R. 1586 and S. 651 propose special taxing rules on bonuses for employees of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and certain federally assisted entities. H.R. 1586 taxes bonuses at 90% as income to the employee, while S. 651 imposes a 35% excise tax on both the employee and entity. Effective tax rates could exceed 35% for employees subject to both taxes. Both bills apply to bonuses received after January 1, 2009. Both H.R. 1586 and S. 651 propose special taxing rules on bonuses for employees of certain entities. H.R. 1586 taxes bonuses at 90% as income to the employee, while S. 651 imposes a 35% excise tax on both the employee and entity. Both bills apply retroactively to payments received, raising constitutional challenges. Arguments include violations of equal protection, due process, takings, ex post facto legislation, and bills of attainder. Targeting certain taxpayers for unfavorable tax treatment may raise equal protection concerns under the Fifth Amendment. The rational basis test is a low standard of review by the courts for tax classifications made by legislatures. Courts typically defer to legislative discretion in creating tax policies, as legislatures have broad latitude in classification. Congress has a low bar to justify its rationale for tax classifications in bills like H.R. 1586 and S. 651, which apply retroactively to certain entities. The rationale for tax classifications in bills like H.R. 1586 and S. 651 may not be easily justified, as they may evidence a punitive intent aimed at one company. This could lead a court to question the legitimacy of the government's interest in these classifications. The legislative history of bills like H.R. 1586 may raise concerns about targeting specific companies, potentially leading a court to question the government's justification for these classifications. The 90% rate in H.R. 1586 could be seen as punitive rather than a tax, making it more susceptible to scrutiny. However, courts may also consider the broad application of the bills to companies receiving taxpayer money, not just those mentioned in the legislative history. Ultimately, courts may look for independent justifications for the bills beyond targeting specific groups of bonus recipients and payors. The legislative history of bills like H.R. 1586 may raise concerns about targeting specific companies, potentially leading a court to question the government's justification for these classifications. The $5 billion threshold may be reasonable under the theory that regulatory concerns are heightened in cases of entities receiving a significant amount of government funds. The question of whether these bills violate the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth Amendment may turn on whether the bills and their legislative history support this interpretation. Both bills apply to bonuses received on or after January 1, 2009, in taxable years ending on or after that date. The bills in question apply to payments received on or after January 1, 2009, in taxable years ending after that date. Retroactive tax legislation may raise due process concerns, but the courts have a low threshold for Congress to justify its rationale for retroactive application. The legislative history may indicate an intent to target specific companies, potentially leading to equal protection challenges. The retroactive tax legislation back to January 1, 2009, is likely constitutionally permissible, as it aligns with customary congressional practice. Due process concerns may arise with extended retroactivity, but reliance on prior law by taxpayers is generally not a significant factor in the analysis. The retroactive tax legislation back to January 1, 2009, is likely constitutionally permissible, as it aligns with customary congressional practice. Lack of notice of retroactive effect of tax law not dispositive of due process violation. Amendment to federal income tax laws not a wholly new tax. Excise tax in S. 651 may be argued as a new tax but falls within pre-existing framework. The tax legislation retroactively imposed aligns with customary congressional practice and is likely constitutionally permissible. The tax imposed by H.R. 1586 and S. 651 is not considered a violation of due process or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The tax rates in H.R. 1586 and the multiple taxation of bonus income in S. 651 are within the existing framework regulating employee compensation. The compound tax rate for high-income individuals could reach 70%, but even at these high rates, it is unlikely to be considered a taking. While a 90% tax rate is closer to being confiscatory, it is not unprecedented, as seen during World War II. Retroactively taxing bonus payments within one year of enactment is not considered a taking under the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court has indicated that retroactive taxes for modest periods do not offend due process or the Takings Clause. Few takings decisions on retroactive taxes have found no constitutional issues, unless the tax is deemed an arbitrary confiscation of property. The curr_chunk discusses the arbitrary nature of a certain act, suggesting it may constitute a violation of the 5th Amendment. The Supreme Court has not definitively defined the \"arbitrary\" threshold, but targeting a specific group for taxation could be seen as unfair singling out. This raises questions about whether a taking of property has occurred. The curr_chunk discusses the factors relevant to determining if a taking has occurred, emphasizing that the principle of \"taxes are not takings\" suggests the bills in question would not be considered takings. The possibility of invalidating the tax as a remedy for any potential taking is also mentioned. The bills in question may violate the ex post facto clause, but the Court has historically interpreted this clause to apply only to criminal punishment. Tax legislation is generally not considered a criminal penalty, so it is unlikely that these bills would be deemed unconstitutional on those grounds. The structure of the bills does not indicate a criminal penalty, and it is unlikely that Congress intended for them to be treated as such. In Burgess v. Salmon, the Court recharacterized a tax as a criminal penalty, finding that the retroactive application violated the prohibition on ex post facto laws. The legislation increased the federal tobacco stamp tax and imposed criminal penalties on transfers without the proper stamp. The Court held that imposing the higher tax was impermissible since the taxpayer had already paid the stamp tax. The Court concluded that the higher tax and criminal penalties were \"equally authorized,\" leading to a violation of the ex post facto prohibition. The Court's analysis in Burgess v. Salmon found that a higher tax could be recharacterized as a criminal penalty, violating the prohibition on ex post facto laws. The tax imposed by the legislation could lose its character as a tax and become a penalty if it has a high rate and deterrent purpose, but other features must also be considered to distinguish it from a typical tax. The analysis suggests that high rate and punitive intent may not classify a tax as a penalty, supporting that taxes in H.R. 1586 and S. 651 are not punishment under the ex post facto clause. The Constitution prohibits bills of attainder, defined as laws determining guilt and punishment without judicial trial, to prevent Congress from usurping judicial power. The curr_chunk discusses the legislature's power to pass bills of attainder and bills of pains and penalties, which allow for punishment without a trial based on political necessity. This contrasts with the Constitution's prohibition of bills of attainder to prevent Congress from acting as a judicial body. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria courts use to determine if legislation is a bill of attainder, focusing on specificity and punishment. The Supreme Court has held that specificity is met if individuals are identified by past conduct. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Lovett that naming specific individuals for past behavior in legislation can be considered a violation of the specificity prong. This was demonstrated when Congress passed a law labeling three government employees as subversive and withholding their salaries without a judicial trial. The defense against a bill of attainder challenge is to show that the statute is not meant to punish but to implement a legitimate regulatory scheme. This analysis, typically considered under the punitive prong, may also impact the specificity prong. In Nixon v. Administrator of General Service, the Court evaluated the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, which required former President Richard Nixon to turn over his papers and tape recordings. Nixon challenged the constitutionality of the act as a bill of attainder, but the Court found it constitutional despite its specificity. The Court in Nixon v. Administrator of General Services found that the act requiring Nixon to turn over his papers and tape recordings was constitutional as it served a valid regulatory purpose. The Court also questioned whether the statute met the specificity prong of the test, suggesting that any level of specificity is acceptable as long as a rational, non-punitive basis for the legislation can be established. H.R. 1586 would impose special taxing rules on bonuses paid to employees of certain entities receiving assistance over $5 billion under EESA after December 31, 2007. H.R. 1586 and S. 651 propose taxing bonuses received by entities that received financial assistance after specific dates. H.R. 1586 suggests a 90% tax rate on bonuses received after December 31, 2008, while S. 651 applies to entities receiving over $100 million in assistance and imposes a 35% excise tax on both employees and entities paying bonuses. The bills H.R. 1586 and S. 651 propose taxing bonuses received by entities that received financial assistance after specific dates. H.R. 1586 suggests a 90% tax rate on bonuses received after December 31, 2008, while S. 651 applies to entities receiving over $100 million in assistance and imposes a 35% excise tax on bonuses. S. 651 may have a broader retroactive application beyond AIG due to its lower threshold for inclusion in the bill. The level of specificity in the final bill's parameters is not immediately clear. The parameters of the legislation may affect the size and composition of the class, with different tax rates proposed in H.R. 1586 and S. 651 for bonuses received by entities that received financial assistance. The 35% excise tax in S. 651, in addition to federal or state income tax, may limit the number or level of bonuses paid. Evaluation under the specificity prong of a bill of attainder analysis is questioned. The specificity prong of a bill of attainder analysis is crucial, as each case is unique and context-dependent. Both H.R. 1586 and S. 651 could impact various individuals or entities with differing bonus amounts and tax levels. These bills have both retrospective and prospective applications, potentially affecting executives who received large bonuses in the past. The bills H.R. 1586 and S. 651 could impact individuals who received large bonuses in the past and those who receive bonuses after the bills are enacted. Past and future behavior being targeted is not necessarily fatal to a bill of attainder challenge. In Brown, the Court focused on the fact that once a person had entered the Communist party, withdrawal did not relieve the disability for five years. The requirement of specificity is not defeated by the potential of future persons being added to the identified group. In the instant case, executives who received bonuses after December 31, 2009, cannot meaningfully withdraw, meeting a per se criteria for specificity. The level of specificity provided by the statute in question may not meet traditional tax purposes, as it could be seen as a means to punish employees and entities. Factors such as group size and burden imposed could influence a court's decision on this matter. The court may consider factors like size and burden when determining if legislation is punitive. The Supreme Court has identified three types of punitive legislation that are prohibited by the ban on bills of attainder. These include burdens traditionally seen as punitive, burdens that do not further non-punitive purposes, and legislative intent to punish. Various punishments historically associated with bills of attainder include capital punishment. The Supreme Court has historically associated bills of attainder with punishments like capital punishment, imprisonment, fines, banishment, and confiscation of property. While taxation has not been considered a traditional form of punishment, a high tax rate could potentially be seen as confiscation of property. A 100% tax on past income, for example, may be viewed as confiscatory. A 90% marginal tax rate has historical precedent but is uncommon, especially when targeting a specific income source. A 35% excise tax on income, along with a marginal tax rate of 35%, could result in a high tax rate but still retain some value for the recipient. While taxation is not traditionally seen as punishment, a tax law imposed for punitive reasons could be considered a bill of attainder. The Court has stated that any legislative act inflicting punishment without a trial is prohibited by the Constitution. For example, a special tax targeting descendants of slave-holders for reparations could be vulnerable to challenge as a bill of attainder. The Supreme Court has indicated that legislative burdens not traditionally associated with bills of attainder might still be considered punishment. The severity of the burden imposed would need to be examined to determine if it serves a non-punitive legislative purpose. Various Supreme Court decisions have invalidated legislation barring specific groups from professions as a form of punishment. In Cummings v. Missouri, the Court noted that disqualification from certain professions could also be considered punitive. The Supreme Court has indicated that legislative burdens not traditionally associated with bills of attainder might still be considered punishment. The severity of the burden imposed would need to be examined to determine if it serves a non-punitive legislative purpose. In Flemming v. Nestor, the Court upheld termination of Social Security benefits to persons deported for events occurring before the passage of the legislation terminating benefits. The Court noted that only the clearest proof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of a statute on bill of attainder grounds. The Supreme Court has emphasized the difficulty of determining Congressional motives and the need to uphold the presumption of constitutionality. Unlike previous cases, the current legislation lacks a clear nonpunitive purpose, raising questions about its constitutionality. The legislation in question may be characterized as taxes imposed to influence future behavior, particularly aimed at curbing bonuses for high-income individuals. The Supreme Court has highlighted the challenge of discerning Congressional motives and the importance of upholding the presumption of constitutionality. The excise tax imposed on employers may lead to a reduction or elimination of certain bonuses. This type of tax has precedence in discouraging specific activities, such as lobbying or voter registration drives, by private foundations through high tax rates. Failure to distribute enough income by a private foundation incurs a tax rate of 30% on the undistributed income, with an additional 100% tax if the income remains uncorrected. The excise tax on private foundations includes a 30% tax on undistributed income, with a 100% tax if the income remains uncorrected. There is also a 200% tax for excess holdings in a business entity if not addressed. These taxes are seen as punitive and designed to discourage certain activities. The instant bills may raise constitutional issues as they appear to impose punitive taxation to deter future conduct, but retroactive application would not be justified. The level of taxation seems punitive even without deterrence, potentially lacking a valid regulatory purpose aside from punishment. The bills may be intended to raise revenue for the United States Treasury through taxing bonuses paid out by certain entities, potentially generating millions of dollars in federal revenue. The relationship between the individuals identified and the tax imposed may be less important if the tax is imposed as a revenue-raising measure. Additionally, the tax could be seen as a measure to influence behavior while also raising revenue. The tax bills aim to raise revenue by taxing bonuses and influence behavior. The retrospective application raises revenue, while the prospective application discourages behavior. Specificity is crucial in identifying regulatory goals for the act. The tax bills aim to raise revenue by taxing bonuses and influence behavior. The retrospective application raises revenue, while the prospective application discourages behavior. The legislative history can help determine if the intended purpose of the legislation was revenue-raising. The legislative history of H.R. 1586 does not clearly support the theory that retroactive tax laws were intended to raise revenue. During debate, few remarks mentioned the regulatory purpose, but none specifically mentioned revenue raising as the basis for the proposed bills. The legislation aimed to prevent individuals from benefiting from retroactive bonuses, potentially indicating a punitive intent. Courts consider specificity and punishment as key factors in determining if legislation is a bill of attainder. Specificity can be met by identifying individuals based on past conduct, even if future persons may be added to the group. The legislation in question targets executives who received bonuses after January 1, 2009, and may be considered punitive based on factors such as specificity and punishment. A tax rate of 90% on past income, as proposed in H.R. 1586, could potentially be seen as a form of punishment by a court. The 90% income tax in H.R. 1586 and the 35% excise tax in S. 651 may be seen as punitive measures. Concerns are raised about the retrospective application of the tax being viewed as punishment. The primary non-punitive regulatory purpose for the tax appears to be revenue generation. The legislative history suggests that while revenue generation is a possible purpose for the statute, there are indications of a congressional intent to punish individuals receiving bonuses. H.R. 1586 raises more serious constitutional concerns compared to S. 651."
