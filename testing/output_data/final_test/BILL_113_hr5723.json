Medicaid is crucial for providing coverage to working families, including pregnant women, children, and individuals with disabilities. In 2013, the program covered 62 million Americans, with enrollment projected to increase by 12.8 million by 2016. If all states expand their programs, an estimated 7 million women aged 18 to 64 would gain coverage. In 47 States and the District of Columbia, Medicaid pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for the same primary care services. Studies show that higher Medicaid payment rates would increase provider acceptance of new Medicaid patients. Congress acted to increase Medicaid payments for certain primary care services to be not less than Medicare rates for 2013 and 2014, aiming to address low provider participation and improve access to healthcare. Demand for primary care services is expected to rise, especially among women aged 18 to 44 who predominantly see OB/GYN physicians. It is crucial for primary care providers, including OB/GYNs, to receive adequate reimbursement from Medicaid. Nurse practitioners and mid-level health professionals play a significant role in delivering primary care services, and aligning their reimbursement rates with Medicare can enhance Medicaid participation and improve access to care. The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures providers have the financial capability to serve their patients' primary care needs, increasing access to critical health care services for women and children nationwide. Adding nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, and OB/GYN physicians in primary care settings further enhances access to care, particularly in underserved areas.
