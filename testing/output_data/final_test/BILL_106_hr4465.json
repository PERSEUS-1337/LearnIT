    "content": "The \"Fairness in Textile Trade Act of 2000\" aims to equalize trade in textile and apparel goods between the United States and WTO member countries. The \"Fairness in Textile Trade Act of 2000\" sets the policy for the United States to negotiate reciprocal market access in textile and apparel goods within the WTO. The President must determine if each WTO member country provides similar market access for US textile and apparel goods by December 31 of each year. The \"Fairness in Textile Trade Act of 2000\" requires the President to impose measures on countries that provide less favorable market access for US textile and apparel goods. The President must negotiate agreements to remove trade barriers and adjust measures if agreements are reached. The \"Fairness in Textile Trade Act of 2000\" mandates the President to ensure that market access for textile and apparel goods between the US and other countries is similar. The President must report annually to Congress on actions taken, including determinations, measures implemented, negotiations, and adjustments. Definitions for \"WTO\" and \"WTO member country\" are provided in the Act. The term \"WTO member country\" is defined in the Fairness in Textile Trade Act of 2000 as per the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. SEC. 3 of the Fairness in Textile Trade Act allows producers, distributors, or retailers of textile goods to bring civil actions against violators of customs laws for damages incurred. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish the violation by a preponderance of evidence. This remedy is exclusive and cannot be sought if damages have been recovered under another law for the same violation. SEC. 4 extends benefit period for trade readjustment allowances for workers in training programs. SEC. 5 amends the Trade Act of 1974 to extend the benefit period from 26 to 52 weeks. The amendments apply to workers covered by a certification of eligibility issued under specific chapters of the Act. SEC. 25B is a new section in the Internal Revenue Code that addresses health insurance costs for individuals receiving trade adjustment assistance. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code allows individuals receiving trade adjustment assistance to claim a tax credit of 50% of the amount paid for qualified health insurance for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. Qualified health insurance is defined as insurance covering medical care, excluding certain types of coverage. The term 'trade adjustment assistance' refers to aid provided under specific sections of the Trade Act of 1974. Special rules include no deduction allowed for amounts used in determining the credit and no credit for individuals eligible for a deduction under another taxpayer. The tax code is amended to include a new item related to trade adjustment assistance for individuals in a taxable year. The tax code is amended to include health insurance costs for individuals receiving trade adjustment assistance, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2000. Trade adjustment assistance is also provided for textile and apparel workers. SEC. 6. TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR TEXTILE AND APPAREL WORKERS. Workers in textile or apparel firms facing job loss due to decreased sales, plant closure, or relocation are eligible for adjustment assistance under the Trade Act of 1974. The Secretary of Labor must certify eligibility within 30 days of a petition being filed."
