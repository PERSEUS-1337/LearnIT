    "content": "The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program is the main federal student loan program administered by the U.S. Department of Education. It offers four types of federal student loans: Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans. Interest rates and loan terms are specified in the Higher Education Act and regulations. Various changes have been made to the criteria for setting interest rates over time. Under current law, Direct Subsidized Loans had a fixed interest rate of 6.8% for AY2013-2014, previously lowered from 6.8% to 3.4% under CCRAA. The 3.4% rate was not made permanent, and the authority for a 3.4% rate expired in 2013. Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans currently have a fixed rate of 6.8%. The 113th Congress is considering proposals for student loan interest rates, including temporarily extending the current 3.4% rate on Direct Subsidized Loans and establishing a new rate structure for loans made through the Direct Loan program. This report examines the interest rates on federal student loans, providing a summary of the current fixed rate structure for loans being made. The 113th Congress is reviewing proposals for student loan interest rates, including extending the 3.4% rate on Direct Subsidized Loans and establishing a new rate structure for future loans. Various proposals are discussed, including the President's FY2014 budget proposal and several bills. The report also analyzes projections of future interest rates and estimates of interest expenses for borrowers. Factors to consider when evaluating student loan interest rate policy options are also discussed. Legislation enacted in 2002 (P.L. 107-139) led to a transition to fixed interest rates for student loans. Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans had a fixed rate of 6.8%, while Direct PLUS Loans had a fixed rate of 7.9%. In 2007, lower fixed interest rates were established for Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduate students. The CCRAA maintained a 6.8% interest rate for Direct Subsidized Loans to undergraduates. In 2012, MAP-21 extended a 3.4% rate for loans in AY2012-2013. Current law sets a fixed 6.8% rate for AY2013-2014 and beyond. Various proposals in the 113th Congress aimed to amend federal student loan interest rates. President Obama's FY2014 budget included related measures. President Obama's FY2014 budget proposes a market-indexed, fixed interest rate structure for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans. The interest rate would be based on the 10-year Treasury note rate with an added margin, without a cap on the maximum rate. The President's proposal for student loan interest rates includes using the 10-year Treasury note rate plus specific percentage points for different loan types. Borrowers with multiple loans may have varying fixed interest rates. The proposal also eliminates the interest rate cap on Direct Consolidation Loans, determining the rate by averaging the consolidated loans' rates. The President's student loan interest rate proposal includes changes to repayment plans and forgiveness options. This includes expanding eligibility for the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan and excluding forgiven loan balances from taxation. The PAYE plan limits monthly payments to 10% of discretionary income and forgives remaining balances after 20 years. The proposal extends the PAYE plan to all Direct Loan borrowers, regardless of when they obtained their loans. The President's proposal aims to exclude forgiven student loan balances from taxation, increasing direct spending by $29.8 billion over FY2013-FY2018. The expansion of the PAYE repayment plan would further increase direct spending by $3.6 billion in FY2013. H.R. 1911 would establish a market-indexed variable interest rate structure for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans, with rates indexed to the 10-year Treasury note rate. Borrowers would have the option of an exclusion from income for forgiven amounts under IBR or ICR plans. H.R. 1911 would allow borrowers to consolidate federal student loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan with a fixed interest rate based on the weighted average of the loans being consolidated. The bill would reduce direct spending by $1.0 billion over FY2013-FY2018 and $3.7 billion over FY2013-FY2023. The House passed H.R. 1911, but the Obama Administration would recommend a veto if presented in its current form. S. 953 would extend the fixed 3.4% interest rate for Direct Subsidized Loans for AY2013-2015, but increase it to 6.8% for AY2015-2016 and beyond. It would also set fixed rates for Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans. Changes to other laws would offset the cost of the extension. S. 953 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify pension plan distribution rules, establish rules for expatriated entities, and modify the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund tax. CBO estimates a net increase in deficits of $5.9 billion over FY2013-FY2018 and a net decrease of $330 million over FY2013-FY2023. The extension of Direct Subsidized Loans at a fixed rate of 3.4% would increase direct spending by $8.3 billion over both periods. The changes to the IRC would increase revenues to offset the spending increase. S. 1003 would establish a market-indexed, fixed interest rate structure for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans made during AY2013-2014 and future years. The interest rate would be based on the 10-year Treasury Note rate plus 3.0 percentage points, with no cap on the maximum interest rate. S. 1003 proposes a fixed interest rate structure for federal student loans, based on the 10-year Treasury Note rate plus 3.0 percentage points, with no cap on the maximum interest rate. Borrowers with multiple loans could have different fixed rates on loans from different award years. The bill does not change the current formula for determining interest rates on Consolidation Loans, which are capped at 8.25%. Borrowers with rates higher than 8.25% could potentially lower their rate by consolidating into a Direct Consolidation Loan. S. 682 would increase direct spending by $25.8 billion over FY2013-FY2018 but reduce it by $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2023. S. 897 authorizes new funding for Direct Subsidized Loans with a fixed interest rate structure for AY2013-2014. The Federal Reserve would transfer funds to the Secretary of Education for these loans at the discount window primary credit rate. S. 897 would establish fixed interest rates for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans made during AY2013-2014 and future years. The bill would not affect other DL program loans' funding or interest rates. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1911 would also implement a market-indexed, fixed interest rate structure for these loans. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1911 establishes fixed interest rates for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans based on the 10-year Treasury note rate with specific percentage point add-ons for different borrower academic levels. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1911 establishes fixed interest rates for Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, and Direct PLUS Loans based on the 10-year Treasury note rate with specific percentage point add-ons for different borrower academic levels. The proposal removes the interest rate cap on Direct Consolidation Loans, determining the rate by averaging the interest rates on the loans being consolidated. Additionally, the amendment requires a study on the cost of administering federal student loan programs. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1911 would increase direct spending by $25.0 billion over FY2013-FY2018, but reduce it by $0.7 billion over FY2013-FY2023. The amendment passed in the Senate by a vote of 81 to 18 and proposes using the 10-year Treasury note rate as an index for Direct Loans. Several proposals in the 113th Congress would index borrower interest rates to market rates. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1911 proposes using the 10-year Treasury note rate as an index for Direct Loans. Historical and projected rates for different indices are shown in Figure 1, including 10-year Treasury notes and 3-month Treasury bills. Several policy options under consideration would use the rate on 10-year Treasury notes as an index. The 10-year Treasury note rate has shown fluctuation over the years, with rates mostly above 4.0% from 1963 to 2007 and above 6.0% from 1969 to 1997. There is less variability in rates on 10-year Treasury notes compared to 3-month Treasury bills. Federal Reserve policy makers have adjusted the primary credit rate in response to monetary policy objectives. Interest rate projections may differ from actual future rates and provide an indication of the expected direction and magnitude of rate movements, albeit with some imprecision. Based on CBO's analysis, interest rate projections have some imprecision, with an average difference of 0.6 percentage points in forecasts of rates on 10-year Treasury Notes. Some proposals suggest using the rate from the last auction before June 1 to set borrower interest rates for the following year, but rates can vary due to market fluctuations. Treasury auctions 10-year notes about once per quarter. The Treasury determines the type and date of security auctions based on government financing needs. The last auction before June 1 may have a different rate than current trading rates. Analysis of student loan interest rate policy options in Congress is compared to current law. The President's FY2014 budget includes policy options for student loan interest rates, comparing current law to proposed changes in H.R. 1911, S. 953, S. 1003, S. 897, and the Senate amendment to H.R. 1911. Information is presented in tables and figures showing interest rate formulas, projected rates for different loan types, and the general pattern of interest rates under various policy options. The analysis compares different policy options for student loan interest rates, including the possibility of varying rates for multiple loans and fluctuations in interest rates over time. A six-year period is used to illustrate rate projections based on a mix of current and historical economic data, with projections beyond year six held constant. The analysis compares policy options for student loan interest rates based on market-indexed rates for loans made during AY2018-2019. Results from case simulations show interest expenses for different types of borrowers. Simulation results are sensitive to projected future interest rates. The analysis compares policy options for student loan interest rates based on market-indexed rates for loans made during AY2018-2019. Two distinct four-year periods of borrowing are examined to present more complete information on the range of outcomes associated with market-indexed fixed rates. Simulation results are based on projected future interest rates. The simulation results for market-indexed loans provide a general sense of rate movement and magnitude, less precise than fixed rates. The analysis examines known and projected rates over future periods to show potential effects on borrowers. Additional information on borrower cases and interest rate policy options is in Appendix A. Under current law, a student who borrowed $16,491 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans over four years would pay $7,804 in interest. The monthly payment would be $202. A parent borrower who borrowed $43,646 in Direct PLUS Loans over the same period would pay $32,434 in interest, with a monthly payment of $634. Future loans are expected to have the same interest rates. Under the President's FY2014 budget proposal, an undergraduate dependent student who borrowed $16,491 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans over four years would pay an estimated total of $5,446 in interest expenses. The monthly payment would be $183, or approximately $19 less than under current law. Future loans under the proposal would likely have different interest rates indexed to market rates. Based on projected future rates, a student borrowing the same amount over four years would pay $7,833 in interest expenses with a monthly payment of $203, slightly higher than current law. For parent borrowers, the estimated total interest expenses would be $27,083 with a monthly payment of $589, $45 less than current law. If borrowing the same amount in a later period, the interest expenses would be $36,839 with a monthly payment of $671, $37 more than current law. Under H.R. 1911, a student borrowing $16,491 over four years would pay $8,647 in interest expenses with a monthly payment of $210, slightly higher than current law. For a later period, the estimated interest expenses would be $8,996 with a monthly payment of $212, $10 more than current law. Under H.R. 1911, a parent borrower who borrowed $43,646 in Direct PLUS Loans over four years would pay $39,342 in interest expenses with a monthly payment of $682 to $689, approximately $48 to $55 more than current law. If borrowing the same amount from AY2017-2018 through AY2020-2021, the estimated interest expenses would be $42,014 with a monthly payment of $711, approximately $77 more than current law. Under S. 953, an undergraduate dependent student borrowing $16,491 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans over four years would pay... Under S. 953, a student borrowing a total of $16,491 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans would pay an estimated total of $6,850 in interest expenses. The monthly payment would be $195, which is $7 less than under current law. For loans made during AY2015-2016 and future years, the borrower would pay $7,804 in interest expenses and have a monthly payment of $202. Direct PLUS Loans would not be affected by S. 953, so borrowers would pay the same amount as under current law. Under S. 1003, a student borrowing $16,491 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans would pay $6,793 in interest over four years. Monthly payment would be $194, $8 less than current law. For loans from AY2017-2018 to AY2020-2021, the borrower would pay $9,588 in interest and have a monthly payment of $217, $15 more than current law. A parent borrower with $43,646 in Direct PLUS Loans would pay $22,831 in interest. Under S. 897, a parent borrowing $43,646 in Direct PLUS Loans would pay $22,831 in interest over four years, with a monthly payment of $554, $80 less than current law. For undergraduate dependent students borrowing $16,491 in Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans, the interest expenses would be $6,953, with a monthly payment of $195, $7 less than current law. The bill would not change the interest rate structure of loans. Under S. 897, borrowers would pay $7,804 in interest expenses over four years, with a monthly payment of $202, the same as under current law. Direct PLUS Loans borrowers would also pay the same amount under S. 897. For undergraduate dependent students, the estimated total interest expenses would be $5,615 with a monthly payment of $184, approximately $18 less than under current law. Under the Senate amendment to H.R. 1911, student borrowers would pay $8,309 in interest expenses over four years, with a monthly payment of $207, approximately $5 more than under current law. Parent borrowers would pay $30,262 in interest expenses, with a monthly payment of $616, approximately $18 less than under current law. During the 113th Congress, interest rates on federal student loans are a topic of interest due to various factors. These factors have been discussed in past deliberations and are influenced by economic conditions. Major factors affecting student loan interest rate policy are briefly discussed. Costs associated with making student loans include raising capital, loan servicing, collecting on delinquent loans, default costs, lost interest from early repayments, and borrower benefits like loan forgiveness programs. Some costs are passed on to borrowers through interest and fees. The government sets interest rates based on borrower payment expectations, with any amount less than the full cost considered a loan subsidy in the Direct Loan program. The Direct Loan program is a federal credit program where costs are accounted for on an accrual basis according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The net present value of future credit flows associated with loans are discounted to the fiscal year using Treasury interest rates, expressed as loan subsidy rates. Administering costs are accounted for separately on a cash basis. Since 2006, federal student loans have fixed interest rates due to low government borrowing costs. Since 2006, federal student loans have fixed interest rates through the Direct Loan program, not tied to market rates. The government expects to earn more than the cost of making loans, with a negative subsidy rate projected for the future. Changes in loan terms could impact cash flows and subsidy rates, measured against the current baseline. The federal student loan programs aim to provide access to loans for postsecondary education without credit check requirements. Direct PLUS Loans are available with an endorser for individuals with adverse credit histories. The government also offers subsidies in the form of below-market interest rates to certain borrowers. The government provides subsidies to borrowers through below-market interest rates or by paying part of the interest. There are ongoing debates on the extent of these subsidies and who should benefit from them. Currently, student loans under the Direct Loan program have fixed interest rates that do not adjust to market conditions or borrower repayment risk. This provides borrowers with rate certainty but does not offer lower costs during low market rates or protection from increased costs during high market rates. The federal student loan programs offer fixed interest rates that do not change with market conditions or borrower risk. Policy options in Congress are considering a shift to market-indexed fixed rates. Fixed rate loans provide predictability for borrowers, but may not offer cost savings during low market rates or protection from increased costs during high market rates. The federal student loan programs currently offer fixed interest rates, which may not always align with prevailing market rates. There is a proposal to shift to variable interest rates to better reflect market conditions and align with other forms of consumer credit. This change would provide borrowers with more flexibility and potentially cost savings over time. The proposal suggests shifting from fixed to variable interest rates for federal student loans, aligning with market conditions and other consumer credit options. Borrowers would face potential fluctuations in rates, but caps on maximum rates and repayment plans like IBR could provide relief. Borrower interest rates are projected to be initially lower than current fixed rates for student loans. The proposal suggests transitioning federal student loans from fixed to variable interest rates, aligning with market conditions. Borrowers would face potential rate fluctuations, but caps on maximum rates and repayment plans like IBR could offer relief. Borrower interest rates are projected to be initially lower than current fixed rates. The proposal suggests transitioning federal student loans to variable interest rates based on market conditions. Borrowers may have multiple loans with different rates, unable to benefit from rate drops. Borrower interest rates are expected to be lower initially but may rise in the future. The analysis of student loan interest rate policy options is based on estimates of average amounts borrowed by undergraduate students from the 2007-2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. The cases used in the report simulate borrowers' cumulative amounts borrowed over different multi-year periods of undergraduate study. Estimates of average amounts borrowed by undergraduate students, independent students, and parent borrowers are presented in Table A-1. The analysis is based on data from the 2007-2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, simulating cumulative amounts borrowed over various multi-year periods of undergraduate study. Interest projections are dependent on future rates of 10-year Treasury notes. The analysis is based on data from the 2007-2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, simulating cumulative amounts borrowed over various multi-year periods of undergraduate study. Interest projections are highly dependent on future rates of 10-year Treasury notes, with CBO projections used for future periods up to 2023. Comparisons between policy options involving market-indexed rates and current law would be impacted by differences in actual rates from projected rates. Loan characteristics assumed in the analysis include fixed and variable rate structures. The analysis assumes loan characteristics such as disbursement timing, interest accrual, deferment of interest, capitalization, repayment plan, and variable interest rate adjustments. The interest rate on market-indexed fixed rate loans is established annually and remains constant throughout the loan's life. Historical data on federal student loans show trends in borrowing over the past quarter century, with separate information for undergraduate and graduate education. Over the period from AY1995-1996 through AY2007-2008, there was a gradual increase in the total amount of loans borrowed by students. Following the enactment of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008, there was a marked change in undergraduate borrowing behavior, with an increase in the number of students borrowing Unsubsidized Loans. By AY2011-2012, approximately 8.8 million undergraduate borrowers of Direct Loans were recorded. In AY2011-2012, approximately 8.8 million undergraduate borrowers of Direct Loans were recorded. 89% obtained Direct Subsidized Loans, while 84% obtained Direct Unsubsidized Loans. 73% of students borrowed both loan types. Graduate student borrowing increased notably after the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005 extended eligibility for PLUS Loans to graduate and professional students. In AY2011-2012, graduate student borrowing of Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans decreased slightly. Starting AY2012-2013, graduate students are no longer eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans. 1.6 million graduate students borrowed either loan type, with 94% obtaining Direct Subsidized Loans and 85% obtaining Direct Unsubsidized Loans. 79% of graduate students borrowed both loan types. In AY2011-2012, nearly 1.3 million graduate students borrowed Direct PLUS Loans, with 360 thousand students opting for this loan type. Students usually exhaust their eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans before turning to PLUS Loans due to their higher interest rates."
