    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 22.4 of the Business and Professions Code, known as the Fair Information Practices Act, outlines principles including transparency, individual participation, purpose specification, data minimization, use limitation, data quality, security, and accountability. Developers and operators of mobile operating systems are encouraged to be transparent about personal data collection and usage. (2) Involve individuals in using personal data and seek consent for collection, use, dissemination, and maintenance. (3) Articulate authority for data collection and specify purposes for data use in mobile applications. (4) Collect only relevant data necessary for intended purposes and retain for as long as needed. (5) Use personal data only for specified purposes and share data for compatible purposes. (6) Ensure personal data is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. (7) Protect data in all media with appropriate safeguards. (8) Be accountable for compliance, provide training, and audit data use for privacy protection. Definition of \"person\" includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, and organizations. Section 22595.3 applies to providers of mobile operating systems or platforms used by operators or developers collecting personal data from California users. They must establish universal privacy policy standards based on specified principles and make them easily accessible on their website. The legislation requires developers or operators of mobile applications to accept universal privacy policy standards set by the platform provider, with the option to opt out with user consent. The Legislature recognizes the importance of low carbon transportation fuels in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Existing incentives for low carbon transportation fuels have not been effective. A new section is added to the Health and Safety Code to define \"indirect land use change emission.\" A new definition is added for \"very low carbon transportation fuel\" in the California Code of Regulations, specifying the carbon intensity requirements and including indirect land use change emissions for fuels produced from food products. The state board may establish a program requiring entities to include percentages of very low carbon transportation fuel in their sales, ranging from one-quarter of 1 percent to 2 percent. Once sales reach 2 percent, the program will be inoperative after five years. The state board may establish a program mandating entities to include low carbon transportation fuel in their sales, with percentages ranging from 0.25% to 2%. This section does not alter existing fuel standards under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation."
