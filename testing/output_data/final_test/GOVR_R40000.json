    "content": "The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, P.L. 111-8, was enacted in March 2009, after a continuing resolution funded operations from October 2008. Two supplemental appropriations bills were also passed during the 111th Congress. The regular Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriation in the FY2009 omnibus totals $108.3 billion, with $87.8 billion in mandatory appropriations and $20.4 billion in discretionary appropriations. The ARRA supplemental provided $26.5 billion, mostly for domestic food. The Agriculture appropriations bill covers funding for various agencies and departments, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The bill provided $771 million for international food aid and domestic farm loans. The appropriations bill is under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a budget of $114.6 billion for FY2009, with food and nutrition programs receiving the largest share of $76 billion. USDA's responsibilities are carried out through 30 internal agencies and offices with 100,000 employees. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a budget of $114.6 billion for FY2009. The second-largest mission area is farm and foreign agricultural services, with $21 billion in budget authority. This includes farm commodity price and income support programs, crop insurance, farm loans, and foreign food aid programs. Other USDA activities include natural resource and environmental programs, rural development, research and education programs, marketing and regulatory programs, and food safety. The Forest Service receives about two-thirds of the budget for natural resources programs. The USDA's budget for FY2009 is $114.6 billion, with the second-largest mission area being farm and foreign agricultural services at $21 billion. USDA's organization and budget data may not always align with the Agriculture appropriations bill in Congress due to different program definitions and spending allocations. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for domestic farm support programs, conservation programs, USDA agencies, FDA, and CFTC. Funding for FDA and CFTC in the bill is about 2%. The CFTC appropriations jurisdiction shifted from the House Agriculture appropriations subcommittee to the Senate Financial Services appropriations subcommittee in FY2008. Despite this change, CFTC appropriations were still included in the Agriculture appropriations bill. Some argue that these agencies, historically linked to agricultural markets, no longer belong in this bill due to their expanding non-agricultural focus. Despite arguments that FDA and CFTC no longer belong in the Agriculture appropriations bill, food safety and agricultural market volatility remain key issues for these agencies. FDA's focus on medical and drug issues has increased, while CFTC's financial futures market has grown significantly. Mandatory and discretionary spending differ in the budget process, with mandatory programs having eligibility requirements written into authorizing laws. Approximately 80% of Agriculture and Related Agencies spending is classified as mandatory, determined by the 2008 farm bill. USDA's mandatory spending is mainly for food and nutrition programs, farm commodity support, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation programs. Congress controls spending on mandatory programs through eligibility rules and benefit formulas, not appropriations. Mandatory spending in the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill has been increasing over time, particularly due to rising food stamp participation and benefits. Some programs, like the farm commodity program, are variable and driven by various factors. These programs receive funding through annual appropriations based on projected spending needs, with supplemental appropriations made if necessary. The Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury and receives an annual appropriation for reimbursement and to maintain its line of credit. The remaining 20% of the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill is allocated for discretionary programs, which are funded through annual appropriations acts. These programs include conservation, rural development, research, education, agricultural credit, WIC, international food aid, meat and poultry inspection, and FDA and CFTC appropriations. Both discretionary and total appropriations have increased since 2000, but in inflation-adjusted terms, the level has remained relatively constant. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows a federal agency to spend, representing a funding limit. Outlays are the actual money flowing out of an agency's account, which may differ from budget authority due to timing of payments. Program levels, along with mandatory and discretionary spending, are key terms in federal spending discussions. The FY2009 Agriculture appropriations bill was marked up in the House subcommittee in June 2008 and reported by the Senate full committee in July 2008. The FY2009 Agriculture appropriations bill was marked up in June 2008 by the House subcommittee and reported by the Senate full committee in July 2008. It did not reach the floor as a stand-alone bill during the 110th Congress, and agencies affected by the bill were funded by continuing resolutions until March 11, 2009. An omnibus appropriations bill, P.L. 111-8, was enacted on March 11, 2009, at the beginning of the 111th Congress. The full appropriations committee was supposed to consider both the Agriculture and Labor-HHS bills on June 26, 2008, but proceedings were halted before the Agriculture bill was discussed. The ranking minority member offered an amendment to substitute the Interior appropriations bill with the Labor-HHS bill, as part of an attempt to raise an offshore oil drilling proposal. The full committee voted to adjourn, halting appropriations action on individual bills in the House for the session. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the Agriculture appropriations bill by polling the bill, bypassing subcommittee action. The Agriculture appropriations bill was not completed before the start of FY2009, leading to the enactment of two continuing resolutions to fund the government until March 6, 2009. Only three out of the 12 regular appropriations bills were enacted before the fiscal year began, with agencies generally funded at their FY2008 levels during this period. The continuing resolution for Agriculture and Related Agencies programs in FY2009 included exceptions such as higher base allocation for FDA, mandatory spending increases for Food and Nutrition Act programs, increased funding for WIC nutrition program, Commodity Assistance Program, and rural housing rental assistance program. The continuing resolution for Agriculture and Related Agencies programs in FY2009 maintained existing programs and allowed new mandatory farm bill programs to begin, with a conservative funding approach. The Office of Management and Budget apportioned funds by limiting availability at certain times, sometimes delaying mandatory programs. The CR did not continue FY2008 earmarks and the 110th Congress ended its work under it. The 111th Congress in 2009 completed regular appropriations for FY2009 with an omnibus bill after an economic stimulus package. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-8) was signed by President Obama on March 11, 2009, funding the regular Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill for the remainder of FY2009. Before this, the 111th Congress focused on passing an economic stimulus package, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5), signed into law on February 17, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) allocated $26.47 billion to agriculture programs, with a focus on nutrition assistance and rural development. This included a 20% increase in monthly food stamp benefits and funding for broadband infrastructure in rural areas. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $26.47 billion to agriculture programs, with a focus on broadband infrastructure, rural water and waste disposal infrastructure, community facilities, rural housing, assistance for farmers, conservation programs, and USDA facilities maintenance and computer infrastructure. The rural broadband program received $2.50 billion, assistance for farmers totaled $744 million, conservation programs received $348 million, and USDA received $250 million for its facilities maintenance and computer infrastructure. The FY2009 Agriculture appropriation provided $700 million for international food aid and $71 million for farm program loans. It also allowed past appropriations for emergency conservation programs to be reprogrammed for recent disasters. The enacted FY2009 Agriculture appropriation was $107.7 billion, including $21.1 billion in discretionary appropriations and $86.6 billion in mandatory funds. The FY2009 Agriculture appropriation included $108.3 billion in total funds, with a discretionary amount of $20.5 billion and mandatory funding increasing by $15 billion compared to FY2008. The discretionary appropriation was 8% higher than FY2008, while mandatory funding rose by 21% due to increased nutrition programs. The FY2009 Agriculture appropriation included $108.3 billion in total funds, with a discretionary amount of $20.5 billion and mandatory funding increasing by $15 billion compared to FY2008. Appropriators have placed limitations on mandatory spending authorized in the farm bill, with more mandatory funds becoming available due to the passage of a new farm bill in 2008. The tension between appropriators and authorizers over funding agriculture programs dates back to the 1930s. The creation of the Commodity Credit Corporation in response to unpredictable funding issues shifted control away from the appropriations committee. However, changes in dynamics in the late 1990s and the 2002 farm bill have reignited debates over funding responsibilities. The tension between appropriators and authorizers over funding agriculture programs has existed since the 1930s. Changes in funding dynamics in the late 1990s and the 2002 farm bill led to debates over who should fund programs with mandatory funding. This has impacted conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and research programs, but not farm commodity programs or nutrition. The tension between appropriators and authorizers over funding agriculture programs has existed since the 1930s. Changes in funding dynamics in the late 1990s and the 2002 farm bill led to debates over who should fund programs with mandatory funding. This has impacted conservation, rural development, bioenergy, and research programs. Appropriators limit mandatory spending without changing the authorizing law, using appropriations language to put limits on mandatory programs. Savings achieved this way are counted as \"scorekeeping adjustments\" to fund discretionary programs at a higher level than allowed by the discretionary spending cap. The enacted FY2009 appropriations act reduced funding from mandatory programs, including conservation and specialty crops programs. The Bush Administration initially proposed reductions in conservation programs, but additional cuts were requested after the 2008 farm bill was enacted. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) saw a 20% reduction in funding. The $1.337 billion farm bill authorization includes reductions in conservation and nutrition programs. Mandatory funding for the watershed rehabilitation program is eliminated, along with a new nutrition program for schools. Limits on mandatory programs in the FY2009 appropriation are larger than in previous years. The 2002 farm bill period saw larger reductions in mandatory programs. Appropriators and authorizers made cuts to programs to score savings during budget reconciliation in 2005. The 2008 farm bill introduced new mandatory programs, giving appropriators the opportunity to limit them. Earmark disclosure rules were adopted in 2007, requiring transparency in appropriations acts. Earmarks listed in conference reports do not hold the same legal weight as those in the law itself. In FY2008, the treatment of earmarks in the Consolidated Appropriations Act varied, with some mentioned in the law text and others in report language. President Bush's Executive Order 13457 instructed agencies to only honor earmarks in the law text starting in FY2009. Appropriators responded by incorporating earmarks in the report language into the statute. In FY2009, Congress disclosed 521 earmarks for Agriculture and Related Agencies totaling $379.6 million, down 6% from FY2008. Three USDA agencies accounted for nearly 90% of the earmarks. Earmarks ranged from $9.5 million to $36,000, with a median project size of $376,000. University and extension service-based earmarks declined in FY2009. The amount of ARS earmarks increased by 10%, while conservation earmarks decreased by 16% in number and 23% in amount. The Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill covers 94% of USDA's total appropriation, excluding the Forest Service. USDA's research, education, and economics function is carried out by four agencies, including the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES). The CSREES distributes federal funds to land grant colleges for research, education, and extension programs. The ERS provides economic analysis of agriculture issues. The omnibus bill contains $2.64 billion for research, extension, and education programs, slightly less than the previous year's appropriation. The USDA research budget remained flat from FY1972 to FY1991, then increased by 25% from FY1992 to FY2000 due to a federal budget surplus. Funding for non-defense research and development, particularly for anti-terrorism activities, has seen fluctuations in USDA research budget levels. ARS and CSREES are key components of the research mission area's budget, with state-level appropriations playing a significant role in program funding. Cuts at either the state or federal level can impact program levels down to the county level. Efforts are being made to increase competitive grants in the REE mission area. The House and Senate Agriculture Committees have sought funds from various sources for competitive grants in the REE mission area since 1997. However, appropriations have often restricted the use of these funds for intended purposes. Despite some increases in discretionary funds for REE programs from FY1999 to FY2006, concerns remain about long-term funding for agricultural research. The 2008 farm bill brings significant changes to the REE mission area structure. The 2008 farm bill brings significant changes to the REE mission area structure, with a new National Institute of Food and Agriculture replacing CSREES. A single program planning staff will coordinate activities of various agencies, and future budget requests will be in a single line item. The bill also provides mandatory funds for competitive grant programs, while repealing the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. The omnibus enacted bill allocates $1.19 billion for USDA's Agricultural Research Service. The omnibus bill allocated $1.14 billion for research and $47 million for laboratory modernization projects at the Agricultural Research Service. Funding includes $112.6 million for congressionally-directed projects and prioritizes research on wheat stem rust (Ug99) and honeybee colony collapse disorder. The bill did not include the $10.4 million for pollinator research recommended in the Senate bill. The omnibus bill provides $1.22 billion for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES), with $691 million in discretionary spending for research and education grant programs. This includes $207 million for Hatch funding to land-grant universities and agricultural experiment stations, and $84.5 million for Special Research Grants. The omnibus bill provides $84.5 million for Special Research Grants, $1.1 million for the Food and Agriculture Policy Institute, $14.4 million for Sustainable Agriculture, and mandatory funding for various programs including Organic Research and Extension Initiative, beginning farmer and rancher research program, and Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers program. Additionally, there is increased funding for cooperative extension programs in the states and level funding for integrated research and extension programs. The omnibus bill provides funding for various agriculture research programs, including $201 million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI), $79.5 million for USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS), and $151.6 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The Administration had requested different funding amounts for ERS and NASS. The omnibus bill provides funding for agriculture research programs, including $201 million for AFRI, $79.5 million for ERS, and $151.6 million for NASS. APHIS, AMS, and GIPSA are agencies responsible for USDA's marketing and regulatory programs mission area, with APHIS focusing on protecting agriculture from pests and diseases like avian influenza and mad cow disease. The omnibus bill provided $876.7 million for APHIS, slightly below the President's budget request but above the previous year's funding. Additional funds were allocated for APHIS buildings and facilities. The budget included $241 million in user fees and trust funds, with proposed new user fees for animal welfare and biotechnology services. The enacted omnibus bill allocated $876.7 million for APHIS, with additional funds for buildings and facilities. The bill did not mention proposed user fees for biotechnology and veterinary biologics. Within the APHIS budget, $160.0 million was designated for foreign pest and disease exclusion programs, $255.7 million for health monitoring, and $345.0 million for pest management. Other allocations included $22.0 million for animal welfare regulation and $94.0 million for scientific activities. During markup of the reported Senate committee bill, appropriators approved an amendment to prohibit APHIS from allowing imports of swine, ruminants, or their meat products from any region of Argentina unless the entire country is certified as free of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). FMD is a highly contagious animal disease that has caused significant production and economic losses. The United States bans imports of these animals and fresh meats from areas with FMD, including much of South America. APHIS is working on a proposed rule to permit meat imports from FMD-free regions of Argentina, which has not reported any recent outbreaks. The enacted omnibus bill provided funding for APHIS activities, including $4.0 million for foreign animal diseases and FMD, $13.7 million for regulatory enforcement, $60.6 million for avian flu surveillance, $62.3 million for fruit fly exclusion, $17.0 million for Chronic Wasting Disease, $9.6 million for brucellosis, and $27.0 million for other activities. In the enacted omnibus bill, funding for APHIS activities includes $17.0 million for Chronic Wasting Disease, $9.6 million for brucellosis, and $27.0 million for agricultural quarantine and inspection. Transfers of funds from various programs were accepted, including reallocating funds for avian influenza, biosecurity, and emergency management systems. The EPP account within pest and disease management would have been funded by the Senate. The Senate committee planned to allocate $133.7 million in FY2009 for pest and disease management, with specific amounts designated for various plant problems. This included funding for citrus health, Asian long-horned beetle, glassy-winged sharpshooter, sudden oak death, Karnal bunt, emerald ash borer, potato cyst nematode, light brown apple moth, Sirex woodwasp, and miscellaneous pests. Additionally, $469,000 was earmarked for Varroa mite suppression in Hawaii to address colony collapse disorder among honey bees. The Administration and congressional appropriators have debated over funding for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), with the omnibus providing $14.5 million for FY2009, less than the Administration's request of $24 million. Progress on NAIS has been slow, with only 500,000 out of 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations registered despite USDA's commitment of $128 million. Progress on developing the NAIS has been slow, with the omnibus report including date-specific objectives from a 2008 APHIS business plan. APHIS must submit reports on objective status and missed deadlines. AMS is responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural products with user fees covering a significant portion of spending, totaling $141 million in FY2008 and projected $145 million in FY2009. In FY2008, AMS received $141 million and is projected to receive $145 million in FY2009 through direct annual USDA appropriations and a transfer from the Section 32 account. The Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY2009 provides $88 million, including funding for the Marketing Services program for country of origin labeling and the National Organic Program. Additionally, $1.3 million is allocated for the Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program. In FY2008, AMS received $141 million and is projected to receive $145 million in FY2009 through direct annual USDA appropriations and a transfer from the Section 32 account. The 2008 farm bill set new annual caps on Section 32 money for various activities, including specialty crop block grants and surplus agricultural commodity purchases. The farm bill cap for FY2009 was set at $1.173 billion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that the farm bill cap for FY2009 was reduced to $1.072 billion from $1.173 billion in the enacted omnibus. This reduction potentially freed up $101 million in Section 32 money redirected to other programs. The CBO oversees U.S. standards for grain and commodities, as well as fair-trading practices in livestock markets. The GIPSA received $40.3 million in FY2009 for salaries and expenses, less than the Administration's request of $44 million but more than the FY2008 amount of $38.5 million. User fees support agency activities, totaling around $42 million annually, approximately half of the agency's budget. The omnibus budget proposal includes additional user fees to offset grain inspection and Packers and Stockyards activities, aiming to recoup $27 million annually. The omnibus provides $971.6 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), $41 million above FY2008 levels. Existing user fees of $140 million in FY2009 are supplemented by a proposed $96 million in new user fees starting after FY2009. The FY2009 omnibus budget proposal includes new user fees totaling $96 million, starting after FY2009. This includes $92 million in licensing fees for meat and poultry establishments and $4 million in \"performance fees.\" The increase also covers costs for implementing provisions from the 2008 farm bill, such as inspecting catfish products and allowing state-inspected plants to ship products across state lines. Additionally, there is an extra $2 million for strengthened enforcement. The FY2009 omnibus budget proposal includes an additional $2 million for strengthened enforcement of the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA). This funding is directed towards maintaining the Humane Animal Tracking System and increasing inspections for HMSA compliance. The Department of Agriculture faced criticism in 2008 for inadequate enforcement of the HMSA, leading to concerns about nonambulatory cattle entering the food supply and a major meat recall. Congress has previously allocated funds to enhance enforcement of humane slaughter laws. The FY2009 omnibus budget proposal includes an additional $2 million for enforcing the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) to address concerns about contaminated foods from China. The bill retains language prohibiting the importation of poultry products from China into the U.S. and calls for a report on the safety implications of such changes. Language blocking the rule to allow certain processed poultry products to enter was delayed by previous Agriculture appropriations measures. USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers farm commodity income support and disaster assistance programs. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers various USDA programs, including farm loan programs and conservation programs. FSA receives funds for salaries and expenses from direct appropriations and transfers from other USDA programs. The FY2009 appropriation for FSA is $1.483 billion, 3.7% higher than FY2008. The FY2009 appropriation for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) is $1.483 billion, 3.7% higher than FY2008. The act did not include language prohibiting closure of FSA county offices, unlike previous years. $22 million is allocated for information technology expenses and network stabilization, with an additional $50 million from the economic stimulus act for modernizing FSA's computer system. Future appropriations of about $320 million are needed for stabilization and modernization plans through FY2011. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has faced challenges with an outdated mainframe computer system, leading to disruptions in services for farmers. Despite efforts to secure increased funding for computer upgrades, the problems persist. The 2008 farm bill's new requirements are expected to further strain the antiquated system. Following computer failures in 2007, USDA initiated a \"stabilization and modernization\" plan to address the issues. The USDA developed a \"stabilization and modernization\" plan after 2007 computer system failures. The stabilization plan aims to strengthen the current system while upgrades are made, preparing for migration to a new system. The modernization plan, called MIDAS, would replace outdated mainframe hardware with a modern Web-based system. The Government Accountability Office found the USDA plan addressed technical issues but lacked details for efficient implementation. Additional funding of $87 million was estimated for the stabilization plan through FY2010, while the development of MIDAS was projected to cost $305 million over three years (FY2009-FY2011). The USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers, providing direct farm loans and guaranteeing repayment on qualified loans from commercial lenders. FSA loans cover farm real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery, some at subsidized interest rates. An annual appropriation is made to FSA for direct and guaranteed loans, known as a loan subsidy. The federal cost of making direct and guaranteed loans, known as a loan subsidy, is determined by interest rate subsidies and projected loan losses. The FY2009 appropriation of $147 million supports $3.427 billion of loans, with increased demand due to the 2009 financial crisis. Direct farm operating loan applications have increased by 81%, ownership loans by 132%, and guaranteed operating loans by 31%. 45% of direct operating loan applications are from new customers, compared to the usual 20%. In response to increased demand for farm loans due to the 2009 financial crisis, Congress allocated additional funding for FSA loans. The economic stimulus act provided $173 million for guaranteed operating loans, quickly used up by a backlog of approved loans. A second supplemental appropriations act then allocated $810 million for various types of farm loans. Additionally, USDA transferred funds from the interest-assistance guaranteed operating loan account to address backlogs in direct farm operating and guaranteed farm operating accounts. The Farm Service Agency allocated additional funding for FSA loans in response to increased demand during the 2009 financial crisis. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is the funding mechanism for mandatory payments to farmers, authorized by the 2008 farm bill. CCC can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance programs like farm commodity subsidies. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrows funds from the U.S. Treasury to finance various agricultural programs and emergency spending. It must eventually repay the borrowed funds and replenish its borrowing authority through congressional appropriations. The CCC earns some money from activities like buying and selling commodities, but its borrowing limit of $30 billion needs periodic replenishment to avoid depletion. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrows funds from the U.S. Treasury to finance agricultural programs. The CCC has a borrowing limit of $30 billion that needs periodic replenishment through congressional appropriations. Funding needs are difficult to estimate, and outlays may not always reflect the CCC's appropriations. In FY2009, CCC net expenditures are projected to be $12 billion, up from $8.2 billion in FY2008. In FY2009, CCC's net expenditures are projected to be $12 billion, up from $8.2 billion in FY2008. The enacted appropriation for CCC is estimated to be $11.1 billion, down 14% from the previous year. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offering free catastrophic insurance to producers with the option to purchase additional coverage at a subsidized rate. The federal crop insurance program is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency and is funded through approved private insurance companies. The Agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for RMA's salaries and expenses, as well as the Federal Crop Insurance Fund for premium subsidies and indemnity payments. In FY2009, the RMA received $77.18 million for salaries and expenses, with additional funding available under the Federal Crop Insurance Act for agency improvements. The Agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, with an FY2009 estimate of $6.58 billion. The increase in funding is due to expected greater crop losses and higher crop values. The enacted bill also includes increased funding for discretionary Natural Resource Conservation. The enacted omnibus bill provides increased funding for discretionary Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) programs, rejecting proposed reductions by the Administration. $969.2 million was allocated for FY2009 discretionary conservation programs, with most of the increase going to Conservation Operations (CO). The total funding was $31.6 million more than FY2008, $1 million less than the Senate-reported bill, and $167.6 million more than the Administration's request. The omnibus bill allocates $250,000 for building improvements and $31.7 million for congressionally-designated projects. $10 million is designated for strengthening NRCS's systems, with additional reports required. Funding levels for discretionary programs are maintained, including $24.3 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and $50.7 million for the RC&D program. The omnibus bill allocated $40.0 million for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program in FY2009, contrary to the Administration's proposal of $6 million. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided $145 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations and $50 million for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program for FY2009 and FY2010, with the additional funding not designated for specific projects. In FY2009, the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funding from the 2005 hurricanes can now be used for current and future disaster relief, with approximately $71 million remaining unobligated. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) reports no significant demand for these funds, but has $40 million in unfunded ECP requests for disasters. This change does not provide new funding but allows the unobligated balance to be used for current and future ECP needs. The National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) administer mandatory conservation programs funded by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). The FY2009 funding for NRCS's mandatory spending programs was reduced by $435 million from the authorized level in the 2008 farm bill. Specifically, funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) was limited to $1.07 billion, a reduction of $270 million. Funding for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) remained unchanged. The largest conservation program, FSA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), remained unchanged at about $2.0 billion for FY2009. The Watershed Rehabilitation Program received $40 million in discretionary funding for FY2009. The 2008 farm bill authorized $100 million of mandatory funding for FY2009. The enacted omnibus specified that no mandatory funds be used for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, including $100 million in FY2009 and $65 million in carryover from FY2007. USDA's rural development mission area is managed by three agencies: Rural Housing Service (RHS), Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), and Rural Utilities Service (RUS). An Office of Community Development provides support through field offices. This mission area also administers the rural portion of the Empowerment Zones. The rural development mission area of USDA is managed by three agencies: Rural Housing Service (RHS), Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBS), and Rural Utilities Service (RUS). It administers loan subsidies related to interest rate reductions and projected loan losses. For FY2009, the enacted omnibus bill provides $2.73 billion in discretionary budget authority for rural development programs, supporting $17 billion in loans and grants. The Senate recommended more budget authority, but it would have supported less program funding. The Administration had requested even less funding. The enacted omnibus bill for FY2009 provides $551 million less in program funding compared to the Senate recommendation. The budget authority includes $20 million for information technology infrastructure. The appropriation for RHS loans and grants is $1.75 billion, a 32% increase from FY2008. Loan authorization level is $8.1 billion, with the majority allocated to the Section 502 single family housing loan program. Guaranteed loans account for 85% of the total loan authority. The FY2009 omnibus bill provides funding for various programs, including $6.2 billion for Section 502 direct loans and $1.1 billion for Section 502 guaranteed loans. An additional $200 million was allocated for the Section 502 program under the ARRA. The rental assistance program (Section 521) received over $896 million in budget authority, a significant increase from FY2008. The omnibus bill also authorized the same amount for mutual and self-help housing grants as in FY2008. The omnibus bill authorizes funding for various rural housing assistance programs, including $38.7 million for one program and $41.5 million for another. It also includes $18.3 million for farm labor account subsidies and grants, with a directive to use 10% for technical assistance. Additionally, $27.7 million is allocated for the multi-family housing revitalization program. The omnibus bill provides $63.8 million for the Rural Community Facilities program, with allocations for direct loan subsidies, guaranteed loan subsidies, and grants. Funding for the program is slightly less than FY2008 but higher than the Administration's request. The bill also includes funding for various initiatives such as the Rural Community Development Initiative, Economic Impact Initiative grants, and Tribal college grants. Additionally, the bill provides $132 million in budget authority for Rural Business-Cooperative Service, supporting $1.1 billion in loan authority. The omnibus bill provides $132 million in budget authority for Rural Business-Cooperative Service, supporting $1.1 billion in loan authority. This includes funding for the Rural Business Program account, Rural Business Enterprise grants, Rural Business Opportunity grants, Business and Industry loan guarantees, and the Delta Regional Authority. Additionally, the Rural Business Enterprise program and the B&I loan guarantee program will receive $150 million from ARRA. The omnibus bill allocates $8.1 million for rural Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Communities grants, $5.0 million for the Renewable Energy Program, and $12.6 million for Rural Cooperative Development Grants. The B&I loan guarantee program will receive $150 million from ARRA, while the farm bill authorizes $55 million in mandatory spending for the program in FY2009. The omnibus bill includes funding for various programs such as Areas, Value-Added Product Grants, and Grants to Assist Minority Producers. The Value-Added Product Grants received $15 million less than FY2008, but with mandatory spending, the total for FY2009 is $18.9 million. The bill also provides $18.8 million for Rural Development Loan Fund loans. Overall, the omnibus bill for FY2009 allocates $653 million in budget authority and $7.76 billion in loan authorization, which is $1.4 billion less than FY2008. The omnibus bill for FY2009 allocates $556.3 million in budget authority for water and waste disposal programs under the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program, which is $2 million less than FY2008. This funding will support $75 million in direct and guaranteed loans, over $1 billion less than in FY2008. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes a supplemental appropriation of $1.38 billion for these programs. The committee expressed concerns about potential funding decreases for water and waste water projects in rural communities due to changes in borrower interest rate procedures authorized in the farm bill. They expect USDA to maintain the same level of support for these communities and requested a report on how USDA determines the characteristics of the served rural areas. Additionally, they asked for a report identifying specific areas, such as Native American and Alaska Native communities, that need water and waste water assistance. The omnibus bill includes funding for broadband telecommunication loans and grants, as well as support for rural broadband infrastructure development. Additionally, there is funding for the Distance Learning/Telemedicine program and USDA rural development programs. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31837. USDA Rural Development Programs, including key mandatory entitlements like child nutrition programs, SNAP, and TEFAP, receive a total of $76.2 billion for domestic food assistance in FY2009. The Senate's bill proposed $65 billion for food and nutrition programs, including SNAP, Nutrition Assistance Block Grants, FDPIR, TEFAP, and Community Food Projects. The omnibus appropriations law funded these programs at $54 billion. The Senate bill proposed $43.4 billion for SNAP in FY2009, with a $3 billion contingency reserve. The omnibus budget agreement allocated $51.8 billion for regular SNAP, including a $3 billion reserve fund. This was a $3.5 billion increase over FY2008. The omnibus appropriations bill allocated $1.8 billion for Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas based on new food price inflation estimates. Funding for the FDPIR was increased to $115 million, higher than the Administration's request. TEFAP commodities received $250 million in funding for FY2009, surpassing the Administration's $140 million request. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY2009 allocates $250 million for the Child Nutrition account, funding various programs like School Lunch and Breakfast, CACFP, Summer Food Service, and food safety education initiatives. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY2009 allocates $15 billion for child nutrition programs, including School Lunch, Breakfast, CACFP, and food safety education initiatives. Funding for a program offering free fresh fruits and vegetables in schools is also discussed. The omnibus FY2009 appropriations law allocates $6.86 billion for the WIC program, with the Senate bill proposing $6.75 billion. The final appropriation and Senate's amount were based on current estimates to ensure sufficient funds for all eligible participants. The Commodity Assistance Program supports various programs like the CSFP and administrative costs under TEFAP. The FY2009 budget proposed terminating the CSFP program, reducing its funding from $142 million to $70 million. Other programs like TEFAP, WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition, and assistance for nuclear-affected zones and natural disasters remained at similar funding levels as FY2008. The Senate bill rejected the proposal to terminate the CSFP program and increased funding to $155 million for FY2009. The omnibus appropriations measure further increased total funding for the Commodity Assistance Program account to $231 million, with $160 million available for the CSFP. This budget account covers federal administration of domestic food assistance programs, special projects for nutrition program quality, and the CNPP. The Administration requested $150 million for nutrition program administration activities in FY2009. The omnibus appropriations law for FY2009 allocated $143 million for nutrition program administration, including discretionary grants for the Congressional Hunger Center. The Center received $2.3 million in funding, with changes to program rules for domestic food assistance also included in the law. The omnibus appropriations law for FY2009 allocated $143 million for nutrition program administration, including discretionary grants for the Congressional Hunger Center. In Section 735, the omnibus measure adds Maryland and Vermont to the states receiving federal subsidies for after-school suppers. The 2008 farm bill established a program offering fresh fruits and vegetables in selected elementary schools nationwide, with mandatory funding provided outside the regular appropriations process. The omnibus appropriations law for FY2009 allocated $143 million for nutrition program administration, including discretionary grants for the Congressional Hunger Center. It provided $65 million for the school year 2009-2010, with funding delays. The Administration proposed capping per-person grants for the WIC program and denying automatic WIC eligibility to Medicaid participants above 250% of the federal poverty income guidelines, but these proposals were rejected. The Administration recommended terminating the CSFP in FY2009, citing duplication with SNAP and WIC benefits. However, the omnibus FY2009 appropriations law increased funding for the CSFP and allocated $1.499 billion for USDA's international activities, with additional funds for other programs. The enacted FY2009 appropriations law provides $164.5 million for the Foreign Agricultural Service to administer USDA's international programs, including export market promotion and food aid. Additionally, $1.229 billion is allocated for P.L. 480 foreign food assistance, with $15 million more for Title II commodity donations compared to FY2008. This amount is less than the $2.5 billion discretionary funding authorized in the 2008 farm bill. The FY2008-FY2009 \"bridge\" supplemental appropriations included $395 million for Title II commodity donations in FY2009, bringing the total appropriation available for Title II to $1.627 billion. The President's budget proposed allowing up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchases of commodities to address international food crises, but this was not included in the enacted appropriations measure. The 2008 farm bill authorizes $60 million of CCC funds for a pilot project to assess local/regional purchases of food aid for emergency relief. The 2008 farm bill mandated a minimum level of P.L. 480 Title II funds for non-emergency assistance. The fiscal 2009 act concurred with the President's request for no funds for P.L. 480 Title I sales and grants, reflecting declining demand for concessional food aid finance and increasing need for food aid for emergency relief. Eliminating food aid loans and providing only commodity donations as food aid also aligns with proposals in the budget submission. The 2008 farm bill mandated a minimum level of P.L. 480 Title II funds for non-emergency assistance. The fiscal 2009 act concurred with the President's request for no funds for P.L. 480 Title I sales and grants, reflecting declining demand for concessional food aid finance and increasing need for food aid for emergency relief. Eliminating food aid loans and providing only commodity donations as food aid also aligns with proposals in the on-going Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. USDA-administered food aid programs, Food for Progress (FFP) and Section 416(b) donations, receive mandatory funding. The President's budget assumed $340 million of CCC funds for FFP, which provides food aid to emerging democracies. P.L. 480 Title I funds can be allocated to FFP, but in the absence of an appropriation for Title I, that source would be unavailable in FY2009. Similarly, USDA anticipates that no CCC commodity inventories would be available for distribution as food aid under Section 416(b), a program that makes surplus agricultural commodities available overseas. The Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, a reserve of commodities and cash to meet unanticipated food aid needs, did not receive a specific allocation of CCC funds in the 2009 budget submission. The 2008 farm bill did not allocate CCC funds to the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust in the 2009 budget submission. P.L. 111-8 provided $100 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. Additionally, $84 million of mandatory funds from the CCC were authorized for McGovern-Dole in FY2009. The FY2009 omnibus appropriation included $5.333 million for administrative expenses of CCC export credit guarantee programs. In FY2009, U.S. agricultural exports totaled $2.6 billion. The 2008 farm bill made changes to CCC export credit guarantee programs to comply with WTO rules. The President's budget allocated $200 million to the Market Access Program (MAP) and funding for other export market development activities as established in the farm bill. The Export Enhancement Program was repealed. The 2008 farm bill repealed the Export Enhancement Program and allocated $3 million to the Dairy Export Incentive Program for FY2009. Concerns were raised by USDA's Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Management and Budget regarding the effectiveness and necessity of USDA's export market development programs. FAS was directed to submit a report detailing how they addressed the recommendations and implemented management reforms. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the safety of foods, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, and medical devices. FDA's budget is overseen by the Agriculture appropriations subcommittees. FDA's program level consists of direct appropriations and user fees. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 provided FDA with a total program level of $2.66 billion for FY2009, which was 10% more than the total FY2008 program level. The President's request for FY2009 was $2.046 billion in direct appropriations, while the enacted FY2009 omnibus provided $2.051 billion in direct appropriations. The FY2009 omnibus bill allocated $12 million for user fees, including PDUFA, MDUFA, and ADUFA fees. The total FDA user fee appropriation for FY2008 was $549 million. The FY2009 request included $595 million for continuing fee programs, a 3% increase over FY2008, and $14 million for DTC television advertisement review. The FDA requested $14 million for the review of direct-to-consumer television ads for prescription drugs, authorized by the FDAAA. This would bring the total requested fees to $609 million, 11% higher than the FY2008 appropriation. The budget justification included proposed fees for enhancing the review of generic drugs, totaling $21 million, and another set of proposed fees for $27 million. The FDA requested $27 million in mandatory fees for reinspection, food, and animal feed export certification, not included in the user fee total. The Senate bill included a total of $595 million in fees, with funding designated for specific FDA centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs. User fee revenue is apportioned across program areas as per the Administration's request. The enacted FY2009 omnibus included $343 million in specific budget authority increases, with 89% of the animal drug user fee revenue designated for the animal drugs and feeds program. The FDA's foods program area remains funded by direct appropriations. The omnibus explanatory statement listed areas for FDA progress, including addressing food safety risks and providing quarterly reports on new hires, inspections, and IT spending. The FY2009 omnibus provided $777 million for the FDA human drugs program, with $413 million in direct appropriations and $364 million in fees. The increase for food safety activities included foreign and domestic inspections, screening technologies, surveillance, risk communication, and traceability capabilities. The omnibus did not include DTC advertising fees authorized by FDAAA, prohibiting their collection and use. The FY2009 omnibus recommendation for human drug program fee revenue totaled $364 million, an 11.3% increase over the total FY2008 level. The omnibus directive included a $114 million increase for medical product safety, requiring FDA to develop a comprehensive approach to ensure product safety from manufacturing to consumer use, covering inspections, laboratory infrastructure, unique device identification, and information technology. The FY2009 omnibus provided increased funding for various FDA programs, including $271 million for the biologics program and $134 million for the animal drugs and feeds program. The biologics program received a $114 million increase for medical product safety. The FY2009 omnibus provided $330 million for the devices and radiological health program, with $281 million in direct appropriations and $49 million in user fees. This total is 8.5% higher than the FY2008 appropriation and 1% above the Administration request. The increase in direct appropriations is intended to enhance animal food and drug safety and modernize scientific and workforce activities. The FY2009 omnibus provided funding for various FDA programs, including $53 million for the FDA National Center for Toxicological Research, $1 million increases for the Office of Women's Health and the Office of Cosmetics and Colors, and $55 million for cost-of-living increases. Additionally, there were demonstration grants for pediatric device availability and reporting requirements for proposed amendments to the Mammography Quality and Standards Act. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets, futures trading, fraud prevention, and investor protection. Congressional oversight is with agriculture committees due to historical origins. Jurisdiction for CFTC appropriations is split between House and Senate subcommittees. The CFTC's funding allocation alternates between House and Senate subcommittees. In FY2009, the CFTC received $146.0 million in funding, a 31% increase from FY2008. This increase was due to concerns about the CFTC's ability to monitor energy commodities futures markets. The CFTC received $146.0 million in funding for FY2009, with $34.7 million available after submitting an expenditure plan to the agriculture committees. For more information on CFTC appropriations, refer to CRS Report RL34523."
