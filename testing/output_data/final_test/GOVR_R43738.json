    "content": "The Stafford Act authorizes the President to declare Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAG) for federal assistance in fire suppression activities. FEMA's Regional Administrators oversee the grants, which provide equipment, personnel, and funding to state, local, and tribal governments for fire control. Recipients are responsible for 25% of expenses. This report discusses frequently asked questions about Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs), including how they are requested, evaluated, and the types of assistance provided. States can request FMAGs when a fire is out of control and threatens a major disaster. Requests can be made to FEMA Regional Administrator by phone, followed by written confirmation within 14 days. Tribes have the same authority as states to request disaster declarations under the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013. Tribal land holdings can request fire suppression support through the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) without reimbursement requirements. Additionally, tribes with their own fire suppression resources may receive reimbursement from BIA for costs related to fire suppression on tribal lands. The FMAG request should include cost estimates and fire information. The request for Fire Management Assistance Declaration (FEMA form 078-0-1) should include cost estimates and details about the fire, such as size, threatened population, evacuations, weather conditions, and resource commitments. Criteria for evaluating wildfires include threat to lives and property, availability of state and local resources, fire danger conditions, and watershed areas. FEMA has developed fire cost thresholds based on national indices like the National Fire Danger Ratings System and potential economic impacts. There are individual and cumulative thresholds to determine eligibility for fire assistance, with varying amounts by state. For example, Pennsylvania's individual threshold is $927,274, while the cumulative threshold is either $500,000 or three times the individual threshold. The individual and cumulative fire damage thresholds vary by state. In Pennsylvania, the cumulative threshold is $2,781,822, while in Alaska, it is $500,000. If FEMA denies assistance, the state can appeal within 30 days. The state can appeal FEMA's denial of assistance within 30 days by submitting a written request for an extension to the Regional Administrator. The FEMA Headquarters Office will notify the state of its determination within 90 days. No emergency or major disaster can be declared after an FMAG declaration has been issued. Funds for Fire Management Assistance Grants (FMAGs) come from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which is a no-year account with two categories: one for major disasters under the Stafford Act and another for base funding. FMAGs are funded through the DRF's base funding category. FMAGs are funded through the DRF's base funding category and do not reduce funding for major disasters. When the DRF balance is low, FEMA uses its \"immediate needs funding\" policy to prioritize urgent activities. The cost-share for FMAGs is 75% federal share of eligible expenses. The FMAG process involves a federal share of 75% of eligible expenses, with the state and local communities covering the remaining 25%. FEMA reimburses grantees for their activities, and the state must submit a grant application within 90 days of receiving the FMAG. FEMA has 45 days to approve or deny the application, and FMAG assistance is similar to other FEMA aid. Salaries for public safety forces will not be covered, but overtime expenses for the event will be reimbursed. Other eligible expenses include equipment and supplies, mobilization and demobilization, emergency work, prepositioning resources, personal comfort items for firefighter health and safety, field camps and meals, and mitigation of declared fires on federal land. Hazard mitigation grants are now available for FMAG declarations due to the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. Under the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (DRRA), hazard mitigation grants are now available for Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG) declarations. These grants are provided to states and tribes based on a sliding scale tied to the percentage of funds spent on FMAG assistance. FMAGs allow for direct assistance to states in fighting fires on state lands without the need for a disaster declaration. FEMA provides assistance through FMAGs, while other federal agencies offer support for wildfire management. Other federal agencies offer various types of assistance related to wildfire management, including postfire recovery and planning for future wildfires. These programs provide financial and technical support to state partners. USDA agencies also administer programs for disaster recovery assistance to nonfederal forest landowners. FMAG assistance is not available in conjunction with emergency suppression assistance from the Forest Service or other federal agencies. FMAGs provide support for suppression operations on nonfederal lands, while federal lands are the responsibility of the agency with jurisdiction. FMAGs may be provided for declared fires on lands with mixed federal and nonfederal ownership. This assistance can be coordinated with other Forest Service programs and federal aid through cooperative agreements with state and tribal partners for emergency wildfire response. The federal government may provide suppression operations on lands under nonfederal ownership through cooperative agreements. Costs are apportioned among partners, with reimbursement provisions. FMAGs can cover eligible costs if a state conducts suppression operations on federal land and costs are not reimbursable. Most fires on federal land are the responsibility of the federal agency and are not eligible for FMAG assistance, except for declared fires in areas with mixed federal and nonfederal land. To assist with declared fires in areas with federal and nonfederal land, states responsible for suppression under a cooperative agreement with the federal agency can receive assistance for costs not reimbursable under other federal statutes."
