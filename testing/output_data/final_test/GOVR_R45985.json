    "content": "Fully autonomous vehicles have the potential to revolutionize transportation safety by reducing human errors that lead to motor vehicle crashes. Legislation supporting the development and testing of autonomous vehicles has faced controversy in Congress, with bills like H.R. 3388 and S. 1885 being introduced but facing concerns about preemption of state laws and exemptions from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Several fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles have raised new questions about regulation. A pedestrian was killed in Arizona by an Uber autonomous vehicle, and three Tesla drivers died in accidents. The challenge of producing fully autonomous vehicles that can operate safely on public roads may be greater than developers had envisioned. Several executives, including the Ford Motor Co. CEO, are advocating for a new outlook on autonomous vehicle legislation. The expiration of federal highway and public transportation programs at the end of FY2020 could shift focus towards a surface transportation reauthorization bill. New technologies are already enhancing vehicle performance and safety, automating functions once controlled by the driver. These innovations include automated lighting and braking, GPS and smartphone connectivity, and lane-keeping features, driven by technological advances and new materials. Three forces driving vehicle innovations: technological advances, consumer demand for connectivity and new ownership models, and regulatory mandates on emissions and safety. Manufacturers combine these innovations for higher automation levels. Vehicles classified into six automation categories by SAE, adopted by DOT for standardized nomenclature. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is working on standardized nomenclature for vehicle automation levels. Currently, vehicles are at levels 1 and 2, with level 3 expected in a few years. Fully autonomous vehicles at level 5 are still distant, except in closed systems. Testing and development of autonomous vehicles are ongoing, utilizing various technologies like electronic sensors, GPS, and cameras. Autonomous vehicles utilize built-in maps, cameras for 360-degree views, and sensors to detect objects, classify them, predict their path, and plan a response. They also use DSRC for monitoring road conditions and may integrate with 5G for greater interoperability and cybersecurity. Manufacturers are incorporating autonomous vehicle technologies like GPS and rear-facing cameras into current vehicles, with plans to add more for driverless transportation. Companies like General Motors and Honda are competing with autonomous vehicle developers such as Alphabet's Waymo. Automakers are forming partnerships for ride-sharing and AI, with Ford and Volkswagen planning to launch an autonomous ride-sharing service in Pittsburgh by 2021. GM acquired Cruise Automation for self-driving technology, while Honda invested in GM's Cruise Automation. Volvo is also involved in the development of autonomous vehicles. As vehicle technologies advance, the security of data collected by vehicle computers and protection against intrusion are growing concerns. Sensors and automated components will generate large amounts of data about the vehicle, driver behavior, and performance. Systems allowing vehicles to communicate with each other and manufacturers could be vulnerable to unauthorized access. Protecting autonomous vehicles from hackers is crucial. Protecting autonomous vehicles from hackers is a top priority for federal and state governments, manufacturers, and service providers. Hackers can exploit multiple entry points in vehicle electronic systems, such as the airbag and lighting system. To address security concerns, manufacturers have established the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) to release cybersecurity guidelines. The Auto-ISAC, established by manufacturers for cybersecurity, is a central hub for sharing reports of incidents and threats in the vehicle industry. Various entities, including manufacturers, suppliers, vehicle owners, and law enforcement, seek access to vehicle data. Issues include data collection, ownership, and consumer privacy. No laws currently prevent manufacturers from reselling data. Autonomous vehicles are being developed globally, with no laws preventing manufacturers from reselling data. Factors contributing to their advancement include innovation, partnerships with academic institutions, ride-sharing services, and infrastructure support requirements. Highway improvements are crucial for enabling autonomous vehicles. Highway improvements are essential for autonomous vehicles to function fully. Workforce training will be necessary for the new skills required, as traditional mechanical parts may disappear. Government laws and regulations need to adapt to the unique features of fully autonomous vehicles. Governments are modifying vehicle requirements for pilot programs and tests to prepare for autonomous vehicles. Permanent changes in standards will likely be needed for commercialization. Consumer acceptance is crucial, with markets more likely to embrace autonomous vehicles in cities with advanced technology and ride-hailing services. Surveys show plans in China, South Korea, Japan, and the United States to benefit from autonomous vehicles. Singapore ranked first in autonomous vehicle readiness due to its policies and laws governing deployment and high consumer acceptance. South Korea's K-City is the world's largest testbed for self-driving cars. The Netherlands leads in guiding autonomous vehicles, while Singapore excels in policy and legislation. Singapore ranked first in policy and legislation for autonomous vehicles, with a single government entity overseeing regulations, funding for pilots, and a national standard for safe deployment. The country also scored first in consumer acceptance, thanks to extensive testing throughout the nation. Germany and Japan rank just below the United States in technology and innovation, while Japan excels in autonomous vehicle infrastructure. Vehicles on public roads are regulated by both the federal government and states. NHTSA oversees auto safety, while states handle driver licensing, traffic regulations, and insurance. Autonomous vehicle proponents are concerned that lengthy safety regulation revisions could hinder innovation. The Obama Administration issued the first report on federal regulations for autonomous vehicles in 2016, with DOT planning annual updates to regulatory guidance. The FCC is reconsidering spectrum allocation for motor vehicle communications, which could impact autonomous vehicle development. The DOT's 2016 report proposed federal and state regulatory policies for autonomous vehicles, including guidelines for design, testing, and deployment. It identified 15 practices for manufacturers and service providers to follow, with Safety Assessment Letters being voluntary but potentially mandatory in the future. Additionally, a model state policy was developed to address new autonomous vehicle issues within existing regulatory structures. The DOT's 2016 report proposed federal and state regulatory policies for autonomous vehicles, including guidelines for design, testing, and deployment. It suggested state roles and procedures, administrative issues, coordination with law enforcement, changes to vehicle registration, and regulation of liability and insurance. It also recommended a streamlined review process for DOT regulatory interpretations and exemptions, as well as new tools and regulatory structures for NHTSA to increase expertise in new vehicle technologies and speed up rulemakings. The Trump Administration's follow-up reports on autonomous vehicle regulation propose a more limited federal role in overseeing passenger vehicle deployment. They also expand the Department of Transportation's oversight to include commercial trucks, public transit, rail, and ports. The new policies encourage automation integration across all transportation modes, replacing recommendations from the Obama Administration. The October 2018 report Automated Vehicles 3.0 outlines the Department of Transportation's six automation principles for overseeing autonomous vehicles in various transportation modes, prioritizing safety, remaining technology-neutral, modernizing regulations, and providing guidance to government and industry partners. It emphasizes the traditional roles of federal and state governments in regulating motor vehicles and motorists, suggesting best practices for states to consider implementing. The Department of Transportation recommends voluntary actions for autonomous vehicle safety, such as manufacturers issuing public self-assessments. NHTSA lists companies filing self-assessment reports, with 17 companies listed. NHTSA is urged to accelerate decisions on exemptions for autonomous vehicle testing. The Department of Transportation is promoting the development of voluntary technical standards for autonomous vehicles. They plan to revise regulations to redefine terms like \"driver\" and \"operator\" to indicate that a human does not always have to be in control of a vehicle. NHTSA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2019 to request comments on testing autonomous vehicle technologies for compliance with federal safety standards. The NTSB report on the 2018 autonomous vehicle fatality in Tempe, AZ found that the crash was caused by the operator's visual distraction from her cell phone. The vehicle failed to accurately classify the pedestrian and predict her path. The report also highlighted an \"inadequate safety culture\" at Uber and regulatory deficiencies as contributing factors to the fatal crash. The NTSB report on the 2018 autonomous vehicle fatality in Tempe, AZ found that the crash was caused by the operator's visual distraction from her cell phone. Uber's safety risk-assessment procedures were inadequate, and the disabling of safety systems increased risks. The Arizona Department of Transportation lacked oversight of autonomous vehicle testing. NHTSA provided insufficient guidance to developers and manufacturers on safety goals. NTSB recommended specific steps for Uber, Arizona DOT, and NHTSA to address the issues identified. The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators is advised to inform states about the Tempe crash, urging them to evaluate developers before granting testing permits. Federal regulation of vehicle communication spectrum may impact automation. Autonomous vehicles, part of connected vehicles and infrastructure, use AI and technology within each vehicle. V2X technologies, including V2V and V2I communications, aim to reduce accidents by improving detection and warning systems. Intelligent transportation systems aim to improve traffic flow and safety by using technologies like DSRC and C-V2X for vehicle communication. The FCC allocated the 5.9 GHz band for motor vehicle safety in 1999. DSRC has been developed and deployed in many states and cities, but C-V2X is emerging as an alternative cellular-based technology. The FCC proposed reallocating the 5.9 GHz band for unlicensed use and transportation-related use, with 20 MHz exclusive for C-V2X. This decision has competitive implications for various industries and may impact safety technologies and vehicle automation. DOT advocates for retaining the entire band for transportation use. The European Commission approved DSRC for direct V2V and V2I communications, while endorsing cellular-based technology for vehicle access to the cloud and remote infrastructure. DSRC advocates support retaining the 5.9 GHz band exclusively for DSRC, while C-V2X supporters argue for sharing the band with their cellular-based solution aligned with 5G standards. Technology companies argue for additional spectrum to accommodate increasing demand. During the 115th Congress, bipartisan support existed for the SELF DRIVE Act, which aimed to address federal issues related to autonomous vehicles. Device makers argued for additional spectrum to accommodate the growing number of interconnected devices, proposing that the 5.9GHz band could be shared between transportation and non-transportation uses. The AV START Act, S. 1885, prioritizes safety for self-driving vehicles, promotes innovation, addresses regulatory incompatibility, remains technology-neutral, reinforces federal and state roles, strengthens cybersecurity, and educates the public on differences between conventional and self-driving vehicles. The bill emerged as slightly different from the House-passed legislation during the 115th Congress. The AV START Act, S. 1885, was not scheduled for a floor vote in December 2018 due to concerns raised by Senators. A committee staff draft bill was circulated to address these concerns and could form the basis of future legislation. The House and Senate bills aimed to address state action replacing federal regulation, empower NHTSA for safety, and encourage innovation in autonomous vehicles. They retained the current arrangement of states controlling driver-related functions and the federal government overseeing vehicle safety. The bills included provisions on preemption of state laws. H.R. 3388 and S. 1885 aimed to preempt state laws regulating autonomous vehicles, with H.R. 3388 emphasizing state control over driver-related functions. States would still be able to enforce laws on vehicle sales and repairs under H.R. 3388. S. 1885 also included preemption of state laws but omitted some specific powers reserved for states in the House-passed bill. The House-passed bill on autonomous vehicles allowed states to issue licenses without discrimination based on disability. Preemption would end when NHTSA sets standards. The Senate draft clarified state authority over traffic laws and limited arbitration in injury cases. Both bills expanded DOT's exemption authority for testing on public roads. The House-passed bill and the Senate bill on autonomous vehicles expanded DOT's exemption authority for testing on public roads. The House bill phased in increases to 100,000 vehicles per manufacturer per year over four years, while the Senate bill allowed up to 80,000 vehicles per manufacturer per year. H.R. 3388 included constraints on exemptions from crashworthiness and occupant protection standards, and required the establishment of a publicly available database of exempted vehicles. The Senate bill did not address these issues. The Senate staff draft added provisions to ensure exempted vehicles maintain overall safety, occupant protection, and crash avoidance. A DOT review of exemptions would be required annually, capped at five years. New NHTSA safety rules would mandate a safety assessment certification for developers and manufacturers, addressing system safety, data recording, cybersecurity risks, and more. The Senate staff draft added provisions for exempted vehicles to maintain safety standards, including a yearly DOT review of exemptions. Manufacturers would need to submit safety assessment reports covering system safety, data recording, and cybersecurity risks. NHTSA would not establish an assessment protocol for minimum risk conditions. The legislation aimed to update safety standards for new vehicle technologies and develop a plan for safe deployment of autonomous vehicles within six months of enactment. The Senate staff draft proposed clarifying requirements for manufacturers to address the ability of autonomous vehicles to detect and respond to road users, including cybersecurity measures such as developing a cybersecurity plan within six months of enactment. This plan would include mitigation strategies for cyberattacks, unauthorized intrusions, and malicious commands, as well as limiting access to autonomous driving systems and employee training. The Senate bill proposed requirements for manufacturers to address cybersecurity measures in autonomous vehicles, including developing a cybersecurity plan, limiting access to driving systems, and employee training. It also aimed to create incentives for sharing vulnerability information and establish a committee for cybersecurity recommendations to Congress. The House-passed bill on autonomous vehicles includes provisions for cybersecurity and privacy. Manufacturers must develop written privacy plans for data collection and storage, with the option to exclude certain processes. The Federal Trade Commission would be responsible for reporting to Congress on vehicle-related issues. The Senate bill would have required NHTSA to establish an online motor vehicle privacy database covering all vehicle types, including manufacturers' privacy policies and how personally identifiable information is collected, retained, and destroyed. It would have added new passenger motor vehicle privacy protections and established advisory panels for further research. Both H.R. 3388 and S. 1885 proposed establishing new advisory bodies to research autonomous vehicles and advise the Department of Transportation (DOT) on potential new vehicle standards. H.R. 3388 aimed to create a NHTSA advisory group focusing on mobility access, cybersecurity, labor, environmental issues, and testing. S. 1885 included panels like the Highly Automated Vehicles Technical Committee, a working group for marketing strategies, and a committee for evaluating the impact of autonomous vehicles on transportation infrastructure and the environment. Additionally, DOT would have been required to study ways to implement autonomous technology. The Senate staff draft proposed creating a Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council to consolidate advisory committees and report on various issues related to autonomous vehicles. This comprehensive legislation also included provisions addressing the impact of autonomous vehicles in the America's Transportation Infrastructure Act of 2019. Discussions on a bicameral bill for autonomous vehicles are ongoing in the 116th Congress. The legislation includes provisions to modernize charging and fueling infrastructure for autonomous vehicles and improve roadway infrastructure. State and local regulations may impact testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. The National Governors Association emphasizes the need for updated regulations to keep pace with technology advancements and ensure safety. The National Governors Association (NGA) is advocating for modifications in autonomous vehicle legislation to ensure safety and keep pace with technology. This includes allowing states and local governments to enforce existing laws, requiring detailed reports on technology safety, differentiating between testing and commercial deployment, and expanding consumer education on safe use. Expansion of legislation related to autonomous vehicles has been seen in at least 41 states and the District of Columbia between 2013 and October 2019. This includes clarifying commercial activities like truck platooning, but no recent laws have addressed cybersecurity or vehicle inspection reports. Governors in 11 states issued executive orders, and 5 states both issued executive orders and enacted legislation. Consumer education on \"safe use and interaction\" with autonomous vehicles is also being emphasized. Recent state laws have been enacted regarding cybersecurity and vehicle inspection reports. NCSL has categorized state legislation in Table 4. The deployment of fully autonomous vehicles will require new technologies and changes to highway infrastructure. Autonomous vehicles rely on pavement markings and signage to navigate traffic. The transition to more autonomous vehicles will take several decades, with the FHWA expected to play a key role. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is updating the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) to address issues related to autonomous vehicle technologies. State compliance with MUTCD standards is voluntary and not uniform across all states. Audi decided not to introduce its Level 3 autonomous vehicle technology in the U.S. due to varying state laws, insurance requirements, and inconsistencies in lane lines and road signs. Improvement and better maintenance of pavement markings, signage, and intersection design are crucial for autonomous vehicle deployment. Inadequate road maintenance, with 21% of major U.S. roads in poor condition, may hinder the progress. Some states do not maintain highway markings at a level suitable for guiding autonomous vehicles, impacting their ability to navigate effectively. Improvement of road markings and signage is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Challenges may arise on dirt and gravel roads due to lack of markings. Clear communication methods between vehicles and infrastructure are needed for safety and efficiency. The TRB is evaluating the development of connected vehicle infrastructure. States should plan and develop connected vehicle infrastructure for full autonomous vehicle deployment. TRB's research focuses on how transportation agencies can identify necessary investments for connectivity. Special highway corridors with V2X systems may facilitate autonomous vehicle travel. Highway markings may become less important as automakers explore new navigation methods. Highly detailed mapping could replace visual cues like lane markings for vehicle guidance. Transportation agencies and automakers may need to develop an open standard for all vehicles to understand this technology. V2X communications through DSRC and cellular networks could evolve to support new types of vehicle guidance."
