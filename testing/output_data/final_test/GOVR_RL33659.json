    "content": "The U.S. Border Patrol, under the Department of Homeland Security, uses personnel, technology, and barriers like fencing and vehicle barriers to secure the nation's borders. This report will analyze the construction and maintenance of these barriers, including cost estimates and policy issues. The focus is on the deployment of fencing to impede illegal entry. The report focuses on policy issues surrounding the construction of border fencing by the U.S. Border Patrol. The \"primary fence\" was erected in 1990 in San Diego as part of the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy to deter illegal entries and drug smuggling. The U.S. Border Patrol constructed a 10-foot-high welded steel fence along the border from the Pacific Ocean with the help of the Corps of Engineers and the California National Guard. The primary fencing was erected in San Diego in 1990 as part of the \"Prevention Through Deterrence\" strategy. Additionally, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act in 1996, giving the Attorney General authority to build barriers along the border. Environmental concerns halted the construction of a secondary fence after 9.5 miles were completed. In 2005, Congress passed the REAL ID Act, allowing the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive legal requirements for border barrier construction. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 directed the construction of 850 miles of fencing along the southern border. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 modified this to require reinforced fencing along at least 700 miles of the southwest border. The U.S. Border Patrol also deploys vehicle barriers at the border. The USBP deploys permanent and temporary vehicle barriers at the border to stop vehicle entry into the US. The San Diego sector covers 66 miles of the border with Mexico, lacking natural barriers for unauthorized entry. In response, the USBP began erecting physical barriers in 1990. In 1990, the USBP started building a physical barrier in the San Diego sector to deter illegal entries and drug smuggling. The initial 14-mile \"primary\" fence made of 10-foot-high welded steel did not significantly reduce unauthorized alien crossings. To address this, Operation Gatekeeper was launched in October 1994, increasing manpower and deploying USBP personnel directly along the border to prevent illegal entry. Operation Gatekeeper involved deploying agents in three tiers along the border to prevent illegal entry, apprehend those attempting to cross, and observe heavily used corridors. The first tier focused on fixed positions, the second tier had more freedom to contain and apprehend aliens who passed the first tier, and the third tier manned vehicle checkpoints further inland. This strategy resulted in significant increases in manpower along the border. Operation Gatekeeper resulted in significant increases in resources deployed to San Diego sector, including manpower, night vision goggles, vehicles, light towers, and seismic sensors. The USBP estimated in 1998 that the entire 66 miles of border patrolled by the San Diego sector's agents could be brought under control in five years. The San Diego sector's agents patrolled miles of border and could be controlled in five years. The primary fence, along with Operation Gatekeeper, was successful but costly. Immigration officials and lawmakers realized the need for a three-tiered fence system to integrate infrastructure, manpower, and new technologies for border control. The Sandia study commissioned by the former INS recommended using multiple barriers in urban areas to increase the USBP's ability to deter illegal border crossers, detect intruders early, and channel them to more manageable locations. It also suggested using highway checkpoints in rugged terrain areas. The study highlighted the resiliency of aliens in bypassing obstacles, proposing a three-fence barrier system with vehicle patrol. The INS constructed primary fencing in San Diego using broad authority granted by the Immigration and Nationality Act. In 1996, Congress authorized the AG to construct barriers at the border for the first time in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Section 102 of IIRIRA focused on improving and constructing barriers at international borders to deter illegal crossings. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act authorized the construction of barriers at the border to deter illegal crossings in high entry areas. Specifically, the Act mandated the construction of a three-tiered barrier near San Diego along 14 miles of the U.S. border. There was debate over whether continuous triple fencing and roads were required for the entire corridor. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act authorized the construction of barriers at the border to deter illegal crossings in high entry areas, specifically mandating a three-tiered barrier near San Diego. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 amended this by authorizing five stretches of two-layered reinforced fencing totaling roughly 850 miles along the southwest border. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 further amended the Act to require reinforced fencing along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border. The Consolidated Appropriations Act amended IIRIRA to authorize necessary funds for border barriers. The original waiver authority for environmental laws to expedite construction was never utilized by INS or CBP. The INS and CBP did not use the original waiver authority for environmental laws to expedite construction in the San Diego area. The REAL ID Act expanded this waiver authority in the 109th Congress, allowing DHS to continue building the border fence and other barriers. The AG was also given land acquisition authorities for enforcement purposes. The REAL ID Act of 2005 granted the Secretary of DHS broad authority to waive legal requirements for the expedited construction of security barriers. These waivers are effective upon publication in the Federal Register, with exclusive jurisdiction for review by federal district courts and the Supreme Court. The Act allows the Secretary to waive all legal requirements necessary for the construction of authorized barriers. The REAL ID Act of 2005 granted the Secretary of DHS broad authority to waive legal requirements for the expedited construction of security barriers, with exclusive jurisdiction for review by federal district courts and the Supreme Court. The waiver provision allows the Secretary to waive all legal requirements necessary for the construction of authorized barriers, with limited scope of judicial review and discretionary Supreme Court appeal. Some concerns have been raised about the breadth of the waiver provision and the limited scope of judicial review. The REAL ID Act of 2005 granted the Secretary of DHS broad authority to waive legal requirements for the expedited construction of security barriers. Secretary Chertoff has interpreted the provision to apply to the waiver of laws in their entirety, along with regulations and requirements. The new waiver provision uses language not typically seen in law, lacking qualifying language seen in other waiver provisions. The REAL ID Act grants the Secretary of DHS authority to waive legal requirements for building security barriers. The provision allows waivers of laws, regulations, and requirements to expedite construction. The Secretary must determine that waiving a law is necessary for quick construction, focusing on laws that impede construction rather than those tangentially related. For example, child labor laws would not be waived as they do not hinder fence construction. The Secretary of DHS has the authority to waive legal requirements for building security barriers under the REAL ID Act. The waiver provision was included to expedite construction by removing laws that impede the process. The Secretary's decision to waive a law is at their discretion, but until then, DHS must comply with all legal requirements. Secretary Chertoff exercised waiver authority in 2005 to ensure the expeditious construction of the San Diego border fence. On January 19, 2007, the Secretary waived various legal requirements to expedite construction of physical barriers and roads near the U.S. border in Arizona. Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit on October 5, 2007, to halt fence construction activities in a conservation area in southeastern Arizona, leading to a temporary restraining order on October 10, 2007. The Secretary of Homeland Security waived legal requirements to expedite fence construction in a conservation area. A temporary restraining order halted construction due to lack of environmental assessment. Waivers were exercised to resume construction, with a list of laws waived published in the Federal Register. The Secretary of Homeland Security waived legal requirements to expedite border fence construction in various states, including Texas. Legal challenges to the waiver authority have been unsuccessful, with courts upholding the Secretary's decision. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 directed DHS to construct reinforced fencing and additional barriers along 850 miles of the southwest border, including stretches from Tecate, CA to Brownsville, TX. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 directed DHS to construct reinforced fencing along 850 miles of the southwest border, with specific deadlines for priority areas. The Act was later modified in the 110th Congress to increase the Secretary of Homeland Security's discretion in choosing where to construct fencing. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 initially required 850 miles of reinforced fencing along the southwest border. However, a more flexible approach was later imposed, mandating at least 700 miles of fencing in practical and effective areas. The Act allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to determine the most appropriate means for achieving and maintaining operational control over the border, including the installation of physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 amends the Secure Fence Act by requiring the construction of either 370 miles or \"other mileage\" of fencing along the southwest border by December 31, 2008. It introduces new consultation requirements for the Secretary of Homeland Security with various stakeholders to minimize impacts. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandates consultation with stakeholders to minimize environmental and cultural impacts near fencing construction areas. Construction of a secondary fence with lighting and access road began in 1996, parallel to existing primary fencing in the San Diego sector. Legal actions halted the completion of the remaining 4.5 miles authorized for construction. The completion of a triple-fence in \"Smuggler's Gulch\" was halted by the California Coastal Commission due to concerns about consistency with state policies. The USBP proposed filling the canyon with dirt to extend the fence, but legal actions stopped the project in February 2004. The California Coastal Commission halted the completion of a triple-fence in \"Smuggler's Gulch\" due to concerns about consistency with state policies. The USBP proposed filling the canyon with dirt to extend the fence, but legal actions stopped the project in February 2004. The CCC found that CBP did not believe it could make further environmental concessions while complying with IIRIRA, and rejected alternative projects that could have been less environmentally damaging. The California Coastal Commission (CCC) raised concerns about adverse effects on the environment, endangered species, and protected lands due to the construction of the San Diego border fence. Congress expanded waiver authority in the REAL ID Act to allow DHS to waive the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) for the fence project. Construction on the final 4.5 miles of the fence has begun with a $31 million appropriation in FY2007. The final 4.5 miles of the San Diego fence, known as Smuggler's Gulch, is under construction by DHS. Apprehension statistics are used to measure USBP performance, but may not accurately reflect the number of people evading capture. Despite limitations, apprehension statistics remain the most reliable way to track trends in illegal migration along the border. The San Diego fence spans two border patrol stations in the sector. The San Diego fence spans two border patrol stations: Imperial Beach and Chula Vista. The primary fence was built in FY1990, followed by the secondary fence in FY1996. Apprehensions at Imperial Beach decreased significantly from FY1992 to FY2004, with a major drop during Operation Gatekeeper. Apprehensions at Chula Vista followed a similar trend. The trend in apprehensions at Chula Vista and Imperial Beach stations showed a significant decrease from FY1992 to FY2002, with a slight increase from FY2002 to FY2004. Enforcement measures, including fencing, initially focused on Imperial Beach and later extended to Chula Vista, leading to a shift in unauthorized migration westward. Apprehensions decreased more rapidly in Imperial Beach compared to Chula Vista during this period. The drop in apprehensions at Imperial Beach and Chula Vista led to an increase in apprehensions at other San Diego sector stations. This suggests that enforcement efforts in the westernmost stations caused unauthorized migration to shift eastward. The installation of border fencing, along with an increase in agent manpower and technological assets, significantly reduced apprehensions in the San Diego sector from FY1992 to FY2004. However, apprehensions slightly increased in FY2003 and FY2004 in response to the USBP focus on the Tucson sector in Arizona. This suggests that fewer unauthorized aliens are attempting to cross in the San Diego sector. The increased enforcement measures in the San Diego sector, including fencing and manpower, led to a decrease in unauthorized aliens attempting to cross the border. Apprehensions in the sector declined from FY1992 to FY2004, with Imperial Beach and Chula Vista stations accounting for a smaller percentage of apprehensions. Meanwhile, apprehensions in the Tucson sector in Arizona increased during the same period. Apprehensions in the Tucson sector in Arizona increased significantly over the late 1990s and early 2000s, while apprehensions in the San Diego sector declined by 76% between 1992 and 2004. The construction of the fence and increases in manpower in the San Diego sector changed migration patterns for unauthorized aliens. The increased deployment of agents, infrastructure, and resources in the San Diego sector led to a significant decline in apprehensions of unauthorized aliens. Despite the shift in migration patterns, overall apprehensions by USBP agents did not decrease. The USBP has been constructing and maintaining barriers along the international land border since 1991, primarily in selected urban areas to reroute illegal migration. Two main types of border fencing have been constructed: primary fencing along urban areas and Sandia fencing in San Diego. The USBP has been constructing barriers along the international land border since 1991, primarily in urban areas. They have installed secondary or triple fencing in San Diego and permanent vehicle barriers in various segments. The construction process involves determining environmental impact, acquiring land and materials, and securing assistance from the Corps of Engineers and National Guard. The section will discuss the role of plays in assisting USBP with constructing border fencing, including acquiring materials. It will cover issues related to environmental assessments and land acquisition along the southwest border, which supports various protected species and habitats. For example, in California, 18 federally protected species can be found, while in Arizona, there are at least 39 endangered, threatened, or candidate species. Over 85% of lands along the Arizona border are federal lands designated for wilderness and wildlife protection. The southwest border region, including Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, is fragile and vulnerable to environmental harm from illegal immigration and USBP activities. The USBP's enforcement activities increased in the 1990s, leading to the construction of fencing and barriers. While the San Diego fence reduced vehicle crossings, foot traffic continued to impact the environment. The USBP's enforcement activities, including pursuit of illegal aliens and construction of roads and fences, contribute to environmental degradation. The REAL ID Act allows the DHS Secretary to waive legal requirements for border fencing construction. Until then, all legal requirements must be followed, such as NEPA documentary requirements. The government must acquire land for fence construction, like the San Diego border fence extending 150 feet north of the international boundary. The DHS Secretary can acquire land for border fencing construction, including the San Diego border fence extending 150 feet north of the international boundary. Eminent domain powers may be used to acquire necessary land, with just compensation required. Construction of the final 4.5 miles of the San Diego fence is delayed as DHS acquires the needed land. The DHS is authorized to acquire new interests in lands under the INA, including land along the border already owned by the federal government through presidential proclamations. In 1907, President Roosevelt reserved public lands within 60 feet of the US-Mexico border in California, Arizona, and New Mexico as the \"Roosevelt Reservation\" to prevent smuggling. President Taft made a similar reservation in 1912 for public lands within 60 feet of the US-Canada boundary to enforce customs and immigration laws. This proclamation aimed to retain federal control over lands abutting international boundaries. CBP has constructed border fencing under an MOA with the ECSO of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The construction process for CBP includes planning, acquiring real estate, drafting environmental protection plans, designing projects, overseeing construction, and enforcing warranties. National Guard and military units provide labor for tactical infrastructure projects, funded by CBP construction account within DHS appropriation. Funding for land acquisition and fence materials comes from DHS Congressional Budget Justifications. The appropriations for fencing and border barriers have increased significantly in recent years, from $6 million in FY2002 to $647 million in FY2007. The FY2008 appropriation included $196 million for fence construction, while the FY2009 request decreased to $775 million for SBInet-related technologies and infrastructure. $275 million was proposed for technology and infrastructure solutions on the southwest border, with an additional $410 million for operations and maintenance. The Administration's request for funding in 2008 did not include new fencing or vehicle barriers at the border. Instead, the funding was allocated for operating and maintaining existing technologies deployed as part of the SBInet program, along with the 370 miles of fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers completed by the end of 2008. DHS had constructed 306 miles of fencing and 3001 miles of vehicle barriers by the end of 2008, with most of the fencing contracted out. The funding for the San Diego fence was fully funded by P.L. 110-329, but $400 million was withheld until an expenditure plan is approved. The plan includes specific components such as accounting of program implementation, allocation of funding for border security needs, and certifications by DHS officials. Once CBP purchases materials and acquires land, the Corps of Engineers takes over. The Corps of Engineers undertakes engineering studies and provides manpower and machinery for installing fencing, with State National Guard often providing manpower. Private contractors are used for most new fencing construction, but the Corps is involved in planning and engineering. Funding for the Corps comes from the Department of Defense Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities Account. The funding for the \"Southwest Border Fence\" sub-account within the Department of Defense Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities Account from FY1997 to FY2009 is shown in Table 2. The USBP uses primary fencing, Sandia fencing, and vehicle barriers along the border. Landing mat fencing, made of army surplus carbon steel landing mats, is primarily used as a primary fence. The landing mat fencing used by USBP during the Vietnam War consists of panels 12 feet long, 20 inches wide, and 1/4 inch thick, welded to steel pipes buried 8 feet deep every 6 feet along the fence. Each mile of fencing requires 3,080 panels, with about 5 miles of surplus landing mat fencing remaining as of 2006. Construction costs were estimated to range from $388,005 to $431,117 per mile. Sites featuring this fencing include Campo, CA; Yuma, AZ; Nogales, AZ; Naco, AZ; Douglas, AZ; and El Paso, TX. The landing mat fencing used by USBP during the Vietnam War consists of panels 12 feet long, 20 inches wide, and 1/4 inch thick, welded to steel pipes buried 8 feet deep every 6 feet along the fence. Each mile of fencing requires 3,080 panels, with about 5 miles of surplus landing mat fencing remaining as of 2006. Maintenance costs per year could vary widely depending on the number of breaches the fence undergoes, estimated to range from $1,742 to $17,753 per mile. The net present value of the fence after 25 years of operation would range from $5.4 million to $8.3 million per mile. The secondary fence proposed by the Sandia study has only been constructed over roughly 9.5 miles of the 14 miles in the original plan due to environmental concerns voiced by the California Coastal Commission. The DHS is using new waiver authority to complete the San Diego fence, estimating an additional $66 million in costs, bringing the total project cost to $127 million. They plan to use a mix of DOD resources and private contractors for construction. The secondary fence is being built behind the primary fence with space for an access road. The secondary fence is an angled two-piece fence, reaching up to ten feet high and extending outwards to prevent climbing. The estimated cost for Sandia fencing ranges from $785,679 to $872,977 for construction and $953 to $7,628 per mile yearly for maintenance. The Corps of Engineers noted that the fence may need replacement every few years due to severe damage, with a net present value ranging from $11.1 million to $61.6 million per mile after 25 years of operation. The USBP utilizes various types of barriers to impede vehicles from crossing into the United States from Mexico. Permanent vehicle barriers, such as steel posts or bollards, are not designed to be moved and are inserted into a concrete base. They are spaced to allow foot and animal traffic but not vehicles. The USBP is building permanent vehicle barriers in the Yuma sector, with plans for a substantial stretch along the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. The USBP is constructing permanent vehicle barriers in the Yuma sector, including a substantial stretch along the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. The project aims to create the largest continuous physical barrier along the border, totaling 123 miles when combined with existing barriers. Commercial contractors are proposed to build 39 miles of barriers, with a projected completion by FY2011 at a cost of $116 million, averaging $1.25 million per mile. The National Park Service has spent $11.1 million to construct 18 miles of permanent vehicle barriers in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, with an additional $6.6 million in funding to complete the remaining 13 miles. Temporary vehicle barriers are typically built from welded metal and can be redeployed to different areas to address changes in smuggling patterns. In FY2007, DHS introduced the SBInet program to enhance border security with a mix of personnel, technology, and infrastructure. Boeing was awarded a contract to lead the technology integration, including testing 8 fence designs. By the end of FY2007, CBP had constructed 76 miles of border fencing, bringing the total to 154 miles. CBP plans to construct an additional 216 miles of fencing by the end of 2008, bringing the total fencing at the border to 370 miles. As of early April 2008, 18 miles of fencing have been completed, totaling 172 miles. The construction is primarily done by contractors, with some involvement from the National Guard in FY2007. Additionally, 32 miles of vehicle barriers have been constructed, totaling 142 miles, with plans to build 158 miles in total. CBP plans to build 158 additional miles of vehicle barriers by the end of 2008, bringing the total vehicle barrier mileage to 300. Despite challenges, CBP had constructed 296 miles of pedestrian fencing and 282 miles of vehicle barriers by the end of 2008. As of February 13, 2009, CBP had constructed 306 miles of fencing and 301 miles of vehicle barriers, meeting its goal for vehicle barriers but falling short by roughly 64 miles for fencing. Congress may consider various issues regarding the construction of border barriers, including effectiveness, costs, diplomatic implications, unintended consequences, and locations. Proponents argue that fences reduce smuggling, citing the success in the San Diego sector. Border barriers in the San Diego sector have been successful in reducing cross-border smuggling and migration. Opponents argue that the decrease in apprehensions is due to increased manpower and resources, suggesting that the fence only redirects unauthorized migration. The USBP views border fencing as a force multiplier, allowing agents to focus on other areas. Urban fencing has rerouted unauthorized migration to less populated areas, where agents have a tactical advantage. In 2004, apprehensions were similar to 1992, with San Diego accounting for the majority in the past. The effectiveness of border fencing in reducing apprehensions is a concern for Congress, especially if not constructed across the entire border. While fencing in limited urban areas has reduced apprehensions, it has also redirected illegal immigrants to less fortified areas. Breaches and tunnels have been discovered in areas with fencing, suggesting that these issues may increase if fencing is expanded. Possible policy options to address border breaches and tunnels include mandating highly tamper-resistant fencing or investing in tunnel-detection technologies. The costs of constructing a double layer fence range from $1.2 million to $1.3 million per mile, with a 25-year life cycle cost ranging from $16.4 million to $70 million per mile. If significant portions of the border were fenced, it could reduce areas for illegal border crossings. The cost of maintaining widely deployed border fencing in the future may be higher due to increased breaches and compromise attempts. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that border fencing would cost $3 million per mile to construct, with maintenance totaling roughly 15% of overall project costs per year. Labor costs and land acquisition expenses are not included in these estimates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that border fencing would cost $3 million per mile to construct, with maintenance totaling roughly 15% of overall project costs per year. DHS predicts the San Diego fence will cost $127 million for its 14-mile length. Construction costs varied from $3 million to $21 million per mile due to delays, complex terrain, and the use of private contractors. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that border fencing costs varied, with construction in FY2007 at $2.8 million a mile and in FY2008 at $5.1 million a mile. There are debates on the cost-effectiveness of fencing compared to other border security measures. The USBP emphasizes the need for a mix of resources for effective border control. The debate in Congress revolves around the allocation of border security resources, specifically regarding the effectiveness and cost of border fencing. Different fence designs have varying strengths and weaknesses, with concrete panels being cost-effective but not allowing visibility for USBP agents. The use of private contractors for construction may impact costs, and questions remain about future maintenance responsibilities. The debate in Congress focuses on the effectiveness and cost of border fencing. Different fence designs have strengths and weaknesses, with Sandia and bollard fencing being effective but expensive, while chain link fencing is more economical but easily compromised. The USBP prefers fencing that can be seen through in urban areas to maintain tactical advantage and avoid violent incidents. Border fencing is most effective in urban areas where individuals crossing the border have a short distance to cover before disappearing into neighborhoods, making it difficult for USBP agents to identify and apprehend unauthorized aliens. Fencing in rural areas provides a tactical advantage as border crossers must travel longer distances before reaching populated areas. Fencing requires manpower to check for breaches and illegal activity, which is less of a problem in urban areas. In rural border areas, agents may spend much time commuting from distant USBP stations to fence locations. Construction costs may rise in remote areas due to logistics. Severe weather in some border areas could damage permanent structures. The practical issues of border fencing include deciding where to construct fences, whether to focus on urban areas or all areas with high unauthorized immigration, and considering factors like distance to USBP stations and environmental challenges. The acquisition of land for border fencing along the California, Arizona, and Texas borders raises questions about costs, ownership, and potential use of eminent domain. The federal government owns much of the land in California and Arizona, while private individuals own most of the land in Texas. The costs of acquiring land and potential use of eminent domain to confiscate land from unwilling owners are key considerations. The validity of land claims and patents on reservations is uncertain, with potential encroachment by private developments. Only those meeting exceptions or statutory requirements may have valid claims. Mistaken grants or transfers to private parties could be void. Questions arise regarding the President's authority to issue proclamations without supporting evidence, potentially conflicting with Congress's mandate to regulate federal property. Compensation under the Fifth Amendment may not be owed if private claims are illegitimate. The issue for Congress is whether presidential proclamations regarding federal property are valid and what actions to take if individuals own land within reservation boundaries. This includes deciding on the extent of land needed for border fencing and the authority of DHS to construct fencing on tribal lands, particularly in heavily trafficked areas like the Tohono O'odham reservation in the Arizona desert. The Tohono O'odham reservation is a heavily trafficked border area where the USBP faces restrictions due to tribal concerns. The tribe opposes fencing on their land for environmental and cultural reasons. The Secretary of the Interior can grant rights-of-way over tribal land with consent, but DHS may use waiver authority to build a fence without consent. It is uncertain if this waiver can override another agency's authority. Congress can take Indian lands for public use with just compensation. The governments of Mexico and Canada have expressed concerns about the United States constructing barriers along the international border. Mexican President Vicente Fox opposes border barriers, stating they isolate nations and do not solve underlying problems. The Mexican government has sent diplomatic notes to the White House registering complaints. The Canadian government has also raised objections. The Canadian government has voiced concern over legislative proposals for border fencing along the northern border, citing difficulties and lack of consultation with Canadian authorities. Deputy Assistant Secretary John P. Clark warned against the expansion, comparing it to the Chinese wall and the Berlin Wall. Congress needs to consider diplomatic ramifications and whether the gains in security outweigh the risk of alienating Mexico and Canada. The debate surrounding border fencing includes concerns about environmental impacts, such as harm to sensitive environments, critical habitats, and migratory patterns for animals. The disagreement over fence design led to Congress passing waiver language in the REAL ID Act. The REAL ID Act allows the Secretary of DHS to waive legal requirements for quick construction of barriers and roads near the U.S. border. This waiver was used to bypass environmental laws for the San Diego border fence. Concerns arise about potential harm to endangered species like jaguars and Sonoran desert pronghorns if a fence is built along the Arizona border. The construction of border fences, such as the one in San Diego, raises concerns about its impact on wildlife migration and gene pools. While some believe it could benefit protected lands by reducing unauthorized migration, others argue that it may have negative environmental consequences. As Congress debates immigration reform and new border fences, balancing national security with environmental protection is crucial. There is interest in studying the environmental effects of border fencing to better understand potential consequences. The construction of border fences raises concerns about its impact on wildlife migration and gene pools. Congress may be interested in environmentally sensitive alternatives to normal fencing to limit illegitimate cross-border traffic. Legal issues stem from environmental laws, with the building of barriers along the international border. The Secretary could waive many environmental requirements, leading to challenges from environmental groups under the National Environmental Policy Act. The federal government's plan to complete the San Diego border fence under the National Environmental Policy Act faced a lawsuit alleging inadequate evaluation of the 14-mile border infrastructure system. Secretary Chertoff's waiver authority led to the dismissal of the environmentalists' lawsuit in December 2005. The provision limits legal redress to constitutional violations, preventing individuals from suing DHS for bypassing environmental impact statement requirements. The waiver authority of Secretary Chertoff led to the dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the completion of the San Diego border fence under the National Environmental Policy Act. Legal challenges can only be appealed to the Supreme Court if the Court grants certiorari, with no guaranteed intermediate appellate court review. Congress may require prompt review in the Supreme Court for cases of great public importance. The USBP's strategy of \"Prevention through Deterrence\" has successfully changed the flow of illegal migration, shifting it to more remote areas of the Arizona border. This has led to an increase in migrant deaths as a consequence. The enforcement posture and shift in migration patterns have led to an increase in migrant deaths, with 472 deaths in 2005 compared to 200 in the early 1990s. Crime rates along the more rural border areas have not decreased as much as in San Diego and El Paso. Border fencing has resulted in the creation of tunnels for smuggling operations, including a sophisticated kilometer-long tunnel in San Diego. The potential unintended consequences of expanding border fencing include increased illegal migration to non-reinforced areas, cross-border tunnels, and impacts on crime rates. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 gave DHS discretion on where fencing should be erected. The Secure Fence Act gives DHS discretion on where to erect fencing along the border, requiring 700 miles of reinforced fencing with 370 miles as a priority by December 31, 2008. $1,225 million was allocated for SBInet, including $1,053 million in emergency funding and $172 million in regular appropriations for development, deployment, operation, maintenance, and program management of the border fence. Funding for the border fence was included in the BSFIT account for development and deployment activities. However, exact details on the funding allocation for the fence are not provided in available documentation. The President's FY2008 request for BSFIT included $196 million for fence-related funding. $650 million for SBInet was withheld until an expenditure plan is approved. Proposed legislation in the 110th Congress also included provisions for border security. Several bills were introduced in the 110th Congress regarding the construction of border fencing. Bills such as H.R. 4192, H.R. 3638, and H.R. 2954 directed the President to construct fencing authorized by the Secure Fence Act. S. 2348 would have authorized $3 billion for border security purposes, including 700 miles of fencing. S. 2294 and S. 1984 called for the construction of 700 miles of fencing. Several bills in the 110th Congress called for the construction of border fencing, including S. 2294, S. 1984, and S. 2348 which authorized 700 miles of fencing. Other bills like S. 1269 and S. 330 proposed double-layer fencing in specific border areas. The issue of barriers at the border was part of the larger immigration debate during that time. Some immigration reform proposals in the 110th Congress included requirements for border fencing as a trigger for broader reform. S.Amdt. 1150 called for 370 miles of fencing and 200 miles of vehicle barriers before certain immigration provisions could take effect. S.Amdt. 1172 later amended this to require 300 miles of vehicle barriers. Several bills in the 110th Congress proposed border security measures, including the construction of 370 miles of fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers as triggers for immigration reform.
