    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2017\". Section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is amended to include a definition of \"concrete actions\" as efforts by a country's government to combat trafficking, such as enforcement actions, investigations, prosecutions, convictions, training, programs, partnerships, and prevention efforts. The amended Section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 defines \"concrete actions\" as government efforts to combat trafficking, including prevention programs, victim services like immigration assistance and restitution, and financial commitments to these actions.

The amended Section 103 of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 defines \"concrete actions\" as government efforts to combat trafficking, including prevention programs, victim services, financial commitments, information from survivors, media reports, academic reports, and assessments of impact. The sense of Congress is that the private sector should support law enforcement agencies in combating child sex trafficking through technology and that private businesses should actively work to prevent and combat this crime. Additionally, Congress believes that any future funding for anti-trafficking programs should include accountability measures. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON PLACEMENT OR RECRUITMENT FEES. Section 106(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is amended to redesignate clauses and subparagraphs, making adjustments to placement and recruitment fees regulations.

The annual Trafficking in Persons Report now requires countries upgraded from Tier 3 to Tier 2 Watchlist to prepare and present action plans to improve their tier ranking. The government of each country must prepare action plans to address deficiencies preventing them from meeting Tier 2 standards. The plans should focus on short-term and multi-year goals. Ambassadors and regional Assistant Secretaries will brief the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on these plans. The Senate and House committees oversee the implementation of action plans to address trafficking issues. The paragraph does not modify minimum standards or actions against governments failing to meet them. SEC. 7.

Relevant officials will brief key Senate and House committees on the implementation of these measures.
