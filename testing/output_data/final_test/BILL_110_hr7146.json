    "content": "The \"Carbon Leakage Prevention Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to carbon emissions. The Congress finds that all industries, both domestic and foreign, should contribute to climate stabilization. Domestic producers of energy-intensive products facing international competition pose a challenge for US climate policy as increased compliance costs may lead to investment and production shifts to countries without greenhouse gas regulations. The US must take economy-wide action on climate change without exempting any industries to prevent job and emission displacement to unregulated countries. International agreements are deemed the most suitable approach. International agreements are crucial for reducing emissions from energy-intensive industries to prevent job and emission displacement to unregulated countries. Output-based distribution of emission allowances can help mitigate carbon leakage, complementing other policies to encourage global greenhouse gas reductions. The purpose of international agreements is to reduce emissions from energy-intensive industries and prevent job and emission displacement to unregulated countries. Output-based distribution of emission allowances can help mitigate carbon leakage and encourage global greenhouse gas reductions. The Act aims to compensate eligible facilities in domestic industrial sectors for carbon emission costs under cap-and-trade programs, limiting compensation to prevent carbon leakage while rewarding innovation. It provides compensation for direct and indirect costs of purchasing emission allowances for compliance, excluding costs related to market dynamics, to prevent carbon leakage.

It provides compensation for direct and indirect costs of purchasing emission allowances for compliance, excluding costs related to market dynamics, to prevent carbon leakage. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA, \"cap-and-trade program\" as a Congress-enacted program for controlling greenhouse gas emissions, \"carbon dioxide equivalent\" as the equivalent amount of greenhouse gas to 1 metric ton of CO2, and \"carbon leakage\" as a significant increase in emissions due to production cost increases in the US. The curr_chunk defines terms related to a domestic cap-and-trade program in the United States, including \"covered facility,\" \"emission allowance,\" \"facility,\" \"greenhouse gas,\" and \"output.\" The term \"output\" in a domestic cap-and-trade program refers to the total production of a manufacturing facility, as determined by the Administrator. SEC. 5. Distribution of emission allowances to energy-intensive manufacturing facilities. The Administrator annually distributes emission allowances to eligible industrial sectors and subsectors, with a maximum limit of 15 percent of total allowances under a cap-and-trade program. If total allowances exceed the maximum, distribution to owners is reduced. The Administrator will reduce distribution to owners and operators on a pro rata basis. By January 1, 2011, eligible industrial sectors and subsectors will be identified based on specific criteria to receive emission allowances. This includes sectors like iron, steel, pulp, paper, cement, and others to minimize carbon leakage. The Administrator considers greenhouse gas intensity, foreign sourcing, international competition, market pricing, and potential for increased imports or decreased exports in evaluating domestic production. The text discusses the calculation of emission allowances for covered facilities under a domestic cap-and-trade program. The allowances are based on direct compliance and indirect carbon factors, using data from two years prior to distribution. The context before this paragraph includes considerations like greenhouse gas intensity, foreign sourcing, and international competition in evaluating domestic production. The text outlines the process for determining compliance allowance factors for facilities under a cap-and-trade program. This includes direct and indirect factors based on greenhouse gas emissions and output levels. The emissions intensity factor is the average greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt hour of electricity purchased in regulated and wholesale competitive electricity markets. In a wholesale competitive electricity market, the emissions intensity factor is the average greenhouse gas emissions per kilowatt hour of electricity purchased, determined by the facility owner. The electricity efficiency factor is 85 percent of the average electricity usage per ton of production. Each facility owner must report information to the Administrator to determine compliance factors for greenhouse gas emissions. This includes direct and indirect carbon allowance factors for electricity sellers. The electricity seller must provide quarterly information to the facility owner and the Administrator to determine emissions intensity factor reduction. This includes using allowances from cap-and-trade programs to prevent electricity rate increases for the facility owner. The Administrator differentiates between iron and steel facilities using different technologies when calculating emission allowances. Other eligible entities receive emission allowances distributed by the Administrator for a calendar year. The Administrator distributes emission allowances to eligible industrial facilities based on the indirect carbon allowance factor, calculated using data from two years prior. New facilities in specified sectors receive emission allowances in their first and second years of operation under the Act. The Administrator adjusts emission allowances for new facilities in specified sectors in their third year of operation to reconcile the total quantity received in the first and second years with what they would have received. The Administrator adjusts emission allowances for new facilities in specified sectors in their third year of operation to reconcile the total quantity received in the first and second years with what they would have received if the appropriate data were available. SEC. 6. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\nThe Administrator, in consultation with relevant departments, must submit reports to Congress on carbon leakage and the effectiveness of emission allowance distribution under this Act every two years, with recommendations for improvement.\n\nSEC. 7. MODIFICATION OR ELIMINATION OF DISTRIBUTION OF ALLOWANCES TO ENERGY-INTENSIVE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. If international efforts significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate disadvantages to domestic manufacturers, the President can reduce emission allowances under this Act. If the competitive disadvantage to domestic manufacturers becomes insignificant, the Administrator will terminate the reduction. If international efforts reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help domestic manufacturers, the President can reduce emission allowances. If the competitive disadvantage to domestic manufacturers is insignificant, the Administrator will terminate the distribution of allowances under this Act."
