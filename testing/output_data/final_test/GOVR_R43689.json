This was a decrease from the previous year's total appropriations for the EPA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $8.20 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency for FY2014, including supplemental funds for water infrastructure and cleanup efforts in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The budget process for FY2014 considered discretionary appropriations under the Budget Control Act of 2011, with a statutory limit on spending through FY2021 and potential sequestration if deficit reduction measures were not enacted. The House and Senate passed budget resolutions with different spending levels and allocations for defense and nondefense. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 set total caps for FY2014 and FY2015 discretionary spending. No FY2014 appropriations bill for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was introduced before October 1, 2013. On July 31, 2013, the markup was suspended. On August 1, 2013, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee released a draft FY2014 Interior appropriations bill with a significant funding difference for EPA compared to the House draft. A temporary 16-day lapse in discretionary appropriations occurred between October 1, 2013, and October 16, 2013, leading to a partial government shutdown. The Continuing Appropriations Act was enacted on October 17, 2013. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 ended the government shutdown on October 17, 2013, providing temporary appropriations at FY2013 levels until January 15, 2014. Further extensions maintained these levels until January 17, 2014, funding federal departments for the full fiscal year. This report compares FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA accounts, programs, and activities to the President's FY2014 budget request and FY2013 enacted appropriations. The FY2014 budget request and FY2013 enacted appropriations included $577.3 million in supplemental funds for EPA accounts in the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The primary sources of information are the Joint Explanatory Statement and the House Committee on Appropriations report. The FY2013 enacted appropriations for EPA reflect sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and an additional across-the-board rescission. A breakout is provided for supplemental funding in P.L. 113-2. Historical comparisons of enacted appropriations by EPA accounts from FY2008 to FY2014 are presented in Table A-1, while Figure A-1 shows funding trends adjusted for inflation. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43207. The funding trends for the agency from FY1976 to FY2014 are depicted in Figure A-1, while Figure A-2 shows EPA's full-time-equivalent (FTE) employment ceiling from FY2001 to FY2014. The term appropriations in this report refers to total discretionary funds available to EPA for obligation, excluding permanent or mandatory appropriations. The majority of EPA's annual funding comes from discretionary appropriations, with a small portion from mandatory appropriations. From FY1996 to FY2013, EPA's appropriations were allocated across eight statutory accounts, with a ninth account added in FY2014 for the Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Fund. This fund was established to track hazardous waste shipments and is supported by start-up appropriations and user fees. H.R. 3547 established a dedicated account to develop a cost-effective IT system for managing manifest transactions electronically under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA are compared to the President's FY2014 request and FY2013 enacted appropriations. The table breaks down the funding for each of the nine EPA statutory appropriations accounts, including the new Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Fund. The FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA compared to the President's request and FY2013 appropriations. The table breaks down funding for nine EPA statutory appropriations accounts, including the new Hazardous Waste Electronic Manifest System Fund. Figure 1 shows the allocation of total appropriations for FY2014 compared to FY2013, with and without Hurricane Sandy disaster relief funds. The FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA totaled $8.20 billion, slightly exceeding the President's request and surpassing the FY2013 enacted appropriations. The FY2014 funding was $298.9 million higher than FY2013, excluding supplemental funds. Rescissions of unobligated balances of prior EPA appropriations were not included in FY2014, unlike previous fiscal years. The FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA totaled $8.20 billion, slightly exceeding the President's request. Rescissions of unobligated balances from prior appropriations were not included in FY2014. The focus during the debate was on federal financial assistance to states for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. The FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA totaled $8.20 billion, slightly exceeding the President's request. Congressional interest focused on federal financial assistance to states for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, categorical grants for environmental programs, air pollution control, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental cleanup. Funding levels for geographic-specific initiatives like the Great Lakes were also discussed. This report discusses FY2014 appropriations for selected EPA programs and activities that received attention in the congressional debate leading to the enactment of P.L. 113-76. The FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA totaled $8.20 billion, slightly exceeding the President's request. Congressional interest focused on federal financial assistance to states for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, categorical grants for environmental programs, air pollution control, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental cleanup. Funding levels for geographic-specific initiatives like the Great Lakes were also discussed. The EPA FY2015 congressional budget justification provides a detailed breakout of the FY2014 enacted appropriations, with State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) accounting for a significant portion of the total appropriations. In FY2013, SRF grants accounted for over 33% of EPA appropriations, compared to about 23% in the President's FY2014 budget request. These grants support wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects to comply with environmental acts. EPA awards SRF grants based on formulas, with a combined $2.36 billion appropriated in P.L. 113-76 for Clean Water and... The FY2014 appropriations for Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs totaled $2.36 billion, which was $443.8 million more than the President's request and $118.4 million more than FY2013. This amount was $451.6 million less than FY2013 when factoring in supplemental appropriations. The FY2014 funding was also lower than FY2012, FY2011, and FY2010 levels. Table 2 compares the FY2014 enacted appropriations to the President's request and FY2013 appropriations for SRF capitalization grants. The FY2014 appropriations included funding for disaster relief supplemental appropriations, specifically for water infrastructure projects in Alaska Native Villages and the U.S.-Mexico Border region. The construction of wastewater and drinking water facilities in Alaska Native Villages received $10.0 million, while $5.0 million was allocated for wastewater infrastructure projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. Additionally, $1.05 billion was included to support other water infrastructure projects in FY2014. In FY2014, $1.05 billion was allocated for state and tribal \"categorical\" grant programs, supporting the implementation of federal environmental laws and regulations. These grants fund activities such as monitoring, permitting, pollution control, and multimedia projects. In FY2014, $1.05 billion was allocated for state and tribal \"categorical\" grant programs to assist with the implementation of federal environmental laws and regulations, including air quality requirements. EPA air quality and climate change activities, such as addressing emissions of greenhouse gases and hazardous air pollutants, received attention during the consideration of FY2014 appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed provisions in FY2014 to limit EPA's use of funds for Clean Air Act regulations. P.L. 113-76 included restrictions on specific air quality regulatory activities related to greenhouse gas emissions. Section 420 addressed regulations for permits under the Clean Air Act for greenhouse gas emissions from biological processes. The Clean Air Act governs greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production, including reporting requirements for manure management systems. EPA receives appropriations for climate change activities, with a small share of funding but a larger policy and regulatory role compared to other agencies. Funds for EPA's climate change and air quality activities are distributed across multiple program activities and appropriations accounts. Funds for EPA's climate change and air quality activities are distributed across various program activities and appropriations accounts. Comparisons can be made among certain activities specified by Congress in the appropriations process. Table 4 shows FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA air quality and climate change activities, comparing amounts to the President's request and FY2013 enacted appropriations. EPA's \"clean air and climate\" activities are the largest funded air quality program area within Environmental Programs and Management (EPM) and Science. The FY2014 enacted appropriation for the State and Local Air Quality Management grants was $228.2 million, $29.0 million less than the President's request but $4.8 million more than the FY2013 enacted appropriation. States use these grants to help operate air pollution control programs. The State and Local Air Quality Management grants fund air pollution control programs, with day-to-day operations handled by state and local agencies. The STAG account also includes funding for the Diesel Emission Reduction Grants program, which has seen a decline in funding compared to prior fiscal years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $200.0 million annually for grants from FY2007 through FY2011. P.L. 113-76 included $8.1 million for state indoor radon grants in the STAG account, a slight increase from FY2013. The President's FY2014 request proposed eliminating the state indoor radon grant program, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds for it. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account supports assessment and cleanup of sites contaminated by hazardous substances. EPA carries out these activities. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account, authorized under CERCLA, finances EPA activities for assessing and cleaning up sites contaminated by hazardous substances. In FY2014, $1.09 billion was allocated for the Superfund account, which was less than the President's request and FY2013 appropriations. Funding has been decreasing since FY2010. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account, authorized under CERCLA, finances EPA activities for assessing and cleaning up sites contaminated by hazardous substances. Funding for the Superfund account has been decreasing since FY2010, with annual levels averaging $1.25 billion. The program aims to clean up hazardous sites and enforce liability for cleanup costs, with both federal and state programs working together to address contaminated sites. EPA identifies responsible parties for cleanup costs at Superfund sites. The Hazardous Substance Superfund account, authorized under CERCLA, finances EPA activities for assessing and cleaning up sites contaminated by hazardous substances. Sites financed by responsible parties do not rely on Superfund appropriations, except in cases where EPA may use the funds upfront and later recover costs. If responsible parties cannot be found or cannot pay, EPA can use Superfund appropriations for cleanup under a cost-share agreement with the state. Orphan sites with no viable parties for cleanup are funded by Superfund. Funding for cleanup primarily focuses on high-risk sites on the National Priorities List for hazardous substance release. Federal facilities on the NPL are funded separately by the administering agencies. Annual funding for the cleanup of contaminated federal facilities exceeds EPA's Superfund appropriations by several billion dollars. EPA oversees their cleanup through the Superfund program in conjunction with the states. Just over half of the Superfund account is allocated to response actions at non-federal facilities. CERCLA authorizes remedial and removal actions to address long-term risks and imminent hazards. Only sites listed on the NPL are eligible for Superfund. The Superfund account funds EPA's homeland security responsibilities, operational expenses, and enforcement of cleanup liability under CERCLA. Enforcement ensures responsible parties pay for contamination cleanup, focusing Superfund appropriations at orphan sites. Funding may also be transferred to EPA's Science and Technology account for cleanup technology research and development. The Superfund account funds EPA's cleanup liability enforcement under CERCLA. Funding may be transferred to EPA's Science and Technology account for research and development of cleanup technologies. Annual appropriations acts typically authorize these transfers. Table 5 shows FY2014 appropriations for the Superfund account compared to the President's request and FY2013 appropriations. EPA also administers a cleanup program providing financial assistance to state, local, and tribal entities for certain sites. The Brownfields program provides federal financial assistance to state, local, and tribal governmental entities for sites with known or suspected contamination that may hinder economic development. Responsible parties at these sites are not eligible for assistance, as they are accountable for cleanup costs. The program focuses on orphan sites where cleanup needs remain unaddressed, awarding competitive and formula-based grants. EPA is authorized to award competitive grants under Section 104(k) of CERCLA. The Brownfields program under CERCLA authorizes EPA to award grants for assessment and cleanup of contaminated sites, job training, and technical assistance. Funding for these grants comes from the STAG account, while program administration expenses are funded through the EPM account. In FY2014, $163.7 million was provided for the Brownfields program, exceeding the President's request and the previous year's appropriations. EPA's Brownfields program, funded by the LUST Trust Fund and General Fund, addresses cleanup of underground storage tank leaks. EPA and states use the funds for corrective actions and leak prevention. The EPA's Brownfields program, funded by the LUST Trust Fund and General Fund, addresses cleanup of underground storage tank leaks. Appropriations within the EPM and STAG accounts are available for regulatory and support activities. P.L. 113-76 appropriated $94.6 million from the LUST Trust Fund to EPA for FY2014, slightly less than the President's FY2014 request. The funding level for FY2013 included disaster relief supplemental appropriations to address leaking underground storage tanks in areas affected by Hurricane Sandy. The LUST Trust Fund provides funding for EPA and states to enforce corrective actions for underground storage tank leaks. Congress established the fund to ensure cleanups are conducted by responsible parties or in emergencies. States have used the majority of their annual LUST Trust Fund for cleanups. The LUST Trust Fund, financed by a motor fuels tax, has seen a decline in balance due to funds being redirected for surface transportation projects. $2.4 billion was transferred to the federal Highway Trust Fund in FY2012, with an additional $1 billion authorized in 2014. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded UST leak prevention provisions and authorized the transfer of $1 billion from the LUST Trust Fund to the Highway Trust Fund in 2014. This reduced the availability of funds for Subtitle I purposes, but the balance of the LUST Trust Fund has grown faster than the use of funds over time. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 expanded UST leak prevention provisions and authorized the transfer of funds from the LUST Trust Fund to support cleanup and underground storage tank leak prevention and detection regulations. Funding for these activities now comes from the trust fund, with a small portion from general revenues. The FY2014 enacted appropriations from the LUST Trust Fund to EPA support cleanup and UST leak prevention and detection activities. The EPM account in P.L. 113-2 provides funding for ecosystem restoration programs addressing water quality and pollution in specific areas of the US. Collaboration among EPA, federal agencies, state/local governments, and nonprofits is common. Funding for Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay restoration is significant. President Bush established a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in 2004 to guide federal efforts for protection and restoration. President Obama proposed the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in FY2010, approved by Congress in P.L. 111-88. The initiative aims to improve coordination among federal programs to address ecosystem problems like invasive species and pollution through grants and agreements with various organizations. Funding consolidates existing Great Lakes programs. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative was established in FY2010 with an initial appropriation of $475 million to EPA. Funding has been allocated to clean up contaminated sediments and coordinate federal programs for ecosystem issues. Congress has continued to provide funding, with $300 million allocated for FY2014. In FY2014, $70.0 million was appropriated for EPA's Chesapeake Bay program, which was $3.0 million less than the President's request and $15.7 million more than the FY2013 enacted appropriations. Despite past restoration efforts, the bay's overall health remains degraded by excessive nutrients and sediment. P.L. 113-76 allocated $16.9 million for \"National Priorities\" in the Science and Technology and Environmental Programs and Management accounts for FY2014. The funds were for high-priority water quality and availability research grants by not-for-profit organizations, with a 25% matching funds requirement. The remaining $12.7 million from the allocated $16.9 million in P.L. 113-76 for \"National Priorities\" in FY2014 was included in the EPM account. These funds were designated for competitive grants to not-for-profit organizations to provide technical assistance for improving water quality or safe drinking water, with a 10% matching funds requirement. $11.0 million was allocated for national level training and technical assistance, while $1.7 million was allocated for technical assistance to individual private well owners. These funds were not categorized as earmarks by Congress. The House and Senate have adhered to an earmark moratorium during the 112th and 113th Congress, precluding earmarks in annual appropriations bills for FY2011-2014. Definitions of earmarks were adopted in House and Senate rules, with separate definitions for transparency requirements. The EPA was established in 1970 in response to public concern about pollution. Congress has enacted numerous environmental laws and amendments over the years, providing funds for EPA to regulate air and water quality, manage hazardous waste, and clean up environmental contamination. EPA also awards grants to assist state and local governments in pollution control. The EPA awards grants to assist governments in controlling pollution to comply with federal environmental requirements and fund the implementation of laws. Congress has funded EPA programs through appropriations despite expired authorizations. House and Senate rules may allow funding for programs without authorization if no point of order is raised or rules are waived. Congress typically continues funding EPA programs through appropriations even after authorizations have expired. Table A-1 shows enacted appropriations for EPA from FY2008-FY2014, while Figure A-1 displays the agency's discretionary budget authority from FY1976 through FY2014. EPA's funding has increased over time to fulfill statutory responsibilities, reflecting the agency's evolving roles in addressing environmental issues. Despite representing a small portion of the federal budget, EPA's funding grew from $1.0 billion in FY1970 to a peak of $14.86 billion in FY2009. Adjusted for inflation, this peak includes regular appropriations of $7.64 billion in FY2009. EPA's funding peaked at $14.86 billion in FY2009, including regular appropriations of $7.64 billion and supplemental appropriations of $7.22 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Adjusted for inflation, EPA's funding in FY1978 was slightly higher than in FY2009. EPA's authorized FTE employment ceiling increased by 18% from FY1990 to FY1999, with the largest increase occurring from FY1990 to FY1993. FTEs grew at a moderate rate of less than 1% per year, with a downward trend since FY2001. EPA's funding structure changed over the years, making historical comparisons difficult."
