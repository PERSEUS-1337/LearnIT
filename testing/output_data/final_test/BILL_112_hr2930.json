    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act\" and includes a crowdfunding exemption. The Securities Act of 1933 is amended to include a crowdfunding exemption for transactions involving the offer or sale of securities by an issuer, with specific aggregate amount limits based on financial disclosures provided. The crowdfunding exemption under the amended Securities Act of 1933 sets an aggregate amount limit of $2,000,000 adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index, or less. Additionally, the total amount sold to any investor in the previous 12-month period must not exceed the lesser of $10,000 (adjusted annually) or 10% of the investor's annual income. The Securities Act of 1933 sets requirements for crowdfunding exemptions, including compliance with intermediary regulations and issuer requirements. SEC. 4A outlines requirements for certain small transactions. Requirements on Intermediaries in securities transactions include warning investors about the speculative nature of investments in startups, emerging businesses, and small issuers, informing them of sales restrictions, taking measures to prevent fraud, and providing necessary contact information to the Commission. The intermediary in securities transactions must provide up-to-date contact information, grant investor-level access to their website, and require potential investors to demonstrate understanding of investment risks. The issuer must set a target offering amount and deadline, and ensure a third-party custodian is in place. The third-party custodian withholds offering proceeds until 60% of the target offering amount is raised from investors other than the issuer. They also conduct background checks on the issuer's principals and provide notice of the offering to the Commission and potential investors, including issuer details, purpose of proceeds, target offering amount, and deadline. The issuer must outsource cash-management functions to a qualified third party custodian, maintain appropriate books and records, provide a communication method on the intermediary's website for issuer-investor interaction, notify the Commission upon completion of the offering, and refrain from offering investment advice. An issuer offering securities without an intermediary must warn investors of risks, comply with sales restrictions, prevent fraud, provide contact information to the Commission, and maintain updated information. The issuer must provide continuous investor-level access to their website, require potential investors to demonstrate understanding of risks, state a target offering amount, and ensure that 60 percent of the target amount is raised from investors other than the issuer before releasing offering proceeds. The issuer must provide notice of the offering with the purpose, target offering amount, and deadline. They must outsource cash-management functions, maintain appropriate records, and offer a communication method on their website for investors. The issuer must provide notice of the offering, outsource cash-management functions, maintain records, and offer a communication method on their website for investors. The issuer and investors can communicate, no investment advice is offered, and the issuer must disclose their interest in the issuance. Verification of income can rely on certifications provided by the investor. The Commission will make certain notices and information available to the States. The Securities Act restricts sales of securities for a year after purchase, allowing transfer only to the issuer or an accredited investor. Intermediaries in transactions under section 4(6) are not required to register as brokers. This does not prevent other forms of capital raising. The Securities Act allows for capital raising through methods not described under section 4(6). The Securities and Exchange Commission will issue rules within 180 days to implement section 4A, considering costs and benefits. Disqualification provisions will be established based on disciplinary history for issuers utilizing the exemption under section 4(6). The Commission will establish disqualification provisions for intermediaries based on disciplinary history, similar to regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act. SEC. 3 amends Section 12(g)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to exclude crowdfunding investors from the shareholder cap. SEC. 4 addresses the preemption of state law. Section 18(b)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933 is amended to include section 4(6). The amendments clarify that State enforcement authority is preserved for registration requirements under the Act, with no impact on other State enforcement actions related to exemptions from registration. The amendment clarifies state jurisdiction over unlawful conduct by intermediaries, issuers, and custodians in connection with securities transactions. The House of Representatives passed the amendment on November 3, 2011. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
