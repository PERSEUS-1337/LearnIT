    "content": "After a period of diplomatic tension, Japan and China have significantly improved their bilateral relationship since 2006. The relationship has seen positive developments such as breakthrough agreements on territorial disputes, high-level exchanges, and increased economic interdependence through trade and investment flows. China-Japan ties have become crucial in the East Asian trade and investment network. Despite improved bilateral relations between Japan and China since 2006, military strategists in both nations remain wary of each other's motives. Japan is concerned about China's military modernization and lack of transparency in military spending, while China is suspicious of Japan developing a more assertive security posture. Tensions have been heightened by occasional Chinese vessel incursions into Japanese territorial waters, despite efforts by leaders in Beijing and Tokyo to pursue d\u00e9tente. Former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine had previously strained the relationship. Since 2006, political leaders in Japan and China have pursued political accommodation despite past tensions over visits to the Yasukuni Shrine and historical disagreements. Analysts believe the short- to medium-term outlook for relations is stable, but long-term ties could be threatened by fundamental distrust and historical disputes. The recent d\u00e9tente in Chinese-Japanese relations could have significant implications for U.S. interests, fostering stability and prosperity in the region. Equanimity between Tokyo and Beijing allows the U.S. to avoid taking sides on delicate issues and aids in multilateral efforts like the Six-Party Talks on North Korea's nuclear program. Some U.S. officials view China as a security threat, but pragmatic Sino-Japanese accommodation serves U.S. interests well. Some U.S. officials and analysts see China as a security threat and advocate for Japan to strengthen its military capabilities to deter China's ambitions. The possibility of Japan and China forming a political partnership that could marginalize U.S. interests seems unlikely due to historical grievances and distrust between the two countries. Despite some signs of strain in the U.S.-Japan alliance, the recent d\u00e9tente in Chinese-Japanese relations could benefit U.S. interests by promoting stability in the region. In the event of a conflict in the Taiwan Straits, Japan would likely participate in a U.S. military response due to the strong American security commitment. The presence of 47,000 U.S. troops in Japan, with a majority in Okinawa near Taiwan, suggests that a counter-attack could be launched from Japan. Taiwan's status as a potential flashpoint for conflict between China and the United States serves as a reliable foundation for the U.S.-Japan relationship despite occasional tensions. Both Japan and China are reevaluating their strategies in the post-Cold War era, with each country playing a significant role in ongoing strategic reassessments. China's primary goal is sustainable economic development, prioritizing a peaceful international environment. Smooth relations with the United States and Japan are crucial to avoid negative responses that could hinder its development. Beijing faces new national security challenges post-Cold War, including the demise of the Soviet Union. Despite being a world economic superpower, Japan is facing challenges adjusting to domestic and geopolitical realities. The economy is struggling in the global downturn, and the political process is uncertain. Chinese leaders are wary of Japan's regional ambitions, especially its territorial claims in the East China Sea, and are concerned about Japan's potential role in a conflict involving China's claims on Taiwan. Japan is facing challenges with a divided government and a shrinking labor force due to low birth rates and an aging population. It is also navigating China's economic growth and political influence. Japan aims to maintain security ties with the US, strengthen trade partnerships in Asia, and avoid conflicts with China. Additionally, Japan seeks to increase its global presence through foreign aid and international development contributions. In 2004, Japan joined the G-4 coalition with Germany, India, and Brazil to seek non-veto membership in the UN Security Council. Despite US support for Japan's bid, Security Council reform efforts have stalled. Japan is the second-largest contributor to the UN budget, facing opposition from China for permanent membership. China and Japan have a complex relationship dating back centuries. Japan's development was greatly influenced by China, but in the late 19th century, Japan's militarism and imperial ambition led to military victories over China, including annexing Taiwan and acquiring territories in Shandong Province. Japan's military campaigns in China, including acquisitions in Shandong Province and occupation of Manchuria, left a bitter legacy affecting Sino-Japanese relations. Mao Zedong's communist forces triumphed in the civil war, establishing the People's Republic of China on the mainland. Japan-PRC relations have seen economic and political engagement alongside periods of tension. Japan has provided economic aid to China since 1979, with trade reaching $237 billion in 2007. After Japan's surrender in 1945, the United States played a significant role in Japan's post-war reconstruction and the structure of East Asia. General Douglas MacArthur was appointed as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers to oversee a primarily American occupation. Taiwan and the Pescadores were assigned to the Republic of China. After Japan's surrender in 1945, the United States assigned Taiwan and the Pescadores to the Republic of China. The post-war constitution established a parliamentary system for Japan, with Article 9 outlawing war as a sovereign right and prohibiting collective self-defense. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces can only respond to attacks on Japan, not defend allies. After Japan's surrender in 1945, the United States assigned Taiwan and the Pescadores to the Republic of China. The post-war constitution established a parliamentary system for Japan, with Article 9 outlawing war as a sovereign right and prohibiting collective self-defense. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces can only respond to attacks on Japan, not defend allies. The occupation of Japan ended in 1952, leading to the signing of the Mutual Security Treaty in 1951 and the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement in 1954, allowing the US to station troops in Japan for regional security. Japan and the United States entered into a defense alliance in 1960, obliging both parties to assist each other in resisting armed attacks on Japanese territories. This alliance affected Sino-Japanese relations, with Japan following the U.S. lead in not having official political relations with the People's Republic of China. Through the 1950s, Japan's unofficial economic contacts with China expanded, including private trade agreements. In 1962, Japan improved trade relations with the PRC, causing Taiwan to object. In 1964, Taiwan suspended government purchases from Japan for six months. In 1971, U.S. President Nixon's announcement of visiting the PRC led to a reassessment of Japanese policy. Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations were established in 1972. Diplomatic relations between Japan and China were established in 1972, preceding the U.S.-China relations by six years. This period saw significant improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, with Japan providing aid, investment, and technology to China. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought new challenges to their relationship, despite their growing economic interdependence. Japan's perception of China shifted from a recipient of aid to a regional rival, especially evident during the Taiwan missile crisis in 1995-1996. This led to growing suspicions between Tokyo and Beijing, with China viewing itself as a replacement focus of the U.S.-Japan alliance. The alliance, strengthened after the crisis, raised concerns in China about a shift in focus away from the Soviet Union. In 1996, China became concerned about a shift in the U.S.-Japan alliance's focus towards Taiwan's status and broader regional security issues. Tensions persisted until a period of d\u00e9tente in 2006. The current controversy over Taiwan's status is partly a legacy issue from Japan's history. The controversy over Taiwan's status stems from Japan's historical involvement, including acquiring the island after the Sino-Japanese War and its occupation during World War II. The Allied Powers' decision to strip Japan of its Pacific islands, including Taiwan, was outlined in the Cairo Declaration of 1943. After Japan's defeat in World War II, Taiwan and the Pescadores were assigned to the Republic of China for post-war occupation as per the Cairo Declaration. The 1951 Treaty of Peace with Japan stated that Japan renounced all claims to Formosa and the Pescadores, but did not address Taiwan's sovereign status. The Treaty of Peace with Japan in 1951 did not specify Taiwan's sovereignty, leading to future controversy. Japan showed independence from the U.S. by imposing sanctions on China after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989. This included suspending a $5.57 billion loan program and withdrawing Japanese experts from China. Despite the threat of severe sanctions, Japan's concessional loan program was not set to begin until April 1990. Japanese officials downplayed their actions towards China, with Prime Minister Sosuke Uno calling sanctions \"impolite.\" Japan also criticized the US for punitive measures against China and worked to moderate the G-7 countries' stance on China at the 1990 economic summit in Houston. Tensions between Japan and China have historically centered on Japan's wartime history and differing perceptions of it. China and Japan have historical tensions over Japan's wartime history, with China criticizing Japan's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine and its history textbooks. Despite this, the two countries have seen a shift towards economic interdependence. Despite historical tensions, Japan and China have shifted towards economic interdependence, with Japanese leaders aiming to improve relations following a hostile period under Koizumi. Tokyo seeks better ties with China for trade benefits, despite concerns about China's military modernization. The need to avoid bilateral tension to prevent armed conflict, such as in the Senkaku/Diaoyutai islands, is also recognized by security specialists. China's economic interests benefit from cooperation with Japan on various issues like trade, investment, and environmental protection. However, some believe that PRC leaders may be trying to influence Japan's relationship with the U.S. or make it harder for Tokyo to make decisions. China may be trying to influence Japan's relationship with the U.S. by creating decision dilemmas for Tokyo. The visits of high-level Japanese officials to the Yasukuni Shrine have been a divisive issue between Japan and China, with the shrine honoring Japanese soldiers, including Class A war criminals. Chinese and other Asian leaders criticize Japanese leaders for paying respects at Yasukuni Shrine, which honors war dead including war criminals. The visits have been a point of contention in Japan-China relations since the enshrinement of war criminals in 1978. Several Japanese prime ministers have visited the shrine, leading to objections from neighboring countries. Abe's low-profile visit to Yasukuni before becoming prime minister led to improved relations with China. His successor, Yasuo Fukuda, pledged not to visit the shrine, which was praised by Chinese leaders. Japanese politicians now avoid provoking Beijing by visiting Yasukuni, with Prime Minister Taro Aso suggesting the emperor should visit instead. Taro Aso suggested the emperor visit the shrine and defended politicians' visits, but as Prime Minister, he would not pay respects at Yasukuni. He has supported transforming Yasukuni into a secular institution. Ichiro Ozawa criticized past visits due to the impact on China relations. The strained relations between Japan and China were evident in top-level leaders' visits, with Chinese President Jiang Zemin scolding Japanese officials in 1998. Koizumi's tenure saw limited official summits between Chinese and Japanese leaders. During Koizumi's tenure, Chinese and Japanese leaders did not have official summits. Chinese leaders indicated they would resume summits if Koizumi stopped visiting Yasukuni Shrine. Abe and Fukuda made efforts to improve ties, with Abe visiting Beijing in 2006 and Fukuda warmly welcomed in 2007. The d\u00e9tente peaked with Hu Jintao's visit to Japan in 2008, heavy on symbolism but light on substance. The Chinese and Japanese leaders emphasized a \"forward-looking\" friendship, agreeing on annual summits, environmental technology cooperation, and cultural exchanges. A consensus was reached on joint oil exploration in the East China Sea, seen as a significant improvement in Sino-Japanese relations. This agreement allowed Japan to participate in energy development without requiring the PRC to accept Japan's claims in the disputed area. The East China Sea agreement between China and Japan allows for joint oil exploration in a disputed area without requiring the PRC to accept Japan's claims. However, potential obstacles could hinder future progress, as both countries have different interpretations of the agreement, particularly regarding the nature of the development project and revenue sharing. The East China Sea agreement between China and Japan allows for joint oil exploration in a disputed area without requiring the PRC to accept Japan's claims. However, future cooperation will need to navigate nationalistic sentiments and unresolved sovereignty issues. PRC nationalist sentiments surged after the East China Sea agreement, leading to protests and online criticism of officials. Japan provided $10 million in aid and sent rescue experts and medical personnel to help after a devastating earthquake in Sichuan province in 2008. The assistance was welcomed by the Chinese people in the quake zone. The Japanese aid in response to the earthquake in China was met with gratitude, but historical sensitivities affected the delivery of aid. Plans for Japanese military planes to carry supplies were shelved due to fears of a negative reaction. Despite past tensions, any improvements in defense relations between China and Japan are significant. Since 2007, military relations between China and Japan have improved, with reciprocal port visits by warships and high-level meetings. Despite these advancements, there are limitations to how far military exchanges can progress, especially in the public eye. The China-Japan economic relationship is dynamic and important, combining the world's second-largest economy (Japan) with one of the fastest-growing economies (China). Both countries are significant holders of foreign exchange reserves, with implications for East Asia and the global economy. The economic relationship between China and Japan is crucial for East Asia and the world, including the United States. Despite political volatility, their economic ties have provided stability and incentive for better relations. Over the last two decades, their economic relationship has deepened and become more complex, evolving from the legacies of World War II and the Cold War. The economic relationship between China and Japan has evolved significantly since the Cold War, with China's economic reforms in the late 1970s opening up its economy to foreign trade and investment. Despite periods of turmoil, the economic ties between the two countries have stabilized in recent years, leading to closer economic integration. Comparing their economies, China has experienced faster growth than Japan. China's economy has grown faster than Japan's, with a 9.5% annual growth rate compared to Japan's 1.2% from 1997-2007. In 2007, China's GDP was $3.2 trillion, surpassing Japan's $4.4 trillion in nominal terms. However, when measured by purchasing power parity, China's GDP was $7.3 trillion compared to Japan's $4.3 trillion. Despite this, China still has a lower per capita GDP compared to Japan, indicating it has room to catch up in terms of standard of living. China's per capita GDP is $5,480 in PPP terms, far below Japan's $33,630. China also has a higher unemployment rate of 9.2% compared to Japan's 3.8%. Labor costs in China are much lower at $1.73/hour, while Japan's is $19.59/hour. This economic complementarity shapes the bilateral economic relationship between the two countries. China-Japan trade saw significant growth from 1980 to 2007, with Chinese imports from Japan and Japanese exports to China increasing notably. By 2007, China had become Japan's largest import source, accounting for 20.6% of imports, while also being the second largest export market for Japan, making up 15.3% of exports. This tightening trade relationship reflects their increasing importance to each other as trading partners. China-Japan trade relationship has evolved over the years, with Japan being China's largest import source in 1995 but declining to 14.0% by 2007. Similarly, Japan's share of Chinese exports decreased from 19.1% to 8.4% during the same period. Japan also moved from being the second most important export market to the third, behind the United States and Hong Kong. The commodity composition of China-Japan trade has shifted over time, reflecting changes in their trading relationship. In the early 1980s, China's exports to Japan shifted from raw materials to manufactured goods. By 2000, manufactured goods accounted for 82.1% of exports, reflecting the growth of Chinese manufacturing. The types of products imported from China also changed, with a decline in low-skilled labor-intensive goods and an increase in technology-advanced products. In 1994, technology-advanced goods like machinery and electrical machinery accounted for 8.6% of Japanese imports from China, increasing to 36.6% by 2007. Japan's exports to China mainly consist of electrical machinery and machinery, making up 44.5% in 2007. Japanese exports to China include parts like integrated circuits, car parts, and digital camera components assembled in China by foreign-owned firms, including Japanese firms. Japanese exports to China include iron and steel products, cars, and organic chemicals. Bilateral trade in services between Japan and China has significantly increased, with Japan's exports to China slightly exceeding imports in 2006. This trend is expected to continue as China's economy advances. Increased Japanese foreign investment in China has become a significant element of the China-Japan economic relationship. China has opened up to foreign investment in the last decade, with foreign-invested firms in China playing a major role in Chinese exports and imports. Japanese investors were initially hesitant due to political instability and government restrictions, but investments picked up in the 1980s and 1990s due to Chinese economic reforms. In the early 1990s, Japanese producers shifted production to China and other East Asian countries due to increased labor costs in Japan. FDI flows dipped between 1995 and 1999 due to Chinese restrictions and economic changes. Japanese FDI in China has since soared, making Japan the second largest source of FDI in China with $61.2 billion in investments. Japanese FDI in China has decreased since 2006 due to higher investment costs and increased country risk. Foreign-owned companies in China, including Japanese-owned ones, play a significant role in trade between the two countries. In 2006, around 70% of imports by foreign-owned firms in China were mechanical and electrical products. In 2006, 63% of exports by foreign-owned companies in China were machinery and transportation equipment, indicating assembly of parts into finished goods for export. The trade and foreign investment between China and Japan have benefitted both countries, with China shifting from low-skilled production to exports of machinery and transportation equipment, and Japanese producers benefiting from lower production costs in China. However, concerns in Japan exist about the \"hollowing out\" of Japan's manufacturing base due to production relocation to China. The relocation of production to China has led to concerns about the \"hollowing out\" of Japan's manufacturing base. As Chinese labor becomes more skilled and local firms adapt foreign technology, they are becoming more competitive. China and Japan are members of major trade and financial organizations, providing avenues for cooperation and rules for bilateral trade. They also participate in groups like ASEAN+3 and support the formation of an East Asian FTA. China and Japan are using FTAs as vehicles to compete. China and Japan are using FTAs to compete for influence in the region, particularly with ASEAN. China initiated a China-ASEAN FTA in 2001, followed by Japan in 2002. Negotiations for FTAs with ASEAN are currently stalled due to resistance on key issues like intellectual property rights and government procurement. Japan aims to establish commercial ties and secure access for investments, while China's motives in FTAs are not specified. China and Japan are using FTAs to compete for influence in the region, with China aiming to expand its political influence and Japan seeking to establish commercial ties and secure investments. A sign of enhanced cooperation occurred in December 2008 when the leaders of China, Japan, and South Korea met to address issues related to the global financial crisis. The meeting resulted in agreements to increase credit lines to South Korea. Maintaining strong relations between Japan and China contributes to stability in the Asia-Pacific, benefiting U.S. interests by fostering trade and prosperity. Prospects for success in regional initiatives, such as the Six-Party Talks, are better if Chinese-Japanese tension is avoided. Chinese accommodation of Japanese interests in regional organizations can promote shared democratic values with the United States and Japan. Japan, along with Australia, is a reliable U.S. ally in Asian fora, with aligned interests with Washington. The threat of Japan moving closer to Beijing due to Sino-Japanese ties appears small at this point. Better communication between Tokyo and Beijing may help diffuse territorial issues and minimize potential military clashes. The U.S. military may need to decide whether to intervene on Japan's behalf in the event of armed conflict over disputed territories. Former officials have given mixed answers on U.S. involvement, with differing views on the U.S.-Japan treaty's extension to the Senkaku Islands. The U.S. government officially does not take a position on the sovereignty of the islands. The determination to bring China into the international system is apparent. The United States faces a question on mediating the Sino-Japanese relationship and how to address U.S.-China-Japan relations in balance-of-power terms. Some analysts warn of the danger of U.S. officials getting involved in historical issues with no easy resolution. Views differ on China's growing power and the U.S. role in the evolving relationship. President Bush mentioned concerns about tension with China over Yasukuni Shrine visits to Koizumi in 2006, but overall, the U.S. has not been very active in the relationship. Some in the United States view China's growing power as a threat to U.S. interests, believing that Beijing aims to erode or replace U.S. international influence. They suggest countering China's strategy by not mediating between Japan and China, but rather empowering Japan to make independent policy choices. Some in the United States believe that China's growing power threatens U.S. interests and suggest empowering Japan to counterbalance Chinese influence. Strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance is seen as crucial in dealing with China's rise. China and Japan are crucial to the U.S. economy, with Japan being the second largest national economy and China among the fastest-growing. Both countries are significant trade partners for the U.S., with China and Japan being the second and fourth largest holders of U.S. government debt. Their role in financing the U.S. national debt is increasingly important. The U.S. national debt is a significant factor, especially as it rises after the global financial crisis. Japan and China hold the largest foreign exchange reserves globally, impacting global capital markets. Their economic relationship could have implications for the U.S., presenting both opportunities and challenges. Promoting trade liberalization and foreign investment could lead to economic growth and opportunities for U.S. firms. The United States and Japan aim to encourage China to fulfill its WTO commitments, enforce intellectual property rights, ensure product safety, and welcome foreign investment. The bilateral economic relationship could potentially harm U.S. interests if excluding U.S. exporters and investors. Some U.S. firms fear that the economic ties between China and Japan may give Japanese producers a competitive edge by utilizing low-wage Chinese labor. Regional analysts are cautiously optimistic about Sino-Japanese relations, citing emotional history issues as a potential source of instability. In a notable incident, Japan's Chief of Staff was fired for praising Japan's role in World War II, signaling Tokyo's commitment to maintaining positive relations with Beijing. The Japanese government's official position of remorse for war-time suffering may be challenged by public sentiment, political groups, and the military. Concerns about the safety of Chinese products were renewed after a toxic pesticide was found in imported meat dumplings. Some in Japan criticize the government for being too \"soft\" on Beijing, while anti-Japanese sentiment in China hinders reconciliation efforts. In 2007, there was public outcry over the proposed national bird choice. There was public outcry over the proposed official choice of a national bird, the Red-Crowned Crane, at the 2008 East Asian Cup games. Chinese fans booed the Japan team during the Japanese national anthem, leading to burning of the Japanese flag after Japan defeated China. Unofficial ties between Japan and Taiwan have remained strong despite periodic disputes, especially during former President Lee Teng-hui's term. The Tokyo-Taipei relationship has not been affected by Japan's historical legacy in Asia. Taiwan is a potential factor in the U.S.-Japan alliance, with Japan recognizing the PRC over Taiwan. However, Tokyo could be drawn into a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan due to hosting U.S. military facilities. Taiwan also plays a role in Sino-Japan territorial disputes, including claims over the Senkaku and Ryukyu Islands in the East China Sea. Claims to the Senkakus date back to the 14th century, with Taiwan and the PRC both asserting ownership based on historical and political reasons. This has led to tensions and conflicts, such as a 2008 incident involving a Taiwanese fishing boat and a Japanese patrol boat near the islands. Taiwan strongly protested, highlighting the complex dynamics between Japan, China, and Taiwan in territorial disputes. The incident involving a collision near the Senkaku/Diaoyutais led to Taiwan recalling its envoy to Japan and asserting sovereignty over the islands. This strained relations with China, which also claims the territory. The United States chose not to intervene in the dispute. Japan's claim to the islands dates back to 1895, and the US assumed control over them after World War II. In 1953, the United States included the Senkaku/Diaoyutais under its control in the Ryukyu Islands. The Okinawa Reversion Treaty in 1971 returned the islands to Japan, involving the U.S. in the ongoing disputes. The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty suggests a U.S. response to an attack on the islands. Sino-Japanese conflicts also involve valuable oil and gas fields. Disputes over territorial claims have persisted since the 1990s. Since the 1990s, there have been ongoing clashes over territorial claims in the region. Chinese vessels have entered disputed areas for marine research and mineral exploration, leading to tensions with Japan. Incidents like warning shots fired at Japanese ships and fighter jets entering Japan's air identification zone have escalated the conflict. The occupation of Mischief Reef in the South China Sea by China in 1995 further heightened Japanese suspicions. The Japanese government has had to address the actions of right-wing groups who have been marking and erecting structures on the Senkaku/Diaoyutai islands, sometimes in response to Chinese ship traffic. Beijing sees these actions as provocations and has protested to Japan, who claims limited interference in citizens' activities. Despite progress in Sino-Japanese relations, mutual suspicion remains in defense communities, with reports of naval incursions. Japanese press reports repeated Chinese naval incursions into Japanese territorial waters, sparking concerns in defense communities of both countries. Incidents have occurred around disputed islands, with Japan worried about China's military modernization and lack of transparency. China, in turn, is alarmed by Japan's military ambitions and upgrades. Increased cooperation between Japan's military and other regional militaries, including the United States, Australia, and India, has raised concerns in China about strategic encirclement. Despite diplomatic meetings and military exercises, wariness on both sides remains a significant obstacle to genuine cooperation between China and Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni shrine, which honors war criminals, angers China and South Korea. Chinese Ambassador Wu Dawei criticizes Japan for various issues, including issuing a visa to former Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui. Koizumi later meets with Chinese President Jiang Zemin to address concerns over Japan's military policies. Koizumi's visit to Yasukuni Shrine angers China, leading to diplomatic tensions. China expresses dissatisfaction and protests by delaying visits and calls between the two countries. Cabinet members pay respects at the shrine on WWII surrender anniversary, while Koizumi visits a national memorial instead. On 11/15/02, Hu Jintao becomes President of China.

On 3/30/04, Chinese activists land on Uotsuri Island, leading to a sovereignty dispute with Japan. On 8/7/04, China and Japan face off in the Asia Cup final, with Chinese fans burning Japanese flags. China and Japan face off in the Asia Cup final, with Chinese fans burning Japanese flags and shouting insults. Japan wins 3-1, leading to riots and weeping Chinese fans. A Chinese nuclear submarine enters Japanese waters near Okinawa, sparking a two-day chase. Japan accuses China of violating its sovereign rights and demands an apology. Beijing expresses regret, citing a technical error. Koizumi and Hu meet. 11/21/04 \u2014 Koizumi and Hu meet in a Japan-China summit in Santiago, Chile, agreeing to develop economic and cultural ties and make efforts for multilateral talks on North Korea's nuclear ambitions. 1/6/05 \u2014 Japan grants Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui a visit despite protests from China. 4/5/05 \u2014 Japan approves new textbooks that China criticizes for glossing over Japan's WWII record, leading to anti-Japan demonstrations in China. In April 2005, anti-Japan demonstrations erupted in various Chinese cities, with protestors attacking Japanese-owned stores and boycotting Japanese products. The protests culminated in Hu and Koizumi meeting to address the escalating tensions. In April 2005, anti-Japan demonstrations erupted in Chinese cities. Hu and Koizumi meet at the Asian-African summit in Indonesia to improve relations. Koizumi apologizes for Japan's WWII aggression. Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi cancels a meeting with Koizumi due to remarks on Yasukuni Shrine. Japanese ministers criticize the cancellation. Chinese naval vessels are seen near the Chunxiao gas field. Koizumi visits Yasukuni Shrine for the fifth time. In October 2005, Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine for the fifth time sparked protests from China, South Korea, and other Asian countries. China canceled Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura's visit in response. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei stated that future Sino-Japanese summits would be difficult due to Koizumi's shrine visit. Past visits to Yasukuni have halted meetings between Japanese and Chinese leaders in their respective countries. Japan delays decision on further yen loans to China due to worsening relations. Shinzo Abe becomes Prime Minister, Chinese submarine near USS Kitty Hawk, Abe's ice-breaking trip to Beijing, first meeting between Chinese and Japanese leaders in five years.
