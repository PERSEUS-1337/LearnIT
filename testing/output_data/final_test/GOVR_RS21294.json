    "content": "Unmanned vehicles (UVs) are a crucial part of U.S. defense transformation, particularly within the Department of the Navy (DON). The DON aims to acquire various types of UVs, including unmanned air systems (UASs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The FY2001 defense authorization act set goals for the fielding of unmanned technology in the Armed Forces by specific timelines. In 2015, one-third of ground combat vehicles are unmanned. The Navy's N-UCAS program aims to acquire a UAS for carrier-based operations by 2021. The program was initiated as the UCAV-N program in collaboration with DARPA. The Department of Defense merged the Air Force and Navy UCAV programs into a Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) program. Management of J-UCAS was transferred to a joint Air Force-Navy office in 2005, and in 2006, it was restructured into a Navy-oriented UCAV program. The Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance UAS (BAMS UAS) program aims to acquire an unmanned maritime ISR system to work with the Navy's P-8 Multi-Mission Aircraft. The Navy's BAMS UAS program aims to acquire unmanned maritime ISR systems, including Global Hawk and Predator UAV variants. The first BAMS UASs are planned for procurement in FY2011, with additional purchases in FY2012 and FY2013. The program also includes the Fire Scout VTUAV for use on LCSs. The Navy's aircraft procurement plan includes acquiring Scouts in FY2006 and FY2007, with increasing numbers in subsequent years. The Fire Scout system is planned to be improved with the COBRA mine countermeasures payload. The Tactical Control System is being evaluated for use in BAMS UAS and STUAS programs. STUAS is a program initiated in FY2008 for persistent ISR operations in support of the global war on terrorism. The Navy and Marine Corps aim to have STUAS enter service in FY2010 for the global war on terrorism. The Marine Corps organizes UAS acquisition into three tiers, with Tier I supporting small-unit commanders and Tier II supporting higher-level commanders. The Marine Corps currently operates over 100 Tier I systems and plans for STUAS to be its new Tier II system. Boeing/Insitu is the current contractor for filling Tier II UAS needs in Iraq until STUAS enters service in FY2010. The Marine Corps is transitioning from the Pioneer Tier III UAS to the Vertical UAS (VUAS) and is developing requirements for the program. They are also updating the ground control system to align with the Army's \"One System\" GCS. The Navy is working on a new USV master plan. The Navy is developing a new USV master plan, including the Remote Minehunting System (RMS) and Spartan Scout USV program for mine warfare and antisubmarine warfare. ONR is working on two USV prototypes for future options. Deployment of Spartan Scout USV has been accelerated. The Navy accelerated deployment of Spartan, the first system deployed in October 2003. The Navy's 2005 UUV master plan outlines nine high-priority missions for Navy UUVs, emphasizing commonality, modularity, and open-architecture designs. Navy UUVs are categorized into Man-portable UUVs and Lightweight vehicles for various missions such as ISR, mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, and communication/navigation network nodes. The Navy is developing different types of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for various missions, including harbor ISR, oceanography, mine countermeasures, and special operations. These UUVs range from lightweight vehicles to large vehicles, with different diameters and weights. The Navy is using its existing UUV systems to support the development of the Mission-Reconfigurable UUV System (MRUUVS) for mine countermeasures and ISR missions in denied areas. The Navy is developing the Large-Displacement, Mission-Reconfigurable UUV System (LD-MRUUVS) for mine countermeasures and ISR missions in denied areas. The system will be used for launching from submarines, LCSs, and amphibious ships to conduct multiple missions, including mine countermeasures, delivery of payloads for special operations forces, persistent ISR, and limited ASW. The Navy plans to develop and field Surface Mine Countermeasure (SMCM) UUV Systems for older Avenger class mine countermeasures ships and LCSs. The Navy plans to develop and field Increment 1 and Increment 2 versions of the SMCM UUV for operational evaluation, with an Increment 3 version as a heavyweight-class UUV for LCSs. The BPUAV is a 21-inch AUV with sonar for mine detection on LCSs. The SAHRV is a man-portable vehicle for Navy SEALs for hydrographic reconnaissance in shallow waters. The SAHRV has achieved Full Operational Capability (FOC) for NSW forces in the War on Terror. The Navy plans to enhance its capabilities. The Armored Breaching Vehicle (ABV) is undergoing testing for breaching minefields. The Gladiator is a wheeled UGV for armed reconnaissance and breaching operations. The Gladiator UGV was recently removed from System Design and Development, but the revised system development continues at Carnegie Mellon University. The MarcBot IV and Talon UGVs are used for reconnaissance and explosive ordnance disposal, with new designs in progress. The FIDO-PackBot is a UGV equipped with an explosive vapor detector for detecting IEDs. Potential issues for Congress regarding naval UVs include implications for naval ships and manned aircraft, and the restructuring of the J-UCAS program. The Department of the Navy's proposed FY2008 budget for Navy and Marine Corps UV programs was submitted to Congress in February 2007, raising questions about the restructuring of the J-UCAS program and coordination between Marine Corps' UAV and UGV programs."
