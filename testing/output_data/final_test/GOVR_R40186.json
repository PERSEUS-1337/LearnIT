Its potential includes selling carbon offsets, improving soil conservation, increasing crop yield, and producing renewable energy. Research is ongoing to ensure successful implementation in U.S. agriculture and forestry sectors. Biochar is a soil supplement that sequesters carbon, curtails greenhouse gas emissions, and benefits agricultural producers. Its use in the United States is currently limited to small-scale applications. Modern biochar production is based on an ancient Amazon technique, terra preta, and is formed from plant and crop residues or animal manure under pyrolysis conditions. Biochar production via pyrolysis is a carbon-negative process that sequesters carbon and enhances soil fertility. The process depends on feedstock, temperature, and processing time. Outputs include syngas, bio-oil, and biochar, with potential environmental benefits when used as a soil amendment or energy source. Biochar provides environmental benefits such as carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emission reduction, and improved soil fertility. Studies show that biochar can sequester around 50% of carbon from biomass feedstock, with the remaining carbon released during pyrolysis. Precise estimates of carbon sequestration from biochar application are limited, but it has the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon in the soil for long periods. Biochar can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly nitrous oxide, by up to 40%. It also retains nutrients for plant uptake and improves soil fertility. Land-applying biochar can lead to greater greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to combusting it for energy purposes. Biochar retains nutrients for plant uptake and soil fertility, limiting harmful nutrient infiltration and soil erosion runoff. It could positively impact developing countries with abundant plant material feedstock and agricultural soil replenishment needs, potentially increasing crop yields. Concerns in the United States include feedstock availability, biochar handling, and system deployment, requiring affordability and compatibility with current farming practices. The use of biochar as a soil amendment is beneficial for plant growth and soil fertility. Research suggests that manure-based biochar could be a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to plant-derived feedstock. Further exploration is needed to understand the advantages of using manure in biochar production and its potential impact on soil health. The spreading of biochar as a soil amendment raises questions about application timing, retention, and safety. Concerns include potential risks to human health and air quality from particulate matter if mishandled. Public safety issues arise due to biochar's flammability. The need for tailored biochar systems based on feedstock and energy requirements is emphasized, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Mass-produced biochar systems for specific agricultural or forestry needs could be feasible. Extensive deployment of biochar systems in specific agriculture or forestry communities depends on system costs, operation time, collaboration with utility providers, and technology reliability. Carbon offsets, including carbon sequestration projects like biochar production, were significant in the climate change debate in the 111th Congress. Congress may also consider biological sequestration methods like biochar technology for carbon capture. Biochar production technology can be implemented by agricultural producers at the field level. Congress may examine biochar as an indirect carbon sequestration technology to offset emissions from major emitters. In 2008, 6% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were from the agricultural sector. Some argue that soil carbon sequestered from biochar application is easily quantifiable and transparent, making it ideal for carbon trading requirements. The Water Efficiency via Carbon Harvesting and Restoration (WECHAR) Act of 2009 aimed to establish loan guarantee programs for biochar technology and demonstration projects on public lands, primarily focused on woody biomass feedstock. The legislation addressed research and development in biochar production. The discussion draft of the American Power Act during the 111th Congress included provisions for biochar production and use under the domestic offsets program. The legislation aimed to address research and development needs for biochar production, but some argued it lacked specific actions for technology transfer and commercial development of biochar systems. The EPA was instructed to report on black carbon emissions and strategies to reduce them, including research on biochar techniques for decreasing emissions and improving agricultural production. The 110th Congress promoted biochar development through the 2008 farm bill, listing it under grants for High Priority Research and Extension Areas. Research areas include biochar production, co-production with bioenergy, soil enhancements, and soil carbon sequestration. Funding for biochar development research would be determined in future appropriation bills and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Department of Agriculture supports biochar production for soil fertility, energy efficiency, and climate change mitigation. Further research and development are needed for practical application across the United States. Policy encouraging academia to conduct research could accelerate technology deployment. A national field trial program funded at $100 million-$150 million for eight years could support research, development, and deployment of commercial-scale biochar production. An assessment of external factors associated with economic growth, similar to studies for the biofuels industry, could guide federal incentives. The definition of biomass in climate change and energy legislation will impact biochar's GHG emissions reduction. USDA officials emphasize the importance of defining acceptable biomass sources and eligible lands for biomass removal. The USDA's Agricultural Research Service spent $2.6 million in 2010 on biochar research. They are conducting various projects to determine biochar's effectiveness as a soil amendment under different conditions. The US could potentially sequester 139 Tg of carbon annually by pyrolyzing 1.3 billion tons of biomass."
