    "content": "The Act titled \"Airline Bankruptcy Passenger Protection Act of 1993\" amends the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 to include a new section on bankruptcy transportation plans. The Secretary shall issue an order allowing covered air carriers to develop a plan for providing air transportation for passengers who become debtors after purchasing tickets, with a submission deadline of 180 days. If the Secretary approves a plan submitted by covered air carriers for protecting persons with airline tickets, it must be implemented by all carriers involved. Carriers who did not participate in the plan's development will be treated the same as those who did. If a plan for protecting persons with airline tickets is not submitted or disapproved, the Secretary will issue regulations for all covered air carriers to provide air transportation. Regulations must be issued within 90 days if the plan is not implemented satisfactorily. The term 'airline ticket' refers to a written contract of carriage between a covered air carrier and a passenger for air transportation. A covered air carrier is defined as an air carrier that primarily provides air transportation with aircraft seating for more than 60 passengers and enplaned more than .2 percent of total passengers in the previous 12 months. The term 'airline ticket' refers to a contract between a covered air carrier and a passenger for air transportation. An air carrier not described in subparagraph (A) can use a single air carrier designator code with another carrier for transportation operations not covered in subparagraph (A). The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Transportation. Sec. 420 outlines bankruptcy transportation plans including development, time limits for approval, implementation, regulations, and definitions."
