    "content": "The Act titled \"Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of addressing findings related to firearms. The Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act of 1999 addresses findings related to firearms, including the commercial nature of firearms, interstate trafficking, the costs of gun violence, and the impact on society. The Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act of 1999 aims to hold manufacturers, dealers, and importers accountable for the costs of gun violence, which are difficult to trace between intrastate and interstate commerce. The evolving laws on liability for gun violence create inconsistencies among states, burdening interstate commerce and hindering adequate compensation for the costs incurred. The Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act of 1999 aims to regulate interstate commerce by removing barriers to commerce and holding manufacturers, dealers, and importers liable for gun violence under Federal law. The Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act of 1999 aims to regulate interstate commerce by regulating firearms trafficking, protecting various entities from the negative effects of interstate gun commerce, establishing liability for manufacturers, dealers, and importers in cases of gun violence, and improving fairness in the civil justice system. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nGun violence refers to the unlawful use or accidental discharge of a firearm. Terms like firearm, importer, manufacturer, and dealer are defined in section 921 of title 18, United States Code. The term \"State\" includes various regions within the United States, while a \"unit of local government\" refers to political subdivisions like cities, counties, and villages. SEC. 4. FEDERAL CAUSE OF ACTION. A State, organization, business, or person affected by gun violence can sue a manufacturer, dealer, or importer for damages in Federal or State court. Remedies may include actual and punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and other appropriate relief."
