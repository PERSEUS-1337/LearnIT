    "content": "Federal agency funding for homeland security R&D in FY2007 was requested at $5.1 billion, with top supporters being DHHS (NIH) at 40%, DHS at 23%, and DOD at 21%. Other funding agencies include NSF, USDA, EPA, NASA, DOE, and DOC. DHHS (NIH) leads civilian efforts against bioterrorism, while DHS focuses on technology projects for countermeasures against WMD in FY2007. In FY2007, federal agencies focused on homeland security R&D, with DOD emphasizing countermeasures against WMD. Other agencies like USDA, NSF, EPA, and DOC also contributed to R&D efforts in areas such as emergency preparedness, cybersecurity, and protection of critical infrastructures. DOE's past R&D included work on materials, detection of toxic agents, and genomic sequencing. NASA's R&D focused on aviation security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established DHS and a Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) responsible for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) in areas such as aviation safety and remote sensing. The Under Secretary for S&T coordinates DHS's S&T missions, sets national R&D priorities to prevent CBRN weapons and terrorist attacks, and collaborates with other agencies for R&D efforts. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established DHS and a Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) responsible for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) in various areas. DHS collaborates with national laboratories, USDA, and DHHS to identify biological \"select agents,\" develop technology transfer guidelines, and support U.S. S&T leadership. Title III transferred programs in chemical and biological security R&D, nuclear detection, assessment, and materials protection, environmental research, and advanced scientific computing to DHS. DHS also incorporates a National Bio-Weapons Defense Analysis Center and USDA's Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Coast Guard and TSA R&D are now under DHS. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established DHS and a Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) responsible for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) in various areas. R&D are now located within DHS. Title III authorized the establishment of the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) to support applications-oriented, innovative RDT&E in industry, FFRDCs, and universities. The law mandated the creation of university-based centers of excellence for homeland security, with five multi-year awards made for centers focusing on various aspects of terrorism and preparedness. DHS and EPA fund cooperative centers for advancing microbial risk assessment and computational challenges for homeland security. DHS also supports a university fellowship/training program and may establish a headquarters laboratory to \"network\" federal laboratories. The Homeland Security Institute conducts risk analysis and policy research on critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and security. DHS established the Interagency Center for Applied Homeland Security Technology (ICAHST) to validate technical requirements and conduct threat assessments. The DHS Secretary was granted special acquisitions authority for R&D. Rules were issued for liability protection for manufacturers of anti-terrorism technologies under the SAFETY Act. The DHS established the Interagency Center for Applied Homeland Security Technology (ICAHST) to validate technical requirements and conduct threat assessments. The DHS Secretary was granted special acquisitions authority for R&D. Rules were issued for liability protection for manufacturers of anti-terrorism technologies under the SAFETY Act. Additionally, the Cyber Security Research and Development Act authorized $903 million over five years for NSF and NIST R&D programs to combat terrorist attacks on computers. The FY2007 budget increased R&D support for explosives countermeasures, interoperable communications, and cybersecurity. The FY2007 budget increased R&D funding for biological countermeasures, explosives countermeasures, DNDO, rapid prototyping, and critical infrastructure. The Office of Science and Technology Policy advises the President on homeland security and recommends federal R&D budgets. The Director chairs the National Security Council's Preparedness Against Weapons of Mass Destruction R&D Subgroup. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) manages interagency efforts to set R&D priorities in various areas related to national security, including bioterrorism prevention, border control technology, and information security. This includes working with the President's Critical Infrastructure Board and the President's Critical Infrastructure Board to recommend priorities and budgets for information security R&D. Additionally, OSTP collaborates with the DHHS on bioterrorism prevention, preparedness, and response efforts. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 involves the DHHS and DOD Secretaries, as well as the Homeland Security Council (HSC) for policy guidance. Former DHS Under Secretary McQueary testified about coordinating U.S. government R&D relevant to the Department's mission. GAO issued a report in 2006 on Plum Island, highlighting successful coordination between DHS and USDA in current work but assessing long-term plans. Controversial issues in DHS's R&D include preventing conflicts of interest in awarding funds. Conflicts of interest in awarding R&D funds at DHS S&T due to managers hired from national laboratories, undocumented decisions, lack of detailed information on priority setting and budgeting, monitoring HSARPA's mission, assessing technology procurement waste, improving S&T effectiveness, and developing priorities meeting responder needs. The DHS S&T Directorate is working on improving its effectiveness by setting S&T priorities that meet responder needs, monitoring cybersecurity R&D adequacy, and enhancing coordination between agencies. The Acting Inspector General highlighted the need for better integration of threat assessment information and inter-agency coordination. Executive Order 13311 transferred responsibilities to DHS for protecting sensitive unclassified homeland security information. DHS issued guidance for its information control procedures but has not yet released it. The House passed H.R. 1817, a DHS authorization bill, during the 109th Congress, which would have required the creation of a Technology Clearinghouse and a working group to advise on relevant military technologies. It also aimed to assess DHS procurements for litigation and risk management protections and establish a university center of excellence for border security. The Homeland Security Committee reported two bills in June 2006. H.R. 4941, the Homeland Security S&T Enhancement Act, aimed to transfer anti-terrorism technology, develop standards for first-responder communications equipment, and create a strategic plan for S&T activities. H.R. 4942, the Promoting Anti-Terrorism Capabilities Through International Cooperation Act, focused on supporting DHS's S&T Directorate. The Promoting Anti-Terrorism Capabilities Through International Cooperation Act, reported and approved in September 2006, aimed to support homeland security R&D with U.S. allies. H.R. 5814, an authorization bill from July 2006, focused on streamlining SAFETY Act procedures, enhancing biosurveillance systems, and creating an assistant secretary for cybersecurity."
