    "content": "Azerbaijan gained independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Abulfaz Elchibey became president but was overthrown in 1992. Heydar Aliyev, a former communist party head, mediated a crisis in 1993 and was elected chairman of the National. Heydar Aliyev replaced Elchibey as president of Azerbaijan in 1993 after a national referendum. A ceasefire agreement was signed in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in July 1994. Heydar Aliyev served until 2003 when his son Ilkham Aliyev took over as president. The Azerbaijani constitution, approved in 1995, strengthened presidential power and established a 125-member legislature. After the 2003 presidential election in Azerbaijan, protests erupted over alleged vote rigging, leading to violence and government detentions of opposition party members. Trials resulted in prison sentences, with concerns raised about evidence obtained through torture. President Aliyev pardoned 114 prisoners, including political prisoners. In 2008, changes to the electoral code were approved by the legislature, some recommended by the Venice Commission. The Venice Commission recommended changes to the electoral code in Azerbaijan, but some suggestions were ignored. The opposition boycotted the election due to unfair laws and media constraints. President Aliyev won with 89% of the vote, but election monitors noted procedural shortcomings and manipulation. The next presidential election is scheduled for October 2013. The proposed constitutional amendments in Azerbaijan were approved in a referendum in 2009, with criticism from some opposition parties. Municipal elections in December 2009 were marred by interference in the candidate registration process, as reported by opposition parties and election monitors. In November 2010, Azerbaijan held a constituency-based election for its 125-member Milli Majlis. The Council of Europe delegation criticized shortcomings in the election process, including issues with voter counting, ballot paper legibility, and vote count reliability. The ruling New Azerbaijan Party (NAP) had all its prospective candidates accepted, while many candidates from other parties were rejected. Oppositionists criticized a law approved in June 2010, which required the legislature to coordinate its agenda with the presidential administration, as further evidence of executive branch control. The ruling New Azerbaijan Party (NAP) approved 690 candidates, impacting opposition's ability to field candidates. NAP had candidates in 111 constituencies, while the opposition PFP-Musavat bloc only had candidates in 38. 387 candidates were self-nominated or nominated by voter groups, with most independents historically supporting NAP. Media and campaign laws favored NAP's dominance in the legislature. Restrictions on media, assembly, and campaign laws limited opposition parties' ability to counter ruling party claims. Opposition parties failed to unite and ran separately. Despite some economic stresses, rising incomes may have contributed to support for the ruling party. OSCE reported restrictions on campaign environment and voting process, including shortened campaign days and elimination of public financing. Restrictions on media and campaign laws limited opposition parties' ability to counter ruling party claims. The ruling NAP had dominant representation on electoral commissions, leading to limited coverage of opposition candidates. Voter turnout was around 50%, with most votes going to NAP members. The NAP increased its seats in the Majlis, while minor parties saw a decrease in seats. One opposition party candidate won a seat in the new Majlis. The 2010 election in Azerbaijan saw the ruling NAP party dominating the electoral commissions, leading to limited coverage of opposition candidates. Voter turnout was around 50%, with most votes going to NAP members. The Popular Front-Musavat bloc, which had won six seats in 2005, did not win any seats in 2010. OSCE election monitors criticized the election for limitations on fundamental freedoms and biased media coverage. The 2010 election in Azerbaijan was criticized by OSCE monitors for an uneven playing field, negative voting procedures in polling stations, and rejection of complaints by opposition candidates. The Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies Center alleged ballot-box stuffing in over one-fourth of polling places. President Aliyev praised the election as successful to the newly elected NAP deputies. In November 2010, President Aliyev praised the election in Azerbaijan as transparent and democratic, reappointing previous top members. Secretary Clinton had commended the country's progress in democratization but the US State Department later stated the election did not meet international standards. The U.S. embassy reported serious violations in the Azerbaijani elections, urging fair adjudication of grievances. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry criticized the State Department's assessment, favoring the OSCE report. The Civic Movement for Democracy/Public Chamber was formed by opposition parties after the 2011 elections. The Public Chamber, formed by opposition parties after the 2011 elections, aimed to establish a representational government denied by fraudulent Majlis elections. Accusing foreign-based NGOs of inciting dissent, the Justice Ministry sent a letter to the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute (NDI) regarding permissible actions of NGOs in Azerbaijan. NDI's Baku office was reportedly closed down, and new regulations required foreign NGOs to uphold national values and refrain from political or religious propaganda. NDI was allowed to resume some activities in late 2011. An internet-launched protest supported by thousands was planned for March 11, 2011. On March 11, 2011, a protest called \"great people's day\" was planned and supported by thousands of Internet users to commemorate the ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarek. Several Internet users were detained before the protest, and organizer Bakhtiyar Hajiyev was arrested on charges of draft evasion. Dozens of people were arrested on the day of the protest, with some receiving short prison sentences. The Musavat Party also held a protest in Baku's Fountain Square the next day, but many were prevented from entering and some activists were detained. Authorities deployed military troops in Baku leading up to the protest. Authorities deployed military troops in Baku and teachers at universities and secondary schools were ordered to lecture students not to attend protests. The Interior Ministry claimed the protests were instigated by \"radical oppositionists\" financed by foreign countries. Azerbaijani officials stated protesting during the war with Armenia was unpatriotic. Baku State University prohibited students from leaving campus on March 11. Youth branches of political parties planned protests, but one scheduled for March 14 did not occur. On March 18, opposition youth groups called for a halt to arrests of activists. The government detained opposition activists before a planned protest on April 2, 2011, leading to arrests and dispersal of protesters. The U.S. Embassy in Baku raised concerns about the government's actions. The U.S. Embassy in Baku raised concerns about government actions. The Public Chamber planned a protest in Baku on April 17, 2011, but authorities denied permission for the venue. Tightened police control led to the detention of dozens attempting to protest. Azerbaijani security forces conducted operations against terrorist cells in various towns, including a suicide bombing in Ganja by Vugar Padarov, allegedly linked to an al Qaeda group called the \"forest brothers.\" The \"forest brothers\" group planned jihad in Azerbaijan targeting mosques, churches, synagogues, security offices, and the Eurovision venue. They also aimed to assassinate President Ilkham Aliyev. Some members trained in al Qaeda camps in Pakistan, Iran, and Syria. Over three dozen arrests were made. In May 2011, a protest against the hijab ban led to 65 detentions. In late May 2011, 150 women wearing hijab marched in Baku. In early October 2011, five men were sentenced for organizing a protest in May 2011. The chairman of the banned Islamic Renaissance Party of Azerbaijan denounced the hijab ban and was arrested for planning a coup. In June 2011, an unauthorized protest was attempted but quickly thwarted by police. In October 2011, four more participants in a demonstration received sentences. In October 2011, four more participants in a demonstration received sentences ranging from 1.5 to 4 years for violating public order and using force against government representatives, bringing the total number of those sentenced for this protest to 14. The trials and sentences have sparked protests from family members and others. In December 2011, outgoing U.S. Ambassador Bryza expressed doubt that the \"Arab Spring\" would reach Azerbaijan. Social media played a significant role in triggering a protest in Guba on March 1, 2012, where citizens rallied against a local official's derogatory comments. On March 1, 2012, citizens in Guba protested against a local official's derogatory comments. The protest escalated with vandalism and the official's home being burned. Security forces dispersed the crowds and arrested about two dozen residents. The official was later sacked, and some restrictions were eased possibly due to Azerbaijan's hosting of the Eurovision Song Contest. One alleged organizer of the April 2011 protest pledged to join the ruling party upon release. Baku authorities allowed a protest on April 8, 2012, with tight security and restrictions. Around 3,000 protesters called for political prisoners' release and democratic reforms. President Aliyev mentioned the rally on April 16, stating there is freedom of assembly. Another rally on April 22, 2012, had conflicting estimates of attendance between the government and opposition. The opposition estimated a crowd of 5,000 to 10,000 individuals at a rally where police tried to restrict demonstrators. Isa Gambar of the Musavat Party called for President Aliyev's resignation and new elections. Protests leading up to the Eurovision Song Contest were held, but authorities efficiently prevented or quashed them. Azerbaijani authorities were firm in not allowing diversity/gay rights demonstrations during the event. Democratic activist Bakhtiyar Hajiyev was released from prison on probation just before Secretary Clinton visited the country. President Aliyev granted amnesty for 66 prisoners, including deputy Musavat head Arif Hajily and others involved in a 2011 demonstration. Pro-government politicians alleged that opposition leader Ali Karimli poisoned former President Elchibey, leading to an investigation by the Baku prosecutor's office. In October 2012, protests erupted over a ban on wearing the hijab in educational institutions, leading to clashes with police. An amendment to the freedom of assembly law in November 2012 increased fines for unauthorized demonstrations, seen as a tactic to suppress rallies before the 2013 presidential election. Police crackdowns on protests in early 2013 hinted at growing public discontent. In early 2013, protests in Baku and Ismayilli were suppressed by police, indicating rising discontent with government policies. Demonstrators faced heavy fines and arrests, with one protest turning violent. Over 2,000 protesters in Ismayilli demanded the resignation of a \"corrupt\" governor. Protesters in Azerbaijan demanded the governor's resignation, leading to arrests and crackdowns by authorities. President Aliyev fired the governor due to \"hooligan\" activity. Political opposition figures were detained, sparking concerns from the EU and OSCE. Subsequent rallies against police violence were forcibly suppressed, with many individuals arrested and fined. Police also shut down a conference in Khachmaz sponsored by a local NGO. The NGO conference in Azerbaijan, funded by NDI, was forcibly shut down on February 12. Freedom House ranked Azerbaijan as \"not free\" in 2012, with ongoing concerns about human rights raised by PACE in a resolution on January 23, 2013. The State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 highlighted three main areas of human rights issues in Azerbaijan: lack of due process, restrictions on freedom of expression, and violations of property rights. PACE failed to pass a resolution on political prisoners in Azerbaijan, opposed by Azerbaijani and Russian delegations as subjective. The State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011 identified three main human rights issues in Azerbaijan: arbitrary arrests, police brutality, and government influence on the judiciary and bar association. Reports of torture and abuse of detainees by police, intimidation of human rights NGOs, and restrictions on media continued. The government in Azerbaijan limited media independence by controlling news coverage and restricting opposition newspapers. Journalists faced physical assaults and lawsuits for libel. Authorities suppressed freedom of assembly by requiring preapproval for rallies and forcibly breaking up unsanctioned gatherings. The law on NGOs was criticized for violating civil rights. The government in Azerbaijan faced criticism for violating civil rights through strict constraints on NGOs, denial of registration based on names, and restrictions on religious freedom. Private property rights were reported to be weakly protected, leading to displacement and inadequate compensation for residents. The State Department's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report highlighted Azerbaijan as a source, transit, and destination country for forced labor and sex trafficking. The government's progress in investigating and prosecuting labor trafficking offenses was limited, but funding and support for victims at its shelter increased. Azerbaijan has been on the Tier 2 Watch List since 2008 for not fully complying with trafficking standards. The country's GDP declined significantly after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the NK conflict in the early 1990s but saw growth in the late 1990s due to oil and gas exports. In 2011, GDP growth in Azerbaijan slowed to 0.1% due to reduced oil exports from maintenance work in oilfields. The economy saw growth in construction, agriculture, and services, indicating a shift towards non-energy sectors. In 2012, the economy grew by 2.2% with inflation at 1.8%, although sources suggest different figures. Sluggish growth was attributed to lagging oil production, partially offset by growth in manufacturing. Inflation eased in 2012 due to an improved harvest and moderating factors. In 2012, inflation eased to 8.1% from 2011, partly due to improved harvest and moderating food prices. The EIU predicts 2.3% GDP growth annually, with oil production leveling off until new fields come online. BP estimates Shah Deniz Phase Two gas fields to start in 2018. The government may use State Oil Fund assets to alleviate budget deficits until then. In 2013, a large transfer from the wealth fund is planned to support social expenditures before the 2013 presidential election. Azerbaijan was commended by the World Bank in 2009 for business regulatory reforms. Azerbaijan was recognized as a top global economic reformer for business regulatory changes, aiming for WTO membership. However, reforms stalled, leading to a drop in rankings. Challenges included difficulty in obtaining construction permits, corruption, and monopolies hindering business growth. President Aliyev urged officials to support entrepreneurs and avoid illegal demands. The government of Azerbaijan supports entrepreneurs and discourages illegal demands, referencing calls for bribes. Unemployment has decreased to 5% and poverty to 8%. Agriculture employs 38% of the population but contributes less than 10% to GDP. Many Azerbaijanis work in Russia, with estimates of up to 1 million, while legal and illegal migrant workers are also present in energy, construction, and trade sectors. U.S. exports to Azerbaijan were $514 million in 2012, with imports at $1.1 billion, mainly due to slowing demand for Azerbaijani oil. Machinery, transport equipment, and food were the main exports to Azerbaijan in 2012. The United States exported machinery, transport equipment, and food to Azerbaijan in 2012. Azerbaijan has significant oil and gas reserves, with hopes of boosting gas exports from offshore fields. U.S. policy supports the development of Eurasian oil and gas resources to increase energy diversity. The U.S. policy aims to increase energy diversity by developing new Eurasian oil and gas resources. This includes supporting the Southern Corridor gas export routes to Europe to enhance European energy security and assist Caspian regional states in accessing competitive prices. The Administration will back the pipeline project that can deliver the most gas quickly and reliably to parts of Europe in need. The U.S. supports the development of new Eurasian oil and gas resources to enhance European energy security. The Administration aims to back pipeline projects that can quickly deliver gas to parts of Europe in need. Morningstar dismissed the idea of competition between Russia and the U.S. for influence over Caspian energy supplies, highlighting the formation of a U.S.-Russia Working Group on Energy. Observers believe that new pipelines in the Caspian region will increase the strategic importance of stability and security for the West. The U.S. has long advocated for Azerbaijani gas to diversify pipeline routes to Europe, apart from those through Russia. In the past, the U.S. encouraged the construction of an oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to Georgia to prevent Russian monopoly over export pipelines. The United States supported the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline to diversify pipeline routes and prevent Russian monopoly over export pipelines. The BTC pipeline, with a capacity of 1 million barrels per day, was completed in 2006 and has transported 1.33 billion barrels of oil to the Ceyhan terminal since then. Additionally, a gas pipeline from Azerbaijan to Turkey (SCP) was completed in 2007. The South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) was completed in March 2007, with exports reaching 159 billion cubic feet in 2011. The ultimate capacity is 706 billion cubic feet per year. The joint venture includes Statoil, British Petroleum, Azerbaijan's Ministry of Industry and Energy, and companies from Russia, Iran, France, and Turkey. Some in Armenia object to lack of access to the pipelines. The August 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict did not harm the pipelines, but they were temporarily closed as a safety precaution. Armenia experienced a temporary decrease in oil shipments due to disruptions in rail shipments from Azerbaijan to the Kulevi oil terminal in Georgia. Kazakhstan initially pumped oil through the BTC pipeline in October 2008, but later restricted its use due to a transit price increase by Azerbaijan in 2011. Some Kazakh oil is now transported by rail to Georgia's Batumi port. Turkmen oil also started to be transported through the BTC pipeline in June 2010, boosting awareness of the South Caucasus' strategic importance. Talks are ongoing between Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to expand oil transportation through the BTC pipeline. In mid-November 2007, Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers inaugurated a gas pipeline connecting their countries, allowing Azerbaijani gas to reach Greece and the EU. Plans for the Interconnector Turkey-Greece-Italy (ITGI) gas pipeline were proposed to extend gas supply to Italy. The Nabucco pipeline faced delays due to Russia's counter-proposals. In September 2010, funding commitments were announced to build the Nabucco pipeline, providing an alternative gas supply to EU members. In 2009, the EU, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Egypt signed a declaration to bolster east-west energy transport, including building the Nabucco gas pipeline and finishing the Italian section of the ITGI gas pipeline. Azerbaijan also aimed to diversify gas exports beyond the SCP and planned Nabucco pipeline. President Aliyev attributed some of these efforts to the need for alternative routes and customers. In 2009, Azerbaijan aimed to diversify gas exports beyond the SCP and planned Nabucco pipeline. President Aliyev attributed increased interest in added gas export routes to negotiations with Turkey over gas transit fees. Azerbaijan signed agreements with Russia's Gazprom for gas supply, with plans to transport gas from Baku to Russia's Dagestan Republic. President Aliyev agreed to provide up to 35.4 billion cubic feet of gas per year to Russia starting in 2011. President Aliyev emphasized that the small supply agreement would not impact gas supply for Nabucco, as Azerbaijan has significant gas reserves. A memorandum of understanding was signed by Azerbaijan, Romania, and Georgia in 2010 for the AGRI project, aiming to transport LNG from Azerbaijan to the EU through Georgia and Romania. The project involves constructing a gas pipeline to transport liquefied gas from Azerbaijan to Georgia's port of Kalevi, then shipping it across the Black Sea to Romania's port of Constanta. The expected output is 247 billion cubic feet per year, with 71 billion cubic feet allocated to Romania and the rest to other EU countries. In September 2010, the presidents of three countries met in Baku to sign the Baku Declaration in support of the AGRI project. By early 2013, SOCAR reported that the project was on hold. Tensions between Turkey and Azerbaijan were eased in June 2010 with agreements on gas sales and transportation. In January 2011, Azerbaijan committed to supplying gas to the EU long-term. Some analysts raised concerns about the availability of Azerbaijani gas for proposed pipelines like ITGI and Nabucco without a trans-Caspian gas pipeline or involvement from Iran or Iraq. However, recent exploratory drilling results off the Caspian seacoast suggest Azerbaijan could supply most of the needed gas. The Shah Deniz Export Negotiating Team, led by SOCAR, received final proposals for gas export pipelines by October 1, 2011. Proposals were received for pipelines to export gas from the second phase development of the Shah Deniz offshore oil and gas fields. Azerbaijan and Turkey signed accords for the transit of Shah Deniz phase 2 gas through Turkey, with a specified amount for Turkey's domestic use. Another accord provided for the possible construction of a new Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP). The construction of the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP) was proposed to transport gas from Shah Deniz Phase 2 without going through the existing Turkish pipeline system. A memorandum of understanding was signed by Azerbaijani and Turkish governments to set up a consortium involving SOCAR, TPAO, and BOTAS for the construction of TANAP. Negotiations for the consortium have been contentious, and the Nabucco consortium submitted new pipeline proposals to the Shah Deniz consortium. The Shah Deniz consortium received new pipeline proposals, including TAP and Nabucco West routes. TANAP construction agreements were signed in June 2012, with a planned completion in 2018. Russia finalized arrangements for the South Stream gas pipeline in late 2012. The South Stream gas pipeline construction began in Russia in December 2012, with plans to extend nearly 600 miles to European markets. Despite concerns about its economic viability, Russia is building the pipeline to maintain dominance in the European gas market and counter other pipeline proposals. Azerbaijan and the Shah Deniz consortium have agreed to finance part of the Nabucco West pipeline, while Turkmenistan explored building a trans-Caspian gas pipeline to Azerbaijan in 1999. The EU approved talks with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan for a trans-Caspian gas pipeline to ensure gas supply for pipelines like Nabucco. Russia opposed the plans, claiming decisions on the Caspian Sea should be made by consensus among all littoral states. In October 2007, decisions on the Caspian Sea were to be made by consensus among all littoral states. Russia violated this by agreeing with Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan on oil and gas field development. The proposed pipeline was seen as an environmental threat. In April 2012, Lavrov urged the EU to respect Caspian littoral states and not advocate for a trans-Caspian pipeline before a convention on the sea's legal status. Tensions rose in June 2012 when a Turkmen survey ship was turned back by Azerbaijani forces, but in September 2012, President Aliyev showed conciliation towards Turkmenistan. Aliyev expressed support for Turkmenistan's involvement in the trans-Caspian project, acknowledging the need for additional gas to meet EU goals for the Southern Corridor. The US backed the construction of a trans-Caspian pipeline, emphasizing the importance of not allowing other countries to veto the decision. Armenia sought alternative routes to Iran due to trade barriers imposed by Azerbaijan and Turkey. Armenia aims to diversify energy sources by building pipelines to Iran, reducing reliance on Russian supplies through Georgia. Azerbaijan competes with Iran in Caspian energy development, cooperating with Western firms to export oil and gas. Azerbaijan signed a deal with Iran to supply gas through a pipeline, with potential for increased supplies in the future. Iran's Naftiran Intertrade Company holds a 10% stake in the project. Iran's Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO) holds a 10% share in the consortium developing the SCP and the Shah Deniz gas fields. The Shah Deniz gas field project is exempt from sanctions under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. Azerbaijan's relations with neighboring states are influenced by the NK conflict, with Turkey seen as a key ally to balance Russian and Iranian influence. Relations with Turkmenistan are strained due to competing claims over offshore oil and gas fields. Azerbaijan's relations with Iran have been tense, with concerns about Iranian-supported Islamic fundamentalism and accusations of Azerbaijan harboring Israeli intelligence agents. Ethnic consciousness among some \"Southern Azerbaijanis\" in Iran has increased, leading to repressive actions by Iran. In February 2012, Iran accused Azerbaijan of aiding Israeli intelligence agents in carrying out operations, including assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists. Azerbaijan sentenced seven individuals in 2008 for terrorism plans, including bombing the Israeli embassy. In February, Azerbaijan confirmed a large arms deal with Israel aimed at \"liberating\" occupied territories. Efforts to ease tensions with Iran included meetings between foreign ministers and Defense Minister Safar Abiyev's visit to Tehran. Despite assurances, Azerbaijan arrested terrorists trained in Iran planning attacks on Western interests. In late March 2012, Iran accused Azerbaijan of aiding Israel in attacking Iran. In early April, Iran arrested individuals believed to be Israeli agents operating from Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan later arrested Iranians and Azerbaijanis involved in smuggling weapons and drugs from Iran. In early May 2012, Iran recalled its ambassador to Azerbaijan due to anti-Iranian protests outside its embassy in Baku. Iran recalled its ambassador to Azerbaijan in May 2012 after protesters in Baku criticized Iran's Supreme Leader. Azerbaijan responded by accusing Iran of insulting statements and warned its citizens against traveling to Iran due to safety concerns. The situation escalated with the arrest of two Azerbaijani poets in Iran on spy charges, leading to tensions between the two countries. Azerbaijan and Iran have had tensions, with Iran recalling its ambassador in 2012 after protests in Baku. Azerbaijan accused Iran of insulting statements and warned its citizens against traveling there. Frictions in Azerbaijani-Russian relations have included Azerbaijan's allegations of a Russian \"tilt\" toward Armenia in NK peace talks. Russia admitted to transferring weaponry to Armenia in 1997. In 2000 and 2005-2007, Russia transferred heavy weaponry from Georgia to Armenia, fueling Azerbaijan's belief that Russia supports Armenia in the NK conflict. Azerbaijani-Russian relations improved in 2002 with a 10-year Russian lease for the Gabala radar station in Azerbaijan. Ilkham Aliyev reaffirmed the Azerbaijani-Russian Friendship Treaty in 2004. After the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict, Azerbaijan moved towards better relations with Russia. In 2010, Azerbaijan's relations with Russia strengthened in response to Turkish efforts to improve relations with Armenia and U.S. support. Some strains have appeared in relations since Vladimir Putin returned as Russia's president in early 2012, including Azerbaijan's demurral of joining the Eurasian Customs Union and the breakdown of talks on renewing the Russian lease on the Gabala radar site. Former Armenian Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanyan stated that the NK conflict is not covered under Article 4 of the Commonwealth of Independent States' Collective Security Treaty. Policymakers in Armenia raised concerns after the CSTO agreed to form large rapid response forces in February 2009. In February 2009, policymakers in Armenia and Azerbaijan expressed concerns over the formation of large rapid response forces, with some viewing it as a deterrent to aggression. The Secretary-General of the CSTO stated they would not intervene in the NK conflict but emphasized Armenia's close military ties with Russia. In May 2011, the Armenian Defense Minister expected CSTO support in case of aggression against NK, leading to protests from Azerbaijan. An agreement in August 2010 extended Russia's military facilities lease in Armenia, with President Sargisyan interpreting it as defense against potential threats. In December 2012, Armenian President Serzh Sargisyan emphasized the importance of CSTO support in case of war with Azerbaijan. He highlighted the strategic partnership between Armenia and Russia as crucial for Armenian security. The CSTO conducted exercises in Armenia simulating defense against invasion. Russia's forces in Armenia were reportedly transformed to professional contract. In 2013, Russia transformed its forces in Armenia to professional contract troops in anticipation of potential Azerbaijani or Israeli military actions. Azerbaijan was seen as unfriendly towards Russia, with a Russian general stating that defending Armenia would be a political decision. Turkey's President visited Armenia in 2008, leading to improved relations and the establishment of diplomatic ties in 2009. Turkish and Armenian foreign ministers signed protocols for diplomatic relations. Azerbaijan criticized Turkey for normalizing relations with Armenia without linking it to a peace settlement of the NK conflict. Turkey pledged not to approve the protocols until progress was made in settling the conflict. The ruling Armenian party coalition suspended the ratification process due to Turkey's refusal to ratify the accord without preconditions. The United States supported Switzerland in mediating the talks that led to the signing of the protocols. President Aliyev criticized the Obama Administration's support of protocols, warning that it threatened U.S. interests in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani officials suggested reconsidering strategic partnership ties with the United States if biased mediation on the NK issue continued. In response, the U.S. State Department affirmed its evenhanded mediation efforts. Azerbaijan subsequently canceled a military exercise with the United States. The Azerbaijani armed forces consist of various troops, including army, air force, air defense, navy, border guards, and Interior Ministry troops. The Azerbaijani military budget has increased in recent years, reaching $3.7 billion in 2013. Azerbaijan has military training agreements with Russia, Turkey, and NATO, and purchases arms from various countries. A military doctrine terms the occupation of Azerbaijani land and external support for the occupation as major threats. Russian troops were deployed at the Gabala radar site under a lease agreement that expired in 2012. Azerbaijan reportedly received foreign-made weapons and armed volunteers from Islamic nations. Azerbaijan's military budget has increased to $3.7 billion in 2013. The country has military training agreements with Russia, Turkey, and NATO, and purchases arms from various countries. Azerbaijani troops have participated in NATO peacekeeping missions since 1997 and operations in Afghanistan since 2003. The bulk of Azerbaijani weapons come from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, with some NATO-compatible equipment received. In 2011, Azerbaijan displayed S-300 air defense missiles supplied by Russia. A civilian agency to manage conscription was established in 2012. In 1988, NK petitioned to become part of Armenia, sparking ethnic conflict. In December 1991, an NK referendum approved NK's independence. A ceasefire agreement was signed in July 1994, and the sides pledged to work toward a peace settlement. The \"Minsk Group\" was formed in 1992 to facilitate peace talks, co-chaired by the United States, France, and Russia. Ethnic Armenian separatists control most of the NK region with Armenia's support. The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh resulted in about 30,000 casualties and over 1 million Azerbaijani and Armenian refugees and displaced persons. The area of control constitutes about 13%-16% of Azerbaijan's land area. Over 600,000 individuals remain refugees or displaced persons in Azerbaijan, with most being economically vulnerable. Basic Principles for the Peaceful Settlement of the conflict were presented to Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2007. The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh resulted in casualties and refugees. Basic Principles for Peaceful Settlement were presented to Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2007, urging acceptance for a comprehensive peace settlement. Updated versions were publicized by US, France, and Russia in 2009 and 2010. In 2009 and 2010, agreements were made for the return of territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control, an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh with security guarantees, a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh, determination of its final legal status through a binding expression of will, the right of displaced persons to return, and international security guarantees. Declarations were signed in 2010 for a peaceful settlement, but speeches by the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan criticized the process. In June 2011, Presidents Sargisyan and Aliyev met in Kazan, Russia, and agreed on some issues, with further talks planned. President Medvedev later called for progress in talks and a frank conversation with Aliyev in Sochi, Russia, to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Aliyev emphasized the need for peace, cooperation, and the return of displaced persons to their homes. At a meeting in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, in September 2011, the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan criticized each other's handling of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. President Sargisyan accused Azerbaijan of trying to derail negotiations, while Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Mammadyarov expressed Azerbaijan's commitment to the negotiation process. Peace and cooperation were emphasized by President Aliyev during talks in Kazan and Sochi earlier that year. In October 2011, the Minsk Group co-chairs issued a statement after talks with Presidents Aliyev and Sargisyan regarding border incident investigation procedures. President Aliyev emphasized the desire for peace before a planned meeting with the Armenian president in Sochi in January 2012. At the Sochi meeting, the two presidents pledged to accelerate talks for a settlement and requested Russia's help in facilitating humanitarian ties. The OSCE Minsk Group presented a draft plan for investigating incidents along the line of contact, with further work needed. President Sargisyan criticized Azerbaijan for not discussing incident investigation mechanisms, which Azerbaijan denied. Azerbaijani officials acknowledged the talks mediated by the Russian president as crucial for settling the conflict. The talks mediated by the Russian president are seen as crucial for settling the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Recent violence resulted in casualties on both sides, prompting calls for a peaceful resolution from Secretary Clinton and a joint statement from the presidents of the US, France, and Russia. The presidents of major countries at a summit in Mexico issued a joint statement urging both Armenia and Azerbaijan to avoid hostile rhetoric and emphasizing that military force will not resolve the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani Foreign Minister stated that the presence of Armenian troops in Azerbaijani lands is the main issue, and tensions escalated when Hungary extradited an Azerbaijani citizen sentenced to life in prison. In 2012, Hungary extradited Ramil Safarov, an Azerbaijani citizen sentenced to life in prison for killing an Armenian officer during NATO training. Safarov was immediately pardoned and rewarded by Azerbaijani President Ilkham Aliyev, leading to protests and diplomatic fallout. The White House expressed disappointment, and the OSCE Minsk Group raised concerns about the impact on peace efforts. In response to criticism from the OSCE, President Aliyev argued that the Minsk Group had failed to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, suggesting that military force might be necessary. The Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers clashed at the U.N. General Assembly, with no progress reported at the OSCE Ministerial Council Meeting in Dublin. In talks since January 2012, Armenian and Azerbaijani presidents pledged faster progress and raised concerns about increased tensions.
