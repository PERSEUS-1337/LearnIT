    "content": "The URAA authorized the President to accept US membership in the WTO and outlined the procedure for withdrawing approval. Section 124 requires annual reports to Congress on the WTO's operation and its impact on the US. The U.S. Trade Representative must submit an annual report to Congress on WTO activities and operations. Every five years, a report must include an analysis of the effects of the WTO Agreement on the interests of the United States. This is required by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The provision allows Congress to periodically review U.S. participation in the WTO and potentially withdraw approval through a joint resolution disapproving the original agreement. This mechanism aims to assess whether continued membership in the WTO is in the best interest of the United States. Congress has the authority to review and potentially withdraw U.S. participation in the WTO to ensure it aligns with trade goals and benefits American interests. This includes the ability to vote on a joint resolution disapproving continued membership in the organization. Section 125 allows Congress to withdraw U.S. approval of participation in the WTO, potentially ending U.S. involvement in the organization. The legislation outlines an expedited procedure for considering the withdrawal measure, following a special fast-track process. Section 152 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 125 of the URAA allow for resolutions disapproving certain actions, with provisions for changing rules of either House. References to Section 125 pertain to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The timetable for legislative consideration of a joint resolution of withdrawal involves introducing the resolution within 90 days of receiving the quinquennial report on the operation of the WTO. The resolution is privileged, nonamendable, and its language is prescribed by law. The resolution to withdraw approval of the WTO Agreement must be introduced within 90 days of receiving the quinquennial report. It is nonamendable and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means in the House and the Committee on Finance in the Senate. If not reported within 45 days, the committee is discharged, and the resolution is placed on the calendar for floor consideration. The joint resolution of withdrawal from the WTO Agreement must be reported favorably or adversely within 45 days of introduction. It is not in order to consider a joint resolution if the House has previously adopted one. The resolution must be reported by the Ways and Means Committee in the House for floor consideration. The motion for withdrawal from the WTO Agreement is highly privileged and non-debatable. Debate is limited to 20 hours, with no amendments or motions allowed. Appeals from the Chair's decisions are also decided without debate. The motion for withdrawal from the WTO Agreement is highly privileged and non-debatable. Debate is limited to 20 hours, with no amendments or motions allowed. Appeals from the Chair's decisions are also decided without debate. The procedure in the Senate involves referring a joint resolution of withdrawal to the Committee on Finance upon receipt, and if a Senate resolution was introduced before the House resolution, the Senate considers its own resolution. The Senate vote on the passage of the resolution is based on the House resolution. If the Senate passes a joint resolution before receiving the House resolution, it is held pending the latter's receipt. This procedure ensures that a resolution of withdrawal cannot be adopted unless it meets specific criteria. The Senate's floor consideration of a resolution of withdrawal is privileged, with limited debate time controlled by the majority and minority leaders. The minority leader controls the time in opposition during the Senate's floor consideration of a resolution of withdrawal. Additional time can be allotted to any Senator. A motion to limit debate is nondebatable, and no amendments are allowed. If Congress adopts a joint resolution, it must be transmitted to the President within 90 days of receiving the President's report. If the President vetoes the resolution, each House can vote to override the veto with a two-thirds majority within the 90-day period. The veto override process in the Senate is limited to ten hours of consideration, divided between the majority and minority leaders. The House debate on overriding a veto is typically limited to one hour. Section 125 does not specify the implementation of a withdrawal resolution. The withdrawal resolution does not specify the entry into effect or the deadline for transmitting the notice of withdrawal to the Director-General of the WTO. The process of withdrawing from the WTO is regulated by Article XV, requiring a written notice to the Director-General, which takes effect six months after receipt. The withdrawal process from the WTO is regulated by Article XV, requiring a written notice to the Director-General, with specific timelines for withdrawal from plurilateral agreements. The withdrawal resolution addresses dissatisfaction and frustration towards the WTO regime. The withdrawal resolution expresses dissatisfaction with the WTO regime, citing concerns about U.S. sovereignty, encroachment on Congress' power, and negative outcomes of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism. Supporters argue for withdrawal based on these issues, while opponents highlight the benefits of the WTO in promoting international trade regulation and transparency. The withdrawal resolution criticizes the WTO regime, but supporters argue that the deficiencies are exaggerated and can be reformed. If the US withdraws from the WTO, it would exclude itself from the international trade rules it helped create. The US withdrawal from the WTO would erode its leadership position in international trade and limit its access to the dispute settlement mechanism. This could strain the organization's cohesiveness, but the overall impact on US international trade position would be limited. The US withdrawal from the WTO would not lead to significant changes in its international trade position in the short run. Most obligations under the WTO Agreement are already enacted as US domestic law and would still apply to trading partners. Existing rights and obligations under the WTO would continue to be in effect even after the US withdrawal. If the United States withdraws from the WTO, its trade relationships with other countries could still be regulated by existing bilateral agreements and free-trade agreements. This would allow for more freedom in taking adverse actions against each other, but also open the door to unrestrained retaliation without the mediation of the WTO. The U.S. withdrawal from the WTO would lead to a loss of access to the dispute settlement mechanism and potential approval for retaliatory actions. The Section 125 report highlighted WTO accomplishments but also discussed unresolved issues for the Organization's future operation. Representative Ron Paul raised concerns in response. In response to concerns raised by Representative Ron Paul, a resolution was introduced in 2000 to withdraw Congress' approval of the WTO Agreement. The Ways and Means Committee held a hearing and unanimously reported the withdrawal resolution adversely. The House Committee on Rules adopted a rule for consideration, but the withdrawal resolution failed to pass on the House floor. No similar action occurred in the Senate. In 2005, Representatives Sanders and Paul introduced H.J.Res. 27 to withdraw Congress' approval of the WTO Agreement. The House disapproved the withdrawal resolution by a vote of 338-86."
