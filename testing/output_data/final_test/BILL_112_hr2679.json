    "content": "The \"PREEMIE Reauthorization Act\" aims to reduce preterm birth, disabilities, and deaths of preterm babies, expand research on causes of preterm birth, and promote evidence-based care for pregnant women at risk of preterm labor. It also includes provisions for research and activities at the National Institutes of Health. The \"PREEMIE Reauthorization Act\" focuses on reducing preterm birth, disabilities, and deaths of preterm babies through research and evidence-based care for pregnant women at risk. SEC. 409K expands research on preterm labor, delivery, and infant mortality. The Secretary of NIH will expand research on preterm labor, delivery, and care for preterm infants. A clinical program will be established to investigate obstetric problems and improve neonatal care, focusing on low birth weight infants. The NIH will award grants for trans-disciplinary research centers to study preterm birth and improve interventions. Research will integrate various disciplines and bioinformatics to enhance understanding of DNA and proteins related to preterm birth. The NIH will award grants for trans-disciplinary research centers to study preterm birth and improve interventions. Eligible entities must submit an application to the Director, including coordination with clinical research networks. The Director will report on the activities of these research centers in the NIH report. Additionally, a national educational campaign will be established by the Secretary. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute on Child Health and Human Development, will establish a national science-based education campaign targeting women of childbearing age, high-risk populations, and healthcare providers to promote healthy pregnancies and prevent preterm birth. SEC. 4. RESEARCH AND ACTIVITIES AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct ongoing epidemiological studies on factors related to prematurity, improve national data tracking, and develop novel approaches. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct ongoing epidemiological studies on factors related to prematurity, improve national data tracking, and develop novel prevention methods for late preterm birth. Additionally, research will be expanded on racial and ethnic disparities in preterm birth, and ongoing epidemiological studies on community-based interventions will be conducted. Reports on progress and results will be submitted to Congress every 2 years. Congress reports on the progress and results of studies conducted under the Prematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act. The act is reauthorized, changing the year from 2011 to 2016. SEC. 5. Research and activities at the Health Resources and Services Administration. Telemedicine Demonstration Project on High Risk Pregnancies: Grants awarded for remote provision of obstetric services to high-risk women using telehealth. Section 399Q of the Telemedicine Demonstration Project focuses on grants for telehealth services for high-risk pregnancies and educational activities on preterm birth risk factors. Eligibility requires submitting an application to the Director. Funding of $1,000,000 is allocated for grants under subsection (q) for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Public Health Service Act Section 399Q is amended to include education on core risk factors for preterm labor, outcomes for infants born before 39 weeks, importance of prenatal care, smoking cessation, hypertension, weight maintenance, and treatments for premature babies. The Public Health Service Act Section 399Q is amended to include education on core risk factors for preterm labor, outcomes for infants born before 39 weeks, importance of prenatal care, smoking cessation, hypertension, weight maintenance, treatments for premature babies, informational needs of families in neonatal intensive care units, preventable birth injuries, depression, and the use of progesterone. Additionally, a Pilot Program will be conducted by the Secretary to research and report on these topics. The Secretary may conduct research studies and demonstration projects to test maternity care models aimed at reducing preterm birth rates through grants awarded to eligible entities like hospitals or nonprofit organizations that follow evidence-based practices. Applicants must submit required information for eligibility, and grants will be targeted towards these initiatives. The Secretary will prioritize grants for projects in areas with high rates of preterm birth. Additionally, subsection (d) will be updated to reflect the year 2016 instead of 2011. SEC. 6. OTHER ACTIVITIES. The Secretary shall establish the Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality to provide advice on reducing infant mortality, improving the health of pregnant women and infants, and coordinating federal programs for maternal and child health care. The Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality will develop strategies to address health and social issues affecting infant mortality, implement the Healthy Start program, promote data collection, and reduce preterm birth rates through research and education. The Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality will develop a plan for research and education on preterm birth through the Department of Health and Human Services, including activities on disparities in preterm birth rates, setting priorities, and incorporating input from scientists, patients, and advocacy groups. The Secretary ensures Advisory Committee membership includes original charter representatives and a National Center for Health Statistics representative. A study on hospital readmissions of preterm infants will be conducted by an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services to address specific questions. The study will investigate inpatient readmission rates for preterm infants, leading diagnoses, treatment costs, preventable readmission percentages, cost attribution, and health insurance coverage sources. The study will investigate inpatient readmission rates for preterm infants, leading diagnoses, treatment costs, preventable readmission percentages, cost attribution, and health insurance coverage sources. The report to the Secretary and Congress will contain findings and recommendations on evidence-based interventions for preventing readmission of preterm infants, including measuring and reporting on quality of care and outcomes. The subsection includes recommendations for hospital discharge and follow-up procedures to reduce preventable hospital readmissions for preterm infants. $1,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2012."
