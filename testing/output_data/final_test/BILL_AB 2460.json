    "title": "AB 2460",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 2860 of the Public Utilities Code is repealed, and Section 2861 is amended to define terms related to gas customers and solar thermal systems. \"Disadvantaged community\" is defined by the California Environmental Protection Agency, \"Gas customer\" includes both \"core\" and \"noncore\" customers, and \"kWth\" is the unit of measure for solar thermal systems. The term \"kWhth\" refers to kilowatthours thermal, measured by the number of kilowatts thermal generated in an hour. \"Low-income residential housing\" includes housing financed with low-income housing tax credits or loans, where rents do not exceed prescribed limits for lower income households. Additionally, it includes residential complexes where at least 20% of units are sold or rented to lower income households. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for affordable housing units under a deed restriction or affordability covenant for a minimum of 30 years. It also defines the \"New Solar Homes Partnership\" program and \"Solar heating collector\" device. The curr_chunk defines a \"solar thermal system\" as a device that reduces natural gas or electricity demand through capturing heat energy from the sun. It includes various types of systems but excludes single-family residential solar pool heating systems. The Legislature acknowledges California's heavy reliance on natural gas, highlighting concerns about aging infrastructure prone to leaks, environmental damage, and public health risks. They emphasize the need to reduce demand for natural gas due to its contribution to global warming and air pollution, especially in water heating for domestic and industrial use. Solar thermal systems offer significant natural gas saving potential in California, providing financial benefits, energy savings, and reducing dependence on foreign energy sources. They also help protect the environment and public health by reducing air pollution. The growing demand for these technologies will create jobs, promote energy independence, protect consumers from rising costs, and result in cleaner air. Installing solar thermal systems in disadvantaged communities can provide local economic benefits and support the state's clean energy goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The State of California aims to promote solar thermal systems to reduce natural gas demand in various buildings. The Legislature intends to establish a mainstream market for these systems, leading to cost-effective investments for gas customers. The Public Utilities Code will be amended by July 31, 2017 to support these initiatives. By July 31, 2017, the commission will implement changes to promote solar thermal systems in homes, businesses, and buildings of eligible customer classes receiving natural gas service throughout California. The program will be administered by gas corporations or third-party administrators under the supervision of the commission. The commission will coordinate the program with the Energy Commission's initiatives, including the New Solar Homes Partnership, to build zero-energy homes. Funding for the program will come from a surcharge on gas customers based on natural gas consumption, not exceeding $250 million from 2017 to 2022. The commission will reserve 50% of the program budget for solar thermal systems in low-income housing or disadvantaged communities, with the ability to adjust the percentage. 10% of the budget will be allocated for industrial applications. Gas customers in certain assistance programs will be exempt from surcharges for the program. Funds from surcharges for the program will be collected by the gas corporation or revenue cycle services provider. Rebates will be given to customers to promote solar thermal system utilization, with rebate amounts consistent until revised by the commission. The commission will consider revising rebate amounts every two years based on installation costs and natural gas prices. A cap on rebates will not hinder industrial customer participation. No funds will be diverted from existing low-income or energy efficiency programs. Eligibility criteria for solar thermal systems will be established in consultation with the Energy Commission and the public. (1) Residential solar thermal systems must meet certification standards to qualify for rebate funding. Solar collectors for various applications must also be certified. Energy output must be determined by accredited testing laboratories.\n(2) Components of solar thermal systems must be new and unused. (3) Solar thermal collectors must have a 10-year warranty against defects and degradation. (4) Solar thermal systems in buildings connected to a natural gas utility within the state. (5) Solar thermal systems must have meters to monitor performance and energy generation, with monitoring costs not exceeding 2% of the system cost. The commission may adjust the percentage of monitoring costs not exceeding 2% of the system cost after a public stakeholder process. Solar thermal systems must be installed according to manufacturer's specifications and applicable codes. Non-owner-occupied properties require owner participation for solar thermal system installation. The commission may adopt consensus solar standards for gas customer funded incentives. Section 2865 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to establish conditions for these incentives. The commission shall set rating standards for solar thermal systems to ensure efficient installation and energy production per gas customer dollar. The commission may establish a grant program or loan program for low-income residential housing, including those participating in a gas corporation energy efficiency program. Eligibility may be extended to ratepayers in single-family homes. The commission may establish a grant or loan program for low-income residential housing, including those in single-family homes or multifamily dwellings. Lower income households and ratepayers in a LIEE program benefit from reduced energy costs with solar thermal system incentives. The commission maximizes incentives for properties serving lower income households and LIEE program participants. The commission may establish conditions for solar thermal systems on low-income residential properties to remain affordable for 10 years. Rebates for solar thermal technologies will be reduced over time and based on actual energy savings. The commission will consider federal tax credits and incentives for solar thermal systems when determining rebate amounts. They will also assess the impact on existing energy efficiency programs and may combine solar thermal rebates with other energy-efficient technologies. Sections 2867.1 and 2867.2 of the Public Utilities Code are repealed, while section 2867.3 is amended. Section 2867.3 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to require publicly owned utilities providing gas service to adopt a solar thermal system incentive program with eligibility criteria and minimum standards for equipment and performance. The text chunk discusses the establishment of a grant program or loan program for low-income residential housing to install solar thermal systems. It also mentions the repeal and addition of sections in the Public Utilities Code related to the inoperative status of certain articles. No reimbursement is required by this act for local agencies or school districts as they have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated programs. This act may incur costs for local agencies due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes."
