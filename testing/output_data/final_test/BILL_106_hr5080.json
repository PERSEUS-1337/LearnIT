The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project is being revised and extended under the terms and conditions outlined in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999.

The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project will have modifications in capitation rates and case management fees for enrollees classified as 'moderate' or 'at risk'. The basic capitation rate will be reduced by 10-15% in certain demonstration sites. The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project includes protocols for telephonic contact with enrollees based on standardized health assessments and disease management programs for prevalent diseases like congestive heart failure, arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension. The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project includes protocols for tracking enrollees through hospitalizations, implementing quality improvement measures, and conducting evaluations. The Medicare Community Nursing Organization Demonstration Project evaluates the impact on per beneficiary spending, health utilization measures, and enrollee satisfaction for the period from July 1, 1997, to December 31, 1999, and for the extension period after September 30, 2000.
