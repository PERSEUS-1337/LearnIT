    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2006\". Congress finds that the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project, a key component of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program, has had significant economic and cultural impacts on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, leading to the loss of homes and communities. Compensation has been provided to some Indian tribes affected by the project. Congress enacted the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act to address inadequate compensation for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe affected by the Pick-Sloan projects. The Act created the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund but did not provide additional compensation for tribal members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The purpose of this Act is to allow the Trust Fund to compensate the tribe. The Recovery Trust Fund may compensate Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project and capitalize the Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. SEC. 3. Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe equitable compensation. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is being amended to address the inadequate compensation for land acquired by the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservation project. The amendments aim to ensure fair compensation for the Tribe and member landowners. The Equitable Compensation Act (Public Law 106-511; 114 Stat. 2365) is being amended to define \"member landowner\" as a Tribe member who owned land on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation acquired for the Oahe Dam project. Additionally, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund section is being revised. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2006 amends the Equitable Compensation Act by specifying funding provisions for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to deposit specific amounts into the Fund on designated capitalization dates. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2006 amends the Equitable Compensation Act by specifying funding provisions for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to deposit specific amounts into the Fund on designated capitalization dates. The Act also outlines investment requirements for the deposited funds. The Secretary of the Treasury is mandated to invest the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Fund must be invested in accordance with specific requirements, including separate investments of principal and interest. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund is divided into a principal account and an interest account. Interest earned from investing in the principal account is transferred to the interest account for further investment. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund has a principal account and an interest account. Interest earned from investing in the principal account is transferred to the interest account for further investment. Amounts in the principal account are invested in eligible obligations with the shortest available maturity initially. Subsequent investments follow specific guidelines. Subsequent investments from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund's principal account are divided into three equal portions and invested in eligible Treasury obligations with 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year maturities. The principal of maturing eligible obligations is reinvested in identical Treasury obligations with 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year maturities until the next-issued publicly-issued Treasury obligations are available. The Department of the Treasury reinvests the principal of maturing eligible obligations in available identical Treasury obligations with maturities longer than 1 year. Amounts in the interest account of the Fund are invested before each capitalization date. The Fund's account is invested in eligible obligations identical to publicly-issued Treasury obligations with maturities matching the capitalization date. Amounts in the interest account are reinvested in similar Treasury obligations after each capitalization date. The Fund's account is invested in eligible obligations matching Treasury obligations with maturities aligned with withdrawal dates. The purchase price of eligible obligations should not exceed their par value to maintain the principal amount in perpetuity. The Fund's account is invested in eligible obligations matching Treasury obligations with maturities aligned with withdrawal dates. Any discount from par in the purchase price of eligible obligations shall be treated as interest paid at maturity. Eligible obligations purchased must be held to their maturities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall review investment activities and financial status annually with the Tribe. If investing according to the specified guidelines is not feasible, modifications may be made. The Secretary of the Treasury may modify requirements if not practicable or if adverse consequences to the Fund would result. Consultation with the Tribe is required before any modification. Beginning on the first day of each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall withdraw interest from the Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer funds from the interest account of the Fund to the Secretary of the Interior for use in the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. Additional compensation may be provided to member landowners for land acquisition by the United States. The Reservoir Project determines heirs of member landowners according to probate code. Additional compensation to member landowners during a fiscal year cannot be deposited into their Individual Indian Money account or any other fund held by the United States. The Secretary of the Interior will provide records to the Tribe to identify heirs of member landowners for land acquired for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project within 90 days of the request. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to allow member landowners to be eligible for certain programs and services. Additionally, the section regarding the extinguishment of claims is modified. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to extinguish all monetary claims the Tribe may have against the United States for the taking of land and property for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. Acceptance of payment by a member landowner or heir will also extinguish any claims they may have against the United States for the taking. The Senate passed S. 1535 on December 7, 2006, amending the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act to provide compensation to tribe members for damage from the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project."
