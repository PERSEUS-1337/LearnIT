    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The governing board of a school district in California may determine which pupils would benefit from advanced scholastic or vocational work, allowing them to attend a community college for educational enrichment opportunities. This aims to provide a smoother transition from high school to college by exposing students to the collegiate atmosphere. If a school district denies a highly gifted pupil's request for enrollment at a community college, they must provide a written recommendation and reasons for the denial within 60 days. This recommendation must be issued at the next board meeting at least 30 days after the request. The governing board of a school district may authorize a pupil to attend a community college as a special part-time or full-time student to take STEM courses if all other enrollment options have been exhausted. The principal must consult with the pupil's teachers before making a recommendation. STEM courses refer to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics courses. A pupil can receive credit for completing community college courses based on the appropriate level determined by the governing boards. The principal can recommend a pupil for community college summer session if the pupil is adequately prepared in the discipline and has exhausted all enrollment opportunities at their school. The principal cannot recommend more than 5% of pupils from a particular grade level for summer session. Compliance with these rules cannot be waived. Section 48801.5 is added to the Education Code, allowing pupils to receive credit for completing community college courses based on appropriate levels determined by governing boards. The principal can recommend a pupil for community college summer session if adequately prepared and all enrollment opportunities at their school have been exhausted, with a limit of 5% of pupils from a particular grade level. Compliance with these rules cannot be waived. The governing board of a community college district can partner with a school district to offer STEM courses to secondary school pupils who have exhausted enrollment opportunities. Pupils can attend a community college session with parental consent if all other options have been exhausted at their school. Secondary school pupils, with parental consent if under 18, can attend community college as special part-time or full-time students. Community college districts must adopt partnership agreements with school districts for STEM courses. The agreements must be approved by both governing boards and presented at public hearings for input and approval. The partnership agreement for STEM courses between community college districts and school districts must outline terms, academic readiness requirements, and protocols for information sharing. It must be approved by both governing boards and filed with the department before the program starts. The Legislature aims to facilitate a smoother transition from high school to college by exposing pupils to the collegiate atmosphere. Pupils can earn credit for community college courses based on partnership agreements between school and community college districts. Community college districts cannot receive state funding for activities already compensated by school districts. The attendance of a pupil at a community college as a special part-time or full-time student is authorized for credit or reimbursement. A special part-time student can enroll in up to 11 units per semester at the community college. The governing board of a community college district may assign enrollment priority to special part-time or full-time students, ensuring they do not displace regular students. Community college and school districts in a partnership are exempt from concurrent enrollment provisions. Annual reporting to the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges is required for each partnership. The Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges requires an annual report on the total number of secondary school pupils enrolled in each program, successful course completions, and equivalent courses in community colleges. The report is transmitted to the Legislature, Director of Finance, Superintendent, and governing boards of participating community college and school districts."
