    "content": "Fees for grazing private livestock on federal lands have been authorized since 1906 for the Forest Service and 1936 for the Bureau of Land Management. The Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 established a fee formula for grazing fees. BLM manages 245.7 million acres, with 154.1 million acres available for grazing in FY2017. FS manages 192.9 million acres, with over 93 million acres available for grazing in FY2017. In FY2017, BLM and FS managed 154.1 million and 93 million acres available for livestock grazing, respectively. The acreage used for grazing is less than available due to various reasons such as lack of forage, voluntary nonuse, and resource protection needs. In FY2017, there were 16,357 operators authorized to graze livestock on BLM rangelands, holding 17,886 grazing permits and leases. In FY2017, BLM and FS managed 154.1 million and 93 million acres for livestock grazing. BLM had 16,357 operators with 17,886 permits and leases. 8,820,617 AUMs were authorized for use on BLM lands, while 6,803,425 HD-MOs were authorized for use on FS lands. The grazing fee for 2019 is $1.35 per AUM. The grazing fee for federal lands in 2019 is $1.35 per AUM, effective from March 1, 2019, through February 29, 2020. BLM and FS spend more on managing grazing programs than they collect in fees. In FY2017, BLM received $18.3 million in grazing fees out of a $79.0 million appropriation for rangeland management, while FS collected $7.6 million out of a $56.9 million appropriation. Grazing fees have been a contentious issue for livestock producers using federal lands. Livestock producers on federal lands want to keep fees low, citing lower productivity, shared use, and lack of amenities. Conservation groups argue that low fees lead to overgrazing. Critics claim low fees subsidize ranchers and contribute to budget shortfalls. Higher fees could improve range conditions and productivity. The Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA) establishes a policy of charging a grazing fee on federal rangelands to ensure economic fairness for livestock owners. The fee is based on the estimated economic value of grazing and is adjusted annually based on factors like rental charges for private rangelands and livestock production costs. Congress limits fee adjustments to 25% of the previous year's fee. President Reagan issued Executive Order 12548 in 1986 to continue the PRIA fee formula indefinitely, setting the minimum fee at $1.35 per AUM. The 2019 grazing fee of $1.35 per AUM represents a 4% decrease from 2018. BLM and FS have charged the same fee since 1981, ranging from $1.35 to $2.31 per AUM, with an average of $1.55 per AUM over the period. Fifty percent of grazing fees go to a range betterment fund in the Treasury, with BLM and FS receipts deposited separately. The range betterment fund receives annual appropriations, with BLM typically receiving $10.0 million and FS receiving less. For FY2017, FS received $4.2 million. The fund is used for range rehabilitation, protection, and improvement activities. Half of the fund is directed by the Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture, while the other half is spent in the district, region, or forest that generated the fees. The range betterment fund receives annual appropriations, with BLM typically receiving $10.0 million and FS receiving less. For FY2017, FS received $4.2 million. The fund is used for range rehabilitation, protection, and improvement activities. BLM regulations allocate half of the fund by the Secretary on a priority basis, while the rest is spent in the state and district where derived. Forest Service regulations allocate half of the monies in the national forest where derived, and the rest in the FS region where the forest is located. FS returns all range betterment funds to the forest that generated them. The agencies allocate the remaining 50% of the collections differently, with 25% deposited in the Treasury and 25% subject to revenue-sharing requirements. Revenue-sharing payments are made to states, which then pass the funds to specified local governmental entities for use at the county level. For BLM, states receive 12.5% of monies collected from lands defined in Section 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act, and 37.5% is allocated elsewhere. 12.5% of monies collected from lands defined in Section 3 of the Taylor Grazing Act and 37.5% is deposited in the Treasury. States receive 50% of fees collected from BLM lands defined in Section 15 of the Taylor Grazing Act. Any state share is to benefit the counties that generated the receipts. PRIA directed the Interior and Agriculture Secretaries to report to Congress on the fee formula evaluation and recommendations for a permanent grazing fee by December 31, 1985. The report included discussions on livestock production and cost estimates for grazing programs. In the 1990s, grazing fee reform was considered by Congress but no change was enacted. In the 104th Congress (1995-1996), the Senate passed a bill to establish a new grazing fee formula and alter rangeland regulations. The formula was to be derived from the three-year average of the total gross value of production for beef and no longer indexed to economic indexes. In the 1990s, Congress considered grazing fee reform but no changes were enacted. The House passed a bill in the 105th Congress with a fee formula based on a 12-year average of beef cattle production costs. Proposed changes to grazing fees by Presidents in the 1990s were not adopted, including a 1993 proposal by the Clinton Administration for an administrative fee increase starting at $3.96 per AUM. The PRIA formula for grazing fees is adjusted annually based on private land lease rates in the West. There have been proposals by Presidents Bush and Obama to change how grazing fees are allocated, including administrative fees to offset program costs. Debate continues over the appropriate grazing fee criteria. The debate over federal grazing fees includes disagreements on fee criteria, fair market value estimates, uniform vs. varied fees, environmental impacts, and the potential reduction of cattle grazing on sensitive lands. Some environmentalists argue for banning all livestock grazing on federal lands to protect sensitive areas. Proposed grazing administration fees in recent years, like the Obama Administration's $2.50 per AUM in 2017, were met with opposition from livestock organizations as an unnecessary cost. The fees would have generated revenue for administering grazing but were not adopted. In 2005, groups petitioned BLM and FS to raise grazing fees, claiming they did not reflect fair market value. The agencies were sued for not responding to the petition promptly. BLM and FS denied the fee increase request in January 2011 after settling the lawsuit. Studies show that BLM and FS grazing fees have been lower than fees on other federal, state, and private lands over the past 15 years. Studies over the past 15 years have shown that grazing fees on federal lands, including BLM and FS, have been lower compared to other federal, state, and private lands. In 2004, fees ranged from $0.29 to $112.50 per AUM for federal agencies, while state fees varied from $1.35 to $80 per AUM and private fees ranged from $8 to $23 per AUM. In 2010, state fees continued to vary widely, with Arizona charging $2.28 per AUM and Texas charging $65-$150 per AUM. Some states had fees based on different methods like auctions or acreage of grazing. In 2018, state grazing fees in 11 western states varied widely, ranging from $3.50 to $100 per AUM. The average monthly lease rate for grazing on private lands in 16 western states was $23.40 per head in 2017. Comparing BLM and FS grazing fees with state and private fees is complex due to different purposes for charging fees. The federal grazing fees aim to prevent economic disruption and harm to the western livestock industry while reflecting fair market value. However, adjustments to the fee formula have not resulted in fees comparable to state and private fees. Ranchers pay market prices for federal permits through grazing fees, nonfee grazing costs, and capitalized permit values. The higher purchase prices federal permit holders pay for ranches reflect the quality of resources and services provided by landowners. Private lands offer better forage, water sources, and services like watering, fencing, and veterinary care. State lands limit public access but have comparable forage and water availability to federal lands. Nonfee costs of operating on federal lands also impact the comparison with nonfederal costs for ranchers. Unauthorized grazing on federal lands, specifically BLM and FS lands, occurs in various ways, such as grazing outside permitted areas or seasons. The frequency and extent of unauthorized grazing are not fully known due to informal handling by agency staff. Between 2010 and 2014, BLM and FS documented nearly 1,500 instances of unauthorized grazing, resulting in penalties and occasional livestock impoundment for the owners. Some cases of unauthorized grazing are unintentional, while others are intentional. Livestock owners have grazed cattle on federal land without permits or paying fees, citing various reasons. A notable case is Cliven Bundy in Nevada, where BLM impounded his cattle for unpaid grazing fees exceeding $1 million. Cliven Bundy owed over $1 million in grazing fees to the federal government for unauthorized grazing. The impoundment of his cattle was halted due to concerns of potential confrontation. Bundy argued that the land belonged to the state of Nevada, but courts ruled in favor of the United States. The BLM is seeking resolution through the judicial process. The BLM had impounded cattle from Mr. Bundy about 50 times before the 2014 intended impoundment. The operation to remove his cattle in Nevada was the largest, sparking controversy due to law enforcement involvement and land closures. Efforts to end livestock grazing on federal lands through permit retirement and closure of allotments are supported by some for environmental reasons but opposed by those who support ranching. Some supporters seek to have ranchers relinquish their permits to the government in exchange for compensation by third parties, particularly environmental groups. Legislation has been introduced to authorize the voluntary donation of permits to end grazing in certain areas. The Secretary of the Interior and/or the Secretary of Agriculture would accept the donation of a permit, terminate it, and end grazing on the associated land. Some bills propose pilot programs for livestock operators to voluntarily relinquish permits and leases, with the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture accepting a limited number of waived permits each year to permanently retire them and end grazing on affected allotments. However, these measures have not been enacted. Legislation has been proposed to buy out grazing permittees on federal lands, with compensation at a higher rate than market value. The goal is to close allotments to grazing permanently, backed by the National Public Lands Grazing Campaign to enhance resource protection and resolve conflicts. Proponents argue that while costly upfront, a buyout program would save money in the long run. Opponents fear the cost and creation of a compensable property right in grazing permits. The extension, renewal, transfer, and reissuance of grazing permits have been issues for Congress. Both BLM and FS have a backlog of permits needing evaluation for renewal, with BLM's backlog exceeding 7,000 permit renewals as of September 30, 2017. Congress enacted temporary provisions allowing grazing permits to continue until renewal processing is complete. The most recent provision, P.L. 113-291 (Section 3023), made automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases permanent. Agency decisions on permit issuance undergo environmental review. Agency decisions on permit issuance are subject to environmental review under NEPA, which may include additional compliance requirements like the ESA for grazing operations. P.L. 113-291 allows for categorical exclusions from NEPA under certain conditions, with supporters citing expedited renewal processes and reduced agency workload, while opponents raise concerns about insufficient environmental review and public input."
