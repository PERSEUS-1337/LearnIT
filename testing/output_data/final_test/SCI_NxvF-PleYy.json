    "content": "Emphasis effects in information visualization are used to draw attention or indicate importance. Most metrics for predicting how users perceive emphasis effects come from abstract models of human vision, which may not apply to visualization design. Two studies were conducted to provide empirical evidence on how users perceive different emphasis effects using color, size, and blur/focus variables at eight strength levels. Gaze tracking, mouse clicks, and subjective responses were analyzed for results. Results from gaze tracking, mouse clicks, and subjective responses show significant differences between visual variables and levels, leading to an initial understanding of perceptual equivalence. A model developed from the first study accurately predicted results in the second study, providing valuable information for designers seeking to understand and control visual perception. Emphasis effects in information visualization alter data points to appear more visually prominent, guiding the viewer's attention. Designers use various visual effects like color changes to emphasize important data points. The visual prominence of selected data points is achieved through color variations, known to guide user attention. However, little is known about how emphasis effects are perceived by users and what visual effects are quickly recognized as emphasis. Abstract models of human vision may not apply to visualization design, as they are constructed using large stimuli under optimal conditions. Visualizations often consist of various marks viewed on different devices and environments, with designers using techniques to emphasize data points. Current guidelines do not address how emphasis effects are perceived by viewers or provide a metric for perceived emphasis. Effective models of visual prominence in visualizations are lacking, leaving designers unsure of how different visual effects compare and what magnitude of effect to use to guide a viewer's attention. The studies aimed to provide empirical evidence on how users perceive different emphasis effects in visualizations using color, size, and blur/focus. The goal was to compare the effects at different magnitudes rather than just identifying the most perceivable effect. The first study established a baseline of visual prominence through eye-tracking data, interaction logs, and subjective ratings in simulated scatterplot visualizations. The first study used logarithmic curves to predict equivalence between emphasis effects. The second study examined perceived emphasis in real-world visualizations from the MASSVIS dataset. A predictive model accurately predicted results with R2 values up to 0.96. Significant differences were found in emphasis effects, with blur/focus being most prominent, color least prominent, and size in between. Graduated levels of magnitude were also identified for all effects. Our studies provide an empirical foundation for understanding how visual effects are experienced by viewers when used for emphasis in visualizations. Emphasis is essential in InfoVis to highlight regions of interest, and our work offers useful information for designers to control how emphasis effects are perceived by users. The curr_chunk discusses theories and models of selective visual attention, including the two-stage process of bottom-up and top-down attention. It also mentions Feature Integration Theory and Guided Search Theory as explanations for how attention operates. The Guided Search Theory proposes attention bias towards targets of interest based on specific visual characteristics. Recent attention theories challenge the two-stage model by suggesting a three-stage model involving current goals, selection history, and physical salience. Visual search experiments examine attention through reaction times and accuracy in identifying targets among distractors. \"Popout\" refers to easily identifiable target items. The term \"popout\" refers to easily identifiable target items based on unique visual properties. Graphical perception studies explore the effectiveness of different visual channels for encoding data, with Bertin suggesting that variations in visual variables like position, size, color, and texture enhance noticeability. Researchers have conducted experiments to rank visual variables for data visualization, including position, size, color hue, and texture. They have also studied how design factors like aspect ratios, chart sizes, and animations impact the effectiveness of charts. Insights from graphical perception studies can guide viewers' attention in a visualization. Emphasis in information visualization involves manipulating visual features to guide a viewer's attention to important data points. Techniques like distortion, magnification, blur, motion, and flicker are used to create emphasis effects. Emphasis effects in information visualization can be categorized into time-invariant (e.g., highlighting, blurring) and time-variant effects (e.g., motion, flickering). Time-variant effects involve animations that alter the appearance of a data point to make it visually more prominent. Visual emphasis in information visualization involves making the target mark visually prominent compared to non-target marks using various techniques like blur/focus, magnification, and highlighting. The effectiveness of emphasizing a target mark depends on the similarity between targets and non-targets, the similarity among non-targets, and the channel offset. Similarity theory suggests that visual search efficiency decreases with increased target/non-target similarity and decreased similarity among non-targets. The relational account of attention theory suggests that the similarity between targets and non-targets can be modeled by a vector in feature space. Visual search tasks can guide attention based on feature direction. However, nontarget similarity may not affect target prominence. Changes in data visualization, such as adding links between dots or adjusting contrast effects, can significantly impact experimental results. Empirical evaluations of visualizations are necessary to validate theory. The need for empirical evaluations of visualizations to validate theory and evaluate real-world applications is emphasized. Studies have shown that shape has the strongest influence on size and color perception in visualizations. Size perception is biased by specific hues, and quantity estimation is affected by both size and color. Scatterplots are effective for visual judgments due to data points being positioned along a common scale. Graphical perception in scatterplots has been extensively explored with the development of new techniques. Recent studies have focused on automating scatterplot design and predicting perceptual attributes. Eye-tracking evaluations are used to understand how users view visualizations and explore different tasks. Free-viewing is a common technique for evaluating human interaction with visualizations. Free-viewing is a technique for evaluating human perception of visual stimuli without a specific task, allowing attention to be guided by image elements in a bottom-up manner. This method is used to collect ground truth data for evaluating saliency and attention in visualizations. Despite prior research focusing on factors affecting visual prominence and ranking visual variables for data encoding, few guidelines discuss how different emphasis effects are perceived by viewers in visualizations. In evaluations, the perception of visual prominence and effectiveness of emphasis effects at various intensity levels are studied. Data visualizations serve to reveal patterns and communicate information, requiring designers to draw attention to specific data points. Two studies experimentally evaluate how emphasis effects are experienced by viewers. The first study aimed to determine the visual prominence of emphasis effects using different visual variables in scatterplot visualizations. It gathered eye-tracking data, mouse clicks, and subjective ratings. The second study increased the complexity by using a subset of the MASSVIS dataset. The theoretical framework was based on emphasis effects in data visualizations developed by Hall et al. The study extends previous work by analyzing the visual prominence of emphasis effects in visualizations using eye-tracking metrics, click data, and subjective ratings. The data collected allows for a better understanding of how users perceive and interact with emphasis techniques in visualization software. The study analyzed visual emphasis effects in visualizations using eye-tracking metrics, click data, and subjective ratings. Three visual variables - colour, blur/focus, and size - were chosen for the study to measure relative perceptibility. Emphasizing elements with colour involves changing the hue to stand out, while size emphasizes by increasing the element's area. Size and colour changes are commonly used to indicate importance in visualizations. Emphasizing an element with blur/focus involves applying a blur filter to all elements except the emphasized one, creating a qualitative difference from color and size emphasis. Different levels of emphasis were tested by varying mark sizes, color differences, and blur strength, allowing for comparisons based on the \"magnitude of difference.\" The study tested different levels of emphasis by varying mark sizes, color differences, and blur strength to determine the \"magnitude of difference.\" Color differences were measured using a color difference metric called \u2206E, which normalizes the color space for a closer fit between perceptual and geometric differences. \u2206E allows for a more accurate comparison of a wider range of colors. The study utilized a color difference metric called \u2206E to compare differences in a range of colors. Eight fixed color differences were chosen, ranging from \u2206E 10 to \u2206E 45, showing increasing perceptibility of emphasized elements. Additionally, eight fixed size differences and blur intensities were tested to determine the magnitude of difference. The study tested eight different blur intensities for blur/focus effects on visualizations, ranging from 1 to 8. Size and blur/focus do not have difference metrics like color's \u2206E, so levels were chosen to cover a wide range of perceived prominence. Two studies were conducted to measure perceptibility of emphasis effects and magnitude levels using scatterplot visualizations. Participants in the study interacted with visualizations using an eye tracker, with data recorded and analyzed. Twenty-one participants were recruited, with three excluded, leaving eighteen participants who received a $10 honorarium. The average age of participants was 26. Participants in the study, aged 26 on average, received a $10 honorarium. They had normal vision, were experienced with mouse-and-windows applications, and completed a color vision test. Eyetracker calibration was done before they explored scatterplot visualizations. Participants in the study explored scatterplot visualizations with target and distractor marks, assessing visual prominence on a 1-7 scale after each trial. The study involved participants rating the visual prominence of target marks on a 1-7 scale. An analysis was conducted to compare the perceptibility of emphasis effects using various visual variables and magnitudes of difference. Dependent measures included time to eye fixation, time to mouse click, total fixation time, and subjective rating of emphasis. The analysis results were used to explore differences between emphasis effects and develop an equivalence model. Time to target was also analyzed based on emphasis effect and magnitude of difference. The study analyzed the differences in emphasis effect and magnitude of difference on participant's time to target fixation, target click, and fixation time in an Area of Interest (AOI) surrounding the emphasized visual target. Significant effects were found for Emphasis Effect and Magnitude of Difference on time to target fixation, with participants fixating fastest in the Blur/Focus condition. Post-hoc tests showed significant differences between conditions. Participants in the study showed differences in time to target fixation and target click based on emphasis effect and magnitude of difference. Emphasis on Blur resulted in the fastest fixation time, followed by Size and Colour. Significant differences were found between emphasis pairs, except for Blur \u2192 Size. Time to target click was also influenced by emphasis effect and magnitude of difference, with participants clicking on focused targets fastest in the Blur condition. Holm-corrected post-hoc tests revealed significant differences between emphasis pairs. The study found significant differences in time to target fixation and click based on emphasis effect and magnitude of difference. Emphasis on Blur resulted in the fastest fixation time, with differences between emphasis pairs except for Blur \u2192 Size. Time to target click was fastest at Magnitude 7 and slowest at Magnitude 1. Fixation time was influenced by Magnitude of Difference, with no difference between Emphasis Effects. Participants rated the visually prominent data point after each visualization. Results from the study showed that emphasis on sharp objects in the Focus/Blur condition was perceived as most visually prominent, followed by Size and Colour. Participants were asked to state which emphasis effect they found most visually prominent, least prominent, and provide additional comments on their responses. Overall, focus/blur was found to be the most visually prominent emphasis effect. Overall, focus/blur was perceived as the most visually prominent emphasis effect, with participants favoring blur/focus for its ability to make certain data points stand out clearly. Size emphasis was also noted for its ease in quick comparisons. Participants favored size emphasis for quick comparisons, noting it is easier for the eye to visualize a bigger/smaller size compared to color differences. The raw data from Study 1 was used to build predictive models for time to target fixation, time to click, and subjective rating of emphasis. Simple logarithmic functions were fitted to the data using R to capture the main differences between the emphasis effects examined. The fitted logarithmic curves for time to target fixation, time to click, and subjective ratings are shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5. The accuracy of the fitted functions varied, with time to fixation being moderately accurate, while time to click and subjective ratings showed higher accuracy. The models revealed that color was less perceptible compared to size and blur/focus, which were more similar in performance data and subjective ratings. Size and blur/focus showed differences in subjective ratings, especially at different levels. The models developed in the study show clear differences in subjective ratings for blur/focus and color effects, with potential for equivalence calculations between effects. Validation is needed to ensure robustness across different visualizations, as some may include additional factors like background graphics and annotations that could impact perception. The study evaluated emphasis effects in complex visualizations from the MASSVIS database, containing 5000 static data visualizations from various sources. 16 visualizations were selected to cover different types, aiming to understand how users perceive emphasis effects in diverse visualizations. The study included a subset of 16 visualizations from the dataset, covering various visualization types such as maps and scatter plots. Each visualization had one emphasis effect applied to evaluate user perception. Baseline graphics were included to compare user perception of emphasized areas. Mark sizes, color differences, and blur strength were sampled along three uniform steps for comparison. Participants explored each visualization after providing consent and calibrating the eye-tracker. Participants were instructed to explore visualizations and click on the most emphasized area. Test graphics had one emphasized mark, while baseline graphics had none. After each presentation, participants rated the perceived visual prominence. Twenty participants (9 male, 9 female, 2 non-binary) with an average age of 26 were included in the study. Participants in the study had normal vision, experience with mouse-and-windows applications, and some visualization experience. The study used a repeated-measures design with factors like Emphasis Effect and Magnitude of Difference. Various dependent variables were measured, including time to fixate on target and subjective rating of perceived emphasis. Analysis showed no main effect of Emphasis Effect on time to target fixation, but did find an effect of Magnitude. The study found no main effect of Emphasis Effect on time to target fixation, but did find an effect of Magnitude of Difference. There was an Emphasis Effect \u00d7 Magnitude of Difference interaction, with significant differences between each magnitude-of-difference pair. Time to click on an emphasized data point was fastest at a Magnitude of Difference of 7 and slowest at a Magnitude of 1. A RM-ANOVA showed main effects of Emphasis Effect and Magnitude of Difference on target click time, with an interaction between the two factors. In Study 1, emphasis on focused targets resulted in the fastest click times, followed by Size and Colour. Post-hoc tests showed significant differences between emphasis pairs. Fixation time varied based on Emphasis Effect and Magnitude of Difference, with a higher magnitude gathering more attention. In Study 1, emphasis on focused targets resulted in the fastest click times, followed by Size and Colour. Fixation time varied based on Emphasis Effect and Magnitude of Difference, with a higher magnitude gathering more attention. Significant differences were found for Magnitude of Difference, but not for Emphasis Effects. Participants rated visual prominence of emphasized data points, with RM-ANOVA showing main effects for Emphasis Effect, Magnitude of Difference, and an interaction between the two. Participants in the study provided their preferences and comments on emphasis effects, with comments echoing the findings. They mentioned how the focus/blur effect helped them identify content quickly, with some preferring the emphasized point that stood out more due to contrast. Others mentioned that size always drew their immediate attention. The participants in the study provided feedback on emphasis effects in visualizations, mentioning how focus/blur and size helped them identify content quickly. The models from Study 1 were used to predict data in Study 2, showing a correlation between predicted and empirical values for time to target fixation and click. The correlation between emphasis effects and perceptibility was high across different visualization situations. Study 1 used plain scatterplots, while Study 2 used more complex visualizations with background graphics and colors. Despite some differences, both studies showed strong correlation scores. The color effect was less perceivable in both studies, while the blur/focus effect was consistently more prominent. In Study 2, there was a noticeable improvement in performance with emphasis effects, particularly with MASSVIS visualizations. The predicted values closely matched the real values, especially in subjective responses. This finding is valuable for understanding the relationship between emphasis effects and perceptibility. The study found that the user's perception of emphasis may be more important for designers than gaze patterns or click behavior. Inaccuracies in predictions were noted at level 7, possibly due to cluttered visualizations causing visual crowding and difficulty in recognizing objects. The study investigated how users perceive color, size, and blur/focus as emphasis effects in visualizations. Findings showed that composite blobs in visualizations with varying-size elements may lead to visual crowding, impacting the effectiveness of size emphasis. This anomaly highlights the importance of having a predictive model to identify unexpected results for further investigation. The study found that blur/focus led to the fastest target fixation and click, while size also had a significant impact on performance and visual prominence. Increasing the magnitude of the effect consistently increased visual prominence. A predictive model based on logarithmic curves accurately predicted emphasis in both studies. The findings and models can assist designers in building visualizations with emphasis. The study found that blur/focus led to the fastest target fixation and click, while size also had a significant impact on performance and visual prominence. The blur effect guarantees no competing visual stimuli, unlike size and color techniques. Size has a relative advantage over color due to color differences being limited. The study results show that size differences have an unlimited upper end compared to color differences. A predictive model built from Study 1 data accurately predicted results in Study 2, indicating consistent perception of emphasis between experimental settings. The model also identified areas for further exploration. The study results indicate that size differences have a significant impact on perception, with anomalies in response times for the MASSVIS dataset and anomalous performance at level 7. The size-at-level-seven anomaly suggests that visual crowding and size variance from overlapping data points can interfere with emphasis perception in real-world visualizations. This highlights the importance of considering planned emphasis effects in conjunction with other visual elements. The study emphasizes the importance of considering planned emphasis effects in conjunction with other visual elements. Equivalence metrics are needed for designers to switch emphasis effects and preserve prominence when interference is discovered. Visual crowding and size variance can affect emphasis perception in real-world visualizations. The decision not to control the distance between points in Study 1 provides a valid representation of the challenges faced by designers in emphasizing elements in crowded visualizations. Global effects like blur/focus are less impacted by visual crowding as blurring nontargets can eliminate them from view, leaving only the focused element visible. The overall visual complexity of an image can be quantified and added to models in future studies. These findings are relevant for various visualization contexts, helping designers draw attention to important data points. Further research will explore additional visual variables. The study suggests that global visual effects like blur/focus can enhance visual prominence, especially in crowded visualizations. Blurring non-target elements can increase noticeability, but may not be suitable for detailed inspections. Predictive models for visual prominence can aid designers in creating effective visualizations. The study suggests that global visual effects like blur/focus can enhance visual prominence in crowded visualizations. Predictive models can aid designers in creating effective visualizations by understanding general relationships and approximate relative magnitudes of perception. The model was most accurate at predicting people's subjective ratings of prominence, raising the question of which metric is most important for designers to consider. Designers can utilize color to emphasize data points, but should consider users with color perception issues. Future work will evaluate different visual cues for emphasis effects. The findings can be applied in interface design for providing visual feedback during tasks in software like web browsers. The visual feedback during \"find\" tasks in software varies, with different methods like color highlighting or size increase. Designers can use perceived visual prominence to guide user attention effectively. Studies tested scatterplot presentations, with plans to extend to other visualizations and scenarios in the future. The study focuses on investigating visualizations that emphasize multiple points and testing predictions of the model regarding user fixation on different emphasized data elements. The difference levels for visual variables in the experiments aim to be generalizable for designing emphasized elements in typical visualizations. Further studies will explore the magnitude of emphasis in visual feedback during tasks. The study aims to investigate emphasis effects in visualizations using various visual variables. Factors such as clutter, mappings of visual variables, and generalization considerations are important. While color perception models assume perfect viewing conditions, real-world complexities like lighting and display devices may impact visual perception. Future work could involve larger user samples and different viewing conditions. There are opportunities to extend findings by exploring emphasis effects with static visual variables. Future research should investigate emphasis effects with dynamic visual variables such as flicker or motion and extend results to interactive visualizations. Evaluation of emphasis effects can be done through user attention maps on visualizations. The CIE2000 color model was used for its methodological validation in past studies, but future work may consider other models. Future work may consider using different color difference models or spaces, such as CIECAM02, to improve accuracy in color perception for visualization design. Emphasis in InfoVis is crucial for drawing attention and indicating importance, but designers struggle to compare different emphasis effects. Two user studies were conducted to evaluate the visual prominence of emphasis effects like blur/focus, color, and size, leading to the development of a predictive model for equivalence between effects. These studies lay the groundwork for understanding visual effects in design. Two studies lay the foundation for understanding how visual effects are experienced by viewers in visualizations, providing valuable information for designers looking to control emphasis effects perception."
