Eligibility for these benefits is based on specific criteria, and a two-step process is used to evaluate claims. To be eligible for most VA benefits, the claimant must be a veteran or a survivor/dependent of a veteran. A veteran is defined as someone who served in the military and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. The VA relies on military service records to determine veteran status for benefits. To be eligible for most VA benefits, a claimant must have active military service, certified by a representative with special training. The document must detail the length, time, and character of the service, and be verified as genuine by the VA. If the required documentation is not provided, the VA will verify the military service directly. Active military service includes full-time service in various branches, excluding active duty for training. Active service for VA benefits includes full-time service in branches like the Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and others, as well as duty for training or inactive duty for training if disabled or deceased from duty-related causes. Determination of active duty is outlined in law, such as disability or death during authorized travel to training. For VA benefits, active service includes full-time service in branches like the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, as well as duty for training. Determining active service eligibility can be complex, requiring scrutiny of service records to fit into specific categories. Enlistment dates determine minimum service requirements for veterans, with exceptions for those who enlisted before or after September 8, 1980. Exceptions exist to the minimum service requirements for VA benefits. For example, service-connected disability compensation benefits are exempt from the length of service rule. Other exceptions include claims for VA life insurance benefits, hardship discharges, and service-related disability retirements. If a veteran did not complete the full period of active duty and served less than 24 months without meeting any exceptions, they are not eligible for benefits under Title 38 or any law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The statutory definition of veteran requires discharge under conditions other than dishonorable. There are five types of discharges: honorable discharge, discharge under honorable conditions, discharge under other than honorable conditions, bad conduct discharge, and dishonorable discharge. The VA determines on a case-by-case basis if a discharge qualifies as under conditions other than dishonorable. Honorable discharges and discharges under honorable conditions are generally considered qualifying. The VA reviews discharges to determine if they qualify as conditions other than dishonorable, with honorable and honorable conditions discharges usually qualifying as veteran status for benefits eligibility. Other discharges like bad conduct may require a special determination by the VA based on the facts of the case. Different discharge categories may apply for multiple enlistment periods. VA benefits eligibility is determined by discharge status, with dishonorable and bad conduct discharges potentially barring benefits. Veterans in prison or on parole may still be eligible for benefits, but those with outstanding felony warrants are not. Benefits may be awarded in certain cases, such as when the individual was found to be insane at the time of the offense leading to discharge. Wartime or peacetime service classification can also impact eligibility for benefits, with only veterans with wartime service qualifying for certain benefits like Improved Pension for low-income veterans. Improved Pension pays benefits to low-income veterans with wartime service, defined by specific periods designated by Congress. Veterans must have served 90 consecutive days, with at least one day during a wartime period. Congress has designated eight wartime periods, including Indian Wars, Spanish-American War, Mexican Border Period, and World War I. Members of the National Guard and reserve components must meet the same standards as other claimants to be eligible for VA benefits. However, they may not meet the active duty or length of service requirements, making them ineligible for benefits in many cases. National Guard and reserve members must serve full period of active duty to meet requirements for VA benefits. They may qualify as veterans if disabled or die from duty-related causes. Eligibility for benefits can be complex, including education benefits and home loans with certain conditions. The GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 recognized the service of certain civilian groups in World War I and World War II as active duty for VA benefits. The Secretary of Defense can determine civilian or contractor service as active duty for VA benefits. The Secretary of Defense can determine certain groups as active duty for VA benefits, including health care. Regulations specify the groups eligible for benefits, with a review board making recommendations to the Secretary for final decisions. Changes to regulations were made in 1989 in response to a court ruling. The Department of Defense has not clarified factors and criteria in their directive regarding P.L. 95-202. Certain groups from World War I and World War II have been granted active duty status, including Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASPs) and Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit. These veterans are eligible for VA burial benefits, including interment in VA National Cemeteries. Legislation enacted in 2016 allows for inurnment in the Columbarium at Arlington Cemetery for these veterans. Merchant mariners, who engage in maritime activities, are also included. Merchant mariners who engage in certain maritime activities, such as transporting military equipment by sea, are generally not considered veterans for VA benefits. However, according to regulations under P.L. 95-202, certain groups of merchant mariners are considered veterans for VA program eligibility, including those who served on blockships in support of Operation Mulberry in World War II and those who served in oceangoing service during the armed conflict between December 7, 1941, and August 15, 1945. Additionally, under P.L. 105-368, merchant mariners may qualify for interment or inurnment at a VA National Cemetery and VA burial benefits if they were members of the United States Merchant Marine or Army Transport Service. Members of the United States Merchant Marine, Army Transport Service, or Naval Transport Service who served between August 16, 1945, and December 31, 1946 are eligible for benefits."
