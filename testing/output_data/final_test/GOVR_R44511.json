    "content": "The pricing of prescription drugs is a concern for U.S. consumers due to rising healthcare costs. Some studies show that drugs are cheaper in foreign markets. Several bills in Congress aim to allow importing lower-cost drugs from abroad, with varying restrictions on the source countries. None of these bills have been passed. The debate on importing lower-cost prescription drugs from abroad has not resulted in any enacted bills in the 114th Congress. This practice, known as \"parallel importation\" or \"re-importation,\" raises intellectual property concerns related to patent rights in the United States. Brand-name firms can use their patent rights to block unauthorized importation of prescription drugs, even if they are deemed safe and effective for domestic use. The debate on parallel importation of patented pharmaceuticals involves a trade-off between encouraging innovation and promoting access to medicines. Some believe that reducing patent rights may hinder future drug development, while others argue that high drug prices in the US warrant a reevaluation of the patent system's role in regulating global trade. This report examines intellectual property laws and policies related to parallel importation of pharmaceuticals. The report discusses property laws and policies on parallel importation of patented pharmaceuticals in the US, including legal frameworks, exhaustion doctrines, and legislative issues. The patent system aims to promote technological information dissemination and inventive activity by preventing free riders from duplicating inventions. The patent system aims to prevent free riders from underselling inventors and hindering technological progress. It allows inventors to profit from their inventions by granting them exclusive rights for a limited time. Additionally, without patent laws, inventors may keep their inventions as trade secrets, which does not benefit society or discourage duplicative research. The patent system requires inventors to disclose their inventions in issued patents to avoid inefficiencies. The Patent Act of 1952 aims to stimulate technological advancement by encouraging individuals to invent around patented technology. Critics argue that market forces already create enough incentive for innovation without the need for patents. Some argue that successful inventors may become complacent and use patents to stifle innovation, while others point out that major inventions in industries like biotechnology and software arose without patent protection. Despite differing views, there is no empirical evidence proving that patents lead to more innovation. U.S. patent rights must be applied for under the Patent Act of 1952. Inventors must submit applications to the USPTO for patent protection. Examiners assess the application for disclosure, clarity, and fulfillment of patent standards. An invention must be useful, novel, and nonobvious to be patentable. A nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of a competent artisan at the time the invention was made. If the USPTO allows the patent to issue, the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing into the United States the patented invention. The term of the patent is ordinarily set at twenty years from the date the patent application was filed, providing inventors with limited periods of exclusivity. Patent rights require monitoring by the patentee to ensure others are not using the patented invention. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over patent appeals from district courts, with the U.S. Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes special enforcement rules for pharmaceutical patents, allowing brand-name firms to protect their patents against generic competitors. The Hatch-Waxman Act extends patent terms for regulatory delays, exempts certain activities from infringement, allows challenges to patent validity, and provides marketing exclusivity independent of patents. Patent rights are restricted by the exhaustion doctrine, depleting rights after an authorized sale. The exhaustion doctrine depletes patent rights after an authorized sale, allowing purchasers to use or resell patented goods without interference from the patentee. This is also known as the \"first sale rule.\" For example, if a consumer buys a patented appliance and later sells it, the patent rights are extinguished with respect to that item. The exhaustion doctrine allows purchasers to freely sell patented goods after an authorized sale, extinguishing the patent rights. U.S. patents only provide rights within the United States, requiring inventors to obtain patents in foreign countries separately. Multinational corporations often secure corresponding patents in various jurisdictions. Multinational corporations often obtain national patents for their inventions in different jurisdictions. These patents, governed by the Paris Convention, have varying legal effects due to differences in wording, translations, and national patent laws. Each national patent is an independent legal instrument, requiring individual enforcement. Following litigation in Canada, a court rules that the Canadian patent is invalid, but this does not affect the validity or enforceability of the U.S. patent. Price disparities between the United States and other nations can lead to parallel importation, where individuals purchase medications from abroad to lower healthcare costs. The term \"parallel imports\" refers to patented products distributed abroad and sold in the U.S. without permission. Two positions exist on using patent rights to block parallel importation, one being \"international exhaustion.\" This allows importers to lawfully purchase authentic goods from the patent holder. The U.S. patent right is subject to \"international exhaustion\" due to a foreign sale, but the Federal Circuit supports \"national exhaustion,\" allowing the patent to be enforced against imports. This doctrine limits exhaustion to domestic sales only. The Federal Circuit's exhaustion doctrine limits patent rights to domestic sales only, allowing patents to block unauthorized imports. The Supreme Court's ruling in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons introduced an \"international exhaustion\" principle for copyrights, creating a contrast with the \"national exhaustion\" principle applied to patents. The case involved Supap Kirtsaeng, a Thai national studying in the U.S., who found textbooks cheaper in Thailand and imported them to sell in the U.S. The Supreme Court ruled in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons that the \"international exhaustion\" principle applies to copyright law. This means that works lawfully purchased abroad and imported into the U.S. are protected from copyright infringement claims under the first sale doctrine. The Court based its decision on statutory provisions and the belief that international exhaustion is sound intellectual property policy. The Supreme Court ruled in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons that the \"international exhaustion\" principle applies to copyright law. This means that works lawfully purchased abroad and imported into the U.S. are protected from copyright infringement claims under the first sale doctrine. The Court observed that technology companies claim various products contain copyrightable software programs or packaging, many of which are made abroad with the American copyright holder's permission. This ruling would prevent the resale of items like cars without permission from each copyright holder, potentially impacting foreign car owners selling their used cars without permission. The Federal Circuit revisited the international exhaustion of patented products following the Supreme Court's decision in Kirtsaeng. In the 2016 case of Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc., the court rejected the doctrine of \"international exhaustion\" for patents. Unlike copyright law, the patent exhaustion doctrine only applies to sales within the United States due to the lack of specific provisions in the Patent Act. Judge Taranto highlighted the differences in patent rights between countries as a reason for this distinction. Patent rights can vary significantly between countries, unlike copyright. The Federal Circuit rejected the doctrine of \"international exhaustion\" for patents in the Lexmark International, Inc. v. Impression Products, Inc. case. Judge Taranto emphasized the differences in patent rights between countries as a reason for this distinction. The Federal Circuit's ruling in Lexmark v. Impression Products rejects international exhaustion for patents, allowing brand-name drug companies to block imports of patented medications into the United States. This raises issues of patent infringement and parallel importation of pharmaceuticals. The report discusses issues related to state and local governments importing patented medications, potential use of label licenses on drugs, and implications of international trade rules set by the WTO. Some governments have considered importing prescription drugs, posing complexities for patentees due to the Eleventh Amendment. This creates a dilemma as federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over patent infringement cases. Recent judicial developments have impacted patent infringement litigation, creating a dilemma for patentees. In Ouellette v. Mills, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine found a state statute allowing drug importation from foreign pharmacies unconstitutional. The court ruled that federal law preempts state legislation in this area, potentially affecting similar laws in other jurisdictions. This could have implications for patent enforcement against state and local governments in prescription drug cases. The exhaustion doctrine allows lawful purchasers of patented goods to use or resell them without interference from the patent owner. Label licenses or bag tags, such as \"Single Use Only,\" may be used to restrict a customer's use of a product. The exhaustion doctrine allows purchasers of patented goods to use or resell them without interference. Label licenses, like \"For Use in Canada Only,\" may impose restrictions, but the Court of Appeals generally upholds them unless there are exceptional circumstances. This legal theory allows patent proprietors to impose restrictions on the use of their products when sold. Under current law, label licenses such as \"Single Use Only\" or \"For Domestic Use Only\" are enforceable, and violating them could lead to liability for breach of contract and patent infringement. The legal issues surrounding pharmaceutical importation involve both contract and patent law. The TRIPS Agreement, signed by the United States as a member of the WTO, requires countries to enact patent statutes that allow patents to be enjoyed without discrimination. Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement requires equal treatment for all classes of inventions under patent laws, with minor exceptions. It prohibits countries from granting lesser proprietary rights to pharmaceutical patents compared to other inventions. The agreement also imposes obligations on national treatment and most-favored-nation status. The TRIPS Agreement imposes obligations of national treatment and most-favored-nation status. It requires equal treatment for all classes of inventions under patent laws, with minor exceptions. The agreement does not impose restrictions on the exhaustion doctrine beyond these obligations. This allows for different treatment of patented inventions, such as allowing re-importation of certain types like pharmaceuticals. The TRIPS Agreement requires equal treatment for all classes of inventions under patent laws, with minor exceptions. Bilateral free trade agreements, like the United States-Morocco FTA and United States-Australia FTA, include provisions on intellectual property rights, specifically on pharmaceutical patents and importation rights. Article 17:9 of the United States\u2013Australia FTA and Article 16:7 of the United States\u2013Singapore FTA both address the exclusive rights of patent owners regarding importation of patented products. These agreements ensure that patent owners have the right to prevent importation without their consent, even if the product has been sold or distributed outside the territory. The provisions in these agreements are similar to those in the TRIPS Agreement, focusing on pharmaceutical patents and importation rights. The United States is obligated to allow pharmaceutical patent holders to use their intellectual property rights to block parallel imports, especially when restrictions on importation are in place through contracts. Congressional interest in this area offers various options for addressing unauthorized infringement actions. Congress has various options to address unauthorized infringement actions, including confirming the Federal Circuit's decision in Lexmark v. Impression Products or introducing an international exhaustion doctrine into U.S. patent law. The TRIPS Agreement does not require adopting the doctrine as an all-or-nothing proposition, allowing Congress to limit its application to specific inventions like patented pharmaceuticals without significant ramifications. One approach to implementing the international exhaustion doctrine into U.S. patent law is to declare that importing goods sold abroad by a patent owner is not infringement. For example, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2004 aimed to exempt patented pharmaceuticals from infringement if first sold abroad by the patent owner or licensee. The amendment under S. 2328 aims to preserve the rights of patent owners and licensees to enforce their patents, particularly in the pharmaceutical field. It may also imply that the international exhaustion doctrine does not apply to non-pharmaceutical patented inventions. Additionally, the Patent Act of 1952 includes provisions to promote the importation of patented drugs and immunize individuals from infringement liability in the area of patented medical methods. The Patent Act of 1952, as amended, exempts licensed medical practitioners and certain health care entities from patent infringement in medical methods. Potential patent infringers in drug importation include importers, distributors, wholesalers, pharmacies, and consumers. Congress could consider an explicit infringement exemption to promote parallel trade in pharmaceuticals. Label licenses should be considered in legal changes to patent laws. Even if drug importation is exempt from infringement, firms can still restrict use through contract law. Legal changes may need to consider firms using contractual provisions as a substitute for patent protection in prescription drug importation. Balancing the goals of controlling drug costs and encouraging new drug development may conflict. Introducing international exhaustion into U.S. patent law could lower drug prices but reduce incentives for research and development. Patent law reforms would likely be considered in the context of drug costs. Consideration of patent law reforms in the context of drug costs, influenced by various factors like pricing policies of foreign nations, profits of intermediaries, and shipment costs into the US. Balancing access to medications and promoting new drug development by pharmaceutical firms is a key concern in the drug importation debate."
