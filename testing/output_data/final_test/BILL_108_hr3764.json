    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Pathways Advancing Career Training Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Pathways Advancing Career Training Act\" aims to provide assistance to displaced homemakers, single parents, and individuals pursuing nontraditional occupations by offering preparatory services, education and training programs, support services, and referral services to create workforce pathways and meet the employment needs of a high skilled, high wage information technology economy. Congress recognizes the importance of a quality, diverse workforce to compete globally and acknowledges the education and training needs of these individuals. Displaced homemakers, single parents, and individuals in nontraditional occupations face challenges in existing systems. They can fill unfilled positions in the information technology sector, offering economic independence through high-wage careers. Sex-segregated vocational education programs hinder female participation in high-skill, high-wage jobs, especially in technology and skilled trades. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"community-based organization\" refers to a nonprofit organization that provides educational services to the community. A \"displaced homemaker\" is someone who previously relied on a family member's income but is now unemployed or underemployed. The term \"eligible State agency\" refers to the State board responsible for vocational and technical education. An \"eligible recipient\" includes community-based organizations, vocational schools, and other entities catering to displaced homemakers and students in nontraditional training programs. A \"local educational agency\" is defined as per section 14101. The term \"preparatory services\" refers to programs designed to assist individuals not enrolled in education or training programs in preparing for participation in such programs. The curr_chunk discusses services provided by postsecondary vocational institutions, including outreach, counseling, vocational assessment, and other programs. It also defines terms like postsecondary vocational institution, secondary school, Secretary, and self-sufficiency standard. The \"self-sufficiency standard\" measures the income needed by families to cover basic costs without subsidies, considering factors like location, family size, and composition. It also defines terms like \"single parent\" and \"services\" related to education and training activities. The Secretary of Education is authorized to provide grants to States for programs described in section 8. Funds will be allocated based on the population ratio of each State. The funds should supplement, not supplant, other public funds for displaced homemakers, single parents, and students in nontraditional occupations. States must develop or enhance programs as part of a state plan. Each eligible State agency must submit a 5-year plan to the Secretary, with annual revisions as needed. The agency should also conduct a review after the second year and make any necessary revisions to the plan. The State agency can consult with experts, students in specific programs, and other individuals when developing the plan. The State plan must include preparatory services, vocational education activities for single parents, displaced homemakers, and students in nontraditional training. It should detail the process for awarding funds, provide professional development, evaluate program effectiveness annually, and coordinate programs effectively. The State plan must ensure coordination of programs to avoid duplication, compliance with Act requirements, and prohibit funds for equipment benefiting purchasing entities or affiliates. The eligible State agency will measure and report the progress of students served under the Act, including participation in vocational programs, completion of nontraditional training, attainment of diplomas, and placement in postsecondary education. The eligible State agency will provide technical assistance to recipients and coordinate programs with other Federal programs under the Act. The eligible State agency may submit a plan under the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 to fulfill requirements. The Secretary will approve a plan within 120 days unless it does not meet the section's requirements. SEC. 7. ACCOUNTABILITY. The purpose of this section is to establish activities to assess the effectiveness of career and technical education in serving specific groups and to maximize the return on investment of Federal funds. Each eligible State agency must collect data on core indicators of performance, including participation in preparatory services, completion of career and technical education programs, and attainment of a secondary school diploma. The eligible State agency must report data on core indicators of performance, including attainment of a secondary school diploma, postsecondary education or training, military service, and nontraditional employment. Data must be disaggregated by gender, race, age, disability, national origin, ethnicity, and English proficiency status. The Secretary is required to submit an annual national report to Congress on the achievements of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998. Programs for single parents, displaced homemakers, and nontraditional employment are addressed in Section 8. Each State may use funds provided under section 9 to provide programs for single parents and displaced homemakers, including subsidies, tuition assistance, career guidance, and counseling services to prepare individuals for employment and economic self-sufficiency. Additionally, programs for secondary and postsecondary education are also supported. Programs for secondary and postsecondary students focus on nontraditional training and employment, offering services like preparatory programs, counseling, tuition assistance, and activities to develop skills for high-wage careers in fields like information technology. Additionally, there are programs to increase awareness of nontraditional occupations and ensure a respectful learning environment for all career and technical education students. Model programs aim to increase participation, completion, and placement rates in nontraditional employment for technical education students. SEC. 9. WITHIN STATE ALLOCATION AND ADMINISTRATION. From the amounts allocated under section 5, not more than 5 percent shall be reserved for State administration. Each eligible State agency receiving funds must match the funds received under section 9. States participating in the program must assign an individual to administer vocational education programs and gather data on program effectiveness. The State administrator is responsible for developing, managing, monitoring, and evaluating vocational education programs. They also provide technical assistance, distribute funds, and ensure grants are awarded competitively for effective programs. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and additional funds for the following 4 years."
