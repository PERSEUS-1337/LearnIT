The Secretary of Energy, in collaboration with the Secretary of the Treasury, will conduct a study on the effectiveness of energy efficiency tax incentives. Recommendations for increasing participation will be included in a report to Congress within one year. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to extend the Energy Efficient Appliance Rebate Program until 2015. SEC. 8. Solar energy systems building permit requirements for Community Development Block Grant funds. Section 104 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 is amended to include new requirements for building permits regarding solar energy systems. Grants under section 106 can only be made if the grantee certifies that the cost of permits for solar energy system construction complies with specified conditions. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 is amended to include new requirements for building permits related to solar energy systems. Grants under section 106 must certify that the cost of permits for solar energy system construction meets specific conditions. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 is amended to include new requirements for building permits related to solar energy systems. Permits for solar energy system construction must comply with cost limitations, not exceeding $500 for residential structures and 1.0 percent of total installation cost for nonresidential structures. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 now includes requirements for building permits for solar energy systems. Noncompliance with certification may result in ineligibility for grants under section 106 for a certain period. A solar energy system uses equipment to generate solar energy for a structure. A solar energy system utilizes equipment to generate solar energy for a structure. Prohibition of restrictions on residential installation of solar energy systems. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, must issue regulations within 180 days to prohibit any restrictions that hinder the installation of solar energy systems on residential properties designed for single-family occupancy. Approval for installation must be processed in the same manner as any other application. The regulations must ensure that any restrictions on solar energy system installation in single-family residential properties are not unreasonably delayed, costly, or prohibitive. Additionally, any fees imposed on owners or lessees for such installations must be deemed reasonable. The term \"solar energy system\" refers to equipment using solar energy to generate electricity, heat, cool, or provide hot water for a structure. The regulations ensure that any restrictions on solar energy system installation are not unreasonably costly or prohibitive. SEC. 10. CENTER FOR ADVANCED SOLAR RESEARCH. The Secretary of Energy will establish a Center for Advanced Solar Research and Development to promote the further development of solar technologies through a competitive grant program for academia and private research. The Center will support research, development, and demonstration of advanced solar energy systems, focusing on improving performance, reliability, environmental impact, and cost-competitiveness of solar technologies, large-scale photovoltaic and solar thermal power plants, and storage technologies for enhanced dispatchability of solar energy. The Center for Advanced Solar Research and Development will focus on promoting solar technologies through a grant program. It will support research on improving performance, reliability, and cost-competitiveness of solar energy systems, including fuel production, manufacturing techniques, materials for photovoltaic conversion, policy analysis, and solar systems integration. $250,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2007 to 2011 for this purpose."
