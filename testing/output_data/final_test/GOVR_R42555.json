    "content": "President Obama requested Congress for authority to consolidate business- and trade-related functions of six federal entities into one department in 2012. This move was driven by U.S. policy interest in enhancing government trade functions to promote exports and employment, especially in response to economic challenges and global competition from emerging markets like China, Brazil, and India. The goal was to improve efficiency by reducing duplication of functions. The report discusses President Obama's trade reorganization proposal to improve government service efficiency, reduce duplication, and enhance coordination. Congress would have a significant role in the debate, with options like oversight, consultations, granting reorganizational authority, and enacting legislation. Key issues, policy options, and the outlook for trade reorganization are also covered. This report focuses on the substantive aspect of the trade reorganization debate, including key federal agencies with trade functions and President Obama's comprehensive review of the U.S. export control system. The reorganization authority requested from Congress and the President's reform initiative are also discussed in separate reports. In the 2011 State of the Union Address, President Obama called for reorganizing the federal government to be more competent and efficient, specifically focusing on agencies with export-related functions. He directed the Office of Management and Budget to review these agencies for overlap, duplication, and cost-saving opportunities. Recommendations for reorganizing and streamlining these functions have not been publicly released. President Obama requested Congress for authority to consolidate business- and trade-related functions of six federal agencies into one department. The reorganization authority, dormant since 1984, would allow the President to present plans to Congress under an expedited process. Draft legislation titled the Reforming and Consolidating Government Act of 2012 was sent to Congress on February 16, 2012, to reinstate the authority to reorganize the executive branch. President Obama requested Congress for authority to consolidate business- and trade-related functions of six federal agencies into one department. A bill was introduced in the House (H.R. 4409, Barrow) in April 2012. The proposed new department aims to streamline trade functions and would be organized into four pillars. Elements of the Commerce Department not associated with these pillars could be transferred to other agencies. The USTR may be transferred to the Department of the Interior, maintaining Cabinet-level status. The proposed new department aims to save $3 billion over 10 years and reduce 1,000 to 2,000 jobs through attrition. President Obama has requested reorganizational authority from Congress and taken administrative actions to enhance trade and investment programs. On February 17, 2012, the President issued a memorandum to enhance trade and investment programs. The memorandum focuses on the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) and the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC), directing them to develop strategies, present a unified federal trade budget, and ensure efficient use of resources. The President directed the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) to support the creation of BusinessUSA, an online platform for federal business programs. He also established the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center (ITEC) to strengthen enforcement of U.S. trade rights under trade agreements and U.S. law. The ITEC was created to combat unfair trade practices, but some policymakers argue it duplicates the USTR's mission. There are concerns about overlap with the IPR enforcement system. President Obama established the Interagency Task Force on Commercial Advocacy to support U.S. businesses competing for international contracts. The Administration is reviewing a proposal to reorganize the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) by consolidating business units to increase efficiency and effectiveness in supporting export opportunities. This includes potentially merging the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service unit and Market Access and Compliance unit. The role of Congress in international trade is based on powers outlined in Article 1. The role of Congress in international trade is based on powers outlined in Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Congress delegates significant authority to the executive branch, including trade negotiating authority to the President. The President directs overall trade policy and specific trade functions granted by statute. During the 98th Congress and the Reagan Administration, there was a push for trade reorganization to strengthen the federal government's role in U.S. trade and compete with other countries. This was driven by the need to reduce federal spending and eliminate unnecessary functions. Legislation introduced during the 104th Congress aimed to reorganize the U.S. trade policy structure by creating a \"Department of Trade\" that consolidated trade-related functions of various federal agencies. Proposals included merging agencies like USTR, Department of Commerce, Ex-Im Bank, OPIC, and TDA. Other suggestions involved incorporating departments like Energy, Labor, State, Transportation, and Treasury. These initiatives were developed during the Clinton Administration. During the 104th Congress, proposals were made to reorganize the U.S. trade policy structure by eliminating unnecessary functions and institutions, with a focus on the Department of Commerce. Bills aimed to transfer certain Commerce Department functions to other federal agencies and create a \"Department of Trade.\" The House passed H.R. 2491, and the Senate reported S. 929, both seeking to terminate the Department of Commerce. Enacting major structural reforms to merge trade agencies has proven politically difficult, with past proposals failing to be enacted due to challenges in reaching consensus among various interest groups. Turf battles among federal agencies have also hindered efforts to reorganize trade functions, prompting questions and debates over the impact on different stakeholders. The organizational structure of U.S. trade functions has evolved over time through actions by Congress and the executive branch. The USTR leads in formulating and coordinating trade policy, while the Department of Commerce administers various trade functions such as export assistance and controls. The U.S. Department of State was initially responsible for trade diplomacy and agreements, but in the 1960s, Congress became concerned about foreign policy overshadowing trade policy. The USTR now leads trade policy formulation, while the Department of Commerce handles export controls and assistance. The State Department and USTR jointly lead U.S. trade policy negotiations. Congress elevated the USTR position to ensure better representation of U.S. trade interests. The Trade Act of 1974 established the Office of the Special Trade Representative in the Executive Office of the President. The Office of the Special Trade Representative (STR) was established under the Trade Act of 1974 to administer U.S. trade agreements and serve as an \"executive broker.\" President Carter's Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1979 elevated the STR to the USTR, expanding its mandate to lead U.S. trade policy development and coordination. The USTR's role was strengthened by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, giving it lead responsibility for developing U.S. trade policy and conducting international trade negotiations. The Department of Commerce's role in administering trade policy has also expanded since the 1970s, with the establishment of the ITA consolidating various trade-related functions within the department. The shift in responsibility from the Treasury Department to the Commerce Department for administering AD and CVD laws and the Commercial Service arose from concerns about inadequate investigations and prioritization of trade promotion. The Export Enhancement Act of 1988 codified the establishment of the U.S Commercial Service in the ITA. The U.S. Commercial Service was established in the ITA, and federal trade agencies were reorganized under various initiatives. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the U.S. Customs Service to the newly created Department of Homeland Security. These agencies have different missions and conduct trade-related programs through interagency relationships. The federal agencies have an interagency process dating back to the 1950s to coordinate trade policy and conduct trade negotiations. Various legislation and executive actions have established mechanisms for coordinating U.S. trade functions, with the State Department playing a major role until the 1950s. The Special Representative for Trade Negotiations was established to centralize lead responsibility for trade policymaking. The interagency coordination of trade policymaking was centralized in the newly created trade official position in 1962. President Kennedy established the Trade Expansion Act Advisory Committee in 1963, composed of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations and various Secretaries. President Ford later replaced this committee with the Trade Policy Committee in 1975. The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) was created by the USTR-led interagency trade policy coordinating mechanism, authorized by Section 242 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It is the primary operating group for developing and reviewing policy papers and negotiating documents related to trade policy, composed of senior civil service members from various government departments. The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) is the primary group for developing and reviewing trade policy documents, seeking advice from the public and interagency consensus. If agreement is not reached, issues are referred to the Sub-Cabinet/Deputies level for further consideration. The Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG) coordinates U.S. government positions on international trade and investment issues at the sub-Cabinet/Deputies level. Disagreements are escalated to the Cabinet/Principals level for review, historically handled by the Trade Policy Committee (TPC) to provide guidance on trade issues to the President and USTR. The Trade Policy Committee (TPC) is responsible for coordinating trade policy objectives and relationships with other major policy areas. It includes the USTR as chairperson and Secretaries of Commerce, State, Treasury, Agriculture, and Labor. The interagency trade policy coordinating system may involve the National Economic Council (NEC) and/or the National Security Council (NSC) at the Deputies and Principals levels. The role of the NEC and NSC in trade policy coordination can vary depending on the Administration and specific trade policy issues. The National Economic Council (NEC) was established in 1993 by President Clinton through E.O. 12835 to coordinate and oversee economic policy. The Director of the NEC is also the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy. President Obama expanded the NEC membership through E.O. 13499 to include additional members. The National Security Council (NSC) was established in 1947 to advise the President on national security and foreign policy matters. It includes the President, Vice President, Secretaries of State and Defense, and other senior officials as needed. The NSC works alongside the National Economic Council (NEC) to coordinate trade policy. The Principals Committee of the NSC/NEC has largely replaced the Trade Policy Committee as the highest tier for resolving trade policy disputes and building interagency consensus. Disagreements at the sub-Cabinet/Deputies level are referred to the Cabinet/Principals level for review. Issues of greatest importance move to the Principals Committee of the NSC/NEC for resolution by the Cabinet. The private sector advisory system supports interagency bodies in providing information and advice on U.S. trade policy matters. Established under the Trade Act of 1974, it ensures U.S. trade objectives reflect commercial interests. The system consists of 28 advisory committees with approximately 700 advisors, organized in three tiers. The U.S. private sector advisory system consists of 28 committees with around 700 advisors, organized into three tiers. The USTR manages these committees, which include policy advisory committees and sectoral/technical advisory committees. Interagency bodies like the TPCC coordinate federal trade promotion activities. The TPCC, composed of 20 member departments and agencies, including key federal export promotion entities, was established in 1990 to address coordination issues in U.S. export promotion programs. However, concerns about its effectiveness have been raised due to a lack of enforcement capabilities. The National Export Initiative introduced higher levels of coordination through the Export Promotion Cabinet under President Obama. President Obama established the Export Promotion Cabinet (EPC) as part of the National Export Initiative (NEI) to enhance federal efforts in promoting exports. The EPC includes key Secretaries and Directors of export promotion agencies and senior White House advisors. While some see the EPC as elevating export promotion as a national priority, concerns exist about potential duplication of functions with the TPCC. Private sector input is provided through the President's Export Council (PEC) to advise on government policies affecting U.S. trade performance and promote export expansion. The President's Export Council (PEC) is composed of private sector members, Senators, Representatives, and heads of various departments. It was established in 1973 by President Nixon and has been renewed through executive orders. The reorganization of U.S. trade functions raises issues for Congress, with rationales for the reorganization based on constraints within the U.S. trade policy apparatus. The effectiveness of U.S. trade policy is influenced by the structure of the trade policy apparatus. Congress faces the challenge of measuring this effectiveness, which can be assessed through indicators like the number and content of trade agreements and the reduction of trade barriers. Goals of U.S. trade policy include opening foreign markets, supporting U.S. businesses, and advancing objectives in international negotiations. Macroeconomic objectives involve promoting U.S. employment and economic growth. The effectiveness of U.S. trade policy is influenced by the structure of the trade policy apparatus. Possible indicators for measuring effectiveness include evaluating how the organizational structure contributes to goals such as supporting U.S. employment, boosting exports, and improving the trade balance. The focus is on supporting firm-specific objectives and exports by SMEs, \"green\" exports, and exports to emerging markets. Critics argue that the current trade policy structure may not be responsive to evolving demands and competition. The U.S. trade policy structure is criticized for not meeting the demands of the global marketplace, hindering U.S. businesses in accessing foreign markets. Stakeholders debate the effectiveness of the organizational structure, with some advocating for reorganization to align with other countries' more consolidated structures. Opponents argue that changes may benefit short-term interests but have little impact on long-term export levels and trade balances. Critics argue that macroeconomic factors have a greater influence on U.S. export levels and trade balances than changes to the trade organizational structure. They also point out that comparisons between the U.S. and other countries' organizational structures may not be valid. Additionally, trade reorganization is driven by goals of reducing government size and costs. In terms of policy goals, considerations for a proposed trade reorganization include budgetary impacts in the short and long term. The debate centers on whether reorganization would enhance U.S. trade policy effectiveness or just lead to bureaucratic reshuffling. Critics argue that macroeconomic factors have a greater influence on trade balances than organizational changes. Supporters of trade reorganization argue for a more centralized approach to accessing federal assistance, reducing duplicative programs, lowering costs, and creating a coherent U.S. trade policy structure. Opponents of trade reorganization argue that restructuring may not address fundamental issues in U.S. trade policy, such as balancing stakeholder interests and enforcing trade agreements. They also raise concerns about potential costs associated with transferring functions to other agencies and the limited capacity of the federal government to provide trade-related services during the restructuring period. Critics are concerned that consolidation proposals to reorganize trade functions may limit effectiveness, as smaller agencies like the USTR are seen as more agile and efficient. Opponents argue that spreading trade functions across different agencies helps support a diverse range of interests in U.S. trade policy. The President's proposal to merge six federal agencies into a broader department raises issues for Congress, with some members supporting efforts to improve trade policy structure while others express concerns. The reorganization of trade agencies raises questions about the effectiveness of the new structure, particularly regarding the positioning of the USTR. Proponents argue that the USTR plays a unique role as an honest broker, mediating between different branches of government and interests. Critics argue that reorganizing the USTR into a larger agency could compromise its ability to serve as an honest broker in trade negotiations. Concerns also exist about limiting the USTR's influence and stature internationally if it is removed from the EOP. The proposal to reorganize the USTR into a larger agency is met with mixed opinions. Proponents believe it would enhance resources and structure for trade policy, while critics fear it may compromise the USTR's independence and create unnecessary bureaucracy. There are concerns about transferring smaller agencies into a larger department, raising bureaucratic issues and potentially hindering American exports and job creation. Congress may need to consider which agencies should be included in a trade reorganization. The President's proposal for reorganization excludes key trade-related agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the State Department, which could impact the cohesion of trade policy by missing opportunities for consolidation of international representation functions. The President's reorganization proposal excludes key trade-related agencies like USDA and State Department, raising concerns about the cohesion of trade policy and the consolidation of international representation functions. Some argue against consolidating foreign service officers into one unit, as their responsibilities extend beyond trade functions. Additionally, there is debate over including agencies like SBA in the proposed new department, as their functions may not align with the rationale for the consolidation. The proposed new department would include both trade and industry functions, raising concerns about the cohesion of trade policy. There is debate over transferring SBA functions to streamline federal trade-related functions and whether maintaining separation between certain policy functions may enhance U.S. trade policy. Some argue that consolidating trade negotiating and enforcement functions may lead to conflicts of interest. The USTR leads FTA negotiations and handles WTO dispute settlement issues, impacting U.S. rights. Concerns exist about reorganization affecting expertise in agriculture negotiations. Small business interests are also a focus in the trade reorganization debate. Small business advocates welcome the Small Business Administrator's elevation to Cabinet level but express concerns about potential dilution of small business interests if SBA is merged with other entities in the proposed reorganization. Questions arise about the impact on trade and development functions served by agencies like OPIC and TDA in the context of the new department's focus on trade, business, industry, and competitiveness. Some question the trade functions currently undertaken with development and foreign policy objectives. A newly created trade-focused department may not prioritize projects in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa as OPIC and TDA do. Congress may consider different policy options on trade reorganization. Maintaining the current trade policy is one option. Some Members argue for maintaining the current trade policy structure, citing concerns about potential problems with restructuring and short-term costs. The Administration may proceed with aspects of trade reorganization without congressional action. The President plans to make administrative changes to federal trade programs without needing approval from Congress. This includes strengthening coordination of trade policy functions and establishing new task forces. There is debate over whether the federal government should be involved in certain trade functions, with potential options being privatization or termination of certain programs. The debate over federal trade functions includes considerations for privatization or termination of certain programs, citing concerns about government size, competition with the private sector, and potential costs to taxpayers. Examples like the Ex-Im Bank and OPIC are mentioned as potential candidates for reorganization. Critics argue against privatization or termination of federal trade functions, citing the unique role of the government in addressing market failures and providing leverage for transactions. They believe federal trade programs give U.S. firms a competitive edge in securing export and investment contracts. Congress could enhance trade agencies' effectiveness by improving rather than consolidating them. One option to improve the effectiveness of U.S. trade agencies is to enhance coordination among them by strengthening existing coordinating bodies or streamlining them. Congress could give more authority to bodies like TPCC and EPC for export promotion coordination. Alternatively, new coordination mechanisms could be set up to reduce duplication of functions and activities. To enhance the effectiveness of U.S. trade agencies, coordination mechanisms could be strengthened or streamlined. Congress may need to assign more authority to coordinating bodies like TPCC and EPC for export promotion. Establishing a commission composed of public and private sector stakeholders to examine trade reorganization could be beneficial. This would align with previous government commissions during times of trade reorganization debate. President Obama has proposed trade reorganization as well. The outlook for trade reorganization in the 113th Congress is uncertain, with potential catalysts including U.S. policy focus on export promotion and cost-saving measures. It is unclear how the dynamics of the U.S. economy could impact the argument for trade reorganization, while potential impediments exist. Other executive branch reorganizations have occurred in response to major crises, but the extent of trade reorganization remains uncertain. The feasibility of trade reorganization in the 113th Congress is uncertain due to potential impediments such as jurisdictional issues among federal government agencies and concerns about impact on special interests. Efforts to merge new agencies may require legislation, leading to turf battles and complicating interagency consensus. Stakeholders like small businesses and agricultural producers may express concerns about the reorganization's effects. The inclusion of USTR in any proposal may also face scrutiny amidst ongoing U.S. trade agreement negotiations. The potential trade reorganization in the 113th Congress, including USTR, may face challenges due to jurisdictional issues and concerns about impact on special interests. Efforts to merge agencies may require legislation, leading to turf battles and complicating interagency consensus. Previous periods of debate on trade reorganization occurred during the Reagan and Clinton Administrations. During the 96th Congress, the International Trade and Investment Reorganization Act was introduced to establish a Department of International Trade and Investment. In the 98th Congress, the Reagan Administration proposed consolidating the USTR and trade-related functions of the Department of Commerce. The Reagan Administration proposed consolidating the USTR and trade-related functions of the Department of Commerce into the United States Trade Administration (USTA) through the Department of International Trade and Industry Act of 1983. This would transfer various trade-related functions and agencies to the USTA. The Reagan Administration proposed consolidating trade-related functions from various federal agencies into the newly created USTA through the Department of Trade and Commerce Act of 1983. This would transfer functions from agencies like USTR, Departments of Defense, Energy, Labor, State, Treasury, Transportation, Agriculture, and SBA to the USTA. The Trade Reorganization Act of 1983 (H.R. 4432) proposed creating a Department of Commerce and Trade, merging various agencies' functions into it. Another bill, H.R. 1756, aimed to eliminate the Department of Commerce by transferring its functions to existing agencies. The Trade Reorganization Act of 1983 proposed merging agencies into a new Department of Commerce and Trade. H.R. 1756 aimed to eliminate the Department of Commerce by transferring its functions to existing agencies, including eliminating the ITA and transferring certain functions to the USTR and State Department. The Trade Reorganization Act of 1983 proposed merging agencies into a new Department of Commerce and Trade, aiming to eliminate various agencies and transfer their functions to different departments. This included transferring the weight and measure functions from NIST to NSF, terminating NTIA and transferring its functions to FTC, transferring PTO to the Department of Justice, eliminating ESA, transferring the Bureau of the Census to the Treasury Department, transferring BEA to the Federal Reserve System, and transferring NOAA functions to various federal agencies. Another trade reorganization bill (S. 929) was introduced in the Senate in 1995. The Trade Reorganization Act of 1983 proposed merging agencies into a new Department of Commerce and Trade, aiming to eliminate various agencies and transfer their functions to different departments. In 1995, Senator Roth introduced bill S. 929 to abolish the Department of Commerce and create the United States Trade Administration (USTA) to handle trade functions. The USTA would have been headed by the USTR, who would have retained cabinet status and ambassadorial rank. The Trade Reorganization Act of 1983 proposed merging agencies into a new Department of Commerce and Trade. In 1995, Senator Roth introduced bill S. 929 to abolish the Department of Commerce and create the United States Trade Administration (USTA) under the USTR's responsibility. The bill also aimed to terminate several Commerce sub-agencies and transfer functions to the Department of Labor. Additionally, it would have established a Government 2000 Commission for government reorganization. The Trade Reorganization Act of 1995, introduced as H.R. 2124, aimed to consolidate the functions of the ITA and the BXA with the USTR, along with the TDA, into a newly created United States Trade Administration. The bill did not include the provision to dismantle the Department of Commerce, which was vetoed by President Clinton on December 6, 1995. The Trade Reorganization Act of 1995, H.R. 2124, aimed to consolidate the functions of the ITA, BXA, and TDA into the United States Trade Administration. It also called for the appointment of a Deputy Administrator and two Deputy U.S. Trade Representatives. The bill did not affect the Ex-Im Bank and OPIC. Key milestones in administrative and legislative action related to trade functions were highlighted."
