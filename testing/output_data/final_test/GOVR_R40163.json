    "content": "The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations through a joint resolution with specified text. This resolution must be submitted within a set time period after the rule is transmitted to Congress. An expedited procedure in the Senate allows for privileged consideration of the disapproval resolution, limiting debate and prohibiting amendments. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations through a joint resolution with specified text. The disapproved rule becomes of no force and effect if a disapproval resolution is enacted into law. The issuing agency may not reissue the same or similar rule without subsequent statutory authorization from Congress. Congressional disapproval is difficult due to potential presidential veto, requiring both houses to override it for the disapproval to become law. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations through a joint resolution. The CRA potentially eases disapproval in cases where the resolution is presented to a new President. It describes procedures for a new Congress to disapprove rules issued by the previous Congress. The report discusses the implications of disapproving rules at the start of a new presidential administration and the challenges posed by the CRA in doing so. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations through a joint resolution. This report discusses procedural means to address difficulties in disapproving rules under the act, including time limits for submitting resolutions and expedited procedures in the Senate. The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations through a joint resolution. If a resolution is submitted within the required period, it could be enacted at any time within the same Congress. However, if Senate consideration occurs when the expedited procedure is no longer available, the disapproval could be filibustered or amended. If amended, it would no longer have the text required by the act, and so would not automatically have the additional effects specified by the act. If a rule is received near the end of a Congress, opponents may find it impracticable to submit a disapproval resolution and secure action on it under the CRA during the abbreviated time remaining. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) may be difficult to use to disapprove a rule if submitted near the end of a session. Any disapproval resolution from a previous Congress would have expired, and the time in the new Congress may be too short for action. The CRA allows for new periods to submit disapproval resolutions in the following session if a rule is transmitted near the end of a session. The Congressional Review Act allows for new periods to submit disapproval resolutions in the following session if a rule is transmitted near the end of a session, especially during transitions in party control. The 110th Congress adjourned, allowing for potential disapproval of rules transmitted after May 15, 2008 in the early months of the 111th Congress. Congressional action may focus on disapproving rules published by the Bush Administration. The expedited procedure under the CRA in the Senate allows for quick consideration of disapproval resolutions. Significant time may be consumed in the consideration of disapproval resolutions in Congress, both in debate and roll call votes. Time can be limited by majority vote, but roll call votes on various aspects of the resolution can still consume time. These conditions may collectively hinder the consideration of multiple disapproval resolutions. One suggested solution to the time-consuming consideration of multiple disapproval resolutions in Congress is to consolidate them into a single joint resolution or bill for quicker voting. This approach could save time by addressing a list of rules in one proceeding, especially in the Senate where amendments are not required to be specific to the issue at hand. One way to expedite the consideration of disapproval resolutions in Congress is to consolidate them into a single joint resolution or bill for faster voting, especially in the Senate where amendments do not need to be specific to the underlying legislation. This approach could streamline the process by addressing multiple rules in one proceeding. Enactment of a measure disapproving a regulation can prevent its implementation, as Congress retains the power to override regulations. The text prescribed for a disapproval resolution includes a directive that the rule shall have no force or effect. If each provision follows this text, it can vitiate the effectiveness of the rule. Section 802(a) of the CRA specifies conditions for congressional disapproval procedures, requiring a joint resolution to be submitted within 60 days with specific text disapproving the rule. This measure can prevent the implementation of regulations by overriding them. The CRA specifies conditions for congressional disapproval procedures, requiring a joint resolution with specific text disapproving the rule to be submitted within 60 days. A consolidated measure consisting solely of disapproval provisions would not qualify as a joint resolution under these requirements. The CRA specifies conditions for congressional disapproval procedures, requiring a joint resolution with specific text disapproving the rule to be submitted within 60 days. A consolidated measure consisting solely of disapproval provisions would not qualify as a joint resolution under these requirements. Additionally, the enactment of disapproval provisions may not retroactively take regulations out of effect or prevent the issuing agency from resubmitting a similar rule. A joint resolution \"bundling\" disapproval provisions into a single measure may not have standing under the CRA but could potentially achieve similar effects. The consolidated measure could include language specifying that disapproved rules cease to have effect and be treated as if they never took effect. It could also prevent the issuing agency from issuing similar regulations without subsequent statutory authority. Alternatively, each section disapproving a rule could conform to specific requirements, with additional provisions ensuring its force and effect as a separate resolution. The consolidated measure could allow Congress to disapprove specific parts of a regulation or modify certain provisions outside the requirements of the CRA. This would give Congress more flexibility in framing individual provisions and would not be subject to CRA considerations. The consolidated joint resolution of disapproval could be amended without violating CRA requirements, as long as retroactive vitiation and prohibition on similar rules are included. However, a measure lacking CRA form would not be eligible for expedited Senate consideration or automatic clearance for Presidential action. The difficulty of including provisions in a consolidated measure to comply with statutory requirements may require separate actions by the chambers. The Senate may need unanimous consent, while the House could adopt a special rule. A consolidated disapproval measure in the Senate may not be eligible for expedited consideration, leading to a choice between regular procedures or individual resolutions. The Senate may need unanimous consent to consider a consolidated measure under regular procedures or individual resolutions. A consolidated measure would not be eligible for expedited consideration under the CRA. Amendments, including non-germane ones, could be made to a consolidated measure considered under the general rules of the Senate. Action on a consolidated measure under the general rules of the Senate may face obstacles such as extended debate or parliamentary maneuvers. To overcome these challenges, supporters may need to compile the components in a way that attracts enough support to invoke cloture. This process may involve omitting certain disapproval proposals and rejecting amendments that could make cloture more difficult to achieve. If sufficient support is garnered to invoke cloture, action on the consolidated measure may proceed. Support to invoke cloture on the consolidated measure could lead to a quicker disposal of disapproval proposals in the Senate. Additional rules could also be disapproved through separate resolutions, meeting the requirements for expedited consideration. The use of non-debatable motions could facilitate the consideration of a significant number of resolutions, although careful consideration is needed on the feasibility of this approach. In the House, the general rules could be used to disapprove a large number of rules without an expedited procedure. One approach could be to consider a consolidated measure with sections disapproving rules as required by the CRA. The House could consider a special rule to disapprove regulations individually or through a consolidated measure with sections disapproving rules as required by the CRA. This would allow for individual decisions on which regulations to disapprove. Alternatively, a single special rule could be considered for a series of separate disapproval resolutions with a strict time limit. The House could consider a special rule for a series of separate disapproval resolutions with a strict time limit and prohibition against amendment. This would allow for individual decisions on each resolution while still preserving the opportunity for rejection. Additional resolutions meeting the requirements of the CRA could also be considered during this process. When both houses pass individual resolutions disapproving the same rule under the CRA, no issues arise during bicameral agreement. However, if one chamber initially acts on a consolidated disapproval resolution, challenges may arise in the other chamber. Typically, both chambers follow passage of their own measure with agreement to the identical measure from the other chamber. If the consolidated measures adopted in two chambers differ, the second chamber to act may face difficulties. When both houses pass individual resolutions disapproving the same rule under the CRA, no issues arise during bicameral agreement. However, challenges may arise if one chamber initially acts on a consolidated disapproval resolution. The second chamber to act may face difficulties if the consolidated measures adopted in two chambers differ in content. The chamber acting second will normally pass the received measure only after amending it with the text of its own measure, potentially leading to delay or deadlock in resolving differences between the two versions. When both houses pass individual resolutions disapproving the same rule under the CRA, no issues arise during bicameral agreement. Challenges may arise if one chamber initially acts on a consolidated disapproval resolution, leading to difficulties in resolving differences between the two versions. The House may find it more practical to consider a Senate-originated measure to avoid the need for a supermajority to invoke cloture. If discrepancies arise, the chamber that adopted the consolidated measure may be best suited to resolve them. The chamber that adopted the consolidated measure may provide for the passage of disapproval resolutions without debate. This could ensure completion of congressional action on disapproval resolutions for rules disapproved by the other chamber in a consolidated measure. The House may use a special rule for considering consolidated measures, while the Senate would require unanimous consent. The Senate may have difficulty limiting time for action on numerous disapproval resolutions from the House. Advocates should consider Senate action on individual disapproval resolutions for the greatest success. Resolutions under expedited procedure could be successful if each component of a consolidated measure is engrossed as a separate joint resolution of disapproval. Separate engrossment may require unanimous consent in either chamber. Separate engrossment of provisions may only be feasible with unanimous consent. A special rule in the House for separate engrossment could be out of order, as it could prevent a proper motion to recommit for each separately engrossed measure. Another form of special rule, a \"self-executing\" rule, could face similar objections if used to adopt a group of separate disapproval resolutions."
