    "content": "Section 319(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, known as the McCain-Feingold law, increases contribution limits for House candidates if their opponents self-finance significantly. This provision, along with a similar one for Senate candidates in Section 304, is called the \"Millionaire's Amendment.\" If a House candidate spends over $350,000 of personal funds, their opponent's contribution limits can triple to $6,900 per election. Senate candidates also have increased limits if their opponent surpasses a certain personal fund threshold. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, also known as the McCain-Feingold law, increases contribution limits for candidates whose opponents self-finance significantly. This provision, called the \"Millionaire's Amendment,\" applies to both House and Senate candidates. If a candidate exceeds a designated threshold of personal campaign funding, their opponent's contribution limits can increase. Additionally, self-financing candidates are required to file special disclosure reports on their campaign spending. In 2006, the FEC informed Davis of potential violations regarding disclosure requirements for self-financing candidates. Davis filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the Millionaire's Amendment, which was ultimately invalidated by the Supreme Court in FEC v. Davis. The Supreme Court invalidated the Millionaire's Amendment for lacking a compelling governmental interest in violation of the First Amendment. Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas. Justice Stevens concurred in part and dissented in part, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer. Justice Ginsburg also concurred in part and dissented in part, joined by Justice Breyer. The Court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. The Court noted its history of upholding limits on individual contributions and coordinated party expenditures, citing prior decisions. The Supreme Court rejected limits on a candidate's personal funds for campaign speech, stating it restricts their right to advocate for their election. Using personal funds reduces reliance on outside contributions, lessening risks of corruption. The Millionaire's Amendment was invalidated for lacking a compelling governmental interest. The Supreme Court ruled that the Millionaire's Amendment imposes an unprecedented penalty on candidates who use personal funds for their campaigns, forcing them to choose between free political expression and discriminatory contribution limits. Candidates who self-finance face a fundraising disadvantage, creating an advantage for their opponents. The Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo upheld the right to use personal funds for campaign speech. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court upheld the provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act allowing presidential candidates to receive public funds with expenditure limits. The Court distinguished the Millionaire's Amendment from the presidential public financing provision, stating that the former imposes a substantial burden on the First Amendment right to expend personal funds for campaign support. The Court ruled that the Millionaire's Amendment, which imposes asymmetrical limits on campaign financing, is not sustainable unless justified by a compelling governmental interest, such as preventing corruption. The Court emphasized that restrictions on campaign financing must be based on legitimate compelling governmental interests, and personal funds can reduce the threat of corruption. The Court cautioned against restricting a candidate's speech to level election opportunities, as it would undermine voters' authority to judge candidates based on their strengths, including wealth and celebrity status. This would involve making judgments about which candidates can contribute to election outcomes, which goes against the Constitution's principles. The Court emphasized that voters, not Congress, have the power to choose House Members, warning against using election laws to influence choices. It found that compelled disclosure infringes on privacy of association and belief, subjecting such requirements to scrutiny for relevance. The Court deemed the Millionaire's Amendment unconstitutional due to the burden imposed by its disclosure requirements. The Court struck down the Millionaire's Amendment, reasoning that its disclosure requirements cannot be justified. In a dissent, Justice Stevens argued that the statute does not restrict the speech of self-financing candidates and only assists their opponents in making their voices heard. The dissent criticized the Court's Buckley ruling, arguing that reasonable spending limits can be justified for combating corruption and reducing the influence of wealth on elections. It emphasized that governmental interests go beyond just preventing corruption and highlighted concerns about the distorting effects of wealth on election outcomes. In a dissent, Justice Ginsburg, along with Justice Breyer, supported the constitutionality of the Millionaire's Amendment, citing the Buckley v. Valeo decision. However, she did not agree with Justice Stevens's dissent on expenditure limits, preferring to leave reconsideration of Buckley for another time. The Court's opinion in Davis reinforces its stance from Buckley that Congress lacks a compelling interest in equalizing candidate funding. The Davis Court determined that Congressional attempts to level the playing field among candidates would supplant voter choices, departing from its previous deference to Congress's expertise in regulating election systems. Justice Stevens still supported deference, but the majority of the Davis Court did not."
