    "content": "The Bureau of Reclamation, part of the Department of Interior, manages and develops water resources in the West primarily for irrigation. It has constructed a significant number of assets since its founding in 1902, with an estimated replacement value of over $78 billion. The Bureau of Reclamation manages a vast infrastructure worth over $78 billion, including 480 dams and 348 reservoirs. It serves 31 million people, irrigates 10 million acres of farmland, and produces a significant portion of the nation's vegetables and fruits. Additionally, it is a major hydroelectric power producer with 58 plants generating over 44 billion kilowatt-hours annually. The aging facilities require increased maintenance as they approach their design lifetime, raising concerns about potential failures. Reclamation faces challenges with increasing maintenance needs for its aging infrastructure, limited funding, and difficulties in financing major repairs. While prompt attention is given to facilities with immediate repayment capacity, others may not receive necessary repairs due to financial constraints. Reclamation's unique ownership and contractual responsibilities impact its infrastructure approach. Reclamation's infrastructure management is impacted by its unique ownership and contractual responsibilities. One-third of facilities are \"reserved works\" where project beneficiaries repay construction and maintenance costs to the federal government. The remaining two-thirds are \"transferred works\" where operation and maintenance are handled by nonfederal entities. Both types of projects face challenges in financing major maintenance costs. Legislation has been introduced to address issues with Reclamation's aging infrastructure. The Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 and the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 addressed Reclamation's aging infrastructure by establishing a loan guarantee program and authorizing actions for inspections and emergency maintenance. This report discusses Reclamation's approach to managing aging infrastructure, potential issues, funding trends, and alternative approaches proposed or enacted. Reclamation's maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation needs are identified through regular monitoring or formal assessments. Maintenance activities are scheduled and funded based on necessity, with immediate action taken for abrupt failures. Major rehabilitation or replacement efforts may be considered for facilities that have exceeded their expected service life. Asset management is primarily the responsibility of Reclamation's 25 area managers. The day-to-day responsibility for asset management at Reclamation lies with 25 area offices, reporting to regional offices and ultimately to the Deputy Commissioner for Operations. The Commissioner makes asset portfolio decisions with input from advisory bodies. The Facilities O&M Team addresses O&M priorities, issues, program formulation, and maintenance management practices. Responsibilities include recommendations on deferred maintenance, condition assessments, replacements, facility security, and maintenance systems. Maintenance needs for both reserved and transferred works are identified by local operating entities or through periodic facility reviews by Reclamation. However, performance data for transferred works may be limited, making it challenging to compare and track these facilities for funding decisions. Major maintenance activities for Reclamation's projects are typically funded through a line item in the budget known as RAX. The RAX program provides funds for major maintenance activities in Reclamation's projects, funded through customer revenues or federal agencies. Non-reimbursable RAX expenditures make up 4%-7% of Reclamation's total appropriation. Reviews have highlighted difficulties in budgeting for non-routine items and the need for improved planning processes and prioritization methods. Reclamation is addressing concerns with its RAX program by analyzing past expenditures, developing a prioritization framework for O&M needs, improving management practices, and creating a long-term investment strategy. The Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 gives the Secretary of the Interior authority to modify dams for safety. The Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 gives direction on classifying repair work for repayment based on structural integrity and safety. Repair costs due to age, deterioration, or lack of maintenance are reimbursable, while those from new safety criteria are not. The Dam Safety Program includes the Safety of Dams Evaluation and Modification Program and the DOI Dam Safety Program, with a focus on Reclamation dams and a budget request of $83.7 million for FY2012. The Safety Evaluation of Existing Dams program (SEED) and the Initiate Safety of Dams Corrective Action program (ISCA) focus on analyzing and addressing potential hazards at Reclamation dams. ISCA funds corrective actions identified by SEED, conducted under the Safety of Dams Act authority. Reclamation implements Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety, tracking infrastructure needs internally. It distinguishes between deferred maintenance and indicated maintenance, with deferred maintenance needs increasing over time. Indicated maintenance is recognized as necessary but may not be scheduled regularly. Reclamation's deferred maintenance costs have risen over the last decade, reaching $40-45 million annually. In FY2008, documented needs spiked to $82 million due to updated estimates. It is uncertain if current funding levels can cover these increased expenses. Maintenance needs are not publicly tracked or available at the project level. Reclamation's maintenance needs, estimated at over $3.2 billion in 2008, include funding for transferred facilities, dams under the Dam Safety Program, hydropower assets, and other reserved works. Specific funding requirements and timing projections have not been disclosed due to the confidential nature of the information. Reclamation received $950 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for infrastructure projects, allocating $165 million for reliability and safety. $91 million went to large projects, and $74 million to smaller ones. The impact on maintenance backlogs is unknown as Reclamation has not updated its maintenance totals. Congressional efforts are underway to address concerns with aging infrastructure. Congressional efforts are addressing the needs of Reclamation's facilities, including legislation altering cost shares and repayment periods for specific projects. Recent proposals aim to provide more options for aging infrastructure. Arrowrock Dam, owned by Reclamation, underwent maintenance with the replacement of lower valves. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2002 played a role in these efforts. The Mancos Project in southwestern Colorado, approved in 1940, includes the Jackson Gulch Dam and reservoir, providing irrigation water for 14,000 acres. Congress mandated Reclamation to recover $6.9 million over 15 years for O&M costs at Arrowrock Dam. The Jackson Gulch Rehabilitation Act of 2009 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to pay 65% of the cost for the project, with a federal share of $8.25 million. The Mancos Water Conservancy District remains responsible for O&M at the project. Reclamation argued that rehabilitation for transferred works should be the responsibility of water users. The project received an initial appropriation of $1.75 million in FY2010. The Jackson Gulch Rehabilitation project received an initial appropriation of $1.75 million in FY2010. This project raises questions about federal funding for maintenance issues at transfer projects and the federal role in infrastructure maintenance. The St. Mary Diversion Dam is part of Reclamation's Milk River Project in Montana, diverting water to the St. Mary Canal for 29 miles. Repair work is needed on sections of the canal. The St. Mary Diversion Dam in Montana diverts water to the St. Mary Canal for 29 miles. Repair work is needed on sections of the earthen canal, two large sets of pipes, and concrete drops at the lower end. The canal's capacity is 30% below design due to maintenance issues. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 authorized $153 million for rehabilitation, with a federal cost share of 75%. The federal share of the cost for the St. Mary Diversion Dam rehabilitation project is 75%. Reclamation has requested funding for related studies, but the Corps has not funded the authorization for construction. Reclamation did not support construction authorization in WRDA or the cost-sharing arrangement, citing concerns about premature construction, unresolved tribal water rights claims, and repayment terms. Reclamation infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation costs can be prohibitive for nonfederal entities. Securing funding for these projects is challenging due to federal ownership of the facilities. Calls have been made for federal credit programs to aid in repairs and upgrades. Congress has previously authorized loan programs for Reclamation's transferred works. The 109th Congress authorized a loan program for Reclamation under the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 to provide federal loan guarantees for project beneficiaries. However, the program has not received funding due to executive branch interpretations of subsidy costs. User interests argue that the subsidy cost should be a percentage of guaranteed loans that may default. The cost of the loan program under the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 has not been funded due to disagreements over subsidy costs. Other laws have authorized funding for emergency maintenance work on water infrastructure, but to date, no projects have been funded. Some suggest using balances in the Reclamation Fund for infrastructure needs, as the fund has grown to over $9 billion from mineral leasing receipts. Without Congressional action, the balances will continue to increase, potentially funding major repair projects. The Reclamation Fund, with over $9 billion from mineral leasing receipts, could be used for major maintenance projects. However, congressional scoring requirements and appropriations caps may complicate efforts to allocate these funds. Other federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NRCS also play roles in managing water resources infrastructure. The Corps and NRCS have different roles in O&M and rehabilitation of dams. The Corps operates 650 dams and 238 navigation locks, with an estimated infrastructure value of $232 billion. They prioritize flood damage reduction, navigation, hydropower generation, and water supplies. The Corps has a $232 billion infrastructure value and a $2.6 billion deferred maintenance backlog. Unlike Reclamation, the Corps does not separate ongoing project operations from major repairs in their budget line. They prioritize flood damage reduction, navigation, hydropower generation, and water supplies in their O&M actions. The Corps prioritizes flood damage reduction, navigation, hydropower generation, and water supplies in their O&M actions. Activities are ranked based on O&M procedures and project performance measures, with costs estimated for each activity. Recent budgets provide O&M totals for individual projects, determined by Corps headquarters in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget. The Corps, in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget, determines policy priorities for project O&M funding based on rankings from Corps Divisions. Congress also directs funding for specific projects during annual consideration of Energy and Water Development appropriations bills. The selection process for major repair and replacement projects has been criticized, with concerns raised about deteriorating infrastructure and underfunding. The Corps is undergoing changes to modernize asset management procedures. The Corps is modernizing its asset management procedures to evaluate deferred maintenance and examine cost and condition variances among asset types. Unlike Reclamation, the Corps is responsible for O&M at most projects, except for levees maintained by local interests. Deterioration of federally built and locally operated levees is a concern for Congress, similar to issues faced by Reclamation with transferred works. The NRCS has constructed over 11,300 dams under the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act. The Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act (P.L. 83-566) authorizes NRCS to assist with rehabilitating aging dams owned by local sponsors. Rehabilitation funding is allocated based on public safety risk and availability of appropriations. Only dams built with NRCS assistance are eligible for this program, and local sponsors can apply for funding assistance at any time. NRCS staff do not estimate future rehabilitation funding needs. NRCS's Rehabilitation Program assists with aging dams owned by local sponsors based on public safety risk. NRCS evaluates requests and funds high-risk projects within available appropriations. They may cover up to 65% of rehabilitation costs but not maintenance expenses. By FY2010, 228 projects had been funded, with 95 dams fully rehabilitated in 14 states. The NRCS Rehabilitation Program funded 228 projects by FY2010, rehabilitating 95 dams in 14 states. Project sponsors requested $37.5 million to restore 90 high priority dams in 24 states in FY2010, but funding typically ranges from $20 million-$40 million. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposes to eliminate funding for this program due to increasing needs and constrained budgets. The current process for identifying and prioritizing rehabilitation funding needs for water resources infrastructure is viewed as inadequate. The process for identifying and prioritizing rehabilitation funding needs for aging infrastructure owned by the federal government but maintained by nonfederal interests is lacking. Other agencies like the Corps and NRCS also struggle with maintaining infrastructure built by the federal government but now maintained by nonfederal interests. As Reclamation's maintenance needs grow, the prioritization process for aging infrastructure may become more critical. Congress needs to consider whether Reclamation and other agencies are adequately addressing these challenges. The question for Congress is whether efforts to identify and prioritize aging infrastructure are adequate, especially regarding funding for federal water projects. The issue of who should pay for costly repairs and upgrades at Reclamation facilities, including transferred works, will likely be a recurring concern. Rehabilitation projects at transferred facilities have faced major failures and limited support from the Administration in the past, prompting attention from Congress. Some argue for increased federal support for all federally owned facilities to prevent deterioration, citing societal costs and private financing challenges. Others, including the current Administration, are wary of setting a precedent by allowing nonfederal entities to shirk responsibilities and question the practicality of a major influx of federal funding due to budget constraints. The extent of current needs is unclear due to decentralized documentation. To date, few beneficiaries have utilized provisions for extended repayment periods for extraordinary maintenance expenses at reserved and transferred works, raising questions about the urgency of federal aid requests. Congress has enacted programs and funding for projects outside of Reclamation's regular budget process, such as capping O&M responsibility at Arrowrock Dam and authorizing funding for the St. Mary Rehabilitation Project to be carried out by another federal agency. Funding for the project has not yet begun and may conflict with existing statutory requirements. Funding for the Jackson Gulch dam rehabilitation project has faced challenges due to conflicting statutory requirements and lack of initial funding from the Administration. Congress provided funding in FY2010, but concerns remain about the sustainability of obtaining funds for individual projects as needs for upgrades increase. In the future, Congress may need to reconsider funding options for aging infrastructure, such as loan programs and dedicated funding from the Reclamation Fund, to address the challenges faced in implementing solutions."
