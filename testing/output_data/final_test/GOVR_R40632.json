    "content": "The GPD administers the State and Regional Preparedness Program and the Metropolitan Statistical Area Preparedness Program, which includes various grant programs to support homeland security capabilities at the state and local levels. The Metropolitan Statistical Area Preparedness Program (MSAPP) includes Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) and Transportation Infrastructure Protection for high-threat urban areas. The program funds state and local preparedness exercises, training, technical assistance, and evaluations with approximately $4.2 billion allocated by Congress in FY2010. In FY2010, Congress allocated approximately $4.2 billion for DHS programs for state and locality homeland security. Funding limits were set for FEMA and grantees' management and administration costs. Congress could address issues such as overall funding reduction, allocation methods for grant awards, and reduced appropriations for the Assistance to Firefighters Program. In FY2010, Congress allocated $4.2 billion for DHS programs for state and locality homeland security, with reductions in funding for FEMA programs and the Assistance to Firefighters Program. The total appropriation was $610 million less than in FY2009, with funding cuts for some grant programs or reductions in others. Over the past eight years, Congress has allocated approximately $33 billion for state and local homeland security assistance. In FY2010, Congress allocated $4.2 billion for state and local homeland security, with reductions in funding for some programs. Over the past eight years, approximately $33 billion has been appropriated for state and local homeland security assistance. Some argue that states should take on more responsibility for funding their projects. Maintaining current funding levels for state and local homeland security may be challenging due to financial circumstances. The ever-changing terrorism threat and natural disasters require new capabilities. Some argue for increased funding due to rising natural disaster costs. Congress is debating how grant program funding is distributed to ensure states and localities meet their homeland security needs. The funding debate for homeland security programs, particularly SHSGP and UASI, has focused on allocating funds based on risk. Critics question the guaranteed minimum allocation for SHSGP and the use of population as a key variable in other grant programs. The 9/11 Commission recommended allocating all homeland security assistance based solely on risk, but P.L. 110-53 required DHS to guarantee a minimum amount of SHSGP funding to states. While the 9/11 Commission recommended allocating homeland security assistance based on risk, P.L. 110-53 mandated a minimum amount of SHSGP funding to states. Critics argue that this does not fully align with the Commission's suggestion, which emphasized allocating funds solely based on risk. President Obama also supported the idea that homeland security assistance should be risk-based. The 9/11 Commission and President Obama support allocating homeland security assistance based on risk. Critics suggest Congress should conduct oversight on DHS funding allocation. Funding should be risk-based, but some jurisdictions may receive limited allocations. A risk assessment process would evaluate state and local capabilities, vulnerabilities, and accurately reflect the nation's current homeland security environment. The FY2010 budget proposed significant changes in firefighter assistance grants, with a 70% decrease in Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) funding to $170 million and a doubling of SAFER funding to $420 million. The total requested amount for firefighter assistance was $590 million, prioritizing capabilities for terrorism response. AFG grants focus on equipment, while SAFER grants are for hiring and recruitment/retention. The proposed AFG funding would have been the lowest since FY2001, while the SAFER budget increase was substantial. The proposed budget for firefighter assistance in FY2010 included a significant decrease in Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG) funding to $170 million and a doubling of SAFER funding to $420 million. The House-passed H.R. 2892 provided $800 million for firefighter assistance, with $390 million for AFG and $420 million for SAFER. The House committee deemed the Administration's request for AFG funding as inadequate and directed FEMA to continue granting funds to local fire departments with an all-hazard focus. The Senate-passed H.R. 2892 provided $810 million for firefighter assistance, with $390 million for AFG and $420 million for SAFER. The committee directed DHS to continue funding applications according to local priorities and priorities established by the United States Fire Administration. P.L. 111-83 provided identical funding levels for AFG and SAFER, directing FEMA to maintain an all-hazards focus and grant funds for eligible activities in accordance with the authorizing statute. The committee directed DHS to maintain current grant application and review process for firefighter assistance funding as specified in the House report."
