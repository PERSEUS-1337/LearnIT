    "content": "Title II of the Social Security Act outlines the requirements for individuals to be eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits under the federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. This includes meeting the definition of disability, filing a claim, being insured, not reaching normal retirement age, and completing a five-month waiting period. The waiting period for SSDI benefits begins with the first full calendar month after insured status is gained, regardless of when the application is filed. Retroactive benefits are limited to 12 months from the date of application, with a maximum of 17 months before the application month counted towards the waiting period. The waiting period for SSDI benefits starts the first full calendar month after insured status is gained. Retroactive benefits are limited to 12 months from the date of application, with a maximum of 17 months before the application month counted towards the waiting period. Beneficiaries are entitled to benefits retroactive to five months after the date of disability onset, with exceptions for those who had received SSDI benefits or had a disabling condition in the five years before the current disability. In 1955, Congress authorized SSDI benefits for persons over 50 with a six-month waiting period, later removing the age requirement in 1960. Recent legislative initiatives aim to reduce the five-month waiting period. The House Ways and Means Committee recommended a six-month waiting period due to the unique federal definition of disability, which required a disabling condition expected to result in death or long duration. Commercial insurance carriers also had six-month waiting periods at the time. The Ways and Means Committee supported a six-month waiting period for SSDI, stating it was long enough for most conditions to improve and would discourage able individuals from not working. Changes to the waiting period exempted those with previous disabilities meeting the statutory definition from waiting. The six-month waiting period for disability insurance beneficiaries returning to work can be a barrier, as some may lose their job due to slight changes in their condition, leading to re-eligibility for benefits. The reduction of the waiting period from six to five months aimed to lessen the financial burden on applicants. The waiting period for disability insurance beneficiaries was reduced from six to five months to alleviate financial hardships. The Senate Finance Committee suggested further reducing it to four months. Title XVI of the act provides Supplemental Security Income benefits for disabled individuals meeting specific criteria. In December 2012, 1.1 million disabled-worker beneficiaries aged 18-64 receiving SSDI benefits also received SSI benefits. SSI can help alleviate economic hardship during the SSDI waiting period. The federal SSI payment is $721 per month for individuals and $1,082 for couples living independently in 2014. Some states add a supplement to this benefit. The average monthly SSI payment is less than the federal benefit rate due to other income sources. In December 2013, the average federally administered SSI payment was $546.38 for adults aged 18 to 64. Thirty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands grant Medicaid eligibility to all SSI recipients. California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and Rhode Island administer Temporary Disability Insurance programs for workers with disabilities. These programs provide temporary benefits for those unable to work due to a disability. Employees of the railroad industry in all states are also eligible for TDI benefits. Employees of the railroad industry in all states are eligible for Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) benefits administered by the federal Railroad Retirement Board. Workers' compensation systems in each state provide wage replacement and medical benefits for employment-related illnesses or injuries. The federal government administers workers' compensation for its employees under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act and for some private sector employees in specific industries through various programs. State unemployment insurance provides partial wage replacement for workers in the event of a job separation, but recipients must be able and willing to work. This condition may exclude those waiting for SSDI eligibility. Unemployment benefits are administered by states under federal guidelines, with provisions for ill or disabled individuals varying by state. A small percentage of SSDI beneficiaries received concurrent SSDI and UI cash benefits in fiscal year 2010. Private disability insurance programs can provide wage replacement benefits during the waiting period for SSDI benefits. Around 39% of private-sector workers have short-term disability insurance, and 32% have long-term disability insurance. Up to 20% of SSDI beneficiaries have received payments from private disability insurance before federal benefits. The five-month waiting period for SSDI eligibility can negatively impact income as claimants are not working or earning below the SGA threshold. The five-month waiting period for SSDI benefits can negatively impact claimants' income, as they are not working or earning below the substantial gainful activity (SGA) threshold. Claimants may not be receiving monthly benefits to replace lost wages or are only receiving lower SSI benefits. The waiting period discourages potential beneficiaries from applying for benefits and reduces the overall generosity of the SSDI benefit. Eliminating this waiting period could increase outlays to SSDI by approximately $8.0 billion in 2022."
