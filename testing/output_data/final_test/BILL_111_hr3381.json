    "content": "The \"Protect America's Wildlife Act of 2009\" includes additional prohibitions and exceptions to violations of regulations under the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956. Penalties for knowingly violating regulations have been increased from $5,000 to $50,000. Section 13(b) of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 is amended to authorize employees, agents, or persons operating under a license or permit to take actions under the act. The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 is amended to authorize actions for protecting land, water, and wildlife, with a focus on enhancing wildlife propagation and survival. No exemption allows shooting or harassing wolves, bears, or wolverines for this purpose without approval from the relevant authorities. The Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture can take action in a biological emergency if all other measures have been exhausted. This action can be carried out by state fish and wildlife agencies for game populations. In a biological emergency, the Department of the Interior or Agriculture can remove predators in specific areas to prevent the emergency, with the minimum number necessary. The Secretary of the Interior may authorize actions to prevent the extinction of threatened or endangered species if no other means are available. The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 is amended to define terms like aircraft, biological emergency, and harass in the context of wildlife protection."
