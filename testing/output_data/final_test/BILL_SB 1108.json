    "title": "SB 1108",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Elections Code in California is being amended to include a new chapter on Advisory and Independent Redistricting Commissions. An advisory redistricting commission recommends district boundaries to a legislative body, while an independent redistricting commission has the power to adopt district boundaries. Key terms are defined, such as \"family member\" and \"legislative body.\" An independent redistricting commission or an advisory redistricting commission composed of residents of a local jurisdiction can change district boundaries or recommend changes to the legislative body. The local jurisdiction can appoint members to the advisory commission, excluding elected officials, family members, staff, or paid campaign staff of elected officials. The commission must submit a report to the legislative body with findings and recommended boundary changes within six months of the final census data release, but no later than August 1 of the following year. Independent redistricting commissions can have members appointed through an open application process, with additional qualifications allowed. Certain individuals or their family members who have engaged in specific activities in the past eight years are ineligible to serve on the commission. Members of the commission must meet certain eligibility criteria, including having been involved in political activities such as holding elective office, working for a campaign committee, or contributing a significant amount to a local candidate. Additionally, members are prohibited from engaging in certain activities while serving on the commission. Members of the commission must meet eligibility criteria related to political activities. While serving, they are restricted from endorsing candidates, running for local office, accepting certain appointments or employment, receiving noncompetitive contracts, or registering as a lobbyist. The commission must also have a diverse political party preference among its members. Each member of the commission must be designated in the conflict of interest code. The commission is subject to the Ralph M. Brown Act and the California Public Records Act. The commission must adopt new boundaries within six months of the final population figures from each federal census, but no later than November 1 of the following year. Proposed boundaries must be published and available to the public for at least seven days before adoption. The commission must hold at least three public hearings before adopting new boundaries and cannot draw districts to favor or discriminate against incumbents or political candidates."
