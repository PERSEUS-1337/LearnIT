The Department of State issues visas, the Department of Homeland Security approves immigrant petitions, and Customs and Border Protection inspects all arrivals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforces immigration law within the U.S. Congress is discussing comprehensive immigration reform, including border security, interior enforcement, and legal reform. Concerns arise over the Department of Homeland Security's capacity to identify and remove temporary aliens who overstay their visas, a longstanding issue in immigration control. Congress has been addressing this problem for over two decades, particularly in the early 1990s when nonimmigrant overstays became a growing concern despite the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 strengthening enforcement provisions. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 significantly strengthened immigration enforcement provisions. Estimates show a rise in unauthorized alien residents from 3.5 million in 1990 to 11.7 million in 2012. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides the framework for controlling foreign national entry and exit, including electronic databases and biometric collection. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) enacted biometric collection before the 20th century. Nonimmigrants failing to leave under visa terms are ineligible for readmission. Visas are issued to immigrants and nonimmigrants, with documentary requirements in Section 222 of the INA. Nonimmigrants, like tourists and students, are admitted for a specific purpose and time period. In FY2012, 8.9 million nonimmigrant visas were issued, with visitor visas for tourism and business comprising the largest group at 78%. Other categories included students, exchange visitors, and employment-based nonimmigrants. The Bureau of Consular Affairs has been issuing machine-readable visas for over a decade. The Bureau of Consular Affairs issues machine-readable visas and stores data on visa applicants in the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD). The CCD includes photographs and ten-finger scans of applicants, links with other databases to flag issues affecting visa issuance, and screens aliens for admissibility. The Visa Waiver Program allows some foreign visitors to enter the US without visas. The Visa Waiver Program allows aliens from certain countries to enter the US without visas. Exceptions to documentary requirements for a visa can be made in specific cases by the Attorney General and Secretary of State. The INA requires inspection of all aliens seeking entry, and possession of a visa does not guarantee admission. In 2013, 362 million travelers entered the United States through 329 official ports of entry, including preclearance offices in Canada, Ireland, and the Caribbean. Border inspections are crucial for foreign nationals entering without visas, with biometric identifiers required by the Office of Biometric Identity Management. The automated biometric entry-exit system in the United States uses biometric identifiers for immigration identification and is stored in DHS databases. However, DHS lacks reliable data on persons who depart the country, including U.S. citizens, LPRs, and nonimmigrants. The I-94 Arrival/Departure form was discontinued in 2013 for air and sea ports but is still used at land ports of entry. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified weaknesses in collecting the I-94 Departure Record at land ports of entry, including vulnerability to manipulation. The exit component of the automated biometric entry-exit system has faced budgetary and structural issues, with DHS considering abandoning plans for its implementation. The DHS proposed methodology to verify departures of foreign nationals from the United States was deemed insufficient by the GAO. Despite testing six exit data pilot programs since 2004, only two programs involving biographic information sharing have been successful and ongoing. The DHS has described Canada as successful in ongoing efforts to address nonimmigrant overstays, which have been a long-standing issue in the immigration control debate. In 1981, the SCIRP recommended the establishment of a fully automated system to track nonimmigrant arrivals and departures from the United States, a recommendation that was later put into law by Congress in 1996. Despite these efforts, nonimmigrant overstays remain a congressional concern. In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) to address nonimmigrant overstays. The act clarified that a nonimmigrant visa becomes void if the individual overstays their authorized period. It also created new grounds for exclusion for those unlawfully present in the US, with penalties ranging from 3 years to 10 years of inadmissibility. These provisions are still a congressional concern. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 introduced the 3- and 10-year bars for inadmissibility. It also mandated the development of an automated entry/exit system for tracking nonimmigrants' departures and arrivals, leading to the creation of the Office of Biometric Identity Management system. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 aimed to enhance visa issuance and alien tracking procedures. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 required the development of an interoperable electronic data system for sharing information on alien admissibility and removability, implementing an integrated entry-exit data system, and adding biometric identifiers to all visas. It also placed new requirements on the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries to issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable passports with biometric identifiers and report theft of blank passports. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of 2004 included provisions to curb nonimmigrant overstays and implement recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. The IRTPA of 2004 required accelerated deployment of biometric entry and exit systems, expanded pre-inspection programs at foreign airports, mandated all individuals entering the US to have proper identification, and established new standards for federal use of identification documents. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 created a waiver for countries with visa refusal rates under 10% to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). This waiver required an air exit system and the electronic system for travel authorization (ESTA) to be operational. The ESTA allows foreign nationals to provide biographical information before travel to check for security risks. The CBP officer determines entry into the US and the permitted stay duration. The data on nonimmigrant overstays is unreliable due to issues with the I-94 Arrival/Departure form collection process. Some nonimmigrant visitors are exempt from filling out the I-94, such as Canadian and Mexican citizens with specific conditions. In 1996, an estimated 41% of unauthorized alien residents overstayed their nonimmigrant visas. In 2000, it was estimated that 2.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the US were nonimmigrant overstays, accounting for 33% of the total. The US Government Accountability Office found varying percentages of nonimmigrant overstays in 2004: 31%, 27%, and 57%. Warren concluded in 2003 that the net nonimmigrant overstay figures are likely overestimates. The 2004 GAO study found that the extent of overstaying is significant and may be understated by DHS's estimate. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated that 33% to 50% of the unauthorized resident alien population are nonimmigrant overstays. ICE's Overstay Analysis Unit identifies potential visa overstays by matching arrival and departure records, with a backlog of 1.6 million unmatched arrival records in January 2011. The GAO reviewed a backlog of 1.6 million potential overstay records in January 2011, finding that about half had departed or adjusted status. DHS had over 1 million unmatched arrival records as of June 2013. Recent analyses by Robert Warren and John Robert Warren show a significant drop in unauthorized aliens arriving in the US since 2001, with nonimmigrant overstays decreasing from 705,000 to 190,000 over a decade. Estimates by Warren and Warren show a significant decline in unauthorized aliens arriving in the US from 2000 to 2009. Entries without inspections decreased every year after 2005, not just during the 2008-2009 recession. The authors note that their estimations are based on broader population trends and lack direct information on overstays. These estimates do not align with official entry-exit data and are affected by difficulties in measuring unauthorized migration components. The Department of Homeland Security faces challenges in accurately estimating nonimmigrant overstays due to issues with updating alien records and the lack of a reliable method to measure emigration or implement an effective exit-monitoring system."
