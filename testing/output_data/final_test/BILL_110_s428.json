    "content": "The Act titled \"IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 2007\" amends the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 to include provisions for IP-enabled voice service providers to provide 9-1-1 and E-9-1-1 services. The IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 2007 requires IP-enabled voice service providers to offer 9-1-1 service to subscribers as per Commission orders. Regulations grant these providers access to necessary 9-1-1 components under similar conditions as mobile service providers. The Commission requires IP-enabled voice service providers to register and establish a point of contact for public safety officials regarding 9-1-1 services. Enforcement of regulations may be delegated to State commissions or agencies. The IP-Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 2007 does not repeal Federal regulations requiring IP-enabled voice service providers to offer 9-1-1 service. The FCC cannot mandate specific technology standards, but can require providers of voice services to offer 9-1-1 service. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 defines terms related to IP-enabled voice services and 9-1-1 services, including enhanced IP-enabled 9-1-1 service designated by the FCC. The term '9-1-1 component' refers to equipment, networks, databases, interfaces, and other facilities necessary for the delivery of 9-1-1 or E-9-1-1 calls, as defined by the FCC in its Report and Order in WC Docket Nos. 04-36 and 05-196. SEC. 3. PARITY OF PROTECTION FOR PROVISION OR USE OF IP-ENABLED VOICE SERVICE. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 is amended to include IP-enabled voice service providers and alternative emergency communications service providers. Changes are made to ensure parity of protection for emergency calls, services, and alternative emergency communications. The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 is amended to include IP-enabled voice service providers and alternative emergency communications service providers. The term 'alternative emergency communications service' is defined as the provision of emergency information to a public safety answering point via wire or radio communications, including 9-1-1 and enhanced 9-1-1 Services. The term 'alternative emergency communications service provider' refers to an entity authorized to provide emergency communications services by the Commission or local/state 9-1-1 governing authority, excluding traditional carriers. State authority of fees. State authority to impose fees on providers of IP-enabled voice services or commercial mobile services for the support of 9-1-1 services is not restricted by federal laws or regulations. The fees must align with those imposed on providers of telecommunications services and be used for emergency communication services as specified by state or local law. SEC. 5. FEE ACCOUNTABILITY.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission must report annually to Congress on the collection and distribution of 9-1-1 fees in each State, ensuring transparency and proper use of funds.\n\nSEC. 6. MIGRATION TO IP-ENABLED EMERGENCY NETWORK. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act is amended to require a national plan for migrating to an IP-enabled emergency network capable of responding to all citizen activated emergency communications. The plan required for migrating to an IP-enabled emergency network must outline benefits, address barriers and funding, ensure availability in all communities, identify location technology, propose a timetable and costs, and include legislative language if needed. The plan for migrating to an IP-enabled emergency network must provide recommendations on legislative changes, assess trial deployments, document solutions for 9-1-1 access for those with disabilities, and recommend implementation steps and timeline. The Federal Communications Commission may compile a list of public safety answering point contact information and consult with various stakeholders to develop recommendations for implementing automatic location solutions for 9-1-1 purposes. The Federal Communications Commission may compile a list of public safety answering point contact information and work with stakeholders to develop best practices for defining geographic coverage areas for Public Safety Answering Points. The Federal Communications Commission is working on defining geographic coverage areas, network diversity requirements, call-handling procedures, certification and testing requirements, validation procedures, and address information format for Public Safety Answering Points. SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT. The FCC will enforce the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999 as part of the Communications Act of 1934. Any violation of the 1999 Act is considered a violation of the Communications Act of 1934. SEC. 8. COMPLETION OF THE HATFIELD REPORT. The Federal Communications Commission must provide funding for the completion of an update to the Hatfield Report on Wireless Enhanced 9-1-1 Services within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Mr. Hatfield is required to submit his findings to the FCC within 60 days of receiving the payment. Additionally, the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 is amended to be called the '911 Modernization Act'. The Senate passed S. 428 on February 26, 2008, amending the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999."
