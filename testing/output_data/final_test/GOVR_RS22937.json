    "content": "Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, U.S. nuclear cooperation with other countries requires a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement. This includes the transfer of special nuclear material for commercial, medical, and industrial purposes, as well as the export of reactors and critical parts. Section 123 agreements are necessary for exports under NRC authority, and they set the terms of reference and authorize cooperation, requiring congressional approval. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 requires peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements for U.S. nuclear cooperation with other countries. Section 123 agreements must meet nonproliferation criteria and be submitted to Congress for approval. The Department of State provides a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement to explain how the agreement meets nonproliferation requirements. The NPAS is required to explain how a nuclear cooperation agreement meets nonproliferation criteria. The President must determine that the agreement will not pose an unreasonable risk to national defense. Section 123 of the AEA outlines the necessary steps for nuclear cooperation, including criteria the agreement must meet and the process for submitting it to Congress for approval. Section 123c. outlines the procedure for congressional approval of limited scope cooperation agreements, while Section 123d. covers significant nuclear cooperation agreements. Section 123a. lists criteria for agreements with nonnuclear weapon states, including safeguards on transferred nuclear material and equipment. The United States has the right to demand the return of nuclear materials if certain conditions are violated by the cooperating state, including detonating a nuclear explosive device or terminating safeguards agreements. Restrictions on retransfer, enrichment, and reprocessing of nuclear material are also imposed, with approval required for storage and construction of facilities using transferred technology. The technology transferred under the cooperation agreement is subject to specific requirements outlined in the Atomic Energy Act. The President has the authority to exempt agreements from certain requirements if they are deemed detrimental to U.S. nonproliferation objectives or national security. All Section 123 agreements currently in force are nonexempt agreements. The President can exempt nuclear cooperation agreements from certain requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. Congress has 90 days to review the agreement, with the President consulting with committees for at least 30 days before submitting it to Congress. The President can exempt nuclear cooperation agreements from certain requirements of the Atomic Energy Act. The agreement is sent to Congress for a 60-day review period, along with supporting documents and a national security determination. If not exempted, the agreement can enter into force after the 60-day period unless Congress adopts a resolution disapproving it. During the 60-day review period, Congress must adopt a joint resolution of approval or disapproval for nuclear cooperation agreements. Committees hold hearings and submit reports recommending approval or disapproval. If no resolution is reported by the end of 45 days, the committee is discharged. Congress then considers the resolution under expedited procedures. Congress must consider nuclear cooperation agreements under expedited procedures if no resolution is reported within 45 days. The United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act amended the AEA to require the President to inform relevant committees of any new agreements. The AEA outlines procedures for licensing exports to states with nuclear cooperation agreements. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) must meet specific criteria in authorizing export licenses for nuclear material, equipment, or technology. These criteria include applying IAEA safeguards, prohibiting the use of exports for nuclear explosive devices, and ensuring recipient states have adequate physical security measures. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) must authorize export licenses for nuclear material, equipment, or technology, with conditions such as applying IAEA safeguards and prohibiting retransfer without U.S. approval. Recipient states must have full-scope IAEA safeguards, and the President must approve exports that are not inimical to common defense and security. The executive branch considers various factors when authorizing export licenses for nuclear material, including nonproliferation policy adherence, potential prejudice to U.S. objectives, and agreement to specified conditions. The President can authorize exports that do not meet certain criteria if it is deemed necessary for U.S. nonproliferation goals. The President can authorize exports of nuclear material that may be prejudicial to U.S. nonproliferation objectives. If deemed necessary, the President can submit an executive order to Congress for approval within 60 days. Waivers can be granted if full-scope safeguards are adopted or if U.S. foreign policy interests dictate reconsideration. Export of sensitive nuclear technology is prohibited under Section 129b.(1). The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 prohibits the export of nuclear materials and equipment to state sponsors of terrorism. The President can waive this provision, but additional restrictions apply to countries with entities conducting nuclear weapons-related transactions with Iran. No license may be issued for nuclear exports to such countries, unless waived by the President. Section 102a.(2)(B) allows the President to waive restrictions on nuclear exports. Section 102a.(2)(C) permits licenses for nuclear exports on a case-by-case basis to entities in sanctioned countries. Section 131 of the AEA outlines procedures for subsequent arrangements to nuclear cooperation agreements, including transfers of nuclear material or technology. These arrangements may also cover physical security, storage, safeguards, and other important measures. The President has the authority to waive restrictions on nuclear exports and permits licenses for exports to sanctioned countries on a case-by-case basis. Procedures for subsequent arrangements to nuclear cooperation agreements are outlined in Section 131 of the AEA, covering transfers of nuclear material or technology, physical security, storage, safeguards, and other important measures. The Secretary of Energy must publish a determination in the Federal Register before entering into a subsequent arrangement, and the Secretary of State must prepare a Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement if the arrangement may contribute to proliferation. The President can waive the 60-day requirement for subsequent nuclear cooperation arrangements if the Secretary of State requests, but must inform the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Section 131 outlines requirements for specific types of subsequent arrangements, including those involving reprocessing of U.S.-origin nuclear material. The Secretary of Energy must receive the Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement before entering into any subsequent arrangement. The Secretary of Energy must provide a report to Congress before entering into a nuclear cooperation arrangement involving reprocessing material. A waiting period of 15 days is required, unless there is an emergency. If the arrangement involves a facility that has not processed nuclear fuel before 1978, the Secretaries of State and Energy must ensure it does not increase the risk of proliferation. The Secretaries must consider timely warning conditions for reprocessing or retransfer of nuclear material. Congressional approval is required for subsequent arrangements involving foreign spent nuclear fuel storage or disposition. The Secretary of Energy must ensure that reprocessing under certain conditions meets timely-warning criteria. The Secretary of Energy must consult with the Secretary of Defense on the physical protection of special nuclear material during export or transfer to deter theft and terrorism. If a genuine terrorist threat is identified, the Secretary of Defense must provide a risk assessment and recommend necessary physical protection measures. In 1978, the Department of Energy notified Congress of a Japanese request to transfer spent fuel assemblies to the UK for reprocessing. In 1978, the Department of Energy notified Congress of a Japanese request to transfer spent fuel assemblies from Japan to the United Kingdom for reprocessing, marking the first approved \"subsequent arrangement.\" This led to a series of similar arrangements between the United States and Japan until 1988 when their nuclear cooperation agreement was revised. The revised agreement included a 30-year advance consent for the transfer of spent fuel from Japan to Europe for reprocessing, which was controversial but not blocked by Congress. Additionally, a subsequent arrangement was made for the sea transport of plutonium from Europe to Japan, with the Department of Energy granting a 30-year advance consent for this transfer in October 1988. The agreement with India allows New Delhi to reprocess nuclear material transferred under the agreement, with a requirement to build a new national reprocessing facility. A subsequent arrangement signed in 2010 governs the operation of two new reprocessing facilities in India, including procedures for U.S. officials to inspect and receive information on physical protection measures. Congress did not adopt a resolution of disapproval within 30 days, allowing the arrangement to take effect. If India builds new reprocessing facilities for U.S.-supplied reactors, a new arrangement must be submitted to Congress under Section 129a. of the AEA. This section requires the U.S. to stop exports of nuclear materials to nonnuclear weapon states that violate certain conditions. The President can terminate exports to nations violating nuclear agreements or aiding nonnuclear weapon states in obtaining nuclear materials. Waivers can be granted if cessation of exports harms U.S. nonproliferation goals. Congress must review the President's determination for 60 days. The Atomic Energy Act allows for limited forms of nuclear cooperation outside the US with authorization from the Secretary of Energy, following a determination that it is not against US interests. These authorizations are known as \"Part 810 authorizations\" and are regulated by 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 810. Part 810 regulations outline activities authorized by the Secretary of Energy, including specific destinations and reporting requirements. These authorizations involve unclassified nuclear technology transfer and services, excluding exports licensed by NRC under 10 C.F.R. Part 110. Civilian nuclear cooperation agreements under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act are not required for Part 810 authorizations or transmission of nuclear-related information, except for restricted data. The NRC may authorize activities governed by Part 810 authorizations under a 123 agreement or subsequent arrangement. Part 810.9 includes factors for the Secretary of Energy to determine if an activity will not be inimical to the interests of the United States. The list of generally authorized destinations is based on U.S. agreements for civil nuclear cooperation. The No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act of 2018, introduced by Senators Markey and Rubio, requires approval for a 123 agreement with Saudi Arabia. The bill includes conditions such as transparency regarding Jamal Khashoggi's death, renouncing uranium enrichment, and progress on human rights. The President must submit a report on Saudi Arabia's progress in meeting these conditions. The bills introduced by Representative Brad Sherman and Senators Markey and Rubio require the President to submit a report assessing Saudi Arabia's progress on conditions such as renouncing uranium enrichment and human rights. The Nuclear Cooperation Agreements Reform Act of 2018 aims to amend the Atomic Energy Act to include additional provisions in nonexempt nuclear cooperation agreements. The bill H.R. 7351 includes provisions such as guaranteeing no access to sensitive materials without U.S. consent, maintaining a legal regime for civil liability protection, and allowing the U.S. to demand return of items if safeguards are violated. It also requires implementing an Additional Protocol to IAEA safeguards, export control measures, and compliance with UN conventions and Security Council resolutions. The bill H.R. 7351 requires the United States to fully implement international agreements on weapons of mass destruction prevention, including the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention. It also prohibits nuclear cooperation agreements with countries not cooperating in preventing state sponsors of terrorism from acquiring nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. H.R. 7351 aims to prevent state sponsors of terrorism from acquiring nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and advanced conventional weapons. It limits nuclear cooperation agreements to 15 years and prohibits nuclear-related exports to countries seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction. The bill also requires the President to consult with relevant congressional committees on ongoing nuclear cooperation negotiations within 15 days of initiation. The bill requires the President to consult with congressional committees on ongoing nuclear cooperation negotiations within 15 days of initiation and monthly thereafter until negotiations are concluded. It also mandates a report on countries' nuclear nonproliferation requirements for exports and the incorporation of US-origin components in their exports. H.R. 7351 includes provisions related to U.S. foreign assistance, such as prohibiting assistance to countries that have withdrawn from the NPT and requiring the return of materials transferred under nuclear cooperation agreements. It also prohibits assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The bill, H.R. 7351, prohibits assistance to countries supporting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missiles for such weapons. It includes reporting requirements, a presidential waiver provision, and considerations for recipients of assistance under certain acts. H.R. 7351 prohibits assistance to countries supporting proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or missiles. It allows joint resolutions approving nuclear cooperation agreements to include additional provisions. The bill also mandates Congress to approve subsequent arrangements to nuclear cooperation agreements. Some experts suggest forgoing enrichment and reprocessing in nuclear cooperation agreements, but the Atomic Energy Act does not require this. The Atomic Energy Act mandates U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements to require U.S. consent for any changes involving enrichment or reprocessing of U.S.-origin material. The U.S. has argued that its nuclear cooperation agreement with the UAE could set a precedent for mitigating nuclear proliferation risks. President Obama's letter to Congress highlighted the agreement's potential as a model for other countries. The U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperation agreement is seen as a potential model for other countries in the region interested in responsible nuclear energy development. It includes nonproliferation provisions requiring the UAE to implement the Additional Protocol and prohibits the country from possessing sensitive nuclear facilities on its territory. The U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperation agreement prohibits the UAE from possessing sensitive nuclear facilities or engaging in activities related to enrichment or reprocessing of nuclear material. The agreement also grants the United States the right to terminate cooperation and require the return of any nuclear material if the UAE violates the terms. The Obama Administration announced in December 2013 that renouncing domestic enrichment and reprocessing would not be a prerequisite for nuclear cooperation agreements with all countries. The U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement with Vietnam in 2014 did not require forgoing enrichment and reprocessing, but Vietnam committed to relying on international markets for nuclear fuel supply. Congress has approved nuclear cooperation agreements outside the Atomic Energy Act process through legislation. President Obama did not follow the legislative process required by the Atomic Energy Act for the U.S.-Australia nuclear cooperation agreement. The House approved H.R. 6411, but the Senate did not pass S. 3844. In 1985, President Reagan submitted the first U.S.-China nuclear cooperation agreement to Congress, which required certain nonproliferation certifications. President Clinton signed required certifications regarding China's nuclear nonproliferation policy and practices, waiving a sanction imposed under P.L. 101-246. Congressional review ended on March 18, 1998, allowing the agreement to be implemented. P.L. 109-401, which became law on December 18, 2006, permitted the President to waive provisions of the AEA for a nuclear cooperation agreement with India. On October 8, 2008, President Bush signed an agreement with India into law after meeting the requirements of P.L. 109-401. Additionally, on December 16, 2016, P.L. 114-320 approved an extension of the U.S.-Norway nuclear cooperation agreement, addressing concerns about insufficient legislative days for congressional consideration."
