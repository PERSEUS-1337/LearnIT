    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Water for the Americas Partnership Act of 2001\". Congress finds that it is in the national interests of the United States to promote public and environmental health in neighboring countries, as disease and pollution do not respect borders. Improving living conditions abroad is crucial in reducing illegal immigration into the US, and the health of natural resources worldwide impacts all people, including Americans. Maintaining good relations with Latin American and Caribbean nations enhances US national security, while the US environmental technology industry offers economic growth opportunities and environmental protection globally. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. An amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 introduces a new chapter focused on the Clean Water for the Americas Partnership, defining key terms. In this chapter, a joint project is defined as a collaboration between a US association or nonprofit entity and a Latin American or Caribbean association or nonprofit entity. The terms \"Latin American or Caribbean association\" and \"Latin American or Caribbean nonprofit entity\" are also clarified. The term 'Latin American or Caribbean nonprofit entity' includes institutions of higher education, private nonprofit entities involved in international education activities, and research institutes in the region. The term 'President' refers to the President acting through the Administrator of the agency responsible for this part. The term 'region' refers to the member countries of the Organization of American States, excluding the United States and Canada. The term 'United States association' refers to a business league described in the Internal Revenue Code. 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(6)) exempts United States nonprofit entities from taxation under section 501(a) of the same Code. This includes institutions of higher education, private nonprofit entities involved in international education activities, and research organizations based in the United States. The President is authorized to establish the 'Clean Water for the Americas Partnership' program within the agency responsible for this part. Personnel from various departments can be utilized. An environmental assessment is required. The President is authorized to conduct a comprehensive environmental assessment in the region to identify key environmental threats to human health and natural resources. Additionally, the establishment of Technology America Centers is proposed. The President, in consultation with the Director General of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service of the Department of Commerce, is authorized to establish Technology America Centers (TEAMs) in the region to link US private sector environmental technology firms with local partners, focusing on urban environmental problems and assisting small businesses. The United States and Foreign Commercial Service, in consultation with the President, may establish Technology America Centers (TEAMs) in countries to provide support for US firms and address environmental issues. The presence of a US Agency for International Development mission in the country is not a requirement for locating a TEAM there. The President is authorized to provide matching grants to US associations and nonprofit entities for promoting water quality, treatment systems, and energy efficiency in the region. Grants will support joint projects, exchanges, training programs, and the development of local chapters and online exchanges. Additionally, grants for prefeasibility studies within a designated subregion are available. The President is authorized to make grants for prefeasibility studies for water projects in designated subregions or countries. Non-Federal contributions are required for grants, and funds are limited per project. Grant funds under this section are available only for the prefeasibility portion of a project. Prefeasibility is defined as not more than 25 percent of the design phase of the project. The term 'subregion' refers to areas within the region such as Central America, the Andean region, and the Southern cone. The President is authorized to establish a Clean Water Technical Assistance Committee to provide support for water projects. The Committee consists of international investors, lenders, and water service providers. Members act as advisers and may form specialized groups for training and technical assistance. The Committee is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. Authorization of $10,000,000 for fiscal years 2002-2004 to the President for water projects. Funds remain available until expended. Effective October 1, 2001. The President must submit a report to Congress two years after the enactment of the Act, assessing the progress of the program established under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Any recommendations for legislative changes for fiscal year 2004 must also be included. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, chapter 13, will be repealed 3 years after the program described in section 500A is established, unless the Administrator of USAID certifies it's in the national interest to continue for an additional 2 years."
