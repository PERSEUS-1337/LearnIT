The critical electric infrastructure of the United States and Canada has over $1 trillion in asset value, 200,000+ miles of transmission lines, and 800,000+ megawatts of generating capability, serving 300+ million people. The infrastructure relies heavily on computer-based control systems connected to open networks, increasing cyber vulnerabilities. Connectivity exposes control systems to cyber risks from malicious actors, including foreign nation states, domestic criminals, hackers, and disgruntled employees. Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) events also threaten critical electric infrastructure, as reported by the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from EMP Attack in 2008. The Department of Homeland Security's Control Systems Security Program aims to enhance the reliability, security, and resilience of control systems against cyber attacks. This includes developing risk reduction products, supporting ICS-CERT in vulnerability mitigation, and coordinating activities to improve critical infrastructure security. Recent news reports indicate that the electronic control systems of the United States electrical system have been compromised by cyber spies from China, Russia, and other countries. This poses a threat to national security, highlighting the need for statutory mechanisms to protect the critical electric infrastructure against cyber threats. Despite existing cybersecurity standards, there is a call for enhanced measures to improve the nation's critical infrastructure security posture. In April 2009, a report from NERC revealed that utilities are underreporting their assets, potentially to avoid compliance requirements. Only 23 percent of utilities identified Critical Cyber Assets as required by NERC standards. NERC urged entities to reassess their methodology to identify and secure more Critical Cyber Assets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission needs additional legal authorities to protect the electric power system against cyber attacks. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with other agencies, is tasked with researching and determining if federally owned electronic devices essential to critical electric infrastructure have been compromised. The scope of research includes identifying attackers, penetration methods, and ramifications on critical infrastructure and national security. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report findings to Congress, with a possible classified annex. Amendments to the Federal Power Act are proposed for additional protection against cyber attacks. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report findings to Congress regarding critical infrastructure and national security, with proposed amendments to the Federal Power Act for protection against cyber attacks. The term 'critical electric infrastructure' refers to systems and assets essential for generating, transmitting, and distributing electric energy, crucial for national security and public safety. 'Critical electric infrastructure information' pertains to data related to these systems. The term 'critical electric infrastructure information' refers to data related to critical electric infrastructure. It includes information on cyber threats and vulnerabilities that could disrupt the operation of essential electronic devices and communication networks. The Secretary of Homeland Security assesses cyber vulnerabilities and threats to critical infrastructure, including electric infrastructure, to enhance domestic preparedness for homeland security. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with reporting on cyber vulnerabilities, terrorist threats, and nation-state threats to critical electric infrastructure to improve domestic preparedness and response capabilities. Security will transmit reports on cyber vulnerabilities or threats to Congress and the appropriate committees, including the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee of the Senate. Reports may include a classified annex. If a significant cyber vulnerability or threat to critical electric infrastructure is identified, the Secretary of Homeland Security will communicate this determination to the Commission promptly. The Secretary of Homeland Security may use intelligence from other agencies to determine critical electric infrastructure protection. The Commission can issue rules to safeguard against threats without prior notice in emergencies. The Commission can issue emergency rules to protect critical electric infrastructure for up to 90 days without prior notice, allowing for input from interested parties before affirming, amending, or repealing the rule. Entities owning, controlling, or operating critical electric infrastructure are subject to the Commission's jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. The Commission can issue emergency rules to protect critical electric infrastructure for up to 90 days without prior notice, allowing for input from interested parties before affirming, amending, or repealing the rule. Entities owning, controlling, or operating critical electric infrastructure are subject to the Commission's jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. Additionally, provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 apply to critical electric infrastructure information submitted to the Commission. \"SEC. 224B. PROTECTION AGAINST KNOWN CYBER VULNERABILITIES OR THREATS TO THE CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE.\" The Commission will establish mandatory interim measures within 120 days to protect against cyber vulnerabilities in the critical electric infrastructure. These measures will supplement or replace existing cybersecurity standards deemed inadequate. The Commission will establish mandatory interim measures within 120 days to protect against cyber vulnerabilities in critical electric infrastructure. These measures may be replaced by new cybersecurity reliability standards developed and approved under section 215. Owners, users, or operators of critical electric infrastructure may be required to develop and submit plans to address cyber vulnerabilities or threats identified by the Commission. The Secretary of Homeland Security will evaluate the capacity and authority of federal agencies to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks, enhancing domestic preparedness and response."
