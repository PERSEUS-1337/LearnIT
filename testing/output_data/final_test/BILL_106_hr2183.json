    "content": "The Act titled \"Church Plan Parity and Entanglement Prevention Act of 1999\" supersedes certain state laws regarding coverage of certain church plans under ERISA provisions. The Church Plan Parity and Entanglement Prevention Act of 1999 amends Section 4 of ERISA to specify that section 514 applies to church plans superseding State insurance law if the plan meets certain requirements. A church plan must be established and maintained by a church, convention, or association of churches to meet the criteria. The Church, convention, or organization must have been operating for over 5 years in connection with employee benefit plans. They need to file an affidavit with the Secretary each plan year, confirming the plan meets requirements specified by the Secretary. The Secretary will consult with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners when issuing regulations. The requirements of this subsection aim to maintain a presumption against superseding State law. The term 'church plan' excludes entities whose primary purpose is not the administration or funding of benefits for church employees. State laws are not affected by this subsection, except for insurance-related matters. The subsection exempts insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and provider service organizations from certain state laws regulating insurance, unless applied directly to a church plan meeting specific requirements. This title supersedes state laws that prohibit agents or brokers from selling insurance in connection with a church plan that doesn't comply with state laws otherwise superseded by this title. The subsection exempts insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and provider service organizations from certain state laws regulating insurance in connection with a church plan meeting specific requirements. This includes prohibiting insurers from issuing stop-loss policies and service providers from providing services for such church plans. The subsection does not override any other federal laws or regulations.
