    "content": "In the last decade, government partnerships with the private sector have been emphasized in international development literature and U.S. development policy discussions. The United Nations' Millennium Development Goals include Goal 8 to \"develop a global partnership\" with a focus on working with the private sector to increase global access to information technology and pharmaceuticals. Both the George W. Bush Administration's \"transformational diplomacy\" initiative and the Obama Administration's U.S. Global Development Policy highlighted the importance of engaging the private sector. U.S. development activities have reflected this emphasis, with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) alone participating in 1,600 public-private partnerships (PPPs) with over 3,000 partners. The report discusses the evolution of private sector involvement in U.S. foreign assistance programs, the benefits and drawbacks of public-private partnerships (PPPs), and how partnerships are used by other donors and agencies. It also addresses partnership-related issues of interest to Congress in the foreign assistance authorization and reform process. In the mid-1970s, USAID started using NGOs more frequently to implement development programs, allowing for flexibility and cost savings while maintaining government control. In the 1980s, the Reagan Administration focused on supporting indigenous private enterprises for economic development through initiatives like the Private Enterprise Initiative. In the 1980s, the Reagan Administration supported private enterprises for economic development through initiatives like the Private Enterprise Initiative. This approach was reflected in the establishment of enterprise funds using USAID funds to invest in small businesses in Central and Eastern Europe. Microenterprise programs also became popular, with USAID supporting local financial institutions providing small loans to entrepreneurs. Today, government aid agencies collaborate with private entities for economic growth and development. The rise of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in development assistance is a new model that leverages the presence of international corporations and foundations in developing countries. This approach involves formal relationships with common objectives, mutual resource contributions, and shared risk. The concept of PPPs is important to understand the debate around their effectiveness in international development. Liberalized trade policies and information technology innovations have increased global actors and private financial flows to developing countries. Official development assistance from government donors only accounted for 18% of total financial flows between OECD member countries and developing countries in 2010. Private capital flows, remittances, and philanthropy made up the majority of U.S. financial flows to the developing world in 2010. In the evolving landscape of global financial flows, private capital is increasingly playing a significant role in developing countries. Donor governments are no longer the primary foreign players, with aid policies now influenced by trade, investment, and migration trends. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are seen as a way to leverage private resources for development and business interests. USAID and the State Department have been active in implementing PPP models, with the Millennium Challenge Corporation also adopting this approach in its country compacts. The Corporation has applied a new partnership model in its country compacts, with many large PPPs involving multiple U.S. agencies as partners. USAID has been a leader in promoting international development through PPPs since establishing the Global Development Alliance Secretariat in 2001. They have participated in over 1,600 PPPs with more than 3,000 partners, including corporations, universities, and foundations. In the Jordan Education Initiative, USAID partnered with private sector technology companies like Cisco and Dell to modernize curriculum content and information technology in education. USAID contributed $11.25 million while private partners contributed $25.6 million. In the Sustainable Tree Crops Alliance, USAID collaborated with cocoa industry stakeholders to improve small tree crop farmers' income and environmental sustainability in West and Central Africa. The sustainability of cocoa production systems in West and Central Africa was supported through technology transfer, marketing, and institutional innovations. USAID contributed $2.18 million in 2002, with other partners adding $7.55 million. Tables 1 and 2 outline the objectives and partner roles for USAID PPPs. The GDA Secretariat was initially meant to be temporary but evolved into the Office of Global Development Alliances due to delays in mainstreaming the GDA business model within USAID. Global Development Alliances, now part of USAID's Global Partnerships Division, have become essential in program planning at U.S. missions abroad. Efforts to institutionalize alliances have been strengthened by new foreign service officers trained as alliance builders. The international community's push to engage a broader range of development stakeholders has further mainstreamed the alliance concept. The GP Division in Washington supports mission staff in developing strategic alliances and serves as a contact point for private sector engagement. The Global Partnerships Division at USAID focuses on strategic alliances with private sector entities to advance knowledge and improve alliance efficiency. They have established Global Framework agreements with companies like Cisco and Hewlett-Packard to provide IT training in multiple countries. As of September 2013, USAID had Global Frameworks with various companies and organizations. The State Department's Global Partnership Center (GPC) was established in 2007 to expand the use of partnerships with the private sector, following Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's \"transformational diplomacy\" initiative. This initiative aimed to leverage resources and expertise from companies like MacArthur Foundation, PepsiCo, and Microsoft Corporation for policy and programmatic objectives. The Global Partnership Center (GPC) was rebranded as the Global Partnership Initiative (GPI) in 2009 under the Obama Administration, emphasizing the importance of partnerships within the State Department. The transition aimed to enhance the division's effectiveness in leading State efforts without additional resources. State Department PPPs focus on diplomatic objectives, although they often support partnerships with development goals. The State Department's Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) focus on diplomatic objectives, aiming to enhance the United States' reputation abroad and build relationships between people with common interests. Examples include the Global Women's Mentoring Partnership and the Breast Cancer Global Congress, where State collaborates with organizations like the Avon Foundation to connect experts and public health representatives from various countries. Germany is connecting experts and public health representatives from over 40 countries to share ideas and promote public-private initiatives for breast cancer treatment. The Global Partnerships Initiative (GPI) is focusing on four flagship partnerships, including the Accelerating Markets Partnership in Brazil and the International Diaspora Engagement Alliance (IDEA) supporting diaspora-centered initiatives in entrepreneurship, volunteerism, and philanthropy. The State Department, through partnerships like the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves and Partnership for a New Beginning, serves as a convener and facilitator for development alliances, providing leadership and credibility. Unlike USAID, State does not provide funds but plays a key role in bringing together private sector leaders for partnership activities. Other U.S. agencies also collaborate with the private sector on development public-private partnerships. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is well positioned to utilize Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for development, working in countries committed to open markets and fighting corruption. MCC encourages private sector engagement to leverage resources and enhance sustainability. They have a \"Private Sector Initiative Toolkit\" for guidance on different types of engagement, including risk-sharing infrastructure activities with private companies. Most of MCC's work with the private sector involves outsourcing public services, rather than the development alliance model promoted by State and USAID. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) utilize Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to advance economic development and U.S. commercial interests in developing countries. USTDA supports infrastructure development and fair trade through technical assistance and feasibility studies. OPIC provides financing, guarantees, and political risk insurance to U.S. businesses operating in foreign markets. OPIC provides financing, guarantees, and political risk insurance to U.S. businesses investing in emerging markets, promoting economic growth and job creation. Development professionals debate whether these activities are foreign assistance or support U.S. commercial interests. This aligns with the Administration's focus on promoting trade and private investment in development policy. Many U.S. agencies involved in foreign assistance also engage in development PPPs. The U.S. agency involved in foreign assistance partners with other agencies in development PPPs, such as the Department of Agriculture in the Sustainable Forest Alliance and the Department of Energy in the Clean Cities Program. Other major bilateral aid donors are also increasingly working with the private sector, like the BMZ partnership with Kraft Foods to benefit cocoa farmers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The Canadian development agency, CIDA, uses PPPs to support investment studies and pilot programs for Canadian firms in developing countries. The UK's DFID utilizes \"challenge funds\" for private businesses to establish new ventures or improve existing ones in developing countries. The African Enterprise Challenge Fund provides competitive grants for business ventures in Africa. The African Enterprise Challenge Fund and the Food Retail Industry Challenge Fund provide grants to support innovative business models in Africa. Multilateral development institutions, like the United Nations and the World Bank, are also leveraging private sector resources to achieve development goals. The UN Global Compact promotes corporate social responsibility among international businesses. The World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) is a multilateral PPP model that brings together public and private entities to achieve shared development goals. PPPs are becoming more common as they allow for shared risks and resources, enabling both partners to achieve goals more effectively than acting alone. Partnerships in modern projects involve joint resource contributions from government and private entities, allowing for larger scale implementation and cost savings. PPPs aim to make projects self-sustaining by tapping into core business interests, as seen in the SUCCESS Alliance's integration of Vietnamese cocoa farmers into Mars's supply chain with assistance from USAID and the World Bank. The partnership between USAID, Mars, and the World Cocoa Foundation aims to improve farmer incomes by integrating Vietnamese cocoa farmers into Mars's supply chain. This collaboration leverages market access and networks, such as partnering with MTV to reach a global audience for messages against human trafficking and promoting HIV/AIDS prevention. The partnership with USAID can enhance reputation in developing countries. Technology companies like Cisco and Microsoft help overcome barriers to technology access. Private companies have specialized industry knowledge that aid agencies may lack. In Guatemala's Inclusive Market Alliance for Rural Entrepreneurs (IMARE), Walmart provides market information to small-scale farmers, leading to higher incomes. Partnering with Sesame Street allows USAID to access advanced pedagogy and production capacity. Positive public relations and reputation enhancement are key considerations for corporate entities in public-private partnerships. The Small Export Vegetable Alliance in Zambia was formed with the goal of projecting a more populist image for the private sector partner Agroflora. This partnership aimed to benefit smallholder Zambian farmers and improve relationships with national and community leaders. However, some development experts are cautious about potential negative impacts of unbalanced partnership relationships and resource demands. The resource demands of partnership management can lead to negative impacts, including Management Burdens and Inadequate Evidence of Value Added. PPPs require more time and effort to design and implement than traditional development programs. Evaluating the development impact of PPPs is challenging due to the lack of a standard definition and meaningful evaluation. Critics suggest that development resources may be better directed elsewhere. Some development officials are concerned that private partnerships can divert resources from established country plan priorities. Private funding opportunities may lead to pursuing partnerships that do not align with mission priorities, resulting in high opportunity costs. Lack of private sector involvement in initial planning hinders PPP effectiveness and sustainability, disadvantaging least-developed countries and individuals. Some development experts are worried that private capital flows in modern PPPs may favor advanced developing countries over the poorest countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Analysts suggest that WHO's involvement in GAVI has diverted resources from traditional vaccines for hard-to-reach populations. USAID's PPPs are mainly funded through mission budgets, limiting their influence on country and regional priorities. Some argue that PPPs, especially those involving global corporate partners, can widen development disparities within countries by imposing international standards. Concerns include the potential for unfair advantages to private partners and the risk of taxpayer funds supporting private interests. USAID does not provide funding or guarantee profits to private partners. While PPPs can enhance reputations and benefit all involved, there is a risk of damage to U.S. agencies by associating with disreputable private sector entities. USAID vets corporate partners for social responsibility, but concerns remain, especially regarding partnerships with extractive companies in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Ghana due to corruption and exploitation in these industries. Partnerships with extractive industries can lead to corruption and exploitation. USAID partners with companies adhering to industry best practices. Concerns exist about PPPs outsourcing American jobs to developing countries. The 113th Congress may consider U.S. foreign assistance programs from various perspectives, including concerns about competition with American workers in developing countries. USAID's partnership with technology and outsourcing companies in Sri Lanka for advanced IT training has raised such concerns, especially with the suspension of English language training funded by USAID. Foreign assistance programs aim to improve economic opportunities in developing countries while balancing U.S. interests and avoiding competitive disadvantages for Americans. The 113th Congress may play a significant role in ongoing reforms related to aid efficiency and effectiveness. Fiscal constraints have led legislators to consider foreign assistance programs as potential sources of savings. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are being considered as a means to share the cost burden of development among stakeholders. The State Department's Global Partnership Initiative (GPI) is part of this effort. The State Department's Global Partnership Initiative (GPI) and USAID's Global Development Alliance (GDA) aim to create cost savings and efficiencies through partnerships with a focus on leveraging private development funds. However, the most strategic partnerships are those that bring technology, networks, or skills not otherwise accessible. Negotiating and monitoring these partnerships can require more staff time than traditional aid implementation, with costs not reflected in leverage ratios. The 113th Congress may consider private sector engagement to sustain development programs amid budget constraints. The Administration proposed reduced funding for certain foundations, suggesting partnerships with the private sector to maintain program levels. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) can impact meeting international development commitments positively or negatively, supporting global partnership goals and donor coordination. The United States signed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in 2005, committing to donor coordination goals. However, an increasing use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) could undermine other international donor commitments, such as supporting recipient country budget and procurement systems. Providing assistance through PPPs may emphasize private sector interests over recipient country governments' goals. The Obama Administration's global development policy, announced in September 2010, emphasizes Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for economic growth. USAID's Private Capital Group for Africa promotes private investment in the region, reflecting a shift towards trade and investment promotion over traditional aid projects. The Obama Administration's global development policy emphasizes Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for economic growth. Some experts suggest expanding OPIC's role in mobilizing private investment in developing countries. Development officials face obstacles due to foreign assistance procurement rules and budget unpredictability. The procurement system at the agency is seen as overly bureaucratic and risk-averse, hindering proactive engagement with the private sector. Slow approval processes and competition requirements make it difficult to maintain long-term relationships with private partners. USAID's progress in implementing PPPs has been slow, with only 1.7% of mission program funding invested in PPPs in FY2012, far below the goal of 10% by FY2015. The lack of predictability in the annual appropriations process increases transaction costs. The lack of predictability in annual appropriations at USAID hinders proactive engagement with the private sector and discourages partnership building. Other government agencies, like the State Department, have become more active in public-private partnerships for development. The incentive fund for PPPs was intended to make funding more predictable but was seen as distorting mission objectives. The QDDR aimed to coordinate international PPPs for the whole of government, addressing the interagency issue by standardizing the partnership process and creating a central database of partnerships. State and USAID have developed a compatible approach to PPPs, with State establishing broad partnership platforms and USAID supporting these platforms. A joint data call was issued in 2012 to implement the central database requirement, but the data are not yet publicly available. Congress may face challenges in overseeing development activities involving public-private partnerships (PPPs) due to limited control over private funds. Concerns about potential workarounds to congressional restrictions through PPPs raise questions on managing public resources. Inconsistent data quality from private partner contributions further complicates oversight. The USAID Inspector General audits in 2005 and 2009 highlighted issues with data on private partner contributions to USAID alliances, leading to revisions in guidance and reporting processes. The Private Sector Alliances office now includes a disclaimer when reporting public-private partnership resource data to address the challenges of applying consistent valuation standards across diverse partnerships."
