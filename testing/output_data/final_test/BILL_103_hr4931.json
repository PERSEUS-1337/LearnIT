The Gulf of Maine is a vital environmental and economic resource shared by the United States and Canada. It supports diverse marine wildlife populations, including birds, fish, whales, dolphins, and endangered species. Additionally, it holds significant value as a recreation resource for a large portion of the United States population. The Gulf of Maine, with 75,600,000 people living within a 1-day drive, contains national parks and a marine sanctuary. It supports a commercial fishing industry generating over $800,000,000 annually and employs 20,000 people. Tourism in the region attracts 10,000,000 visitors yearly, contributing millions in revenue and supporting maritime facilities. The Gulf of Maine supports a commercial fishing industry and tourism, attracting millions of visitors annually. Studies show that without coordinated management, the region's resources may have adverse impacts on the environment and economy. Environmental threats, including high levels of toxic contaminants, are too complex to be managed by a single agency. The Gulf of Maine ecosystem is facing challenges such as bacterial contamination closing shellfish beds and habitat loss, leading to economic losses. The interconnected natural resources in the region require cooperation between States, provinces, and Federal Governments to protect them. The Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment, established in 1989, facilitates interjurisdictional cooperation and coordination of efforts to protect the resources of the Gulf of Maine and stimulate its economy. The Gulf of Maine Council, established in 1989, works with organizations in the region to protect and sustainably develop the Gulf of Maine. They have implemented innovative strategies like the Gulf of Maine Action Plan 1991-2000 to enhance marine environmental quality and resource use. The United States policy aims to maintain and strengthen activities related to conserving natural resources in the Gulf of Maine and promoting sustainable development. Cooperation and coordination with the Gulf of Maine Council serve the environmental and economic interests of the American people. The President shall establish a Gulf of Maine Inter-Agency Task Force to improve interagency cooperation and coordination for the conservation and sustainable development of natural resources in the Gulf of Maine. The Task Force will meet regularly, share information about agency programs in the region, and provide updates on agency programs. The Gulf of Maine Inter-Agency Task Force aims to enhance cooperation and coordination for natural resource conservation. This includes providing updates on agency programs, identifying opportunities for collaboration, and developing plans for joint initiatives among various entities. The Gulf of Maine Inter-Agency Task Force membership includes representatives appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, Interior, EPA, and the Army, with the possibility of additional representatives from other federal departments or agencies. At least one member appointed by the Secretary of Commerce must be included. The Task Force appointed by the Secretary of Commerce for the Gulf of Maine Inter-Agency Task Force shall consist of personnel from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with one member from an office related to sustainable economic development. The Task Force will be chaired by the Gulf of Maine Coordinator designated by the Secretary of Commerce, serving a 2-year term. The Coordinator's duties include responding to invitations from the Gulf of Maine. The Gulf of Maine Coordinator, appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, attends meetings of the Gulf of Maine Council and reports on Federal activities. The Task Force may authorize the Coordinator to represent them in negotiations with the Gulf of Maine Council. The Secretary of Commerce submits an annual report to Congress on the Task Force's meetings and findings. The Environmental Protection Agency will report on the Task Force's meetings, findings, activities, recommendations, initiatives, and plans in the Gulf of Maine. The report may also highlight examples of cooperation and coordination among agencies in the region. Federal cooperation and coordination with the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment is addressed in Section 5. The officials appointing Task Force members must cooperate with the Gulf of Maine Council on natural resources. The Secretary of Commerce can make agreements with the Council to enhance conservation efforts. A sustainable development strategy may be developed in consultation with various stakeholders. The Task Force members appointed by officials must align their activities with the goals and policies of the Gulf of Maine Council and the protection of natural resources in the Gulf of Maine states. Financial contributions can be made to the Gulf of Maine Council to support its purposes. To fulfill the Act's purposes, officials appointing Task Force members may grant funds to the Gulf of Maine Council for conservation and economic development projects in the region. Grants cannot exceed 75% of total project costs, with non-Federal contributions including in-kind donations. Administration costs are limited to 10%. The grant funds for conservation and economic development projects in the Gulf of Maine region have limits on administrative expenses (10% of the grant amount) and total annual grants (not exceeding $1,000,000 before fiscal year 2000). SEC. 6. GULF OF MAINE RESEARCH. The Regional Marine Research Board for the Gulf of Maine region will work with the Gulf of Maine Council and the States bordering the Gulf of Maine to promote the environmental and economic health of the region. The Board may revise research plans in consultation with the Council and the approval of the Secretary of Commerce to ensure effective coordination with activities under this Act. SEC. 7.
