    "content": "The President signed P.L. 108-334 into law on October 18, 2004, providing $33.1 billion in new budget authority for DHS for FY2005, with $19.6 billion allocated for border and transportation security. H.R. 4567 was passed by the Senate on September 14, 2004, recommending a total appropriation of $33.8 billion for DHS, an increase of $1.3 billion over the Administration's request. H.R. 4567 was passed in the House with a total appropriation of $33.1 billion for DHS, an increase of $500 million over the Administration's request. S. 2537 was introduced in the Senate with a similar appropriation amount. President's FY2005 budget proposed $32.6 billion for DHS. The FY2005 budget request for DHS proposed $32.6 billion in appropriations, a 7.7% increase from FY2004. $19 billion (58%) is allocated for Border and Transportation Security agencies. Legislative status of DHS appropriations for FY2005 is summarized in Table 1. Increasing border and transportation security are crucial for homeland security. Border security involves regulating the flow of goods and people across borders to detect and prevent dangerous individuals or items from entering. Transportation security focuses on inspecting people and goods within the country to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks. A sophisticated border management system is needed to balance security with facilitating commerce and the movement of citizens and visitors. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security, aiming to improve border and transportation security while balancing security measures with facilitating commerce and movement of people. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred personnel from 22 agencies to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is organized into four major directorates. The Border and Transportation Security Directorate (BTS) and the U.S. Coast Guard are responsible for the first line of defense against terrorism and securing the nation's borders, including managing entry and enforcing immigration laws. DHS also oversees the TSA's role in protecting transportation systems. The TSA, part of the Border and Transportation Security Directorate (BTS) under DHS, is responsible for protecting transportation systems, including airline passengers, baggage, and freight. BTS also oversees Customs functions, border patrol, and inspection of plants and animals entering the US to prevent the introduction of pests and diseases. The activities of BTS are organized into three bureaus: Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and TSA. The Homeland Security Act merged various functions from legacy Customs, INS, and APHIS into CBP and ICE. FPS, FLETC, and ODP were included under BTS. Federal Air Marshals moved to ICE, US-VISIT to BTS, and ODP renamed OSLGCP. Coast Guard remains a standalone agency within DHS. Responsibilities shifted to DHS on March 1, 2003. The transfer of responsibilities to the new DHS from former departments and agencies faced challenges in determining the exact amount of funds transferred due to differences in purposes and funding lines. The documentation of appropriations in the President's FY2004 Budget was prepared after the formation of DHS but before final enactment of appropriations for FY2003. The completion of appropriations for FY2004 has established a baseline for future funding decisions, making comparisons to previous years easier. The distinction between border and transportation security functions and other funded activities is somewhat arbitrary. Our analysis focuses on \"border and transportation security\" activities, excluding those with no direct bearing on this function. This grouping includes the Coast Guard, which plays a crucial role in providing security in these areas. The Administration's request for DHS in FY2005 was organized similarly to the appropriations for FY2004. The report approximates costs for border and transportation security, excluding certain functions related to security improvement. The appropriations for FY2004 established a baseline for future funding decisions, with a focus on border and transportation security activities. The Administration's FY2005 request for DHS was structured similarly to FY2004, with $19 billion allocated for Border and Transportation Security functions. This amount represents 58% of the total $32.6 billion requested for DHS in FY2005. In FY2005, the Administration requested $19 billion for Border and Transportation Security functions, with the Coast Guard accounting for 38%, CBP for 26.9%, ICE for 17.3%, TSA for 14.4%, US VISIT for 1.8%, and FLETC for 1%. The appropriations by P.L. 108-344 allocated $19.6 billion, with the Coast Guard accounting for 37.6%, CBP for 26.8%, ICE for 16.1%, TSA for 16.6%, US VISIT for 1.7%, and FLETC for 1.1%. In FY2004, there was a discrepancy between the House and Senate reports regarding offsetting fee collections for CBP. The difference in fee collections changed the total amount available for obligation by CBP but did not change the total amount directly appropriated by Congress for CBP. Additionally, there was a $63 million rescission of FY2004 funds previously appropriated. The Administration's request to increase the aviation security fee was denied by both the House and Senate, resulting in a $400 million difference in TSA offsetting fee collections. Congress is faced with determining the appropriate funding level for border and transportation security amidst competing resource claims. The report details operational components and challenges in border and transportation security. Securing the nation's borders and transportation systems involves regulating imports and exports, enforcing immigration laws, inspecting agriculture and livestock at borders, overseeing port security, and inspecting airline passengers and baggage. Some question the exclusion of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services from discussions on security. Immigration services are essential for homeland security, but their costs should not be included in border and transportation security expenses. The curr_chunk discusses the appropriations for border and transportation security agencies, including details on FY2004-2005 funding. It mentions the transfer of the Office of Air and Marine Operations from ICE to CBP and explains a decrease in ICE funding for FY2005 due to changes in accounting for fee receipts. The FY2005 appropriations for border and transportation security agencies include changes in accounting for fee receipts, resulting in an increase of nearly 11% for ICE from the FY2004 level. The decrease in Maritime and Land Security funding reflects a reorganization of grants, moving responsibilities from TSA to the Office of Domestic Preparedness. Border security responsibilities at ports-of-entry are under CBP, including inspecting people and goods for authorized entry. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency is responsible for inspecting people and goods for authorized entry into the U.S. They also process individuals seeking entry and consolidate various border-related functions. The FY2005 budget requested $5,122 million in direct appropriations for CBP, with additional funding from user fees. The appropriations varied between different legislative proposals, with a final net appropriation provided in P.L. 108-334. H.R. 4567 would have provided $5,158 million, but P.L. 108-334 ultimately allocated $5,270 million for CBP, including a rescission of $63 million in funding. This amount also includes $390 million for the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction, transferred from ICE to CBP by DHS. Rounding may affect totals, and FY2004 amounts reflect a 0.59% across-the-board rescission. The technology adopted in S.Amdt. 3618 during Senate floor debate on H.R. 4567 includes funding for the Container Security Initiative, Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program, and radiation detection technology. These initiatives are fully funded by P.L.108-334. The funding allocated for non-intrusive inspection technology includes radiation portal monitors, radiation isotope identifier devices, and personal radiation detectors. Additional funding is provided for enhancing targeting systems, expanding the Integrated Surveillance and Information System, and purchasing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Additional funding was also provided for radiation detection equipment. The House recommended additional funding for radiation detection equipment, Immigration Security Initiative, and monitoring 'in-bond' cargo containers. The conference transferred training funds to reflect the Charleston Training Center transfer to FLETC. Both House and Senate fully funded C-TPAT and FAST programs, with a $4 million difference between their amounts. The House and Senate reports indicated full funding for the Administration's request for the National Targeting Center and Automated Targeting System modules. There was a discrepancy in the requested amounts for the UAV program, with the House indicating $16 million and the Senate indicating $19 million. The Senate allocated funding for the UAV program within the \"Air and Marine Interdiction, Operation, Maintenance, and Procurement\" account within ICE. The Senate adopted S.Amdt. 3611 during floor debate on H.R. 4567 which reduced total CBP Salaries and Expenses by $1 million. Both the House and Senate reports indicate congressional concerns regarding staffing of the primary border agency. The House report supports the 'one face at the border initiative' and directs CBP to submit a detailed staffing plan within 90 days after enactment. The conference report to H.R. 4567 requires CBP to submit a staffing plan within 90 days after enactment, detailing personnel, funding sources, and positions at each border location. The plan should be updated within 90 days, adopting language from previous reports. Additionally, there is a project to integrate CBP's IDENT system with the FBI's database. The USBP uses IDENT to identify and track illegal aliens, while the FBI's IAFIS holds over 40 million records for criminal identification. Integration of the two systems is crucial for border security but has faced challenges due to technical and organizational reasons. The House Committee expresses concern about the slow pace of integrating IDENT and IAFIS systems for border security, noting a security gap that allows individuals with criminal records to pass undetected. They direct DHS to fully fund the project and require a report by January 1, 2005 on the status of data sharing, real-time accessibility, and technical/policy issues. The Senate Committee report emphasizes the importance of State and local law enforcement officials accessing the IDENT system for information. They direct DHS to submit a plan by February 8, 2005 for integrating the US-VISIT program and the IAFIS database, including funding sources and a timetable for integration. The conference report echoes these concerns and requires DHS to fund the full cost of achieving real-time interoperability between the two systems. The Under Secretary of BTS is directed to report on the integration effort of IAFIS into IDENT within 90 days. CBP activities at ports of entry, including cargo and container security, are highlighted. Both the House and Senate support C-TPAT and CSI for securing the supply chain and inspecting marine containers at foreign sea ports. The House requests a report on the implementation plan for CSI. The report from CBP details the implementation plan for CSI and urges the development of an integrated network for all relevant data. The GAO report credits CBP for rolling out CSI and C-TPAT quickly but highlights the need for systematic human capital plans, performance measures, and a long-term strategic plan. Congress has allocated over $200 million for programs enhancing container security in the US. The DHS has taken steps to enhance container security, including resources expended in prior fiscal years and future needs. Ongoing container security projects like Operation Safe Commerce, CSI, and C-TPAT are being monitored. The primary responsibility for implementing cargo container security measures lies with a BTS entity, which will implement future cargo security standards, policies, procedures, or regulations. The report should also address the security of 'in-bond' shipments, which are shipments provisionally admitted into the US under CBP supervision without immediate duty payment. The DHS has implemented measures to enhance container security, including projects like Operation Safe Commerce, CSI, and C-TPAT. In-bond shipments are admitted into the US under CBP supervision without immediate duty payment. Duties are collected when the merchandise is withdrawn from the bonded warehouse. CBP uses the Automated Targeting System (ATS) for risk assessment to focus inspections on high-risk shipments. $1 million was allocated for sensor and tracking technology to track in-transit shipments. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) sorts shipments based on risk and assigns a risk score. Higher scores require more attention and increase the chance of inspection. Concerns have been raised about the lack of comprehensive risk assessments in CBP's targeting strategy. The House report directs CBP to address these issues by November 1, 2005. CBP uses non-intrusive inspection technology, including gamma-ray and x-ray systems, as well as radiation detection devices. Congress allocated $145 million for inspection and detection technology investments, with $50 million specifically for radiation detection technology. Additional funding may be used for either radiation detection technology or NII. The report recommended an additional $50 million for detection and inspection equipment, including 1,000 RPMs. The Senate and House provided additional funding for radiation detection technology and the Immigration Security Initiative. The ISI program is intended to be a CSI for people, building off a legacy program. The Immigration Security Initiative (ISI) program, similar to the CSI program, will station CBP officers at major airports to intercept high-risk travelers. ISI officers will work in an advisory capacity with host country authorities and have no legal authority. DHS should collaborate with the Department of Defense for New Mexico National Guard support. Concerns remain about CBP's Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) development. The House report directs CBP to address the integration of CBP and ACE modernization with DHS information systems, border security technologies, CSI, and the ATS in quarterly reports to Congress. Funding for ACE is contingent upon submission of a comprehensive expenditure plan that complies with capital planning and investment control requirements. The House report supports the expansion of the Integrated Surveillance Information System (ISIS) for border patrol, noting gaps in integration of surveillance systems. The House report supports funding for ISIS and requests a five-year capital acquisition plan and integration report. The Senate requests a master plan for nationwide deployment by December 15, 2004, including cost estimates and staff requirements. Conferees direct CBP to submit the capital acquisition report and master plan with the FY2006 budget. The conferees direct the Under Secretary for BTS to report on the integration of ISIS sub-systems by February 8, 2005. The GAO is tasked with studying ISIS project management and spending plans for FY2006-FY2010. The Senate expresses concern about USBP vehicle acquisition policy and directs CBP to submit a detailed vehicle management plan by February 8, 2005. The House report highlights the need for Severe Off-Road Vehicles for the USBP fleet. The House report requests a detailed report on USBP vehicle acquisition and fleet management plan, including the 2004 fleet baseline and planned investments for FY2005-FY2009. It expresses concern over illegal immigration in the Tucson sector and supports the Arizona Border Control initiative but is disappointed in its progress. The House Committee supports the Arizona Border Control initiative but is disappointed in its progress. They believe ABC will reduce vulnerability at the Arizona border, stop violence from human traffickers, and limit costs and danger to residents. The committee also requires CBP to study locations for permanent checkpoints in the Tucson sector and mandates that tactical checkpoints be relocated every 14 days. Additionally, funds cannot be used for permanent checkpoint construction in the Tucson Sector. CBP must submit a detailed staffing plan, and additional staff will be funded for the Northern Border. ICE focuses on enforcement of immigration and customs laws, investigations into fraud, forced labor, smuggling, and vehicle theft. It oversees security activities of the Federal Protective Service, Air and Marine Operations, and Federal Air Marshals Service. The bureau combined functions of U.S. Customs Service and former INS, excluding Air and Marine Interdiction funding. ICE, a bureau focusing on enforcement of immigration and customs laws, conducts investigations to reduce illegal entry into the United States. It is responsible for locating and removing illegal aliens, identifying visa overstays, combating terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforcing export laws. The President's budget requested $3,499 million in direct appropriations for ICE in FY2005. The ICE budget request for FY2005 includes funding for various activities such as Investigations/Intelligence, Detention and Removal, and Air and Marine Operations. The President's budget proposed $3,307 million for ICE, with recommendations from H.Rept. 108-541 and the Senate for higher amounts. Amendments were adopted to increase ICE appropriations by $350 million. The Senate adopted amendments to increase ICE appropriations by $350 million, including funds for Air and Marine Operations, additional investigators, Detention and Removal, and Federal Air Marshals. P.L. 108-334 provides $3,167 million for ICE, excluding amounts for AMO transferred to CBP. (Source: P.L. 108-334, H.Rept. 108-541, S.Rept. 108-280) The FY2005 ICE budget request shows a 2.9% decrease from FY2004 due to accounting changes, but actually results in an 11% increase. Federal Air Marshals were transferred to ICE from TSA in 2003, and the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction was transferred from ICE to CBP. The Administration requested $78 million for Investigations program initiatives. The FY2005 ICE budget request includes funding for various programs such as SEVIS, US-VISIT, International Affairs, benefit fraud operations, and worksite enforcement. The Administration requested $108.2 million for Detention and Removal program initiatives, including expanding the Institutional Removal Program nationally. The FY2005 ICE budget includes funding for various programs such as SEVIS, US-VISIT, International Affairs, benefit fraud operations, and worksite enforcement. The budget also includes $50 million for the National Fugitive Operations Program, $11 million for alternatives to detention, $6 million for the Legal Program, $6.2 million for interdicting illegal alien migrants in the Caribbean region, and $5 million for additional detention bed space. The FY2005 ICE budget includes funding for various programs such as SEVIS, US-VISIT, International Affairs, benefit fraud operations, and worksite enforcement. Additionally, there is $40.5 million allocated for AMO program initiatives, including $28 million to increase P-3 flight hours and $12.5 million for long-range radar for drug interdiction efforts along the southern border. The Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (AMO) was transferred from ICE to CBP under P.L. 108-334. Issues regarding AMO's location within BTS, mission overlap, resource allocation, and radar coverage were discussed in House and Senate reports. AMO's current mission includes... The House and Senate express concern about the appropriate location for AMO within BTS. Options include leaving AMO in ICE, aligning its operations with CBP, or making it a standalone agency under the Under Secretary of BTS. Both committees aim to identify overlaps between AMO, Border Patrol, and Coast Guard operations. DHS and BTS are reviewing air and marine operations. The House and Senate committees are reviewing air and marine operations within DHS, including AMO's transfer from ICE to CBP. They are interested in rationalizing assets and organization, with a focus on modernization and staffing plans. The committees have directed DHS and BTS to submit reports by February 15, 2005 detailing specific actions taken to streamline air and marine efforts. The House and Senate committees are reviewing air and marine operations within DHS, including AMO's transfer from ICE to CBP. They are interested in rationalizing assets and organization, with a focus on modernization and staffing plans. The committees have directed DHS and BTS to submit reports by February 15, 2005 detailing specific actions taken to streamline air and marine efforts. The current focus includes plans for modernizing air and marine assets, cost/benefit analysis of retrofitting the existing P-3 fleet, and the multiple air and marine missions of CBP and their relation to the Coast Guard. One radar system utilized by AMO is the Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS), managed by the Department of Defense. The House Committee notes a discrepancy in the number and location of TARS sites, with only eight sites currently in operation. The committee directs the Under Secretary of BTS and DHS' U.S. Interdiction Coordinator to submit a joint report within 90 days detailing a threat analysis of the U.S. border, including analyses of intrusions and threatening air and marine activity in relation to TARS sites. The report should also outline costs and benefits of maintaining current sites, opening new sites, and upgrading all sites with modern surveillance equipment. The Senate passed version of H.R. 4567 added funding for air bases in Michigan, Montana, New York, North Dakota, and Washington, as well as a pilot project for interoperable testing. The committee directs the Under Secretary of BTS and DHS' U.S. Interdiction Coordinator to submit a joint report within 90 days detailing a threat analysis of the U.S. border, including analyses of intrusions and threatening air and marine activity in relation to TARS sites. The report should also outline costs and benefits of maintaining current sites, opening new sites, and upgrading all sites with modern surveillance equipment. The Senate passed version of H.R. 4567 added funding for air bases in Michigan, Montana, New York, North Dakota, and Washington, and authorized $5 million for a pilot project to test interoperable communications between the first Northern Border Air Wing and local law enforcement personnel. Detention Issues: Concerns have been raised about the lack of detention space for the 300,000 noncitizens in the United States who have been ordered deported. A study found that almost 94% of those detained with final orders of removal were deported, compared to only 11% of those not detained. The cost of detaining noncitizens in DHS detention raises questions about efficiency and alternatives to detention for certain cases. There are concerns about the disparate application of policies due to varying detention space availability. Issues remain due to the dismantling of the former INS into three bureaus within DHS. Concerns include funding for immigration enforcement activities previously supported by the Examination Fee Account now going to USCIS. Questions arise about whether appropriated funds will suffice. Additionally, concerns exist over the staffing of ICE's overseas attache offices due to increased responsibilities for visa security. SEVIS is the foreign student monitoring system used by DHS to collect information on foreign students. SEVIS is a system used by DHS to monitor foreign students, track their visa compliance, and identify violators. Schools have reported technical difficulties with SEVIS and concerns about DHS's ability to locate all visa violators. The TSA was created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. The TSA, established by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, aims to increase protection for travelers in the US. The FY2005 TSA request includes a $2,752 million budget, primarily for prior year funding and pay inflation. H.Rept. 108-541 recommended a $3,225 million appropriation for TSA, with increases totaling $73 million. The Administration budget request included a $400 million increase in aviation security fees, but House and Senate reports funded this with appropriated funds. The total appropriation for TSA for FY2005 was recommended to be $3,337 million, with an additional $75 million added for baggage screening activities. P.L. 108-334 provided a net appropriation of $3,260 million for TSA. The apparent decrease in Maritime and Land Security reflects a reorganization of grants (primarily port security grants) that were moved from TSA to the OSLGCP. Table 9 provides selected sub-account level detail to illustrate the funding amounts recommended for passenger screening, baggage screening, and airport security. In Table 9, there are differences in recommended appropriations for Aviation Security. P.L. 108-334 provides varying amounts for Passenger Screening, Baggage Screening, and Airport Security Direction and Enforcement compared to the requested amounts. The Senate recommended $38 million above the administration's request for airport information technology, support, and air cargo security activities. Both the House and Senate Committee reports fully fund the budget request for pilot airports that have privatized their baggage and passenger screeners. TSA is expected to adhere to reprogramming requirements if additional airports opt for private screeners. The House Committee expects TSA to cover passenger screening activities for federal screeners and private contracts under the opt-out provision. They caution TSA to stay within the funding provided and limit the number of screeners to 45,000 FTE employees by the end of 2005 to ensure disciplined spending. TSA's initial over-hiring and mismanagement of funds during federalization led to the need for more disciplined staffing levels. The Committee emphasizes the need to cap TSA's FTE screener workforce at 45,000 by the end of FY2005 to prevent over-hiring and ensure disciplined spending. They also highlight the importance of developing EDS to reduce the number of screeners needed, while allowing TSA to realign its workforce between airports for security and customer service. The TSA is replacing the CAPPS II system with a new program called \"Secure Flight\" to focus on identifying terrorists. This change comes after privacy concerns and operational issues led to the scrapping of CAPPS II. The 9/11 Commission Report recommends that TSA take over the existing CAPPS system from airlines until a new program is operational. The conferees agree to provide $35 million for the new \"Secure Flight\" program, with an additional $10 million for crew vetting. They express concern about the tight timeline for implementation and urge TSA to prioritize watchlist functionality. They also emphasize the need for cooperation with GAO in reviewing Secure Flight. TSA will cooperate with GAO in reviewing Secure Flight, which aims to check all watchlists as recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The Senate Committee recommends a $75 million increase for airport checkpoint equipment and electronic surveillance. Concerns remain about detecting explosives in passengers' baggage. The committee directs TSA to report on a pilot program for screening passengers and carry-on baggage for explosives by July 1, 2005. An additional $35 million is allocated for checkpoint security, along with $10 million for crew vetting. The House Committee recommended $10 million for vetting foreign air carrier crews, expressing concern over TSA's use of $20 million from CAPPSII funding without notifying Congress. They emphasize the need for clear distinction between CAPPSII and other vetting activities. Both House and Senate Committees recommended additional funding for Explosive Detection Systems and Explosive Trace Detection machines. The Senate suggested a $60 million increase for next-generation EDS machines. The House recommended $30 million for next-generation EDS machines, emphasizing competition among vendors for a variety of technologies. They also proposed a $10 million \"Manhattan Project II\" program to advance EDS technology significantly. The conferees allocated $54 million for next-generation EDS machines. The conferees allocated $54 million for next-generation EDS machines and $45 million for airport security installations, in addition to the statutory allocation of $250 million for the Aviation Security Capital Fund. The House Committee noted budgetary constraints in providing a 90% federal share to airports participating in the Letter of Intent program. The committee waives language in section 605 of the Vision 100 Act to fund the LOI commitment at a 75% federal share. Both the House and Senate recommend additional funding for air cargo security, with $10 million allocated for TSA to hire 100 air cargo inspectors. The Senate also recommends funding to expand explosives detection canine teams. The Senate Committee recommended additional funding of $115 million for air cargo security, including $40 million for 100 additional inspectors and enforcement activities, and $75 million for research and development of technologies. They also suggested continued funding for the \"known shipper\" database to verify shippers' status and coordinate with CBP's C-TPAT program. The House Committee praised TSA's work on developing ETD system protocols for inspecting air cargo. The House Committee commends TSA's efforts in developing ETD system protocols for inspecting air cargo on passenger and cargo aircraft. They direct TSA to issue the protocols promptly and enhance the known shipper program to prevent high-risk cargo from being loaded on passenger planes. Additionally, the committee instructs TSA to double the percentage of air cargo being screened and strengthen air cargo security measures by conducting regular checks and ensuring compliance with security directives. The conferees decreased funding for the Transportation Worker Identification Card program due to delays in prototyping and evaluating credentials. TSA is directed to report back on the prototyping results before moving forward. $15 million is provided for the program, with $5 million in direct appropriations and $10 million offset through fees. Both House and Senate Committees supported the program and recommended additional funding. The House Committee recommended $15 million above the President's request, with $15 million allocated for developing necessary hardware and software for ID card production sites. The TSA is directed to develop a centralized personalization system for ID cards using existing government facilities. The House committee expects $50 million to be offset by fees for ID card applications. The Senate Committee recommends $55 million for infrastructure investments and implementation for high-risk transportation workers. $12 million is allocated for rail security, including federal rail compliance inspectors and explosive detection teams. Additionally, $150 million is provided for rail security grants through the Urban Area Security Initiative. The conferees direct TSA to implement projects for new train control technology and allocate additional funding for rail security. The Senate Committee recommends $15 million for deploying compliance inspectors and canine explosives detection teams, while the House Committee recommends $11 million for rail security within TSA. The House Committee recommended $11 million for rail security within TSA and an additional $12 million for rail security through the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. They also directed TSA to work with other agencies to develop a comprehensive rail and transit security program, requiring a report by March 1, 2005. Additionally, $1 million was allocated for a prototype program to assess domestic freight cargo risks, with $10 million for testing and evaluating security technologies. The House Committee allocated funds for rail security within TSA and directed the agency to work on developing a comprehensive rail and transit security program. They also requested reports on pilot programs for remote baggage screening systems and the potential use of deployable flight incident recorders in passenger aircraft for improved security analysis. TSA was required to submit a report by January 31, 2005 on plans for uniform screening standards at airports. The House Committee directed TSA to develop uniform screening standards for airport workers, assess technologies for securing airport perimeters, and conduct vulnerability assessments. The Senate passed version of H.R. 4567 includes an amendment for an integrated transportation security plan to protect assets and prioritize cost-effective defense measures. The House Committee directed TSA to develop uniform screening standards for airport workers and assess technologies for securing airport perimeters. Senate H.R 4567 includes amendment 3642, requiring a comprehensive report on protecting commercial airliners from MANPADS. The Coast Guard, now under DHS, is responsible for maritime homeland security and other missions like fisheries enforcement and marine rescue operations. The Coast Guard was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in 2003. It operates as its own agency within DHS, reporting directly to the Secretary. The FY2005 budget request for the Coast Guard was $7,335 million, an 8.5% increase from the previous year. The House recommended $7,307 million, while the Senate recommended $7,469 million for FY2005. The Coast Guard's FY2005 budget was $7,469 million, including a rescission of $16 million for Rescue 21 due to contract delays. Table 10 provides detailed account information. The House passed H.R. 4567 to fund Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation under the Science and Technology Directorate of DHS. The requested amounts and funding levels for various Coast Guard initiatives were detailed in P.L. 108-334, H.Rept. 108-541, and S.Rept. 108-280, including $102 million for port and maritime security plans, $27 million for the Rescue 21 Project, and $10 million for the Integrated Deepwater Program. The Deepwater program, funded by P.L.108-334, H.Rept. 108-541, and S.Rept. 108-280, aims to replace or modernize aging Coast Guard ships and aircraft. Potential issues include meeting mission requirements established in the late 1990s and a 2004 RAND Corporation report stating the baseline program may not meet USCG needs. The Deepwater program, funded by P.L.108-334, H.Rept. 108-541, and S.Rept. 108-280, aims to replace or modernize aging Coast Guard ships and aircraft. The program may not provide adequate assets and capabilities to fulfill demands for traditional missions and emerging responsibilities. The Coast Guard is reassessing mission requirements to address post-9/11 demands, as existing deepwater-capable assets are wearing out faster than expected. The Senate Committee fully funds the program, while the House Committee expresses concerns about the program's direction and the need for significant changes. The House Committee requires the Coast Guard to make significant changes to the Deepwater program, including re-baselining and submitting findings in the FY2006 budget. Specific acquisition timetables for necessary assets and new assets for homeland security functions are needed. The House recommends less funding for Maritime Patrol Aircraft due to concerns about meeting required capabilities. Ongoing evaluations of these aircraft are ongoing. The committee cannot fully support the budget request for the revised Deepwater proposal until ongoing evaluations of aircraft are completed. Concerns are raised about the condition of Coast Guard legacy assets and the increased maintenance costs, leading to less funding for acquiring replacement assets. The Coast Guard is directed to submit a report on its operational requirements post 9/11 and the impact on its legacy asset inventory by March 1, 2005. The House Committee is concerned about the Coast Guard's ability to maintain its legacy assets due to prioritizing Deepwater procurement. They require a report on maintenance plans for legacy vessels and aircraft within 30 days of the Appropriations Act enactment. Quarterly reports on legacy maintenance plans are also mandated starting with the President's FY2006 budget submission. Congress is also looking into potential issues with the Automatic Identification System (AIS). The House Committee is concerned about the implementation of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) by the Coast Guard for maritime domain awareness. Questions include radio frequency availability and coverage of all ship categories posing a threat to homeland security. Both the House and Senate support the AIS program, but there are concerns about the limited funding and slow implementation progress. The House Committee is providing $24 million for the completion of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) by the Coast Guard in FY2005. There are concerns about the Coast Guard's ability to balance its homeland security and non-homeland security missions post-9/11, with reduced resources allocated to non-homeland security operations. The GAO has noted a decrease in operating hours for non-homeland security missions and raised concerns about resource allocation for different missions. The House and Senate reports support non-homeland security Coast Guard initiatives, with additional funding for hiring staff to meet watch standards. The Senate encourages cooperative programs in marine safety education and supports the Rescue Swimmer program. The Ballast Water Program aims to prevent the introduction of alien nuisance species into American waters from foreign ships' ballast tanks. Both the House and Senate fully support this program and provide funding for the Coast Guard to transition it to mandatory enforcement. The committees emphasize the importance of this program for all states with water resources, regardless of their proximity to commercial ports. Additionally, there is a need for improved aerial surveillance assets to enhance the Coast Guard's homeland security missions. The House Committee supports Coast Guard efforts to renegotiate icebreaking costs with the NSF for Antarctic missions. They urge the Coast Guard to evaluate future needs for polar icebreakers considering national defense, homeland security, scientific, economic, and environmental interests. The Senate directs the Coast Guard to conduct a study on the role of icebreakers in supporting US operations in the Antarctic and Arctic, including scenarios for continuing operations and addressing possible changes due to environmental factors. The study should be submitted to the Senate Committee by September 30, 2005. The House Committee directs the Coast Guard to submit a report on the staffing and resource implications of moving to a sector command structure. They also require a report on establishing a West Coast helicopter squadron by October 1, 2004. The Committee fully funds the budget request for implementing the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. The committee directs the Coast Guard to review all foreign vessel security plans and report their findings by October 15, 2004. They also instruct the Coast Guard to use Port State Control Programs to ensure compliance with these plans and report on progress by March 1, 2005. The Senate Committee is concerned about the decrease in Coast Guard hours dedicated to non-homeland security missions post 9/11. The Coast Guard is directed to submit a report on developing a system for accurate cost representations to meet performance goals. Amendment 3633 requires DHS to report on integrating the process for issuing letters of recommendation for liquefied gas marine terminals. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations on border and transportation security do not specify funding changes. The commission highlights the need for a national plan for transportation security that covers all modes of transportation, not just aviation. They emphasize the importance of systematically evaluating all aspects of transportation security and allocating resources efficiently. The commission recommends reallocating transportation security funding across all modes and investing in technologies like EDS, ETD, NII, and RDE for screening. They call for expanding screening programs and integrating the U.S. border security system into a larger network. The DHS should design a comprehensive screening system for transportation and vital facilities, including nuclear reactors. They should implement biometric entry/exit screening and expand passenger and baggage screening for explosives. The 9/11 Commission's recommendations lack concrete estimates of funding implications."
