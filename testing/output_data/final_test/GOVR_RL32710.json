    "content": "After the 9/11 attacks, Germany realized its traditional approaches to combating terrorism were inadequate for dealing with the new threat of transnational, radical Islamic terrorism. The terrorists behind the attacks had lived and plotted in Germany, taking advantage of liberal asylum policies and low surveillance levels. Germany's response was immediate and unprecedented, setting aside its post-World War II prohibition against deploying forces outside of Europe. Germany quickly offered military assistance to the United States after the 9/11 attacks, declaring \"unlimited solidarity.\" The German government invoked NATO's Article V and gained approval from the Parliament to deploy troops to Afghanistan. Since then, Germany has expanded its efforts in the fight against terrorism through policy, legislative, and organizational reforms, maintaining extensive bilateral cooperation with the United States despite differences in approach. Germany's counterterrorism strategy aligns with the United States, focusing on identifying terrorists, assisting at-risk countries, addressing root causes of terrorism, halting weapons proliferation, and seeking UN approval for military action. Germany now views radical Islamic terrorism as its primary security threat and a potential target of attack, despite not being directly targeted by it. Since 9/11, more German citizens have died in Islamic terrorist attacks than in the entire history of domestic violence by the Red Army Faction. Germany was a center for planning the 9/11 attacks, with terrorists finding it easy to operate due to liberal asylum laws and strong privacy protections. Germany prioritizes protecting civil rights and liberties, including for non-citizens, while combating terrorism. There are concerns that Germany's interpretation of civil rights could hinder capturing terror suspects. Military force is not seen as the solution to terrorism. Germany emphasizes the use of \"soft power\" instruments like diplomacy and development assistance to combat terrorism, prioritizing peaceful resolution of international disputes. Critics question the effectiveness of this approach against hard core Islamic terrorist groups and \"rogue\" states. Germany's approach to combating terrorism emphasizes \"soft power\" instruments like diplomacy and development assistance. Chancellor Schroeder opposed the U.S. policy of broadening the war against terrorism to Iraq, questioning its impact on the global alliance against terrorism. Germany's security strategy has evolved post-9/11, with a focus on defending its security interests globally. The \"Struck-Doctrine\" emphasizes the need to protect security beyond its borders, such as in Afghanistan. Counterterrorism is a significant foreign policy concern due to Germany's economic interests worldwide, with nearly half of its exports going to non-EU countries. Additionally, Germany imports 98% of its natural gas. Germany's extensive domestic measures against terrorism post-9/11 included identifying and closing loopholes in laws that allowed terrorists to operate unnoticed in the country. Two major anti-terrorism packages were adopted in November 2001, revoking immunity of religious groups and charities from investigation and surveillance by authorities. After 9/11, Germany implemented anti-terrorism measures including revoking immunity of religious groups and charities from surveillance, prosecuting terrorists in Germany even if part of foreign organizations, restricting terrorist entry, and enhancing border security. Additionally, $1.8 billion was allocated for new counterterrorism efforts, and intelligence and law enforcement agencies were given more authority to gather and share information. Germany's intelligence and security authorities, such as the BND, BfV, MAD, BKA, and BGS, work together to gather and share information with law enforcement. Measures like increased aviation security and mandatory luggage inspections at airports have been implemented. The country's large Muslim population also influences anti-terror efforts. Germany's strong record of tolerance and protection of Muslim religious freedoms is evident in its anti-terror policies. The government is determined to target Muslim extremists through profiling and efforts to eliminate terrorist cells. Around 31,000 German residents are believed to have ties to extremist Islamic organizations. Following the 9/11 attacks, the government took action against twenty religious groups and conducted over 200 raids. Three radical Islamic organizations have been banned in Germany. The German Justice Ministry is currently involved in 80 preliminary proceedings related to Islamic terrorism. The German Justice Ministry is conducting 80 preliminary proceedings related to Islamic terrorism involving 170 suspects. The government has prosecuted members of a terrorist group with connections to Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and Al Qaeda. The BKA is monitoring 250 to 300 suspects with links to international terror networks. German authorities have used computer-aided searches to dismantle terrorist groups. In the 1990s, Germany successfully dismantled the Red Army Faction and uncovered radical Islamic \"sleepers.\" New measures against money laundering were implemented, including wider access to financial data of terrorist groups and improved bank customer screening procedures. Measures to prevent money laundering now include checking electronic data processing systems. New laws in Germany aim to strengthen the country's capabilities in combating terrorist financing by ensuring proper screening of clients' business relationships and setting up internal security systems. The German Federal Banking Supervisory Office oversees monitoring of all financial flows for illegal activity, with a Financial Intelligence Unit serving as the central registration office for money laundering. Germany was the first country to implement EU guidelines and recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. Germany's anti-money laundering regulations are praised by the FATF for being comprehensive and effective. New measures in Germany include a proposed aviation security law allowing the military to shoot down threatening hijacked aircraft, and an immigration law making deportation of suspected foreigners easier. Organizational changes implemented by federal and state Ministers of the Interior include the creation of a central database for information on Muslim radicals suspected of terrorism, a joint Coordination Center to prevent terrorist attacks, and integration of German federal states into the coordination center. Germany's approach to terrorism is influenced by its central location in Europe. Germany's approach to terrorism is influenced by its geographic position in Europe and EU membership. EU legislation governs many anti-terrorism measures in Germany, but critics point to bureaucratic hurdles and constraints in law enforcement and intelligence efforts. Germany has stricter constraints and closer oversight than many other countries, operating with transparency and prioritizing privacy rights and personal data protection. These protections extend to non-citizens as well. Police can only investigate with probable cause of a crime, and intelligence agencies cannot make arrests or use covertly collected information in court. While entry of terrorists into Germany has been limited, existing residents can exploit loopholes in the law for potential terrorist activities. The new immigration law in Germany, effective from January 2005, aims to close loopholes that have allowed potential terrorists to obtain extended residency permits. Second-generation immigrants with citizenship serve as a potential recruitment pool. However, there is a lack of central oversight in Germany's organizational framework for fighting terrorism, with differing opinions on whether greater centralization would be beneficial. The organizational structure of German security and intelligence authorities is decentralized, with federal and state bureaus working independently. This lack of automatic cooperation increases the risk of information loss, but recent initiatives such as the Information Board and Coordination Center aim to improve collaboration among authorities. The German government faces challenges in improving cooperation between federal and state authorities to enhance domestic response to terrorism. Resistance from federal states hinders centralization efforts, despite concerns about terrorist activities in states with key international hubs and large Muslim populations. The upcoming 2006 Soccer World Cup is seen as a potential catalyst for reevaluating security measures and gaining support for counterterrorism efforts. The German government invoked NATO's Article V after 9/11, deploying troops to Afghanistan and contributing to counterterrorism efforts. However, they did not support US actions in Iraq. Germany currently has 7,800 troops abroad, with 40% engaged in counterterror missions. Germany is directly involved in five major counterterror missions as part of the global coalition, with estimated costs of $3.5 billion for 2002 and 2003. German crews participated in Operation Noble Eagle after 9/11, contributing one third of the squadrons' personnel. In Afghanistan, 2,300 German soldiers participate in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Some 2,300 German soldiers participate in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) missions in Kunduz and Feizabad. German special forces units are on standby in Germany after participating in special operations in Afghanistan. Additionally, 720 German naval personnel are involved in naval missions associated with Operation Enduring Freedom and Active Endeavor to gather intelligence, cut off terrorist supply channels, and safeguard international shipping routes. Germany's military efforts have faced challenges due to delays in implementing reforms and addressing airlift capacity issues. Despite participating in various missions, such as in Afghanistan and Kuwait, budget constraints may hinder the country's efforts to make its armed forces more expeditionary. Germany has been actively engaged in post-war reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan through hosting international conferences and supporting counterterror resolutions at the United Nations. They have ratified multiple UN anti-terror Conventions and are working to improve the Schengen-system at the European level. Germany is advocating for the use of biometric identifiers on passports, visas, and resident permits within the EU and internationally. They see themselves as a leader in European counterterrorism efforts and have coordinated with the US and other G8 countries on anti-terrorism measures. Germany has also proposed joint standards for air marshals deployment within the G8. Germany's foreign policy includes foreign assistance and economic development, with a focus on Civil Crisis Prevention, Conflict Resolution, and Peace Consolidation. Despite financial constraints, Germany remains a significant contributor, particularly in Afghanistan, with $384 million allocated for reconstruction by the end of 2004 and a promise of $1.2 billion through 2008. Critics argue that the plan is underfunded. Germany has promised $1.2 billion for reconstruction in Afghanistan through 2008. They have also contributed $196 million towards postwar efforts in Iraq and waived $2.4 billion of Iraq's debt. Total German foreign aid and reconstruction funding worldwide for 2002 and 2003 was about $13.9 billion. Security cooperation between the United States and Germany has increased significantly, with liaison officers from both countries working closely together. In Germany, U.S. liaison officers are involved in investigating 9/11 terrorist cells. Bilateral cooperation agreements have been made to protect computer systems, critical infrastructure, and nuclear facilities. Legal cooperation in criminal matters has also been increased. Germany is active in the U.S. Container Security Initiative to prevent terrorists from smuggling weapons of mass destruction. Germany and the United States cooperate on container security to prevent terrorists from smuggling weapons of mass destruction. U.S. Customs agents monitor suspicious containers in German harbors, and Germany is part of the Proliferation Security Initiative aimed at stopping the spread of materials for weapons of mass destruction. In October 2003, U.S. and German intelligence cooperation led to the seizure of a ship bound for Libya with illicit nuclear material. However, there are concerns about weaker information sharing due to security and privacy issues between the two countries. Germany and the United States cooperate on container security to prevent terrorists from smuggling weapons of mass destruction. There are concerns about weaker information sharing due to security and privacy issues between the two countries, with German critics claiming that the U.S. expectation of information sharing is not reciprocated. A recent example involved trials of suspects in the 9/11 attacks, where crucial evidence was not initially shared by the United States, leading to acquittals in a German Federal Court. U.S.-German cooperation in information sharing is mostly on a case-by-case basis without formal agreements. Cooperation between Germany and the United States in targeting terrorist infrastructure and sharing information is mostly on a case-by-case basis without formal agreements. A shared database for tracking terrorist suspects and harmonizing surveillance activities is seen as necessary, but differing perspectives on the death penalty have hindered bilateral cooperation in some cases. Germany, as an EU member country, has abolished the death penalty and does not allow extradition if there is a risk of execution. Extradition has only occurred after assurances that the death penalty would not be imposed. In a case involving the U.S. Embassy bombings, Germany extradited a suspect after the U.S. waived the death penalty. Germany prohibits providing evidence that could lead to a death sentence, as seen in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui. The United States and Germany differ on the death penalty issue, with Germany opposing it and not allowing extradition if there is a risk of execution. Germany also criticizes U.S. plans to use military tribunals for terrorist suspects, advocating for multilateral cooperation in the fight against global terrorism. In the German view, cooperation in fighting global terrorism should be multilateral and sanctioned by international organizations. They hope the US will prioritize multilateralism to gain international support for counterterrorism efforts. The US rejects absolute commitment to multilateralism, fearing it could lead to paralysis. Germany's approach is criticized for prioritizing process over results, especially with \"rogue\" states and weapons of mass destruction. Germany's approach to non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction focuses on positive engagement and soft power instruments like diplomacy and economic levers. Critics argue that Germany lacks the military means or political will to confront WMD states. In contrast, the US has extensive military capabilities for dealing with terrorism, while Germany excels in conflict prevention and reconstruction, suggesting a complementary relationship between the two countries. Germany's focus on non-proliferation involves diplomacy and economic tools, while the US has strong military capabilities for counterterrorism. The US and Germany could complement each other in global efforts against terrorism, as highlighted by the U.S. 9/11 Commission's emphasis on utilizing all national powers, including soft power. Cooperation between the two countries in domestic security and bilateral efforts is crucial for their security in the near and mid-term. Germany's focus on non-proliferation involves diplomacy and economic tools, while the US has strong military capabilities for counterterrorism. The US and Germany could complement each other in global efforts against terrorism. Lapses in German domestic surveillance could directly threaten U.S. security. Understanding and accepting differences in security threats and responses may enhance future U.S.-German cooperation in the global war on terrorism. Germany's cooperation with the United States in the global war on terrorism is crucial due to its significance as a European and world actor. The Federal Security Council, led by the Chancellor, shares data on Networks of Arab Mujaheden. Anti-terror laws passed in late 2001 removed legal protection for religious associations, allowing state authorities to conduct surveillance. In late 2001, Germany passed laws removing legal protection for religious associations, allowing state authorities to investigate groups with suspected terrorist ties. Associations promoting violent or terrorist activities will be prohibited, and terrorist activities can be prosecuted even if they occur outside Germany. People posing a threat to Germany's democratic order and involved in terrorist organizations will be denied entry or residence permits. Asylum applications must include a voice recording of the applicant's country of origin and fingerprints will be collected. Fingerprints will be collected with applications and stored for 10 years. The Central Alien Register now has automated information accessible to security authorities, including visa applications, decisions, and residents in Germany. Security screening is required for personnel in counterterrorism and defense roles. Air Traffic Law restricts firearms for air marshals and mandates security clearances for airport personnel. Changes in Passport and Personal I.D. Law will improve identification systems to prevent fake IDs. The new laws aim to enhance identification systems by adding encrypted biometric codes to documents, giving authorities more power to track extremist groups, allowing the Federal Bureau for Criminal Investigation to lead its own investigations, and deploying armed officers of the Federal Border Guard on German airplanes for thorough border screenings."
