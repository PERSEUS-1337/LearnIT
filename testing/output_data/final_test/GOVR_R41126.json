    "content": "The Senate passed health reform legislation on December 24, 2009, known as H.R. 3590. The House Rules Committee issued an amendment to H.R. 4872 on March 18, 2010, which would amend H.R. 3590. This report focuses on the modifications in the reconciliation bill and affected provisions in H.R. 3590. It is a companion report to CRS Report R40942, Private Health Insurance Provisions in Senate-Passed H.R. 3590. The reconciliation bill would reduce federal deficits by $138 billion over 10 years and insure 95% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population by 2019. It includes changes to increase subsidies in insurance exchanges and reduce the impact of an excise tax on certain health insurance plans. The reconciliation proposal in the Senate-passed H.R. 3590 would implement reforms to the individual and group markets, including prohibiting lifetime limits and restricting annual limits on essential health benefits by group health plans and health insurance issuers. The reconciliation proposal in the Senate-passed H.R. 3590 would establish caps on the dollar value of benefits for participants and beneficiaries, with exceptions for non-essential health benefits. The Secretary would define restrictions on annual limits to ensure access to needed services with minimal impact on premiums. Rescissions for group health plans and insurance issuers would generally be prohibited, except in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation. The reconciliation bill would extend dependent coverage to unmarried adult children up to age 26 in group and individual health plans. Lifetime limits, rescissions, and coverage for dependent children would also apply to grandfathered plans six months after enactment. The requirement that adult dependents not be married would be removed. The reconciliation bill extends dependent coverage to unmarried adult children up to age 26 in group and individual health plans. Amendments apply specifically for grandfathered group health plans. The restriction on annual limits starts six months after enactment. For coverage of dependent children before 2014, the requirement is limited to adult children without employer coverage. Under H.R. 3590, individuals must maintain minimum essential coverage for themselves and dependents, with penalties for non-compliance based on household income or a flat dollar amount. The reconciliation bill introduces penalties for non-compliance with the individual mandate, based on household income or a flat dollar amount. Certain exemptions apply, such as for individuals below the federal poverty level. Changes are made to penalty calculations and exemptions in the bill. The reconciliation bill introduces penalties for non-compliance with the individual mandate based on household income or a flat dollar amount. The base income amount and percentages for penalties would vary by year, with percentages starting at 1% in 2014 and increasing annually. Penalty amounts for 2015 and 2016 are set at $325 and $695 respectively, with adjustments for inflation thereafter. Exemptions from the penalty include individuals with household income below the personal exemption amount for the applicable tax year. Under H.R. 3590, employers with more than 50 full-time employees could face penalties for not providing coverage or not meeting certain requirements. Penalties include a flat amount of $750 per full-time employee for each applicable month in 2014, with indexing in subsequent years. Employers offering coverage but having employees decline it and receive a premium credit could also face penalties. Employers with more than 50 full-time employees could face penalties for not providing coverage or meeting requirements under H.R. 3590. Penalties include a flat amount of $750 per full-time employee per month in 2014, with indexing in subsequent years. Employers offering coverage but having employees decline it and receive a premium credit could also face penalties. The reconciliation bill would make changes to how employer penalties are calculated, creating more similarity in penalties among employers offering coverage and those that do not. The reconciliation bill would reduce the number of full-time employees by 30 for penalty calculations related to employer coverage under H.R. 3590. It would also eliminate the special rule for the construction industry, treating them the same as other employers. The reconciliation bill in 2014 imposes monthly penalties on applicable employers based on the number of full-time employees who received premium credits. The penalty amount varies depending on whether the employer offers coverage or not. Additionally, the bill limits the total penalty imposed on employers and indexes dollar amounts after 2014. The reconciliation bill in 2014 includes new federal health insurance standards for group health plans and markets, effective January 1, 2014. It eliminates fees for employers with extended waiting periods and prohibits exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions. The bill also calculates full-time equivalents in determining employer penalties based on full-time employees receiving premium credits. The reconciliation bill in 2014 establishes new federal health insurance standards for group health plans and markets, effective January 1, 2014. It prohibits exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions and limits waiting periods to 90 days. The bill removes the grandfather exemption for excessive waiting periods and extends the prohibition on preexisting conditions to grandfathered group health plans. Individuals enrolled in private health insurance through an exchange would be affected starting in 2014. Individuals enrolled in private health insurance through an exchange starting in 2014 would be eligible for premium credits based on income. The credits would be in the form of advanceable, refundable tax credits. Qualifying individuals at or below 133% federal poverty level (FPL) would pay no more than 2% of income towards premiums. Premium credits would be available to individuals up to 400% FPL, with adjustments in generosity for different income ranges compared to H.R. 3590. The reconciliation bill would adjust premium credits based on income growth exceeding premium growth. If subsidies exceed 0.504% of GDP, the required percentage of income paid toward premiums would increase. Exchanges must provide enrollees' coverage details to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the Senate and reconciliation bills, individuals covered by health insurance may receive cost-sharing subsidies for silver plans sold through an exchange. These subsidies help cover deductibles and copayments, ensuring access to healthcare even for those who have insurance but struggle with out-of-pocket costs. The reconciliation bill increases cost-sharing subsidies for those up to 250% FPL, using Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for determining eligibility for premium and cost-sharing credits, Medicaid, and CHIP. MAGI includes gross income with certain deductions and exclusions. The reconciliation bill establishes a Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund with $1 billion for federal administrative expenses within the Department of Health and Human Services. MAGI, based on Adjusted Gross Income, determines eligibility for subsidies and Medicaid."
