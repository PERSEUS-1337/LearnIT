    "content": "The report summarizes the value proposition, obstacles, and risks faced by Fusion Centers, which are seen as an extension of pre-9/11 state and local law enforcement intelligence activities. Fusion centers aim to broaden data sources for analysis beyond criminal activities. Fusion centers expand data sources for analysis beyond criminal intelligence to include federal, public, and private sector data. They also broaden state and local analysis to encompass homeland security and counterterrorism issues, reflecting a shift towards a more proactive approach to law enforcement in the United States. The National Strategy on Homeland Security emphasizes the importance of protecting the American people from terrorist threats. Fusion centers, when networked nationally, are seen as a proactive tool in combating global jihadist adversaries. These centers serve as a central node for sharing terrorism and law enforcement information with various levels of law enforcement and security officials. The argument for fusion centers in homeland security is based on four key presumptions: the importance of intelligence in preventing terrorist attacks, the need to fuse a wide range of data sources, the unique role of state and local agencies in collecting information, and the potential benefits of fusion activities at the sub-federal level. However, questions remain about the effectiveness of fusion centers due to their fragmented development and vague federal guidelines. The development and utility of fusion centers are complex due to the lack of a standardized model. Key questions include whether fusion centers improve information sharing and safety, their integration with intelligence and security philosophy, who benefits from them, staffing and funding considerations, their role in the Intelligence Community, federal agency involvement, impact on security vs civil liberties, and the extent of intelligence collection activities. The effectiveness and sustainability of fusion centers are questioned, including the need for common standards, national strategy, expected results, performance assessment, organizational structure efficiency, funding sustainability, and risk assessment. The risks associated with fusion center development include creating centers without necessary organizational changes, potential loss of political and popular support leading to their demise, and the argument that their establishment may have been premature without a common understanding of the discipline. The development of fusion centers aims to enhance coordination and cooperation to address homeland security threats. However, challenges arise from differing conceptions of intelligence among agencies, hindering progress. Without a common framework, the impact of fusion center efforts may remain limited. The 2006 Fusion Center Guidelines provide a common framework, but further transformation is needed for real progress. The 2006 Fusion Center Guidelines, while well-received, have limitations such as being voluntary and lacking practical application. Fusion centers aim to integrate and analyze information for actionable policy outcomes, including counterterrorism and crime prevention. A more targeted intelligence process could help prevent crime by filling in intelligence gaps. The potential use of private sector data by fusion centers has raised concerns about civil liberties abuses. Critics argue that gathering intelligence without a criminal predicate could lead to violations of civil liberties. There is also a risk that individuals without proper training may be involved in fusion center activities. The ACLU is concerned about fusion centers potentially jeopardizing First Amendment protected activities and granting extraordinary powers to the Department of Homeland Security without adequate transparency or safeguards. Fusion center representatives are aware of the need to respect privacy and civil liberties. Several fusion centers are implementing governance boards to oversee civil liberty concerns, with some appointing former judges for this purpose. While many centers have privacy policies, few have robust outreach programs to educate the public on their intelligence activities. Most fusion centers operate under federal regulations for criminal intelligence activities, guided by the Attorney General's Guidelines for FBI National Security Investigations. State and local levels follow 28 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Chapter 1, Part 23 for multi-jurisdictional criminal intelligence systems. Many fusion centers follow 28 CFR, Part 23 for their criminal intelligence operations, which requires reasonable suspicion to collect and maintain information on individuals involved in criminal conduct. The establishment and maintenance of state fusion centers are driven by the need to provide law enforcement with information to suspect individuals or organizations involved in criminal activities. The balance between civil liberties and security is a constantly evolving issue, influenced by the country's sense of safety. Some believe that post-9/11, there was a rush to create fusion centers, which may eventually be replaced by regional fusion organizations in the next 5 to 10 years. State and regional fusion centers may consolidate into regional organizations due to various issues such as lack of perceived need, financial constraints, duplication of effort, and reduced risks. If fusion centers prove their value as proactive intelligence hubs, they could attract more federal, state, and local funding. However, there is a funding risk if the US remains free from successful terrorist attacks. If the United States avoids terrorist attacks, homeland security funding may decrease, leading to potential cuts in the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) funding. This could force states to prioritize critical programs. Fusion centers' funding, supported by federal programs like DHS and FBI detailee programs, may also suffer. The fate of fusion centers would vary by state based on factors like maturity, agency partnerships, resource needs, and successes. There are over 40 intelligence/information fusion centers in the US, mostly state-owned or operated. Some urban areas also have fusion centers. States may have multiple fusion centers, with varying levels of cooperation and potential duplication of missions. The majority of fusion centers in the US do not have distinct legal authority, operating under existing organizations. Initially focused on counterterrorism after 9/11, less than 15% now have a sole focus on this mission. Many have expanded to include all-crimes and all-hazards. Fusion centers in the US have shifted their focus to include all-crimes and all-hazards, with approximately 40% describing their mission as such. Some centers prioritize large-scale crimes like terrorism and organized crime, while others focus on any type of crime. This shift is driven by a desire to conform to national trends, gain local support, and secure sustainable resources. Approximately 40% of fusion centers in the US describe themselves as \"all-hazards\" in addition to all-crimes. This term can have different interpretations, including receiving information from various agencies, having representatives from different sectors, and being responsible for preventing and mitigating both man-made and natural disasters. The majority of fusion centers interviewed for this report claim to have an all-hazards approach. The majority of fusion centers in the US primarily serve an analytic role, providing support for operations and investigations. Some centers are more operational, owned by state police agencies and staffed by law enforcement personnel. They engage in activities like responding to incidents, assisting with investigations, and tasking collectors. Fusion centers focus on prevention, enhancing information sharing, conducting threat assessments, and mitigating various threats. Fusion centers in the US enhance information sharing, conduct threat assessments, and support preparedness efforts. They play a situational awareness role during events and some have a more active role by sending analysts to command posts. These centers are primarily law enforcement oriented and staffed by state law enforcement personnel, with staffing levels ranging from 3 to nearly 250 full-time personnel. Federal representation at fusion centers varies significantly, with some centers having collocated federal agencies influencing their development and operations. The level of federal participation correlates with the center's positive view of the relationship. Participating federal agencies include FBI, DHS, National Guard, Coast Guard, ATF, ICE, and TSA. Annual budgets for fusion centers studied range from tens of thousands to several million dollars, with federal funding accounting for approximately 31% on average. States continue to pay for about 80% of fusion center budgets, despite federal financial support through homeland security grants. On average, fusion centers have 14 staff with Secret clearances, and some also have Top Secret and Top Secret-Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearances. Clearances for state and local personnel vary, with federal detailees sometimes holding the highest level clearances. Fusion centers typically have staff with TS/SCI clearances but lack infrastructure for classified information storage. Most fusion centers struggle to adopt a proactive prevention approach and fully integrate the intelligence cycle. Federalism is a central theme in the challenges faced by fusion centers. The challenges faced by fusion centers revolve around federalism, balancing national needs with state autonomy. It is crucial to maintain the state and local identity of these centers while ensuring federal support for public safety and homeland security purposes. The tension between state and federal authorities is evident in the diverse threat and warning products required by each. Federal support for fusion centers must balance guidance with autonomy for state-established entities. Terrorism, a federal crime, is also prosecuted at the state level post-9/11. Since the September 11th attacks, terrorism has been recognized as a crime in many states, leading to the codification of federalism in fusion centers. The role of the federal government in supporting these centers and the products they produce with federal funding levels are central questions. Fusion centers began to gain support and attention from federal entities after the 2001 terrorist attacks, with concrete federal financial support not materializing until later. Federal financial support for fusion centers began in Fiscal Year 2004 with $29 million from the Homeland Security Grant Program. Guidance from DHS followed in July 2005, and human capital support from DHS and FBI detailees started in 2006. While DHS provided direct financial support, the FBI contributed through security clearances, personnel support, and in-kind contributions. The federal government played various roles in assisting states and regions in developing fusion centers post-9/11. Federal support for fusion centers post-9/11 included guidance for fusion center operations, technical assistance and training, financial resources for start-up costs, human resources for interaction with federal agencies, and assistance for information sharing between federal and state/local entities. Congressional hearings and federal regulations also played a role in supporting fusion centers. Given that fusion centers are established by states, localities, and regions to serve their own needs, there may not always be a federal remedy for every issue. Congress may choose to take no action, but if they do, there are challenges with unique federal remedies and those that may require state or local intervention. Congressional actions could include oversight of federal agencies interacting with fusion centers and requesting Executive Branch action. The challenges and options for Congress regarding fusion centers include interacting with fusion centers, requesting Executive Branch action, establishing a statutory basis, convening hearings with state and local fusion center leaders, adjusting funding levels, and considering federal funding conditioned on meeting performance benchmarks. One option for Congress is to recommend that the Executive Branch draft a cross-agency national strategy with input from various agencies and fusion center representatives to address the absence of a formal national strategy for fusion centers. Ownership, benefits, funding, permanence, statutory basis, performance measures, and federal interaction are key issues to consider for fusion centers. It is important to determine the division of labor and costs between federal, state, local, and tribal roles to ensure productive outcomes and efficient interaction with homeland security agencies. The relationship between fusion centers and the Federal Intelligence Community is a key issue. Fusion center leaders prioritize sustainment funding and question the continuation of federal funding for fusion efforts. Congress must decide on the conditional nature of federal aid to fusion centers. The Fusion Center Guidelines are voluntary for recipients of federal HSGP funds, leading to a lack of formal auditing for civil liberties protection. Congress has legislative tools available to address this issue, such as continuing funding through HSGP grants. The flow of federal funds to state/regional fusion centers is determined by sub-federal designees making homeland security grant decisions. Fusion centers compete for funding with other initiatives, and there is no direct funding stream allocated to them. Potential alterations to the grant program could address hurdles in funding flow, such as increasing grant cycle duration for better planning and autonomy in grant allocation. The HSGP funding split could allow states to allocate funds to a designated fusion center, with audits ensuring accountability. A national network of fusion centers may be beneficial for long-term homeland security interests. The development of national interests served by fusion centers requires metrics, standards for capability and maturity, and thresholds for federal funding. Collaboration between federal, state, and local representatives is essential, possibly under the \"Global\" program. Congress could condition this approach or determine fusion center functions that warrant sustainable federal support. The federal government may provide sustainable support for core fusion center functions like intelligence systems and analysis. A pilot program could be implemented to assess the benefits of direct federal support. Lack of a federal fusion center strategy and differing mission expectations may hinder coordination between state and federal homeland security organizations. If state fusion centers focus on local criminal activities instead of terrorism, Congress may consider ending federal funding. Enhancing training and coordination between federal agencies and fusion centers could improve information sharing. The diversity of professionals in fusion centers may lead to differing perspectives. The importance of a common understanding and lexicon for intelligence among fusion center personnel is highlighted. Additional civil liberties training is suggested for fusion centers to ensure awareness of privacy concerns. Congress may consider requiring funding for state fusion centers to include nationally consistent civil liberties training, especially regarding private sector data use. This training could be made a prerequisite for receiving federal grants, with oversight provided by a designated federal entity. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell's 100 Day Plan emphasizes the need to accelerate information sharing. The 100 Day Plan for Integration and Collaboration emphasizes enhancing information sharing within the intelligence community and formalizing fusion centers. Congress could take action by strengthening fusion center participation through personnel exchanges and drafting a National Intelligence Estimate on the nexus between criminal activity and terrorism. Enhancing fusion centers' mechanisms for information sharing with the Intelligence Community and input into the National Intelligence Priorities Framework. Fusion centers vary in resources and functions, with potential paths for development. Congress has legislative tools to support fusion center development, including designating one center per state. The development of fusion centers can be supported by designating one center per state, establishing regional fusion centers, expanding FBI Field Intelligence Groups, and creating a National Fusion Center Representative Organization. Congress has various legislative options to assist fusion centers, such as revising federal regulations for criminal intelligence systems, requiring interoperability, standardizing reporting formats, consolidating information sharing systems, increasing cleared personnel at fusion centers, and urging compliance with Intelligence Reform. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need to increase the number of cleared SLT personnel at fusion centers and urges compliance with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act and 9/11 Commission recommendations on over-classification."
