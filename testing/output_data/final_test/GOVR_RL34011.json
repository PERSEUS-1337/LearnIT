The annual bill includes funding for various agencies like the Smithsonian Institution, National Endowment for the Arts, and Department of Energy programs. Jurisdiction over DOE and EPA was consolidated in the 109th Congress. The House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees now cover Interior and Related Agencies after the abolition of the subcommittees on Veterans Affairs, Housing, and Urban Development. Appropriations laws since FY2006 have three main titles for funding Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies. The report is organized into sections for Interior agencies, EPA, other agencies, programs, and cross-cutting topics. The curr_chunk discusses key funding changes proposed for FY2008 in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. It highlights the challenges of summarizing budget submissions and funding bills due to the extensive details involved. The report contains final FY2007 enacted levels for agencies and programs. The FY2007 figures used in this report differ from the FY2008 agency budget submissions due to agencies being funded under a short-term continuing resolution. Final FY2007 funding levels were determined by agencies under P.L. 110-5, which provided funds through September 30, 2007. The law required agencies to submit fund allocations below the account level to House and Senate Appropriations Committees within 30 days of enactment. Appropriations represent total funds available, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations, but exclude permanent mandatory budget authorities. Funding figures primarily come from the House Committee on Appropriations, with other sources including the Senate Committee on Appropriations, agency budget justifications, and the Congressional Record. Table 1 displays budget authority for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies from FY2004-FY2008. The President's FY2008 request of $25.69 billion would have been the lowest since FY2004, with a potential 6% decrease in funds. The House-approved funding was slightly higher than FY2004, while the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $27.19 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $27.19 billion for FY2008, a slight decrease from FY2004. The total funding of $27.39 billion included $500.0 million in emergency fire funding. The FY2008 funding for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) signed into law on December 26, 2007. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161), which included funding for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, was signed into law on December 26, 2007. An explanatory statement in the Congressional Record detailed funding levels and earmarks, but did not reflect a 1.56% across-the-board cut provided in H.R. 2764. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) provided $26.89 billion for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, reflecting a 1.56% cut. An additional $500.0 million in emergency appropriations for wildfires was included, bringing the total to $27.39 billion for FY2008. This amount was about the same as enacted for FY2007, but $240.2 million lower than the House's proposed amount for FY2008. The FY2008 budget for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies was $26.89 billion, with an additional $500 million for wildfires. The funds were allocated for various purposes including wildland fire management for the Forest Service and BLM. In FY2008, funds were allocated as follows: $40.0 million for suppression, $115.0 million for repayment of accounts borrowed in FY2007, $10.0 million for hazardous fuels reduction, and $6.0 million for rehabilitation of federal lands. The appropriations level varied for different agencies, with increases for some like the Forest Service and decreases for others like the Environmental Protection Agency. In FY2008, funding allocations included -$124.2 million for the EPA, -$43.6 million for the OSM, -$33.9 million for the OST, and -$27.19 billion for all agencies under the Interior. Continuing funding was necessary due to the lack of a regular FY2008 funding bill before the start of the fiscal year. In FY2008, funding allocations for various agencies were as follows: -$124.2 million for the EPA, -$43.6 million for the OSM, -$33.9 million for the OST, and $27.19 billion for all agencies under the Interior. The House passed H.R. 2643 with $27.63 billion for FY2008, an increase over the FY2007 level. The Senate committee level proposed a decrease from FY2007. Both House and Senate levels were higher than the President's request of $25.69 billion for FY2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee considered amendments, including one to remove language barring funds for new Outer Continental Shelf leases without price thresholds. The House considered 58 amendments to H.R. 2643, adopting 18 before passing the bill on June 27, 2007. Amendments addressed various programs and issues, including banning imports of polar bears and polar bear parts. Amendments to extend the Secure Rural Schools Act and expedite claims challenging land management plans were withdrawn. The bill aimed to compensate counties for tax-exempt national forests and public lands. The House Appropriations Committee reported H.R. 2643 with a total of $27.63 billion, and a supplemental report identified funded projects. Amendments to the bill included reducing appropriations or prohibiting funds for specific programs. During consideration of the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, funding and policy issues have been debated. The FY2008 funding levels were controversial, with key issues including Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects, and construction of BIA Schools and IHS Health Facilities, with debates on funding cuts proposed in the President's budget. The FY2008 funding levels for the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill were controversial. Key issues included Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, construction of BIA Schools and IHS Health Facilities, Indian Trust Funds, Land Acquisition, and Outer Continental Shelf Leasing. The FY2008 funding levels for the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill were controversial, with key issues including moratoria on preleasing and leasing activities in offshore areas, oil and gas leases in offshore California, Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PILT), Royalty Relief for oil and natural gas companies on federal lands, and Superfund funding for hazardous waste cleanup. Termination of BIA Education and Housing, IHS Urban Health Programs, and Wildland Fire Fighting funding issues were key concerns in the FY2008 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages public land for various uses, including energy development, grazing, recreation, and preservation. They also oversee federal mineral resources and wildfire management on millions of acres of land. In FY2008, BLM received $1.89 billion in funding, including emergency appropriations for wildfires. For more information, refer to the \"Bureau of Land Management\" and \"Department of Agriculture: Forest Service\" sections in this report. In FY2008, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) received $1.89 billion in funding, including $78.0 million in emergency appropriations for wildfire suppression. An additional $171.0 million in emergency wildfire funds was provided in a previous law, bringing the total BLM appropriation to $2.06 billion. This funding level was higher than FY2007 and was supported by the Administration, House, and Senate Appropriations Committee primarily due to the emergency appropriations for wildfires. The FY2008 law allocated $853.9 million for the management of lands and resources, which was lower than FY2007. The FY2008 Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $1.89 billion to the Bureau of Land Management, including $78.0 million for wildfire suppression. The law included $74.8 million for maintenance, $44.3 million for wildlife and fisheries, and $73.0 million for range management, with increases for deferred maintenance and the healthy lands initiative. The FY2008 law allocated $67.9 million for recreation and wilderness programs, with an increase for the healthy lands initiative to enhance vegetation resources on western public lands. The National Landscape Conservation System received about $5 million more than the President's request for its 26 million acres of protected conservation areas. The FY2008 law included lower funding for energy and minerals at $109.9 million, with a reduction achieved through offsetting fees. Revenues are expected from a new program requiring payment for drilling permits. The law also capped the appropriation for oil and gas management at $90.2 million due to concerns about fund usage. The FY2008 law included provisions to limit funding for oil and gas activities by BLM, specifically regarding oil shale leasing programs. Concerns were raised about potential impacts and lack of cooperation with affected states. Funding for wild horse and burro management remained nearly level at $36.2 million, despite the Administration's proposal for a reduction to $32.1 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported increases in funding for wild horse management in FY2008, encouraging federal agencies to acquire wild horses from BLM. The FY2008 law allocated $886.1 million for Wildland Fire Management, including emergency appropriations for wildfire suppression. An additional $171.0 million was provided for fire suppression, hazardous fuels reduction, and rehabilitation. The total funding for wildland fire management in FY2008 was $1.06 billion. In FY2008, funding for wildland fire management was $1.06 billion, with fire suppression increasing to $367.8 million. Preparedness funding increased to $276.5 million, while funding for other fire operations rose to $241.8 million. The Senate Committee recommended an increase in preparedness funding to avoid shifting expenditures to suppression. In FY2008, wildland fire management funding increased to $1.06 billion. Fire suppression funding rose to $367.8 million, while preparedness funding increased to $276.5 million. Other fire operations received $241.8 million, with a focus on reducing hazardous fuels to prevent catastrophic fires. In FY2008, the law allocated $6.4 million for BLM Construction, a decrease from the previous year. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern over DOI's lack of commitment to infrastructure funding. Land Acquisition received $8.9 million, with two-thirds designated for eight acquisitions. In FY2008, $6.4 million was allocated for BLM Construction, a decrease from the previous year. Land Acquisition received $8.9 million, with two-thirds designated for eight acquisitions. The Administration sought a reduction to $1.6 million, with an additional $5.0 million from sales of subsurface mineral estate to surface owners. BLM estimated that 500,000 acres could be sold annually for $10 per acre, totaling $5.0 million per year. Money for land acquisition comes from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The FY2008 appropriation for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was $1.37 billion, a 2% increase from FY2007. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is for the Resource Management account, which received $1.08 billion in FY2008, a 6% increase from FY2007. The House approved $1.42 billion, while the Senate recommended $1.38 billion. The House approved $1.10 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) budget, while the Senate Committee recommended $1.08 billion. Funding for the Endangered Species program is a perennially controversial issue, with the FY2008 appropriation at $150.5 million, a 4% increase from the previous year. The Administration proposed a smaller increase of 1%. The FY2008 law did not include language to limit funding for the importation of polar bear parts from sport hunts. The House rejected amendments to prohibit funds for Mexican wolf recovery. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $224.3 million for endangered species, including reductions in funding for various conservation programs such as the Landowner Incentive Program and Stewardship Grants. The Cooperative Endangered Species program saw a decrease in funding from $81.0 million to $73.8 million, but with the use of prior year balances, the total FY2008 funding was $78.8 million. Table 4 shows that the FY2008 appropriations law allocated $224.3 million for endangered species and related programs, a 13% decrease from FY2007. Funding for refuge operations and maintenance increased by 10% to $434.1 million. The House approved $451.0 million, a 14% increase, while the Senate committee level was $413.8 million, up 5%. Operation costs have risen on many refuges due to factors like hurricane damage and border enforcement. The NWRS faced funding cuts for programs aiding endangered species, invasive species control, water protection, habitat restoration, and staffing at less popular refuges. The Northeast Region led efforts to consolidate management, increase \"de-staffing\" at refuges, and spread resources more effectively. Other regions also planned to address reduced budgets. FWS was directed to use FY2008 funding to reestablish basic operations nationwide and report back to the Appropriations Committees. In FY2008, Congress allocated $59.6 million for Law Enforcement, a 4% increase from FY2007. The House approved $60.1 million, up 5%, while the Senate recommended $61.1 million, a 7% increase. $7.3 million was enacted for studying avian flu, lower than the initial $7.4 million proposal. FWS collaborates with other agencies to monitor the virus in wild birds. In FY2008, the focus was on studying the spread of avian flu through wild birds, particularly in North American species with migratory patterns that intersect with infected Asian birds. The geographic areas of interest included Alaska, the Pacific Flyway, and Pacific islands. The Land Acquisition appropriation for FY2008 was $34.6 million, a 92% increase over the Administration's request and a 23% increase over FY2007. This funding was allocated for acquiring new lands and inholdings, with a significant portion previously used for federal refuge acquisitions. In FY2008, the Land Acquisition appropriation was $34.6 million, with a focus on studying avian flu spread through wild birds. Funding was allocated for acquiring new lands and inholdings, with a portion previously used for federal refuge acquisitions. The Administration proposed to reserve $5.5 million for specified acquisitions, funding the program at $12.5 million from LWCF appropriations. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for non-taxable federal lands presence. The National Wildlife Refuge System receives receipts from various activities, but additional appropriations are needed to fully fund authorized amounts. For FY2008, Congress provided $14.0 million, which would cover about 42% of the authorized payment level. The President's request was $10.8 million, down $3.4 million from the previous year. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund benefits endangered species like elephants and tigers. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund received $7.9 million for FY2008, benefiting Asian and African elephants, tigers, rhinoceroses, great apes, and marine turtles. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants help conserve species of concern to states, territories, and tribes, generating support from these governments. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund received $7.9 million for FY2008 to support conservation projects for various endangered species. Funds are allocated for state conservation plans and competitive grants to tribal governments. State allocations are determined by a formula, with a total appropriation of $73.8 million for FY2008.

The National Park Service (NPS) oversees 391 park units covering 85 million acres with a mission to protect and preserve natural and historic areas for public access. The NPS has over 20,000 employees and 20 types of area designations, including national parks, monuments, and recreational areas. Annual park visitation is at 273 million visits. The National Park Service (NPS) manages various park units across different landscapes and promotes resource conservation activities. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $2.39 billion for the NPS, with plans to enhance visitor services and park programs for the NPS's 100th anniversary in 2016 through the National Parks Centennial Initiative. The Parks Centennial Initiative, introduced by President Bush in 2006, aims to provide up to $3 billion in new funds for national parks over 10 years through a public/private partnership. It includes adding $100 million annually in discretionary funds, challenging the public to donate $100 million annually, and matching public donations with federal funds. Concerns have been raised about potential commercialization and privatization influence on the parks. Park advocacy groups estimate a budget shortfall of over $600 million annually for national parks. The FY2008 law addressed a budget shortfall of over $600 million annually for national parks. It extended the authorization of the National Park System Advisory Board and did not include a transfer of $1.0 million for the Statue of Liberty. The Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery grant program has not been funded since FY2002. The House Appropriations Committee reminded the NPS of its responsibility to enforce regulations prohibiting the conversion of project sites for other uses. The FY2008 law did not provide new grant monies for UPARR. The NPS issued a Record of Decision on winter use management in Yellowstone, with lawsuits not requesting injunctions, allowing operations to continue. The law also repealed a provision prohibiting the NPS from removing nonnative deer. The FY2008 law prohibited the NPS from removing nonnative deer and elk from Santa Rosa Island in the Channel Islands National Park, impacting park operations funding. The law provided $1.97 billion for park operations, incorporating the Park Police account into the operations line item. The majority of operations funding is provided directly to park managers to support activities, programs, and services essential for day-to-day park operations. The FY2008 law allocated $1.74 billion for park management, with increases sought for maintenance, visitor services, and resource stewardship. The U.S. Park Police is an urban-oriented law enforcement entity with jurisdiction in Washington, DC, New York City, and San Francisco. The U.S. Park Police, with jurisdiction in Washington, DC, New York City, and San Francisco, provide specialized law enforcement services to NPS units and other federal and state lands. Funding in FY2008 increased for enhanced security at National Mall icons and special events. The Administration proposed additional funding for park operations as part of the National Parks Centennial Initiative. The FY2008 law provided $24.6 million for a signature projects matching program under the Centennial Initiative, requiring a 50:50 match. The House approved $50.0 million for matching donations, while the Senate committee expressed support but preferred the issue to be addressed by the authorizing committee. The President proposed the establishment of a mandatory program instead of seeking an annual appropriation for this purpose. The FY2008 law provided $67.4 million for park system recreation, natural and cultural resource protection programs, and an international park affairs office. Funding for Preserve America was moved to this line item, increasing the total amount allocated. Legislation would be required to establish a 10-year mandatory spending program of $100.0 million annually. The FY2008 appropriation included $15.3 million for the heritage partnership program funding National Heritage Areas, $5.3 million more than requested. For non-NPS sites, $7.5 million was allowed for statutory and contractual aid programs, $4.3 million more than FY2007. The FY2008 law provided $218.4 million for NPS construction, $79.1 million less than FY2007. Recent DOI data from March 2007 shows a deferred maintenance backlog of $7.9 billion for the National Park Service, with $4.3 billion allocated to park roads. Another DOI source estimates the backlog to be $9.1 billion for FY2006. In FY2008, $69.0 million was appropriated for the NPS under the Land and Water Conservation Fund, with $44.4 million for NPS land acquisition and $24.6 million for state assistance programs. The $44.4 million for NPS land acquisition was $10.0 million above the FY2007 level. The Administration requested $1.4 million for program administration under National Recreation and Preservation, while the House and Senate committees sought higher funding levels. The $24.6 million for state assistance was significantly less than the House and Senate proposals, as well as below the FY2007 enacted level. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) provides grants for restoring historic sites and objects, with NHPA reauthorization enacted in December 2006. The NHPA reauthorization (P.L. 109-235) extended funding authority for the HPF through 2015, with preservation grants funded on a federal-state matching basis. The FY2008 law allocated $70.4 million for the HPF, a 7% increase from FY2007. Grants to state historic preservation offices increased by 6% to $39.4 million. Additional funding was provided for Save America's Treasures and Preserve America grant programs. The FY2008 law increased funding for Save America's Treasures to $24.6 million and for Preserve America to $7.4 million. The Park Service proposed a $5.0 million program for creating an inventory of historic properties, but it was not funded. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is a key science agency providing information on natural hazards, the environment, and energy. It is also a primary mapping agency and a source of water resource data. Funding for the USGS is allocated for various activities including geographic research and geologic investigations. The FY2008 law allocated $1.01 billion for the USGS, the first time its budget exceeded a billion dollars. This was $31.5 million (3%) over the Administration's request and $18.4 million (2%) over the FY2007 enacted level. Additionally, $6.3 million was provided for water resources research institutes and full funding for the mineral resource assessment program. An increase of $7.4 million was included for global climate change research, with $2.5 million directed to establish the National Global Warming and Wildlife Science Center. The FY2008 law provided $110.4 million for Enterprise Information within the USGS, slightly below the Administration's request. This program includes funding for information technology, security, services, and resources management. There are three main programs under Enterprise Information: enterprise information security and technology, enterprise information resources, and national geospatial program. The national geospatial program, managed by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), aims to provide high-quality geospatial information to the public. The FY2008 law allocated $77.7 million for the program, with $24.2 million designated for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (Landsat 8) to monitor the Earth's land surface and coastal areas. The FY2008 law supported funding for Landsat 8, which will have more data than Landsat 7 with additional spectral bands and higher resolution. The law also provided $243.5 million for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities, including Hazard Assessments, Landscape and Coastal Assessments, and Resource Assessments. The Administration sought a reduction in the mineral resources program funding. The FY2008 law reinstated funding for geologic hazards program, providing $85.7 million, $1.6 million above the Administration's request. Funds would support research on volcanoes, landslides, and earthquakes. Congress expressed strong support for the multi-hazard initiative. Additionally, $220.5 million was allocated for Water Resources Investigations, exceeding the Administration's request by $8.1 million. The FY2008 law provided $6.3 million for water resources research institutes, with an increase to $20.1 million for the National Streamflow Information Program (NSIP) to maintain and expand the streamgage network. The NSIP collects streamflow data for various agencies and programs. The USGS Biological Research Program received $179.9 million in FY2008, slightly below the Administration's request. They are surveying for avian flu in wild birds and collecting samples from birds migrating through Russia and Southeast Asia. The Science Support program received $67.2 million for modernizing scientific information infrastructure. The FY2008 law allocated $100.0 million for Facilities, focusing on maintenance and repair costs. The Minerals Management Service administers the Offshore Minerals Management and Minerals Revenue Management programs. For more information on the U.S. Geological Survey, visit http://www.usgs.gov/. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) collects and distributes revenue from federal onshore and offshore leases, as well as Indian mineral leases. In FY2007, MMS collected $11.5 billion in revenue, with royalties from natural gas production accounting for 40-45% and oil royalties for 38.5% of receipts. The revenue fluctuates annually based on oil and gas prices. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) collects revenue from federal onshore and offshore leases, as well as Indian mineral leases. In FY2008, MMS had a funding level of $294.7 million, with appropriations of $115.9 million, offsetting collections of $135.7 million, and state cost sharing deductions of $43.0 million. This represented a $6.4 million (2%) increase from FY2007. The Senate recommended a budget of $302.1 million, while the House approved $295.7 million with less funding through appropriations. The FY2008 appropriations law included provisions for a $50.0 million deferral for ultra deepwater research and a $43.0 million deduction for state royalty administrative costs. Congress established net receipts sharing in 1991, requiring states to cover some administrative costs for federal leases. In 2000, this requirement was ended, allowing states to receive their full share of revenue. The law did not include language to prevent transfers of funds into the Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Natural Gas and Other Petroleum Research Fund. The Fund, created in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, received $50 million annually from federal oil and gas leasing receipts. The House-passed bill supported the Administration's proposals, resulting in a $50.0 million deferral for ultra deepwater research and a $43.0 million deduction for state royalty administrative costs. Controversial issues include oil and gas development moratoria in the OCS and Congress enacted separate legislation. Congress enacted separate legislation (P.L. 109-432) to open part of the Gulf of Mexico previously under moratoria, but nearly all of the eastern Gulf remains under a leasing moratorium until 2022. The law also includes revenue sharing provisions for selected coastal states. Bristol Bay and Virginia are controversial areas in the OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program. The FY2008 appropriations law did not include language barring funds for new leases. The House-passed bill includes language preventing funds from being used for new leases for those with leases under the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 without price thresholds. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected a similar provision. Royalty relief for OCS oil and gas producers was a topic of debate during the FY2007 Interior appropriations. The MMS did not collect royalties on leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 due to the absence of price thresholds in the agreements. The MMS did not collect royalties on oil and gas leases in 1998 and 1999 due to the absence of price thresholds. The House passed a bill denying new Gulf of Mexico leases without price thresholds or payment, which could lead to legal challenges and delay development. DOI suggested offering a three-year lease extension as an incentive to include price thresholds. The House-passed language regarding price thresholds for leases was not included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Amendments related to lifting the OCS moratoria for natural gas leasing and development were defeated. Appropriations Committees provided direction for drilling in the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area, stating that detailed studies and information should be available before drilling. MMS and scientific bodies were directed to document oil spill containment and response procedures. The MMS was required to complete a pre-sale process and NEPA process before proceeding with the North Aleutian Basin sale. Critics argue that less auditing and more focus on compliance review has led to a less rigorous royalty collection system, resulting in a loss of revenue to the federal Treasury. Recommendations have been made to strengthen the Compliance and Asset Management Program, and an independent panel was established to review the MMS Mineral Leasing Program. The Royalty-in-Kind Program has significantly grown over the past three years. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the need for more audits and directed MMS to report on corrective actions. Oil and gas leasing in offshore California remains controversial due to issues with consistency in federal offshore leases with state coastal zone management plans. In 2001, California sued MMS over lease suspensions, which were later struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2002. Oil company lessees then filed breach of contract claims against MMS for restitution. In 2005, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that the federal government breached its contract with the lessees regarding lease suspensions. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled that the government breached contracts with oil company lessees over lease suspensions, ordering repayment of \"bonus payments\" made in exchange for leases.

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure coal-mined land is reclaimed. An Abandoned Mine Land fund was created to address abandoned mine sites with health or safety hazards. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure coal-mined land is reclaimed. States and tribes develop their own regulatory programs incorporating minimum standards. AML collections are divided and assigned to different accounts, with grants awarded based on a formula to annual congressional appropriations. Collections have exceeded appropriations, with an unappropriated balance of over $1.95 billion by the end of FY2006. The AML fund balance exceeded $1.95 billion by the end of FY2006, with $1.2 billion in state-share accounts. Western states contributed more due to coal production shifting westward. States in the East pushed for increased AML appropriations to address disproportionate reclamation burdens. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act reauthorized AML fee collections through FY2021 and changed grant disbursement procedures. Grants will be funded by permanent appropriations from the AML fund and the U.S. Treasury general fund. During the fiscal year following, the AML fund balances will be returned to states and tribes in seven annual installments. Certified states, which have reclaimed serious sites, will receive equal installments of unappropriated balances in their state-share accounts. Additionally, they will receive grants based on historic coal production. The allocation of funds from certified states' state-share accounts to the federal-share account representing historical coal production will no longer be given to certified states after FY2008. This change aims to increase the funding available for distribution to uncertified states in the future. The grants for uncertified states will be determined by their entitlement from the historical coal production account, which will now have more funds. Due to a permanent appropriation, the FY2008 budget request for the Office of Surface Mining was significantly lower than the previous year. The total budget request for FY2008 was $168.3 million, a 43% reduction from FY2007. In FY2008, the Office of Surface Mining received a total appropriation of $170.4 million, with $118.5 million allocated for Regulation and Technology and $52.0 million for the AML fund. This budget is slightly higher than the Administration's request by $2.1 million (1%). Some activities will still be subject to annual appropriations, including federal AML programs in states without OSM-approved reclamation programs, an emergency reclamation program, OSM administrative expenses, and the Clean Streams program. The Office of Surface Mining received a total appropriation of $170.4 million in FY2008, slightly higher than the Administration's request by $2.1 million (1%). The House and Senate committees recommended funding boosts for Regulation and Technology, with additional funds allocated for environmental protection activities. The Senate committee also recommended an increase in funds to match state costs for regulatory programs. Both committees agreed on the Administration's request for $52.8 million for the AML fund. The House approved $170.2 million for the Office of Surface Mining, $1.9 million over the Administration's request and $124.5 million below FY2007. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $174.3 million for OSM, $6.0 million over the Administration's request and $120.3 million below FY2007. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides various services to tribes and historically leads federal dealings with them. Programs include government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. For more information on OSM, visit http://www.osmre.gov/osm.htm. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides services such as social programs, education, economic development, and Indian rights protection. In FY2008, BIA received $2.29 billion in direct appropriations, a decrease from the previous year. Key issues for BIA include education programs and the management of trust assets. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) faces key issues with education programs, law enforcement, housing, and tribal acknowledgment. The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) funds a school system with 184 schools and dormitories, educating 46,000 students in 23 states. Tribes operate 123 institutions under self-determination contracts, while BIE operates the rest. BIE also operates two postsecondary schools and provides grants to tribally controlled colleges. Key problems include low student achievement. The Administration proposed a $15-million initiative in FY2008 to enhance education at BIE-funded schools, addressing low student achievement and inadequate school facilities. The initiative includes funds for improving instructional resources, teacher development, principal training, student transportation, and education management. The Administration proposed a $15-million initiative in FY2008 to enhance education at BIE-funded schools, addressing low student achievement and inadequate school facilities. The initiative includes funds for improving instructional resources, teacher development, principal training, student transportation, and education management. Additionally, the House approved an additional $7.0 million for meeting AYP goals and an additional $1.0 million for student transportation. The amount of appropriations enacted for FY2008 for the education initiative is being determined through the OMB report under \u00a7437 of the Interior portion of the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Department of Education programs under Titles I and VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act provide funds for BIE-funded schools. Opponents argue that these programs cannot replace culturally relevant JOM programs. The House approved $5.3 million under Tribal Government and $16.5 million under BIE for JOM in FY2008, while the Senate recommended $7.7 million under Tribal Government and $8.0 million under BIE. The amount enacted for JOM is still being determined. The OMB report specified $14.0 million for JOM under BIE, with a 1.56% rescission for discretionary programs. Two tribal technical colleges, one in North Dakota and one on the Navajo Reservation, are excluded from BIE tribal colleges and universities assistance program. The BIE has sought to end funding for these colleges, stating they receive adequate funding from the Carl Perkins Act. Congress has not agreed with this decision. The Administration proposed no funding for tribal technical colleges in FY2008, but Congress approved $6.0 million for these colleges. Many BIE school facilities are old and dilapidated, with health and safety deficiencies. The Administration proposed a reduction in education construction funds for FY2008, including a significant cut for construction of replacement schools. Despite improvements since 2001, opponents argue that many BIA schools still require major repairs or replacements. The FY2008 appropriations law supported a substantial reduction in education construction funding. The FY2008 appropriations law supported a significant reduction in education construction funding, with the House-passed level of $145.2 million reduced to $142.9 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for education construction, with no funding for replacement school construction due to funding shortfalls in existing projects. The Committee found that 18 projects faced funding shortfalls totaling $143 million, leading to a halt in new projects until a plan was presented. Rising crime rates, methamphetamine use, and juvenile gang activity were reported on some Indian reservations. The federal government holds jurisdiction over major criminal offenses on most reservations, with limited sentencing options in tribal courts. The BIA proposed a $17.3 million increase in law enforcement funding for FY2008. The FY2008 BIA law enforcement funding saw a $17.3 million increase to $221.8 million, with allocations for additional officers, equipment, training, staffing at detention facilities, and specialized drug enforcement training. Despite concerns about staffing shortages and the methamphetamine problem, the enacted amount was $228.1 million after a rescission, a 12% increase over FY2007. The BIA received a total funding of $204.5 million, with specific activities determined through an OMB report. The Appropriations Committees directed the BIA to increase law enforcement and criminal prosecutions using existing authorities, especially in areas with the greatest need. The House allocated $231.8 million, including $9.5 million to combat methamphetamine abuse. The Senate recommended $225.8 million for BIA law enforcement, with increased funding for criminal investigations and detention/corrections. The FY2008 appropriations law provided $14.3 million for tribal courts, a $2.3 million increase from the previous year. The House approved $17.1 million, while the Senate committee recommended $12.1 million. The Indian Housing Block Grant is the major federal housing program, while BIA's HIP program focuses on repairs and new houses for needy families near reservations. The FY2008 appropriations law provided $13.6 million for the BIA's Housing Improvement Program (HIP), which focuses on repairs and new houses for needy families near reservations. The Administration proposed eliminating HIP for FY2008, but Indian tribes and supporters opposed this, arguing that HIP meets a great need for housing rehabilitation. The House approved $18.8 million for HIP in the Human Services budget activity for FY2008. In FY2008, the House Appropriations Committee allocated $18.8 million for the Housing Improvement Program (HIP) in the Human Services budget activity, a slight increase from FY2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $9.4 million for HIP. Federal recognition provides tribes with unique benefits, including partial sovereignty and eligibility for federal Indian programs. The Interior Department established a regulatory process for acknowledgment decisions in 1978. The Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) within the Assistant Secretary\u2014Indian Affairs employs expert teams to review recognition petitions. OFA's funding for FY2008 was $2.9 million, with a goal to increase decision-making efficiency. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to various insular areas and former insular areas, managing relations and building governmental capacity. The specific amount for the Office of Federal Acknowledgment (OFA) is being determined through the OMB report. For more information on education programs of the Bureau of Indian Education, visit http://www.oiep.bia.edu. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) receives a budget that includes permanent and annually appropriated funds. In FY2008, OIA's budget request included $324.1 million in permanent funding for U.S. territories and $83.1 million in annually appropriated funds. The $83.1 million is divided into two accounts: Assistance to Territories (AT) and Compact of Free Association (CFA), providing financial assistance for various projects and initiatives in American Samoa and freely associated states. In FY2008, the Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) received $77.8 million in Assistance to Territories (AT) funding and $5.3 million in Compact of Free Association (CFA) appropriations. The approved funding levels for AT and CFA remained consistent across different stages of the appropriations process. The appropriations law designated $70.1 million in AT funding for various assistance programs, including technical and maintenance assistance, disaster assistance, and grants to territories. $8.5 million was allocated for OIA salaries and expenses. The law also specified conditions for the release of AT funding, such as Government Accountability Office audits and grants to specific territories. In FY2008, the Office of Insular Affairs received $77.8 million in Assistance to Territories funding and $5.3 million in Compact of Free Association appropriations. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions which cannot be taxed, with payments totaling over $3.6 billion since 1976. The program has been controversial due to the payment formula. The PILT program has been controversial as appropriations have not kept up with authorized levels, leading to county governments claiming insufficient funding compared to property taxes. Rural areas, in particular, require additional PILT funds for essential services. For more information, visit the DOI website. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets and manages Indian funds directly. Indian trust funds were transferred from the BIA to the OST in 1996. The funds managed by the OST include tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts for about 323,000 individual Indians. Total asset value is approximately $2.9 billion. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) manages tribal funds for about 300 tribes and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts for 323,000 individual Indians with a total asset value of $400 million. The FY2008 budget for OST was $189.3 million, a decrease from the previous year. Key issues include historical accounting for tribal and IIM accounts, as well as ongoing litigation. The Administration and Senate Appropriations Committee supported $60.0 million for historical accounting in FY2008. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act limited historical accounting to $55.5 million, $0.9 million less than FY2007. The historical accounting effort aims to assign correct balances to tribal and IIM accounts due to litigation. DOI proposed a five-year, $335 million project in 2003 to reconcile IIM accounts. The DOI proposed a $335 million project in 2003 to reconcile IIM accounts. The plan has been revised to include additional accounts and aims to reconcile all transactions for certain account types and land-based transactions over $5,000. OST estimates completion in FY2011, using a statistical sampling approach for transactions under $5,000. Tribal trust fund and accounting suits have been filed for over 300 tribes, with most suits filed in 2006. OST allocates about $40 million of historical accounting expenditures to IIM accounts. The House Appropriations Committee has expressed intent to limit expenditures for historical accounting, with a lawsuit filed against the federal government by IIM account holders. The DOI estimated its method for historical accounting would cost $335 million over five years. The court rejected both plaintiffs' and DOI's historical accounting plans, ordering DOI to account for all trust fund and asset transactions since 1887 without statistical sampling. DOI estimated compliance would cost $6 billion-$12 billion and appealed the order. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned much of the order but a similar order was issued in February 2005. In 2005, the Appeals Court vacated the district court's order regarding DOI's historical accounting obligations. The OST continues its accounting under a 2003 plan. Concerns exist about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit and potential impacts on DOI trust reform and Indian programs. The potential costs of a settlement for the Cobell lawsuit could be significant, possibly exceeding the $27.5 billion proposed settlement amount. Funding sources discussed include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund,\" but some consider the Fund insufficient. Congress may consider options such as enacting a delay to the court-ordered accounting, directing a settlement, or clarifying the department's historical accounting obligations. The Administration proposed a $7 billion settlement for IIM and tribal accounting claims, as well as trust land mismanagement claims. However, there was opposition to this proposal in a Senate hearing. No trust fund settlement legislation has been introduced in the 110th Congress so far. The Committee urged parties in litigation and Congress to settle trust litigation completely. The National Indian Gaming Commission oversees tribal gaming operations and faces funding adequacy issues. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) is primarily funded through annual fees assessed on tribes' Class II and III operations, with no direct appropriations from FY1999-FY2008. There was a need for additional funding due to increased demand for oversight resources. Congress increased NIGC's fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004-FY2007, and later created a formula-based fee ceiling in the Native American Technical Corrections Act of 2006. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) implemented a formula-based fee ceiling of 0.08% of gross gaming revenues for FY2007 and onwards, replacing the previous dollar limitation. The NIGC anticipated fee revenues of $16 million for FY2007, a one-third increase from FY2006, and expects $18 million for FY2008. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970 to consolidate federal pollution control responsibilities and has seen significant growth in responsibilities due to new environmental laws and amendments. For more information on NIGC, visit http://www.nigc.gov. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established in 1970 to regulate air and water quality, pesticides, toxic substances, and waste management. EPA's funding has increased over time to fulfill its statutory responsibilities, reaching a high of $8.4 billion in FY2004. In FY2008, EPA received $7.46 billion in funding, which was less than the proposed amounts by the House and Senate. In FY2008, Congress allocated $7.46 billion for EPA, which was less than proposed amounts. Funding levels were specified for various programs and activities within eight statutory accounts. Funding for individual programs varied compared to previous years. In FY2008, Congress allocated $7.46 billion for EPA, with funding levels specified for various programs within eight statutory accounts. The law did not include a new account for a proposed Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, but provided funding for other climate-related activities. In FY2008, Congress allocated $7.46 billion for EPA, with funding levels specified for various programs. The law provided funding for activities related to climate change, including water infrastructure projects, hazardous waste cleanup, scientific research, grants for air quality programs, and EPA regulatory actions. Funding for climate change and staffing of EPA's Office of Inspector General were also areas of interest within Congress. In FY2008, funding for EPA included allocations for climate change activities, hazardous waste cleanup, scientific research, air quality programs, and regulatory actions. The appropriations law prohibited funds for EPA's proposed rule on hazardous air pollutant emissions. Funding for water infrastructure projects, specifically the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, received $689.1 million in FY2008, slightly more than the President's request but less than the previous year. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) was $829.0 million, lower than the President's request of $842.2 million and the prior year's appropriation of $837.5 million. Federal funding for Clean Water SRFs has been a contentious issue, with Congress consistently allocating more funds than the President's requests in recent years. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) was $829.0 million, lower than the President's request of $842.2 million. Congress has historically allocated more funds than the President's requests for Clean Water SRFs. Some Members argue for additional federal funds to help meet stricter drinking water standards. EPA also receives targeted funding for special project grants within the STAG account to support water infrastructure needs. The EPA's STAG account provides grants for wastewater, drinking water, and storm water infrastructure projects to specific communities. Special project grants do not require repayment but recipients must provide 45% of the project's cost in matching funds. Funding for special project grants has declined in recent years, with $132.9 million allocated in FY2008. Congress did not provide funding for special project grants in FY2007. In FY2007, Congress did not fund special project grants, as prohibited by P.L. 110-5. FY2008 allocated $1.22 billion for the Hazardous Substance Superfund account, slightly higher than the President's request. Funding for the Superfund program has remained consistent over the past decade. The Superfund program's funding adequacy has been a long-standing issue over the past decade. Some argue that steady federal funding is sufficient for cleanup, while others believe more funds are needed to expedite cleanup and address health and environmental risks. The Superfund program's funding for physical cleanup of contaminated sites has been a perennial issue, with about 2/3 of annual funding devoted to short-term and long-term cleanup actions. In FY2008, $827.5 million was allocated for cleanup activities, exceeding the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. In FY2008, the Superfund program received $827.5 million for cleanup activities, surpassing the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. Concerns about program performance and funding for long-term remediation were key points in the funding debate. Amendments in 2002 also established a separate program for cleaning up contaminated \"brownfields.\" The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $165.8 million for EPA's Brownfields Program, slightly lower than the House's proposal of $172.9 million. The funding includes grants for cleanup at individual sites and state programs, as well as administrative expenses. Brownfields are commercial or industrial properties with less hazardous contamination than Superfund sites, requiring cleanup before they can be reused. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $165.8 million for EPA's Brownfields Program, slightly lower than the House's proposal of $172.9 million. The funding includes grants for cleanup at individual sites and state programs, as well as administrative expenses. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and evaluations of EPA programs. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and evaluations of EPA programs and operations, funded by a base appropriation and a transfer from the Superfund account. In FY2008, the OIG received $52.6 million, with concerns raised about staffing for Superfund cleanup oversight. In FY2008, the OIG received increased funding to maintain staffing levels for oversight of Superfund cleanups, preventing a reduction in workyears. The S&T account, like the OIG account, is funded by a base appropriation and a transfer from Superfund for research on more effective cleanup methods. EPA's scientific research activities, including laboratories and research grants, are primarily funded through the S&T account. The FY2008 law allocated $785.8 million for the S&T account, an increase from previous years. Most of the funds support research activities, with some used for operational expenses. Funding for EPA's research areas either decreased or remained flat compared to the previous year due to a shift in funds from other accounts. Funding for EPA's research areas in FY2008 either decreased or stayed the same compared to FY2007. Some areas, like Climate Protection and Global Change research, received more funding than requested by the President, but not as much as proposed by the House or Senate Appropriations Committee. Concerns have been raised about the declining federal resources for scientific research and the debate continues on the use of \"sound science\" in federal policy development. The FY2008 law allocated $216.8 million for state and local air quality management grants, which was an increase from the President's request of $185.2 million. However, some Members and officials argue that more funding is needed due to increasing Clean Air Act responsibilities. The enacted appropriation was less than what the House and Senate had proposed. EPA attributed the President's requested decrease to different authorities in the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed a change in grant authorities in the Clean Air Act to require matching funds from recipients, reducing the federal role in funding activities. This shift was based on the assertion that the monitoring network for particulate matter is now in the implementation phase. The Senate Appropriations Committee disagreed with this proposal in the FY2008 Interior appropriations bill. The FY2008 law did not address the President's proposed shift in grant authorities to require matching funds from recipients. The law did not include funding for a new Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, which was proposed by the House. The House proposed a $50.0 million commission on climate change adaptation and mitigation, with $5.0 million for operations and $45.0 million for research funding to federal agencies. The commission would have included government and non-government members, chaired by the President of the National Academy of Sciences. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $4.67 billion for the Forest Service, including $222.0 million for wildfire suppression. An additional $329.0 million was provided for emergency wildfire funds, bringing the total FS appropriation to $5.0 billion for FY2008. Congress rejected proposed decreases in line items and programs, opting to support the higher budget primarily due to emergency fire money. The Forest Service expressed concerns about the increasing costs of firefighting, which are impacting fire preparedness and natural resource programs. In FY2008, half of the total FS appropriation was allocated to wildland fire management. The Senate Appropriations Committee was troubled by the growing proportion of the Forest Service budget dedicated to fire activities while the overall budget was declining. In 2000, fire programs accounted for 21% of the FS budget, increasing to 45% in the FY2008 budget request. Significant issues have been raised regarding the proposed sale of 300,000 acres of national forest lands in the FY2007 and FY2008 budget proposals. Legislation would be required to authorize the land sale, but it has not been enacted. The House Appropriations Committee strongly discouraged the Administration from pursuing the sale of national forest lands. The House Appropriations Committee discouraged the Administration from selling off national forest lands to fund rural schools. A one-year extension of payments under P.L. 106-393 was included in P.L. 110-28. Reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools without land sales is still being debated. The FY2008 law did not include language limiting funds for timber harvesting in the Tongass National Forest. An amendment to prohibit funds for timber harvesting in the Tongass was not included in the FY2008 law. The Tongass timber harvests are debated for their impact on the Treasury and the environment, with opponents arguing for their importance to southeast Alaska's economy. Fire funding and protection programs remain controversial, with discussions on high suppression costs, treatment locations, and obstacles to fuel reduction and post-fire rehabilitation activities. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $3.55 billion for fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations for FS and BLM wildfires, the highest level in at least five years. The BLM received 30% ($1.06 billion) and the FS received 70% ($2.49 billion), with the largest portion going towards fire suppression at $1,067.6 million. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $3.55 billion for fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations for FS and BLM wildfires. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern with the high costs of large fires and rejected the Administration's cut as \"irresponsible.\" Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees provided direction to examine, reduce, and report on the costs of large fire incidents. The FY2008 law allocated $432.0 million for FS fire programs, with a focus on hazardous fuels reduction. The Administration's proposed cuts were not reflected in the law, with most funds allocated for fuels treatments in the wildland-urban interface. The Appropriations Committees provided direction on fund allocation based on prioritizing areas with high fuel loads. The FY2008 law allocated $329.0 million for emergency fire funds for the FS, with allocations for wildfire suppression, repayment of borrowed funds, hazardous fuels reduction, and other activities. State and Private Forestry programs received $262.7 million for financial and technical assistance, a decrease from the previous year but an increase from the Administration's request. The FY2008 law allocated funds for emergency fire funds for the FS, with allocations for wildfire suppression, repayment of borrowed funds, hazardous fuels reduction, and other activities. State and Private Forestry programs received financial and technical assistance. The FY2008 request included cuts for forest health management programs, but appropriations were reduced from FY2007 without meeting the Administration's desired levels. Forest stewardship, forest legacy, and urban and community forestry programs also saw changes in funding levels. The FY2008 appropriation for the National Forest System was $1.47 billion, with level or increased funding for major activities except for a 15% reduction in land management planning. Law enforcement saw the largest increase in funding from $115.0 million in FY2007 to $131.9 million in FY2008. The urban and community forestry programs received $27.7 million, an 8% reduction from FY2007 but a 59% increase over the request. The FY2008 appropriation for the National Forest System was $1.34 billion, with a decrease of 8% spread among many programs. Law enforcement received an increase to $123.8 million. Capital Improvement and Maintenance appropriations were slightly reduced to $434.4 million, with an additional $40.0 million from transfers. $48.3 million was allocated for deferred maintenance to reduce the agency's backlog, a significant increase from previous years. The FY2008 appropriation for the National Forest System was $1.34 billion, with a decrease of 8% spread among many programs. Law enforcement received an increase to $123.8 million. Capital Improvement and Maintenance appropriations were slightly reduced to $434.4 million, with an additional $40.0 million from transfers. $48.3 million was allocated for deferred maintenance to reduce the agency's backlog, a significant increase from previous years. The House approved $39.4 million for legacy road remediation, while the Administration sought to cut the appropriation to $15.7 million. Level funding of $41.8 million was provided for Land Acquisition in FY2008. The Indian Health Service (IHS) in the Department of Health and Human Services provides medical services for American Indians and Alaska Natives through various programs and facilities. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical services for American Indians and Alaska Natives through various programs and facilities. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, school health centers, health stations, village clinics, and residential treatment centers. In FY2008, IHS received $3.35 billion in appropriations, an increase of $166.0 million (5%) over FY2007. Funding also comes from reimbursements and a special Indian diabetes program. In FY2008, the Indian Health Service (IHS) received $3.35 billion in appropriations, with 89% allocated for Health Services and 11% for Facilities. Key issues in the budget include the urban Indian health program and health care facilities construction. IHS Health Services are funded through congressional appropriations, reimbursements from private health insurance, and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid, totaling $700.3 million. Another $150.0 million is spent annually on the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, which expires after FY2008. The FY2008 appropriations for IHS Health Services budget included $2.43 billion for clinical services, with primary care at IHS- and tribally run hospitals and clinics. This was an increase of $135.0 million (6%) over FY2007. The House approved $2.48 billion, while the Senate committee recommended $2.45 billion. The FY2008 appropriations for IHS Health Services budget included $2.43 billion for clinical services, with primary care at IHS- and tribally run hospitals and clinics. The Administration and the House had both supported $1.49 billion for contract health care, while the Senate committee recommended $1.50 billion. Contract health care funds the purchase of health services from local providers when IHS cannot provide medical care, especially in regions with fewer direct-care facilities. The FY2008 law appropriated $579.3 million for contract health care, including $26.6 million for the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF), a $62.0 million increase over FY2007. The House and Senate Appropriations Committee approved $579.5 million, close to the appropriated level. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated funds for various health care programs within the IHS Health Services budget. This included $28.0 million for the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF), which is used for high-cost cases like disaster victims or catastrophic illnesses. Additionally, funds were provided for dental programs, mental health, alcohol and substance abuse, methamphetamine treatment and prevention, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF). The law directed allocation based on areas with the greatest health care funding needs. The Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (IHCIF) is allocated among IHS service units to address health care funding needs. The Administration proposed funding for dental, mental health, and substance abuse programs. The House approved these proposals and added funds for methamphetamine treatment and prevention. The Senate committee recommended additional funding for methamphetamine programs. The FY2008 appropriations law included $127.6 million for preventive health services, with increases for public health nursing, health education, immunizations in Alaska, and the community health representatives program. The Administration, House, and Senate supported $129.6 million for preventive health services. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $410.2 million for other health services, a 4% increase from FY2007. This included $267.4 million for contract support costs (CSC), the largest item in this category, to help tribes administer IHS-funded programs. The House approved $418.6 million, while the Senate committee recommended $411.7 million. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $410.2 million for various health services, including Indian health professions scholarships, tribal management grants, direct IHS operation of facilities, and self-governance technical assistance. The urban Indian health program received $34.5 million, a 2% increase from the previous year, despite the Administration's proposal of no funding. The program helps fund preventive and primary health services for eligible urban Indians through contracts and grants. The urban Indian health program provides preventive and primary health services for eligible urban Indians through contracts and grants with 34 urban Indian organizations at 41 urban sites. Services offered include clinical care, substance abuse care, referrals, and health information. The Administration argues that funding should target Indians on or near reservations, while opponents claim alternative programs cannot replace the urban Indian health program and its impact on urban Indian healthcare has not been studied. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $374.6 million for the Indian Health Service's Facilities category, including funding for equipment, construction, maintenance, and improvement of health-care and sanitation facilities. This was an increase of $20.7 million (6%) over the previous year and $35.5 million (10%) over the Administration's request. The House approved $360.9 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $375.5 million, with allocations for maintenance, sanitation facilities construction, equipment, and environmental health support programs. In FY2008, $36.6 million was allocated for health care facilities construction, a significant increase from previous years. The funding was designated for construction of hospitals, clinics, ambulatory facilities, and dental units. The expectation was for the Indian Health Service to prioritize projects that were already in progress but required additional funding to stay on schedule. This allocation marked a substantial increase compared to the FY2007 level, which had seen a 36% reduction from the previous year. In FY2008, funding for health care facilities construction saw a significant increase to $36.6 million. The Administration proposed a 48% reduction to $12.7 million, citing a focus on maintenance of existing facilities. Opponents argued against the cut, pointing to a $1.5 billion backlog in unmet health-facility needs. The House approved $20.3 million, while the Senate committee recommended $33.0 million for new construction. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was created in 1974 to resolve a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over lands. ONHIR's activities include land and housing acquisition, infrastructure construction, and post-move support for relocated families. Relocation is voluntary, with federal expenses covering new homes and bonuses. The FY2008 appropriations law allocated $8.9 million for ONHIR, a 4% increase from FY2007. Navajo-Hopi relocation, which began in 1977, is nearing completion. ONHIR has a backlog of relocatees awaiting replacement homes, with most being Navajo families. By FY2005, 98% of eligible Navajo families and 100% of Hopi families had completed relocation. About half of roughly 250 Navajo families living on Hopi land still need to be relocated. Approximately half of the 250 Navajo families living on Hopi land have signed \"accommodation agreements\" allowing them to stay under Hopi law. Some families may opt out of these agreements and relocate using ONHIR benefits. As of FY2005, 83 eligible Navajo families were awaiting relocation, with eight still residing on Hopi land. ONHIR was negotiating with the Hopi Tribe to allow seven families to stay on Hopi land as autonomous families. In FY2007, ONHIR estimated relocation moves for currently eligible families. ONHIR estimated that relocation moves for eligible Navajo families may not be completed until the end of FY2008 due to the addition of families opting out of agreements or filing late applications. Congress has expressed concerns about the speed of the relocation process and avoiding forced relocations. Legislation in the 109th Congress proposed to sunset ONHIR in 2008 and transfer remaining duties to the Secretary. The 109th Congress proposed legislation to sunset ONHIR in 2008 and transfer duties to the Secretary of the Interior. A proviso in ONHIR appropriations language prohibits evicting Navajo families from Hopi lands without providing replacement homes. Negotiations aim to prevent forced relocations as the backlog of relocatees is reduced. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum and research complex with 19 museums, 9 research facilities, and the National Zoo. It had nearly 23 million visitors in 2006 and is funded by federal appropriations and a private trust, with over $979 million in revenue for FY2006. In FY2008, it received $682.6 million in funding, with allocations for Salaries and Expenses, Facilities Capital, and a new Legacy Fund. In FY2008, the Smithsonian received $562.4 million in federal appropriations for Salaries and Expenses, representing a 5% increase from FY2007. The funding was $8.9 million lower than the President's requested level. The growth in staff and expenditures was mainly for the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Concerns over governance and fiscal management led to the resignation of Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence M. Small in 2007. In 2007, the Deputy Secretary and CEO of Smithsonian Business Ventures resigned amid expense investigations. The Smithsonian Board of Regents initiated governance reforms. Funding for facilities falls short of the needed $2.3 billion over ten years. $105.4 million was allocated in FY2008 for renovations. In FY2008, $105.4 million was provided for Facilities Capital, mainly for renovations, security, and health and safety improvements. The Smithsonian Institution also receives income from trust funds, supporting salaries, capital projects, and operations. Non-appropriated revenues fund over a third of operations, with an estimated $284.1 million available for FY2008. The Smithsonian Institution estimates $284.1 million available for operations from various sources. A new account called the Legacy Fund was included in the FY2008 law to address facilities capital repairs, with up to $14.8 million in federal funding provided. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including NEA, NEH, Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities, and IMLS, serves as a primary federal support for arts and humanities. NEA and NEH authorization expired at the end of FY2008. For more information, visit the Smithsonian Institution's website at http://www.si.edu/. The NEA and NEH authorization expired in FY1993, but have been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law. In FY2008, the arts and humanities received $289.4 million, an increase of $23.7 million (9%) over FY2007. The NEA received $144.7 million, an increase of $20.1 million (16%) over FY2007. The House bill proposed a 28% increase for the agency, but floor amendments to cut or eliminate funding were not agreed upon. The FY2008 funding for the arts included $9.3 million for Challenge America and $13.3 million for American Masterpieces. The NEH provides grants for humanities education, research, and preservation, supporting regional humanities centers and state humanities councils. Since 1965, NEH has awarded around 61,000 grants, including a Challenge Grant program. In FY2008, the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) requested $141.4 million, receiving $144.7 million in funding, a 3% increase from FY2007. The two largest grant programs were federal/state partnership grants and We the People Initiative grants, funded at $31.7 million and $15.0 million respectively. We the People grants focus on improving humanities curriculum in schools. The LWCF is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015 for acquiring lands by federal agencies and state/local governments for recreational development. The LWCF has been funded through a grant program administered by the NPS, with money also appropriated for related activities. From FY1965 to FY2007, about $30 billion was credited to the LWCF, with $15 billion appropriated. Annual appropriations have varied, with funding not exceeding $400 million until FY1998. In FY1998, LWCF appropriations exceeded authorized levels for the first time, reaching $969 million from $159 million in FY1997. FY2001 saw a record funding of $1.0 billion, partly due to President Clinton's Lands Legacy Initiative. However, FY2008 saw a reduction to $255.5 million, a 30% decrease from FY2007. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee supported decreases, with the Senate recommending $292.9 million and the House approving $261.9 million. Additionally, an extra $7.7 million was allocated for land appraisals. The FY2008 law allocated $129.7 million for federal land acquisition, a $16.7 million increase from FY2007. The House approved $155.6 million, with an additional $7.8 million for land appraisals not from LWCF. The Senate recommended $152.2 million for land acquisition and $7.8 million for appraisals from LWCF funds. Appropriations for federal land acquisition had more than tripled in the five fiscal years leading up to FY2001. In FY2008, federal land acquisition appropriations declined to $129.7 million, attributed to various factors including funding national priorities like the war on terrorism. For the LWCF program, $24.6 million was appropriated, with a decrease from FY2007 levels. The Senate recommended funding at the FY2007 level, while the House approved a substantial increase. The House approved a substantial increase to $50.0 million for federal land acquisition appropriations in FY2008. The Administration did not request funds for new stateside grants, citing alternative funding sources for parkland acquisition. They requested $1.4 million for program administration, to be derived from the National Recreation and Preservation line item. This move to eliminate funds for new stateside grants is not new, as previous administrations have also proposed similar cuts. The Clinton Administration and Congress agreed to reduce stateside funding by 83% over seven years, from $143.9 million in FY2002 to $24.6 million in FY2007. Future funding from OCS leasing under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 will provide $6.4 million in FY2008 and an estimated $21.8 million through FY2017. Additionally, $101.1 million was allocated in FY2008, with $48.9 million for Cooperative Endangered Species Grants and $52.2 million for other programs. In FY2008, $48.9 million was allocated for Cooperative Endangered Species Grants and $52.2 million for the Forest Legacy Program. The Senate sought $102.9 million from LWCF for these programs, while the House approved $56.3 million for Forest Legacy only. The President requested $313.1 million for 11 other programs, with FY2008 appropriations for these programs being less than in FY2007. The largest portion of the FY2008 LWCF appropriation was for land acquisition, a shift from previous years. The Administration requested $440.6 million for land acquisition in FY2007, but Congress appropriated a smaller amount. Congress provided funds for various programs from FY2006 to FY2008, including non-LWCF funding. Altered natural flows of water in South Florida are attributed to canals, levees, and urban development. In 1996, Congress authorized the Corps to create a plan to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was completed in 1999, with federal involvement authorized by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. WRDA 2000 is considered the key law for Everglades restoration, with appropriations provided for restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem through annual appropriations bills. The DOI agencies receive funds for restoration projects in southern Florida, including CERP and non-CERP activities. Federal and state funding for South Florida ecosystem restoration projects exceeded $7.6 billion from FY1993 to FY2007. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in southern Florida is expected to be $286 million. The Administration requested $235.0 million for DOI and the Corps for Everglades restoration in FY2008. Specific funding amounts for Everglades restoration are generally not identified. The FY2008 law provided $14.3 million for the Modified Water Deliveries Project under NPS construction to improve water deliveries to Everglades National Park. $13.3 million was appropriated for FY2007, and $14.5 million was requested for FY2008. In FY2008, $14.5 million was provided for the Everglades restoration. The House Appropriations Committee requested a progress report on the restoration. Funding for Mod Waters under NPS construction was contingent on matching funds from the Corps. $9.8 million was allocated to the Corps for Mod Waters, raising uncertainty about potential NPS funding cuts. The federal government's commitment to Everglades restoration through CERP is being questioned due to a lack of authorized projects since WRDA 2000. Some believe commitment will be shown through increased federal funding for construction as projects progress. There are differing opinions on whether federal funding should be maintained, increased, or decreased to match state funding levels. The current level of funding for the Modified Water Deliveries Project should be maintained or increased due to escalating costs and project delays. Interior appropriations laws have conditions for funding based on meeting state water quality standards. Funds will be provided unless federal departments/agencies indicate water quality standards are not met. These provisions were enacted due to concerns regarding a Florida state law amending the Everglades Forever Act. The Everglades Forever Act of 1994 was amended in 2003 to address phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. Funding for restoration projects is contingent on meeting water quality standards. More information can be found on the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program and Corps of Engineers websites.
