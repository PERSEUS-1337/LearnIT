    "content": "In 1986, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) due to outdated electronic communications privacy laws. The ECPA governs government and private access to stored online communications, including demands for emails, private posts on social media, stored videos on platforms like YouTube, and cell location information from phone companies. ECPA has faced criticism from technology and privacy advocates in recent years. In recent years, ECPA has faced criticism for not providing adequate privacy safeguards for electronic communications. Reform bills have been introduced in Congress, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2015 (S. 356) and the Email Privacy Act (H.R. 699), which aim to require warrants for emails regardless of storage time and eliminate confusion in lower courts regarding electronic storage definitions. The Online Communications and Geolocation Privacy Act (H.R. 656) and the Email Privacy Act aim to make changes to the SCA, but federal agencies like the SEC are concerned it could hinder their investigations. The Email Privacy Act and ECPA Amendments Act include provisions to address this issue. Additionally, there is ongoing litigation regarding ECPA's extraterritorial reach, and the LEADS Act would require third-party service providers to store data abroad. The LEADS Act would mandate disclosure of U.S. persons' electronic communications held overseas with a warrant. This report outlines ECPA reform, covering its background, current legal framework, data accessible under ECPA, and proposed amendments. Before ECPA in 1986, government access to private electronic communications was governed by the Fourth Amendment and federal wiretap law. In 1967, the Supreme Court issued landmark Fourth Amendment cases, establishing the right to privacy in communications. Congress then enacted the Wiretap Act in 1968 to regulate wiretapping with judicial approval. The Wiretap Act of 1968 regulated wiretapping with judicial approval, covering the interception of actual sounds. However, it did not address digital communications, leading to the introduction of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) in 1985. ECPA aimed to fill the gap in coverage to prevent stifling American technological innovation, protect privacy rights, and ensure admissibility of evidence in criminal prosecutions. The Wiretap Act was updated to include electronic communications, creating rules for pen registers to capture routing information. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) was added to regulate access to stored electronic communications. Law enforcement now relies more on the SCA than real-time interception. ECPA reform has focused on the SCA due to this shift in enforcement practices. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) focuses on providers of electronic communication services and remote computing services. It prohibits sharing customers' communications without consent and allows the government to request disclosure of communications or records. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702(a)(1), a provider of ECS to the public is prohibited from knowingly divulging the contents of a communication in electronic storage. Section 2702(a)(2) also prohibits disclosure of communication carried or maintained by the service, with specific conditions that must be met for protection. Section 2702(a)(3) prohibits a provider of ECS or RCS from disclosing non-content information about a subscriber or customer to any governmental entity. This rule does not apply to the contents of communications covered in previous sections. The SCA prohibits providers from disclosing non-content information to governmental entities, but this rule does not apply to private entities. Exceptions to disclosure include sharing with addressees, for service provision, or in emergencies involving danger. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) requires disclosure of communications in emergencies and sets up a tiered system for disclosure of customer communications and records. Different standards apply depending on the type of record and whether advanced notice is given to the customer. The government may use greater process than necessary, such as a warrant instead of a subpoena. The government can use a warrant or a subpoena under Section 2703 of the Stored Communications Act to access communication content from an ECS provider. If the communication has been stored for 180 days or less, a warrant is required. For communications stored longer than 180 days, a subpoena can be used with notice to the customer. Section 2703(d) orders require specific facts showing relevance to a criminal investigation. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that government access to emails stored for more than 180 days without a warrant is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. The Stored Communications Act allows access to non-content information with a warrant, but the government can also use a subpoena. The government can access non-content information with a warrant or a Section 2703(d) order without customer notice. Basic subscriber information can be obtained through a warrant, Section 2703(d) order, or an administrative subpoena. The definition of \"electronic storage\" is crucial in forced government disclosures under Section 2703. Lower federal courts have differing views on whether opened emails can be considered stored for \"backup purposes\" as defined in subsection (B) of the law. Some courts argue that opened emails do not fall under the definition of \"electronic storage\" as they are no longer in temporary storage. The district court in United States v. Weaver provided a more detailed analysis on this issue, specifically regarding opened emails left on a Hotmail account. The district court in United States v. Weaver analyzed whether emails left solely on a Hotmail account could be considered stored for \"backup purposes.\" Microsoft's servers were deemed to be storing the emails for the purpose of providing storage or processing services. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Theofel v. Farey-Jones held that emails left on a service provider's server after being downloaded could be considered stored for backup purposes, regardless of prior access to the emails. The court's inquiry into the expiration of the underlying message in electronic communications has been questioned for plausibility. ECPA reform proposals aim to expand its reach and rely less on the definition of \"electronic storage.\" Lower federal courts have applied the SCA to various electronic communications, including emails, text messages, social media content, and historical cell site location information, with differing protections based on data storage duration. The ECPA reform proposals aim to eliminate distinctions in how long data is stored and accessed in electronic communications. Different standards apply depending on whether the provider is considered an ECS or RCS, as seen in cases like Quon v. Arch Wireless and Viacom Intern. v. YouTube. Proposed reforms generally require a warrant to access any stored data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) aims to eliminate distinctions in accessing electronic communications and requires a warrant for access. It outlines when the government must provide notice to customers about disclosed communications. ECPA has faced criticism for lacking privacy safeguards in the digital era. In March 2010, technology companies, privacy advocates, and academics urged Senator Leahy to introduce legislation to update federal electronic communications privacy laws. ECPA reform has gained legislative attention in recent Congresses. Senator Leahy proposed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2011, requiring law enforcement to obtain a warrant before accessing any electronic communication content. In the legislative process, various bills related to electronic communications privacy have been introduced in Congress, such as the Email Privacy Act and the ECPA Amendments Act. These bills have garnered support from members of the House and Senate but have not been enacted into law. The Geolocation Protection Act and the Law Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act were introduced in Congress to amend the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). These bills aim to restrict the disclosure of communication content and non-content information to government entities, with exceptions outlined in existing law. Section 3 of the bills amends ECPA by combining legal requirements for ECS and RCS, removing the 180-day rule for email warrants, and clarifying the definition of \"electronic storage.\" This ensures that all emails, regardless of storage duration, require a warrant for access. The bill expands protection to include all messages stored by the provider, allowing access with a warrant or consent. Access to basic subscriber information is also authorized with various legal processes. The proposed legislation would add the authorization to use a civil discovery subpoena as a new authority. It would also require government entities to provide notice to customers when accessing their electronic communications, regardless of whether the content has been stored for more than 180 days or has been opened. Law enforcement would have 10 days to give notice, while other governmental entities would also be required to provide notice. The proposed legislation includes provisions for government entities to provide notice to customers when accessing electronic communications, with law enforcement having 10 days and other entities having 3 days. Applicants for a disclosure order can request a delay in notification, with law enforcement able to delay up to 180 days and other entities up to 90 days. The Online Communication and Geolocation Protection Act would align legal treatment for information held by different services and expand the scope of communications covered. H.R. 656 would require governmental entities to notify customers within three days of accessing their communication contents. Unlike other reform bills, H.R. 656 does not extend access to non-content information with a civil discovery subpoena and does not include a \"rule of construction\" allowing direct access to electronic communication records from a target of an investigation. Some ECPA reform bills have broad support but face opposition from federal agencies concerned about their investigative abilities. Bills like the Email Privacy Act include a \"rule of construction\" to address these concerns. Federal agencies currently have subpoena authority to obtain subscriber information without court approval. Federal agencies have subpoena authority to obtain subscriber information without court approval, including email content held by service providers for over 180 days. Administrative subpoenas require a lower evidentiary standard than warrants and must meet Fourth Amendment criteria for legitimacy, relevance, information possession, and procedural steps. The Supreme Court mandates that sought information be \"reasonably relevant\" and \"sufficiently limited\" for investigations. The relevancy standard for subpoenas is low, with courts quashing them only if there is no reasonable possibility of producing relevant information. Federal district courts must enforce proper subpoenas unless they are plainly incompetent or irrelevant. Agencies are not required to notify targets of investigations when subpoenaing information from third parties. The major ECPA reform bills would require a warrant to obtain electronic communications from service providers, eliminating the use of administrative subpoenas. This may hinder federal agencies, other than the DOJ, from directly obtaining electronic communication contents from providers. The Email Privacy Act, ECPA Amendments Act, and LEADS Act clarify that agencies can use subpoenas to obtain electronic communication contents from individuals, not directly from service providers. Administrative agencies can also seek communication contents from corporations if the emails are from officers or employees. The government can seek electronic communications directly from a corporation if it provides in-house email services to its employees. Legislation now requires a warrant to access electronic communication contents held by service providers, following a court ruling that subscribers have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their emails. The government needs a warrant based on probable cause to access electronic communications. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argues that new legislation requiring warrants would hinder its investigative authority as targets may not provide incriminating communications. The SEC historically relied on Section 2703(b) to obtain electronic communication contents from service providers during investigations. The legislation would prevent the SEC from doing so in the future, weakening its investigative power. The SEC argues that new legislation requiring warrants for electronic communications would hinder its investigative authority as targets may not provide incriminating communications. Privacy advocates question the necessity of obtaining contents directly from service providers, citing alternative methods of obtaining information. The letter argued against the SEC's authority to obtain email contents without a warrant, suggesting alternative methods like enforcing a subpoena on the individual. It raised concerns about potential abuse and violation of attorney-client privilege. The letter proposed an amendment to legislation allowing administrative agencies to use subpoenas to obtain information from third parties. The LEADS Act would require a warrant based on probable cause to obtain communication contents and eliminate the 180-day rule. It includes amendments like notice requirements and authority to use civil discovery subpoenas for non-content information. The Act would allow the government to access electronic communication contents regardless of storage location for U.S. persons. This extension of ECPA's reach is prompted by the Internet's ability to store data in multiple locations. The LEADS Act addresses the issue of storing customer data in multiple locations, including overseas. It aims to clarify whether the government can compel service providers to produce electronic communications held overseas. In a pending case, Microsoft complied with a warrant for non-content information stored in the US but refused to provide content information located in servers in Dublin, Ireland. Microsoft challenged a warrant for data stored in servers in Dublin, Ireland, arguing that US courts lack authority for extraterritorial warrants. The court upheld the warrant, stating that Section 2703(a) warrants are hybrids of subpoenas and traditional warrants, allowing for disclosure of information regardless of location. No extraterritorial search occurs until data arrives in the US. The LEADS Act would clarify the government's authority regarding disclosure of U.S. persons' electronic communications held overseas. It requires third-party service providers to disclose content upon issuance of a warrant, with exceptions if disclosure violates foreign laws. The impact on email privacy is uncertain due to varying legal privacy regimes in other countries and the global data storage capabilities of service providers. The LEADS Act clarifies the government's authority on disclosing U.S. persons' electronic communications held overseas. It raises questions about email privacy for non-U.S. persons and the government's ability to compel disclosure. The LEADS Act clarifies the government's authority on disclosing U.S. persons' electronic communications held overseas. It raises questions about email privacy for non-U.S. persons and the government's ability to compel disclosure. The broad privacy protections in Section 2702 may prevent providers from disclosing non-U.S. persons' communications stored overseas, as Section 2703 does not authorize the government to obtain a warrant for this. The LEADS Act's focus on U.S. persons could suggest that non-U.S. persons' communications are not covered, but there is debate on this interpretation. The LEADS Act lacks authorization for the government to obtain a warrant to compel disclosure of non-U.S. persons' communications held overseas. The privacy protections of Section 2702 do not apply to such contents, allowing the government to seek them through other means. The \"presumption against extraterritorial application\" of U.S. law limits the reach of statutes without clear indication of extraterritorial application. The question of whether an ECPA warrant can authorize law enforcement seizure abroad is currently under litigation in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. If litigation in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determines that the privacy protections of Section 2702 do not apply abroad, the government could use alternative authorities to compel disclosure of non-U.S. persons' communications held overseas, such as a traditional subpoena. This issue, along with other interpretive questions from ECPA reform, may need to be resolved through legal proceedings."
