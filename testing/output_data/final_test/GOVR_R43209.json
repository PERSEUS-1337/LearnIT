    "content": "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is involved in water resource projects such as commercial navigation, flood risk management, and ecosystem restoration. Congress authorizes Corps activities through Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs) and studies are conducted in response to project-specific authorizations. The outcome is a Chief's Report that recommends project construction to Congress. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recommends project construction to Congress based on studies conducted in response to project-specific authorizations. Factors like federal funding availability and congressional authorizations impact the time it takes to move from project planning to construction completion. Congressional focus is on expediting project development activities before a Chief's Report can be submitted for project construction recommendation. During project planning, the Corps must complete various studies, reports, and evaluations to meet environmental requirements. Some groups are concerned about delays in project delivery due to these requirements. This report assesses the impact of meeting environmental requirements on project delivery. The report discusses the array of environmental requirements for civil works projects, how Congress established these requirements, and how the Corps integrates compliance into project planning. It also addresses issues that led to the enactment of environmental requirements, their impact on project planning, and the Corps' evaluation and compliance processes. The Corps evaluates the impacts of civil works projects and compliance requirements before submitting a Chief's Report to Congress. The project development process is complex, focusing on environmental requirements during planning. Other factors affecting project delivery, such as federal funding availability and congressional approvals, are not detailed in this report. For more information on these issues, refer to CRS Report R41243. The Army Corps of Engineers focuses on navigation, flood risk management, and ecosystem restoration projects. These projects can have adverse impacts like flood damage, habitat destruction, and water quality issues. The Corps' civil works mission now includes ecosystem restoration efforts. The Army Corps of Engineers expanded its civil works mission to include ecosystem restoration projects to address adverse effects from past projects. This involves actions like restoring natural conditions, improving fish passage, and wetland hydrology. Congress directed the Corps to implement environmental requirements to reduce potential impacts and identify measures to minimize unavoidable impacts. The Army Corps of Engineers expanded its civil works mission to include ecosystem restoration projects to address adverse effects from past projects. Congress directed the Corps to implement environmental requirements to reduce potential impacts and identify measures to minimize unavoidable impacts. During planning, the Corps is obligated to conduct specific studies, reports, and evaluations to ensure that environmental impacts are considered, evaluate economic and public safety benefits, and identify opportunities to protect the environment. Compliance requirements will be identified based on project-specific impacts and the degree to which they affect air or water quality, or natural and cultural resources. The Corps of Engineers must evaluate and describe the environmental impacts of a project before recommending it for construction authorization. These impacts can affect air or water quality, as well as natural or cultural resources protected by Congress. The Corps may need to consult with outside agencies for review and compliance with environmental requirements. The Corps of Engineers evaluates environmental impacts of projects to ensure compliance with requirements. Debates often arise over the time taken for compliance with federal agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Obtaining necessary federal reviews for civil works projects can be complex and resource-intensive. The Corps of Engineers evaluates environmental impacts of projects to ensure compliance with requirements that may apply due to social and environmental concerns. Key requirements for project planning and implementation were enacted in the 1960s and 1970s as national priorities shifted towards addressing human impacts on water resources development. In the 1960s, Congress responded to public awareness of human impacts on the environment by enacting laws affecting project planning, development, and funding to protect air, water, and natural resources. These laws aim to minimize adverse impacts and ensure environmental protection for federally funded projects, including Corps water resource projects. In the mid-1960s, Congress enacted laws broadening Corps planning requirements to include evaluating project impacts on environmental quality. The Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 created the Water Resources Council and established coordinated planning processes for water resource conservation and development. The Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 broadened Corps planning requirements to include evaluating project impacts on environmental quality. The law also mandated the establishment of principles, standards, and procedures for water and land resources projects. A WRC Task Force specified that water resources agencies should identify impacts in national economic development, environmental quality, regional economic development, and social well-being. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts and involve the public in the decision-making process. The Corps uses the NEPA compliance process to identify project impacts on natural or cultural resources, air, or water quality. The Corps is required to coordinate its NEPA analysis with agencies having jurisdiction over affected resources. Construction of major waterworks declined in the late 1960s due to changing priorities and increasing costs. Congressional concern over environmental impacts led to laws like the National Historic Preservation Act, Endangered Species Act, and Clean Water Act in the late 1960s and 1970s. By the mid-1970s, the Corps began identifying project impacts. The Corps began integrating environmental impact assessments into project planning in the mid-1970s, complying with NEPA and the Water Resources Planning Act. Congressional authorization for civil works projects has been provided through Water Resources Development Acts since 1974, with directives to manage environmental issues. For example, WRDA 1986 directed the Corps to improve fish habitat affected by water resources facilities. The Water Resources Development Acts (WRDA) from 1990 to 2000 authorized the Corps to address environmental protection and restoration as a primary mission, including projects for aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection. This included using dredged materials for habitat creation and restoration, such as wetlands. Additionally, WRDA 2000 approved the Florida Everglades restoration program. The Water Resources Development Acts (WRDA) from 1990 to 2000 authorized the Corps to address environmental protection and restoration as a primary mission, including projects for aquatic ecosystem restoration and protection. WRDA 2000 (P.L. 106-541) approved the Florida Everglades restoration program, marking the agency's first multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort of this type. WRDA 2007 (P.L. 110-114) included \"Project Streamlining\" requirements and directed the Secretary of the Army to develop a coordinated review process for water resource project development. Section 2031 of WRDA 2007 amended national Water Resources Planning policy to prioritize economic development, environmental protection, and sustainable development in water resource projects. This policy shift reflects a broader focus beyond traditional \"flood control\" and \"economic development\" objectives. The water resources development process has evolved to consider measures for protecting the environment and mitigating damage, reflecting changing needs identified by Congress since the 1960s. The Corps' civil works program is led by a civilian Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, overseen by a military Chief of Engineers who reports on civil works matters to the ASA(CW). The Corps' civil works responsibilities are organized under eight Major Subordinate Commands (MSCs), further divided into 38 Districts. Project development process begins with local identification of water resources problem. Congress authorization is required for Corps to study the issue. Federal funding is needed for study initiation. Not all authorized studies receive appropriations immediately. The Corps' planning process starts with a reconnaissance study to assess federal interest and nonfederal support. If recommended, a feasibility study follows to propose solutions to the water resources problem, including economic, environmental, and social impacts. The Corps' planning process involves formulating alternative plans, investigating feasibility, conducting cost-benefit analyses, and evaluating environmental impacts. Feasibility reports are reviewed and approved at the Headquarters level before the Chief of Engineers makes final decisions. The Corps' planning process involves formulating alternative plans, investigating feasibility, conducting cost-benefit analyses, and evaluating environmental impacts. Feasibility reports are reviewed and approved at the Headquarters level. The Chief of Engineers uses these documents to produce a Chief's Report, supporting the recommendation to Congress for project authorization. The Chief's Report is then submitted for policy compliance review to ASA(CW) and OMB, with informational copies sent to Congress. This process is part of the four phases of project development and 21 distinct steps identified by the Corps. Congress plays a crucial role in project development by authorizing studies, appropriating funds, and providing oversight. Only a small percentage of Corps studies on water resources problems lead to project construction. The Corps authorizations exceed annual appropriations, leading to competition for funds among authorized activities. Budget requests focus on projects near completion, limiting funding for new studies and projects. Few new Corps projects receive funding, with the majority of authorized projects currently unfunded. The majority of studies and construction projects authorized in WRDA 2007 are currently unfunded and cannot proceed without appropriated funds. The Corps is obligated to assess projects' economic, social, and environmental impacts during planning, following procedures outlined in the Planning Guidance Notebook. Environmental requirements are integrated into the planning process as projects are developed. Environmental evaluation and compliance requirements are integrated into the planning process to ensure Corps compliance with NEPA, the Water Resources Planning Act, and other federal environmental laws. This report addresses two groups of environmental requirements: those applicable to water resources development and those related to project-specific impacts. Activities are undertaken to ensure compliance with these requirements. The Corps integrates environmental evaluation and compliance requirements into the planning process to ensure compliance with federal environmental laws. This includes activities during project design, construction, and operation to address project-specific impacts and ensure compliance with applicable requirements. Compliance continues through final project stages. The Water Resources Planning Act established planning requirements for federal water resource projects, including those by the Corps. Congress mandates evaluating environmental quality measures for project effects. Corps-specific planning requirements are outlined in Title 33 of the U.S. Code, addressing matters to be included in planning. The Water Resources Planning Act mandates evaluating environmental quality measures for federal water resource projects, including those by the Corps. Specific planning requirements in Title 33 of the U.S. Code include addressing the quality of the total environment, preservation of cultural and historical values, reconnaissance studies, contents of feasibility reports, and evaluating benefits and costs of environmental measures. The Corps must identify requirements from federal laws, regulations, and policies during the planning process, using the NEPA process to ensure compliance before project construction. This is outlined in various Corps documents such as Engineer Regulations, Circulars, and Pamphlets. The Corps ensures compliance with federal laws, regulations, and policies during the planning process by considering environmental impacts alongside economic and community benefits before making final decisions on projects. NEPA documents, such as Environmental Impact Statements, are prepared to demonstrate this consideration. The NEPA process involves preparing Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) for major projects, which are issued in draft and final stages. A Supplemental EIS may be required if significant time passes after the final EIS. The process is completed with the issuance of a final record of decision (ROD) by the agency. Environmental Assessments (EA) are prepared for projects with uncertain impact levels, leading to either the need for an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI). Maintenance or modifications to Corps facilities may also require an EA resulting in a FONSI. Both EIS and EA must include a statement of purpose and need for the action. An Environmental Assessment (EA) must include a statement of purpose and need for an action, description of alternatives, analysis of effects, and compliance with additional environmental requirements for projects. The Corps is obligated to identify and evaluate reasonable alternatives during the planning process. If a project requires an EIS or EA, it indicates impacts that need additional environmental compliance. The Corps may need data or analysis from state, tribal, or federal agencies to determine a project's impact on natural or cultural resources. Compliance requirements may trigger consultations or approvals from other agencies. The Corps may need permits or licenses from other agencies for certain projects, such as those impacting endangered species habitat. Consultations with agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may be necessary to minimize harm to species or determine restoration measures. Selected federal statutes frequently apply to civil works projects, subject to regulation by outside agencies. The Corps may need permits or licenses from other agencies for projects impacting endangered species habitat. Consultations with agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may be necessary to minimize harm to species or determine restoration measures. Federal statutes often apply to civil works projects, regulated by outside agencies. Outside agency consultations are required to coordinate project development and implement mitigation measures for resource protection. Congress recognized the need to protect fish and wildlife in water resource development as early as 1934. Most laws affecting water resources development were enacted between 1966 and 1973, establishing requirements for federal actions in response to public concern over environmental impacts. The NEPA process coordinates compliance with environmental requirements like the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act, ensuring adherence to project-specific regulations. The Corps identifies impact-specific environmental compliance requirements within the NEPA process, including coordination with outside agencies and obtaining necessary permits for project implementation. Compliance with applicable laws and executive orders is summarized in the draft NEPA document. The Corps identifies impact-specific environmental compliance requirements within the NEPA process, including coordination with outside agencies and obtaining necessary permits for project implementation. Summary of any outside agency coordination completed or under way, required pursuant to the applicable environmental law, must be included in the final NEPA document. The chart below lists activities that occur during the 21 steps of project development identified by the Corps, illustrating key processes, procedures, and decision points associated with environmental evaluation and compliance requirements during planning. Timeliness of Corps delivery has been scrutinized by Congress, with legislative proposals aimed at streamlining project development processes. The Corps focuses on streamlining project development processes, particularly the NEPA process, which is unique to water resources development. It is challenging to determine the extent to which NEPA delays projects due to the complex issues involved. Compliance with various congressional directives and the Endangered Species Act may overlap with Corps-specific activities, making it difficult to measure the impact of individual environmental requirements. Actions to comply with the Endangered Species Act may overlap with Corps-specific requirements for project mitigation. It can be challenging to pinpoint a specific time frame in project development solely dedicated to environmental compliance activities. Delays in completing consultations or obtaining approvals from other agencies have been a point of scrutiny. Delays in project development may occur due to disagreements with federal or state agencies, but data on systemic delays are limited. The time it takes the Corps to move through project steps varies based on project complexity and size. Delays in project development can be caused by disagreements with federal or state agencies. The timing of project delivery is significantly influenced by Congress authorizing studies and project construction, as well as the timing of appropriations. Limited funding for new studies and feasibility phases has led to delays in project initiation and progression. Delays in project development can be caused by disagreements with federal or state agencies. Moving from reconnaissance to feasibility phase may take years or never occur. Feasibility report is transmitted to Congress for construction authorization. Congress authorizes most Corps projects in Water Resources Development Acts, but enactment has been infrequent. Only two WRDAs enacted in the past 13 years. Corps can continue with preconstruction engineering and design activities while waiting for authorization. Construction funds are sought in annual Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act after receiving congressional authorization. The initiation of new construction projects has been curtailed due to competition for inclusion in annual appropriations. Many projects authorized in WRDA 2007 have not received construction funding. Funding priorities have focused on existing projects, with environmental requirements often causing delays in project delivery. Consultations with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act may cause delays in project timelines, but compliance can be demonstrated alongside other project requirements. Delays are project-specific and may not be avoidable by changing procedures. Stakeholders are concerned about the time it takes to plan and start construction on water resource projects, prompting calls for a reevaluation of planning requirements and processes. Some suggest reevaluating current requirements and processes for a more efficient project review process. The challenge lies in determining which steps can be streamlined or eliminated.
