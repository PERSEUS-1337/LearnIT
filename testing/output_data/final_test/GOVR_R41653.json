    "content": "President Barack Obama submitted a request for military construction appropriations for FY2012 to Congress on February 14, 2011. This request overlapped with the congressional process for FY2011 appropriations due to the lack of regular appropriations bills passed by the 111th Congress. The military construction appropriation, part of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, funds new military facilities for new weapons systems. The military construction funds cover the building of new facilities for weapons systems, redeployment of forces, improving living and working conditions, reducing operating costs, and enhancing productivity. It also includes funding for NATO Security Investment Program for collective defense facilities. The Family Housing Improvement Fund (FHIP) finances DOD's portion of public-private partnerships for military family housing privatization. The Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF) assists DOD family homeowners affected by base closures or housing market crises. The Secretary of Defense terminated temporary eligibility for the housing crisis in late 2010. A final subaccount funds construction of facilities at chemical munitions depots for demilitarization and disposal of banned nerve gases. Construction for this program is nearing completion. Titles II and III of the bill fund benefits programs and operations of the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies. Title IV is a new appropriation provision dedicated to military. Title IV is a new appropriation provision dedicated to military construction supporting overseas contingency operations (OCO), such as ongoing ground force deployments to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Obama Administration has moved this funding into the regular appropriations process, highlighting it through the designation of \"Title IV (OCO)\" military construction. FY2011 military construction is funded under continuing appropriations, allowing DOD and military departments to spend funds at the same rate as last enacted in a regular appropriation bill. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) included the most recent four-year military construction appropriation. In the 112th Congress, a full-year continuing appropriations bill was introduced as Division B of H.R. 1473, passed by the House on April 14, 2011. The President has requested appropriations for FY2012. President Obama has requested $14.8 billion in military construction and family housing new budget authority for FY2012, a reduction of $9.9 billion from FY2010. The decrease is mainly due to lower BRAC costs. This reduction extends across most military construction and family housing subaccounts. The President's FY2012 budget request for military construction and family housing is $14.8 billion, a $9.9 billion reduction from FY2010. The request includes $1.3 billion less for active and reserve component construction, $564 million less for family housing accounts, and a significant cut in chemical demilitarization construction. Additionally, there is virtually no OCO military construction funding requested. $9.3 billion is allocated for projects within the United States, $1.8 billion for projects outside the U.S., and $3.7 billion for unspecified or future planning and design purposes. The requested funding for military construction in FY2012 includes major projects, planning, operating expenses, BRAC, and property leases. The U.S. Northern Command's area includes the contiguous U.S., Alaska, Canada, and Mexico. Key issues involve personnel relocation and troop redeployment within the U.S. due to BRAC recommendations. The defense agencies and military departments have conducted a $35 billion construction and movement program over the past six years, including the 2005 BRAC round and the Global Defense Posture Realignment. Additionally, plans are in place to permanently move a Navy aircraft carrier from Norfolk, VA, to Mayport, FL for strategic reasons. The Navy is considering building a second facility at Mayport to service a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier due to concerns about vulnerability. Congress has not yet approved the $580 million project, and the FY2012 request does not include funding for the needed facilities. Other military construction funding issues include the disestablishment of Joint Forces Command and the Navy's Second Fleet Headquarters. The closure of organizations in the Pacific region is not considered under the military base closure law. U.S. Pacific Command covers a vast area including China, Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Major force movements and construction projects are ongoing in the region, with Japan undertaking new air facilities construction. Japan is constructing a new air facility in Okinawa for U.S. Marine Corps units, with plans to return the existing facility to Japanese control. Approximately 8,000 Marines will be relocated to Guam, with Japan contributing $6 billion of the $10 billion needed. Congress has criticized the pace of planning for the move. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended deferring $464.6 million in construction funding for overseas projects in Guam, Europe, Korea, and other locations pending a DOD review of global posture. U.S. ground forces in Korea are being concentrated into two large military communities centered on Osan Air Base and Camp Humphreys. The U.S. European Command (EUCOM) oversees military operations in Europe, Russia, Israel, Greenland, and Iceland. During the Cold War, most U.S. forces stationed overseas were in the EUCOM area. After the Cold War, there were significant reductions in military garrisons in Western and Southern Europe, particularly in West Germany. During the Cold War, U.S. military garrisons in West Germany saw significant reductions in size. By 2010, there were approximately 79,000 U.S. servicemembers in Europe, with 53,900 located in Germany. Military personnel in Germany are being consolidated into two large communities at Kaiserslautern and Grafenw\u00f6hr-Vilseck.\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u306a\u6226\u95d8\u529b\u306f\u3001EUCOM\u306e\u9678\u8ecd\u90e8\u968a\u306e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u304c\u3001GDPR\u306e\u4e00\u74b0\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u57fa\u5730\u306b\u518d\u914d\u7f6e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u4e88\u5b9a\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002 The Secretary of Defense reconsidered the movement of two brigade combat teams as part of the GDPR. The President's FY2012 request includes funding for construction in Germany, Army construction of facilities, DOD Education Agency's request for school construction, Tricare Management Agency's plan to replace a military medical center, and the Air Force's request for a new airman's dormitory. The Air Force is requesting $35 million for a new airman's dormitory at Ramstein Air Base, and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is asking for $2.4 million to upgrade its facility near Stuttgart. AFRICOM was activated in 2008, shifting military affairs responsibility to the new command. Funds were requested for the construction of two headquarters buildings at Camp Lemonier, Djibouti in FY2011. The Senate Committee on Appropriations noted DOD's lack of a report on future operations at Camp Lemonier and CJTF-HOA, recommending denial of funds for a separate task force headquarters. The President's FY2012 request includes $44 million for housing construction and $45 million for facility improvements at the camp. AFRICOM headquarters may potentially move to the Norfolk, VA, area from Germany. CENTCOM's area of responsibility includes Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia, with significant U.S. military operations focused there since 2002. The FY2012 request for appropriations includes $80 million for construction at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Congress has annually renewed a temporary authority for military construction in support of overseas operations, with funding varying over the years. The National Defense Authorization Act, 2011 limited funding to $100 million for construction in Afghanistan, emphasizing support for temporary military operations. Recent legislation has softened restrictions on construction funding, with exemptions for long-term presence in Afghanistan. The CRS Report R41232 discusses continuing appropriations that have funded federal government operations through FY2011. The first bill, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 111-242), provided funding through December 3, 2010, with six other bills extending funding through March 4, 2011. Adjustments were made to appropriations accounts from their prorated FY2010 levels. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 made adjustments to military construction accounts, notably reducing the BRAC 2005 account from $8.0 billion to $2.4 billion. Additionally, it included restrictions on the use of funds for new production or increased production rates above FY2010 levels. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 authorized appropriations for military construction projects, but DOD interpreted a section as a barrier to new FY2011 construction. No new construction has been initiated in FY2011, despite subsequent appropriations. The House passed H.R. 1, a full-year continuing appropriation, setting new FY2011 appropriations for military construction and family housing accounts. The House passed a full-year continuing appropriation bill for military construction and family housing accounts, but it failed in the Senate. A second bill was introduced in the House for military construction funding. DOD is expected to spend funds at a rate similar to FY2010 levels until a final FY2011 appropriation is enacted. The President submitted the FY2012 appropriation request for military construction and family housing to Congress. The President submitted his FY2012 appropriation request for military construction and family housing to Congress on February 14, 2011, with a 26.2% reduction in funding compared to FY2011. The reduction is mainly due to less funding needed for BRAC 2005 and a reduced request for active component military construction, particularly from the Navy and Marine Corps account. No funds were requested for the Overseas Contingency Operations construction account, a significant decrease from the previous year. The FY2012 military construction and family housing appropriation request included a substantial reduction in construction funding compared to FY2011. Questions arise regarding the impact of delayed appropriations on construction planning, efficiency in obligating funds, and potential limitations due to government debt. Additionally, concerns about the effects of a government shutdown on military construction projects are raised. The potential effects of a government shutdown on military construction projects and the limitations imposed by the prohibition on congressionally directed spending (\"earmarks\") on Congress's ability to support the military are key concerns. Additionally, the question of whether the Department of Defense should assist local jurisdictions in handling the increased demands from a larger military community size and the necessary legislation for such assistance are also important considerations."
