Congress finds that the American burying beetle was listed as an endangered species in 1989, with only 2 known populations remaining. The cause of the species' decline is unknown. The American burying beetle was listed as endangered in 1989 with only 2 known populations remaining, one in Eastern Oklahoma and one on an island off the coast of Rhode Island. The Rhode Island population was estimated to be around 520 beetles, while the Oklahoma population had fewer than 12 beetles. The Service has not conducted a range-wide population survey since 1985. In 1991, a recovery plan was published to protect and maintain these populations. To reconsider the listing status, the Service must identify 3 beetle populations. The American burying beetle was listed as endangered in 1989 with only 2 known populations remaining, one in Eastern Oklahoma and one on an island off the coast of Rhode Island. The Service identified 4 geographical areas for reestablished populations, including the Midwest, Great Lakes, Southeast, and Northeast regions. In 2008, a 5-year review determined criteria for reconsidering the listing status of the beetle. The American burying beetle has been discovered in the Midwest region, exceeding the numerical target in the recovery area. One of the four geographic recovery areas has met the criteria for reclassification, but the species remains extirpated in most of its historic range. The American burying beetle population in Nebraska has grown to over 3,000 beetles, one of the largest known populations. In Oklahoma, the population has also increased significantly since being listed as an endangered species in 1989. The Service believes the American burying beetle should remain listed as endangered. The American burying beetle exists in 45 of the 77 counties in Oklahoma, with only 4 counties having a known population when it was listed as endangered in 1989. Oklahoma State officials are concerned about the limited mitigation options for developers. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation Director has not received a response to the request for an update to the recovery plan submitted in 2013. The American burying beetle is being considered for delisting, following a similar process as the gray wolf. Several states have populations of the beetle, and the history of the gray wolf's delisting could serve as a model for the beetle's delisting in the Midwest region. The gray wolf was removed from the endangered species list in several states due to healthy population levels, with Wyoming being delisted later. The American burying beetle is also being considered for delisting, following a similar process as the gray wolf. The official policy states that the Service evaluates the probability of a species being lost to extinction within its known existing range, not a hypothetical historic range. If the American burying beetle were reconsidered for listing as an endangered species, it likely would not be eligible as known populations are not in danger and are expanding. The American burying beetle's historic range is based on outdated data, making it difficult to assess the current population status. There is uncertainty about whether the population increase is due to improved detection methods or actual growth. The American burying beetle has proven more resilient than originally believed, making the decision to list it as an endangered species indefensible under the Endangered Species Act. The American burying beetle will not be listed as a threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act, despite previous considerations."
