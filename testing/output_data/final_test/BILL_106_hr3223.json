    "content": "The Act is titled the \"William H. Gray, III, College Completion Challenge Grant Program of 1999\" and authorizes a new chapter in the Higher Education Act of 1965 for the program. Congress finds that students from low-income families are more likely to leave higher education without a degree, contributing to the educational and income gap between disadvantaged and affluent students. The Federal Government should expand its role in student financial assistance programs to address the lack of persistence in baccalaureate degree completion. Grant assistance is crucial for students' degree attainment. Factors like delayed entry into postsecondary education, low GPA, and working full-time contribute to students dropping out of 4-year institutions. Most college dropouts occur within the first 2 years, especially among at-risk students. Those who receive targeted academic support services are more likely to complete their degrees. Intensive academic summer programs for incoming first-year students from disadvantaged backgrounds are crucial for improving retention rates. The program aims to assist at-risk students in higher education to stay in school until they obtain baccalaureate degrees, particularly those who are economically disadvantaged. Grants are awarded to eligible institutions to cover program costs for a duration of 3 years. \"Institutional eligibility for grants under this chapter requires meeting specific requirements and awarding baccalaureate or associate degrees. Associate degree-granting institutions can apply as part of a consortium with baccalaureate degree-granting institutions. An institution can receive up to two grants under this chapter. The application process is outlined in section 408D.\" \"In order to receive a grant under this chapter, eligible applicants must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating prior commitment to the program's purposes. The Federal share of program costs cannot exceed 50%, with matching funds required from non-Federal sources.\" The Secretary may establish matching requirements for consortia of institutions eligible for waivers. Eligible institutions must coordinate activities with other programs and not duplicate services. Funds should supplement, not replace, existing programs. \"Authorized activities under SEC. 408E may include establishing matching requirements for consortia of eligible institutions, coordinating activities with other programs, and ensuring funds supplement existing programs.\" An eligible institution receiving a grant under this chapter must use it to provide services to students at risk of leaving their programs without degrees, especially economically disadvantaged students. This includes implementing an intensive summer program for incoming first-year students or those in their second or third year, with a strong commitment to student retention. The institution must use the grant to provide student support services, including peer tutoring, mentoring programs, assistance with admissions and financial aid, and course selection for students in their first 2 years of postsecondary education. Grants are also provided to students in their first 2 years to support their academic journey. The institution must use the grant to provide student support services, including peer tutoring, mentoring programs, assistance with admissions and financial aid, and course selection for students in their first 2 years of postsecondary education. Recipients of funds under this chapter may serve high-risk students who have completed their first 2 years of postsecondary education if they demonstrate a commitment to meeting the needs of all eligible first- and second-year students. The Secretary may establish minimum student grant award levels by regulation. The Secretary may establish minimum student grant award levels for institutions to provide grants under subsection (a)(3), considering different costs of attendance. If the Secretary does not set minimum levels, institutions must demonstrate that their grant amounts are appropriate and impactful in addressing student persistence issues. SEC. 408F states that grants provided to students from eligible institutions under this chapter will not affect their need for financial assistance, with the total amount not exceeding the student's cost of attendance. SEC. 408G authorizes $35,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and additional funds for the following years. The Secretary may reserve up to 1% for program evaluation. The amendment made by section 2 will be effective on October 1, 1999."
