    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Land-Based Marine Debris Reduction Act\". Congress declares the United States' economic and strategic interest in a healthy ocean and marine ecosystems. They note that land-based sources contribute to 80% of litter in the oceans, leading to detrimental effects on wildlife, ecosystems, navigation, public health, and safety. Successful solid waste management involves creative use of the entire hierarchy, including waste reduction, recycling, waste-to-energy, and landfilling. Recycling is crucial in reducing municipal waste and marine debris, saving national energy and material resources. Comprehensive recycling programs are the most cost-effective way to meet recycling goals and reduce marine debris. To achieve recycling goals and reduce marine debris, responsibility should be shared by all consumers of recyclable goods, including households, municipalities, and commercial establishments. National goals for waste reduction and recycling include no increase in solid waste sent to landfills above current levels, with a target of recycling 50% of municipal solid waste by 2020 and 65% by 2030. Additionally, the goal is to prevent an increase in marine debris flow into the ocean. An annual report will track progress towards these goals. The Administrator is required to annually report to Congress on the amount and composition of municipal solid waste generated in the US, waste entering the ocean, waste management methods, progress towards waste reduction goals, and recommendations for achieving these goals. The first report must be submitted within 18 months of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a report on primary leakage paths of marine debris into the ocean is mandated. The Administrator must report to Congress on the primary pathways of marine debris entering the ocean, including consumer discards and infrastructural leaks, along with best practices to reduce these pathways at different levels of government. Additionally, there are requirements for products and packaging. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, will develop a list of commonly discarded products and packaging, determining the percentage of recovered materials, source reduction efficiency, recycling rates, and more for each category. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, will develop a list of commonly discarded products and packaging. This list will include the percentage of products entering the ocean or being littered, as well as the environmental effects compared to alternatives. Categories identified will be targeted for regulatory action. The Administrator will target categories with high life cycle impact for regulatory action, considering environmental impacts, material content, recyclability, and waste stream volume. Regulatory actions may include requiring manufacturers to use recovered materials in products. The Administrator may phase in regulatory actions for requiring recovered material content in products if deemed necessary for economic reasons. SEC. 7. PACKAGING STANDARDS. The Administrator and the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with various stakeholders, will develop voluntary packaging standards focusing on materials and recyclability. Packaging meeting these standards can use a compliance label for promotion. SEC. 8. REPORT ON LANDFILL CLOSURES. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress within 1 year of this Act's enactment, analyzing the costs and challenges faced by States and local communities when closing landfills. The report will also provide recommendations for Federal assistance, including technical guidance and funds. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator\" as the head of the EPA, \"marine debris\" as human-created waste in coastal or marine areas, \"recovered material\" as defined in the Solid Waste Disposal Act, and \"recycled\" as reusing or reclaiming materials from solid waste.
