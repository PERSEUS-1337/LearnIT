    "content": "The Impact Aid program, administered by the U.S. Department of Education, compensates local educational agencies for financial burdens resulting from federal activities like federal land ownership and enrollment of children of parents who work or live on federal land. This compensation is provided because these activities prevent LEAs from collecting property taxes, despite being obligated to provide free public education to these children. Impact Aid, specifically Section 8003(b) payments, compensates LEAs for enrolling \"federally connected\" children, such as those living on federal property or Indian lands. In FY2014, these payments made up 89.3% of all funds for the program. This report focuses mainly on Section 8003(b) payments. The Appendix briefly describes other payments under the Impact Aid program. This report explores options for adjusting the timing of Impact Aid appropriations for Section 8003(b) activities. It discusses funding alternatives like forward funding and advance appropriations, analyzing their impact on the appropriations process once fully implemented. The curr_chunk discusses the appropriations actions required for changes in the Impact Aid program, specifically for Section 8003(b) activities serving federally connected children. These children include those living on Indian lands, federal land, low-rent public housing, and children of Armed Forces members. The report analyzes the impact of funding alternatives like forward funding on the appropriations process. The presence of federally connected children can strain LEAs without a proportional increase in tax revenue. To qualify for Section 8003(b) payments, an LEA must have 400 such children or 3% of ADA. Only 10% of public school districts meet these criteria, with $1.151 billion allocated in FY2014, comprising 89.3% of Impact Aid funding. These payments are unrestricted in use, unlike other federal education programs. The federal government provides Section 8003(b) funds for local education expenditures, which can also be used for capital expenses and are not limited to federally connected children. Impact Aid payments lack specific educational goals, leading to minimal accountability requirements. Federal program funding is typically available at the start of the fiscal year, beginning on October 1st. The Impact Aid program receives budget year appropriations from the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill. Section 8003(b) payments are delayed due to the use of continuing resolutions instead of enacting budget year appropriations acts before the fiscal year starts. The timing of federal funds provided through Impact Aid causes issues for LEAs in budget planning. Delays in full allocation of funds occur during short-term continuing resolutions. Impact Aid-dependent LEAs are more affected by funding decreases than those under other federal education grant programs. The timing of federal funds through Impact Aid causes budget planning issues for LEAs, especially those heavily reliant on this funding. Funding reductions can create financial difficulties, with Impact Aid funding being immediately reduced during the 2012-2013 school year. This uncertainty can be mitigated by providing appropriations in advance of the school year they will be used. LEAs face budget planning issues due to the timing of federal funds through Impact Aid. Providing advance appropriations can help mitigate funding reductions and financial difficulties for LEAs heavily reliant on this funding. The Impact Aid Section 8003(b) payment is the only K-12 program administered by ED that does not receive advance appropriations or forward funding. The Impact Aid programs have historically received funding through appropriations acts since 1968, but currently, no such appropriations are being provided. It is crucial for federal, state, and local officers to have advance notice of available financial assistance for education activities. While Impact Aid payments could be provided through forward funding or advance appropriations, it is assumed that any changes in appropriations would only affect the timing. Advance appropriations are enacted one or more fiscal years prior to becoming available, affecting Section 8003(b) payments. They have been provided for various programs, including education, Veteran's Health Administration, and Rental Assistance Programs, to avoid funding gaps or reliance on current appropriations. Some advocate for advance appropriations to avoid funding gaps and enable better planning, while others argue that forecasting program needs in advance may be limited. Forward funds are enacted in advance but become available in the last quarter of the budget year. Forward funding for elementary and secondary education programs allows funds to be available from July 1, 2015, or later, through the following fiscal year. This aligns federal appropriations with the school districts' fiscal year, running from July 1 to June 30. Forward funding differs from advance appropriations as it provides funds during the summer for costs in the following fiscal year, while advance appropriations are available in the fall of that year. At the program level, there is little difference between providing funds in July or October for elementary and secondary education programs. Budget enforcement rules impose limits on discretionary spending each fiscal year through statutory and procedural mechanisms. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021, while the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allocates budget authority under the Appropriations Committee. The 302(a) and 302(b) allocations, along with statutory discretionary spending limits, are enforced during floor consideration and after enactment through sequestration. Appropriations amounts are scored based on their period of availability for budget enforcement purposes. Forward funding and advance appropriations are scored against specific budget years. Advance appropriations are scored against the limits on appropriations that apply the first fiscal year they are available for obligation, not the budget year of the bill in which they are enacted. This allows for budget enforcement to occur in the following fiscal year, separate from the spending decisions for that year. Since FY2001, House and Senate procedural limits have been imposed to address concerns about avoiding budget year limits with advance appropriations. These limits specify accounts and cap amounts for advance appropriations. For FY2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 restricted advance appropriations to $28.582 billion for specific accounts. The Senate allows unlimited advance appropriations for various programs including Special Education, Career, Technical, and Adult Education, Payment to Postal Service, Tenant-based Rental Assistance, and Project-based Rental Assistance. Different scenarios are considered for Impact Aid Section 8003 (b) payments, such as forward funding, advance appropriations, or a combination of both. This approach is similar to funding for other federal education programs like Title I-A Grants to Local Educational Agencies. The curr_chunk discusses the potential impact of forward funding and advance appropriations on grants to Local Educational Agencies authorized by the ESEA or Grants to States authorized under Part B of IDEA. It considers the implications for the annual appropriations process, transition fiscal year actions, and budget process issues. The ESEA would not need to be amended for Section 8003(b) payments to receive forward funding or advance appropriations. The curr_chunk discusses the possibility of forward funding or advance appropriations for Section 8003(b) payments in the Impact Aid account, shifting funds availability from October to July to support upcoming school years. The curr_chunk discusses the potential transition to forward funding for the Impact Aid program, requiring double-funding in the transition year to support school activities for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years. The potential transition to forward funding for the Impact Aid program would require double-funding in the transition year to support school activities for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years. Otherwise, the program would lack funding until July 1, 2015, affecting the 2014-2015 school year. Funding for the 2015-2016 school year would need to be forward funded to be available in the final months of FY2015. The Section 8003(b) payment would need to be fully appropriated using a forward funding period of availability, involving regular budget year appropriations and forward funding appropriations. This scenario was arguably contemplated in Title IV, Section 420(b) of The General Education Provisions Act. The potential transition to forward funding for the Impact Aid program would require double-funding in the transition year to support school activities for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years. In subsequent years, assuming the program remained forward funded, the annual appropriation provided solely through forward funding would be $1.151 billion. The increase in discretionary appropriations required to forward fund the Section 8003(b) payments in FY2015 would be counted against any statutory or procedural limits on discretionary spending applicable to that fiscal year. The transition to forward funding for the Impact Aid program may require double-funding in the transition year to support school activities for two school years. This could be addressed by offsetting additional appropriations with reductions to another program or enacting a provision to exclude certain funding from budget enforcement. Advance appropriations are enacted before the school year starts, unlike regular budget year appropriations. Advance appropriations for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years would be enacted one year in advance but not available until the following fiscal year. Changing appropriations for federally connected children to advance appropriations requires different actions and costs. The program requires advance appropriations for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years to ensure funding availability. Without these appropriations, there would be little to no funding for the respective school years. The switch to advance appropriations would need to be accompanied by budget year appropriations to avoid funding gaps. The funding for advance appropriations for FY2016 would not count against FY2015 limits and would not require double funding in a single year. Procedural limits on advance appropriations must allow for Impact Aid and Section 8003(b) payments. Appropriations for Section 8003(b) payments could use a combination of forward funding and advance appropriations. The funding for programs like ESEA, Title I-A, and IDEA, Part B could be split between forward funding and advance appropriations. For example, a portion of payments would be forward funded and available on July 1, while the rest would be advance appropriated and available on October 1. This approach would require appropriations each fiscal year to fund payments for the upcoming school year. The funding for programs like ESEA, Title I-A, and IDEA, Part B could be split between forward funding and advance appropriations. For example, a portion of payments would be forward funded and available on July 1, while the rest would be advance appropriated and available on October 1. This approach involves setting a percentage for forward funding and the remainder for advance appropriations to support activities in the school year. For instance, if 25% of funds are forward funded and 75% are advance appropriated, specific amounts would need to be allocated for discretionary appropriations in different fiscal years. During the transition period, a combination approach of forward funding and advance appropriations for Section 8003(b) payments would require adjustments to accommodate statutory limits on discretionary spending. In subsequent years, only the forward funding amount would need to be appropriated in the budget year, with the remainder being advance appropriated. Any limits on advance appropriations would need to be modified to allow for Section 8003(b) payments. The transition period may require adjustments to accommodate advance appropriations for Section 8003(b) payments. A provision could specify that double funding should not count for budget enforcement. Table 1 summarizes current law and transitions to different funding approaches for FY2015 appropriations. The table details the discretionary funding needed in FY2015 and advance appropriations for FY2016, assuming level funding for Section 8003(b) payments. The act provides level funding for Section 8003(b) payments for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, with a distribution of 25% forward funding and 75% advance appropriations. Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorizes various Impact Aid payments, including Section 8002 payments for LEAs compensated for federal property ownership. About 216 LEAs receive Section 8002 payments annually. Section 8002 payments are used by LEAs for operating expenses. In FY2014, $66.8 million was appropriated for Section 8002, with payments ranging from $150 to $5.0 million. Section 8003 compensates LEAs for enrolling federally connected children, with two payments made under this section. In FY2014, 1,151 LEAs are eligible for Section 8003(b) payments, serving about 930,000 federally connected students. In FY2014, $1.151 billion was appropriated for Section 8003(b) payments to LEAs serving about 930,000 federally connected students. Additional payments under Section 8003(d) are authorized for certain federally connected children with disabilities eligible for services under IDEA, including children of Armed Forces members and those on Indian lands. $48.3 million was appropriated for Section 8003(d) payments in FY2014, benefiting about 888 LEAs. Section 8007 provides funds for construction and facilities upgrading to certain LEAs serving high percentages of children living on Indian lands. In FY2014, Section 8007 grants totaling $17.4 million were awarded to 174 LEAs serving children on Indian lands. Section 8008 provided $4.8 million for emergency repairs and improvements to schools serving federally connected military dependent children."
