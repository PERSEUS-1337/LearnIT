    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Foreign Credit Reform Act of 2004\". Congress finds unsustainable debt in the world's poorest countries hinders development, and financing should generate sufficient returns. The US has provided over $27.8 billion in food loans since 1955. $27.8 billion in food loans provided by the US under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, with $10.6 billion outstanding in 2002. Arrears on payments totaled $1.2 billion by December 31, 2002. Former Soviet Union states received $1.6 billion in loans, paying $112.7 million in 2003. Rising debt levels may impact credit worthiness. President Bush's initiative, supported by G-7 leaders in 2002, aims to increase World Bank grant assistance to heavily indebted poor countries. This move is crucial for alleviating poverty, preventing unsustainable debt, and addressing urgent human needs in countries where people live on less than one dollar a day. By replacing loans with targeted grants, governments can invest in education, health, nutrition, water supply, and sanitation without the burden of repayment. The G-7 agreement in June 2002 to fully fund the remaining costs of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative is crucial for debt relief in eligible nations. The United States has been a leader in international debt reduction efforts for poor countries, including canceling food loans for sub-Saharan African countries. It must continue to encourage all Paris Club creditors to participate in debt negotiations. Several poor countries not eligible for enhanced HIPC debt reduction terms face severe debt overhang, hindering resource allocation for development and discouraging productive investment. The World Bank prioritizes programs to combat infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, having provided over $1.7 billion since 1986. Debt reduction is crucial but only a partial solution for long-term development; sustainable growth requires promoting economic growth, trade, external investment, and responsible governance. TITLE I--MULTILATERAL DEBT RELIEF\n\nSEC. 101. SUPPORT FOR THE HIPC TRUST FUND.\n\nAmends H.R. 5526 to provide necessary funds for the HIPC Trust Fund until 2006.\n\nSEC. 102. DEBT SERVICE REINVESTED INTO THE GLOBAL FUND.\n\nAmends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to allow debt service to be reinvested into the Global Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will negotiate an agreement for contributions to the Global Fund from the Bank and the Fund based on approved grant proposals. The total contributions in a year cannot exceed the country's debt service payments to the Bank and the Fund. The Global Fund refers to a public-private partnership established to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in 2001. The term 'eligible country' refers to a country that has received debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and has a prevalence of HIV/AIDS among individuals aged 15 to 49 of at least 5 percent. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative is a multilateral debt initiative for heavily indebted poor countries presented in 1999. HIV/AIDS is defined as an individual infected with HIV or living with the virus. The terms 'HIV' and 'AIDS' refer to the human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, respectively, in individuals infected with or living with the virus. TITLE II--BILATERAL DEBT RELIEF\n\nSEC. 201. Amends H.R. 3425 to change the year for bilateral debt relief from 2004 to 2005.\n\nSEC. 202. Addresses debt forgiveness under Title I of Public Law 480. Debt forgiveness authorization for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. Countries with high debt relative to exports can have payments waived. In 2003, a country's guaranteed debt exceeded 8 percent of its exports value. Authorization of appropriations for debt reduction or cancellation in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954. The Act allows for the waiver of payments of principal and interest for countries with high debt relative to exports. SEC. 203. MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS. Financing Assistance Under Title I of Public Law 480 is amended to specify developing countries eligible for assistance. A developing country must meet certain requirements to qualify for assistance under this section. The eligibility criteria for developing countries to receive assistance under Title I of Public Law 480 include not being in default on payments to the United States, not being classified as a low-income or lower-middle income country by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and not being classified as severely-indebted or moderately-indebted. Under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, assistance to a country must be determined to be in the national interest of the United States, effective for up to one year."
