    "content": "Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, coastal nations have authority over a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea and a contiguous zone extending 24 nautical miles. They can regulate these zones to enforce various laws and have sovereign rights in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for resource exploration and management, as well as jurisdiction over artificial structures, marine research, and marine preservation. The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extends 200 nautical miles from the baseline of a nation's territorial sea. It overlaps with the continental shelf, which is defined as the seabed and subsoil extending beyond the coastal nation's land territory. The continental shelf cannot extend beyond 350 nautical miles from the recognized coastline under UNCLOS. Coastal nations have authority over the EEZ for resource exploration, artificial structures, marine research, and preservation. The United States, although not a ratified signatory to UNCLOS, follows many of its principles as customary international law. Through executive orders, the US has claimed offshore zones similar to those in the treaty, with federal statutes confirming federal control over these areas. The primary federal law governing offshore oil and gas development applies to the \"outer Continental Shelf,\" defined as submerged lands seaward of coastal areas. The U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) extends at least 200 nautical miles from the official coastline, with federal authority over offshore oil and gas development. Coastal states have jurisdiction up to three geographical miles from their coast under the Submerged Lands Act of 1953. The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 allows coastal states to extend their boundaries to three marine leagues in the Gulf of Mexico if approved by Congress. Coastal states have ownership and management rights over the lands and natural resources within their offshore boundaries, including the option to develop offshore oil and gas. Coastal states have the option to develop offshore oil and gas within their waters and can regulate the development. State laws governing oil and gas development in state waters vary, along with other laws like environmental protection and coastal zone management regulations. States decide which offshore areas will be opened for development, while the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act governs oil and gas development in federal waters. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) governs the development of offshore oil and gas resources in federal waters. It extends federal laws to structures on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), applies state laws when not conflicting with federal law, and establishes a leasing process and royalty system for mineral resources. The OCSLA ensures the orderly development of OCS resources while maintaining competition and national needs. The OCSLA governs offshore oil and gas development, including withdrawals of areas from leasing. Congressional moratoria on funding for leasing activities were in place from FY1982 to FY2008, but not included in appropriations legislation from FY2009 onwards. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) can use funds for OCS leasing activities unless restricted by future legislation. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 imposed a moratorium on certain OCS areas. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 permits oil and gas leasing in certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico but establishes a new moratorium on activities in the eastern Gulf until June 30, 2022. This moratorium is separate from any congressional moratorium and can be issued by the President under Section 12(a) of the OCSLA. President George H. W. Bush issued the first moratorium on offshore drilling in 1990. The legislation in place at the time prohibited leasing and related activities in certain offshore areas. President George W. Bush rescinded the executive moratorium on offshore drilling in 2008, allowing drilling in areas designated as marine sanctuaries. President Barack Obama used his authority under the OCSLA to issue moratoria on offshore exploration and production activities in specific areas off the coast of Alaska, including Bristol Bay and the North Aleutian Basin. He also withdrew certain areas in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. President Obama issued withdrawals under the OCSLA for the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and areas associated with canyons off the Atlantic Coast. President Trump later modified these withdrawals, leaving only the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area, Bristol Bay, and Marine Sanctuaries protected. The OCSLA is the primary statute governing federal offshore energy exploration and production, with other statutes also playing a role. Offshore activities must comply with federal laws protecting the environment and public health. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act prohibits the destruction or injury of sanctuary resources, effectively banning oil and gas exploration in those areas. The OCSLA governs federal offshore energy exploration and production, with provisions for marine national monuments and coastal state involvement. Amendments in 1978 enhanced environmental standards and leasing procedures. The leasing process includes planning, preleasing, exploration, and development stages. Section 18 directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a five-year leasing program. The OCSLA governs federal offshore energy exploration and production, with provisions for marine national monuments and coastal state involvement. Amendments in 1978 enhanced environmental standards and leasing procedures. Section 18 directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a five-year leasing program that establishes a schedule of proposed lease sales based on national energy needs and potential impacts. Comments from governors and the Attorney General are solicited and considered before publication in the Federal Register. The OCSLA requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a five-year leasing program for offshore energy exploration. The program must be submitted to Congress and the President for approval, with comments considered and any revisions made as necessary. Leased areas become available for leasing once approved, and the program must be reviewed annually with the potential for revisions. An environmental impact statement is required for significant revisions to the program. The OCSLA mandates a five-year leasing program for offshore energy exploration, requiring an environmental impact statement for significant revisions. The current Five-Year Program, approved in 2017, includes 11 potential lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Cook Inlet. The Trump Administration has proposed a new program for 2019-2024, with a Draft Proposed Program published in January 2018. The lease sale process for offshore energy exploration involves multiple steps, starting with the Director of BOEM publishing a call for information and nominations for potential lease areas. This process is guided by federal laws, particularly Section 8 of the OCSLA, and includes environmental analysis under NEPA to determine areas recommended for leasing. The lease sale process for offshore energy exploration involves environmental analysis under NEPA to craft a list of recommended leasing areas and lease stipulations. The list is submitted to the Secretary of the Interior for approval, published in the Federal Register, and sent to potentially affected states' governors. Governors and local government executives can submit recommendations on lease sale size, time, or location within 60 days. The Secretary must accept the governor's recommendations if they reasonably balance national interest and state citizens' well-being. The Director of BOEM then publishes the approved list of lease sale offerings in the Federal Register. The BOEM publishes the approved list of lease sale offerings in the Federal Register at least 30 days before the sale, describing areas, stipulations, terms, and conditions. Bidding must adhere to baseline requirements set by OCSLA, with some flexibility at the Secretary's discretion. The Attorney General can review proposed lease sales for antitrust concerns and make recommendations to the Secretary, who is not bound by them. The Secretary has the authority to grant leases to the highest bidder, with some deviations possible. The OCSLA sets minimum conditions for all lease instruments, including royalty rates and profit share rates. The Secretary can modify these rates under certain conditions to promote increased production. The Secretary has the authority to grant leases to the highest bidder, with the ability to modify royalty or profit share requirements to promote increased production. Royalties may be suspended under certain conditions by BOEM. Successful bidders must provide up-front payments and performance bonds, with additional provisions for selling production to small or independent refiners. The OCSLA lease entitles the lessee to explore, develop, and produce oil and gas, subject to due diligence requirements and approval of a development plan. Lessees must prepare and comply with an approved exploration plan, which includes detailed information and analysis. The plan is submitted to the governor of an affected state and the state's Coastal Zone Management agency. Federal actions and projects in federal waters must comply with the Coastal Zone Management Act. Federal actions and projects in federal waters must be submitted for state review to ensure consistency with state coastal zone management programs. If a state finds a lessee's plan inconsistent, the lessee must amend it or appeal to the Secretary of Commerce. The BOEM regional supervisor analyzes environmental impacts under NEPA, with a 30-day review timeframe. Extensive environmental review may be limited, relying on previous NEPA documents. If the supervisor rejects the plan, the lessee must make changes. Operators must adhere to regulatory review and environmental analysis requirements for drilling activities associated with exploration plans. Approval for drilling is contingent upon the BOEM district supervisor's review of the permit to drill application. Additional scrutiny is necessary for development and production phases, necessitating the submission of a Development and Production Plan or Development Operations Coordination Document. The Development Operations Coordination Document is required for areas with significant activities. It complements environmental analysis under NEPA and may not always require a new EIS. Affected states can submit comments on proposed plans for consistency with state programs. Non-conventional production technology may trigger additional requirements. Applicants for non-conventional production or completion technology in any water depth must submit a Deepwater Operations Plan (DWOP) and a Conceptual Plan for review by BOEM. Approval for drilling requires an Application for Permit to Drill (APD) focusing on well specifics and machinery. The OCSLA allows the Secretary of the Interior to regulate lease suspension and cancellation under specific circumstances. The OCSLA allows for the suspension of OCS activities under specific circumstances, including national interest, proper lease development, transportation facility construction, and threats of harm to life, property, or the environment. Leases may also be suspended for compliance with judicial decrees, installation of safety equipment, or environmental protection measures. The OCSLA allows for the suspension of OCS activities for various reasons, such as national interest, proper lease development, transportation facility construction, and threats of harm. Suspension may also occur for compliance with judicial decrees, safety equipment installation, or environmental protection measures. When a suspension occurs, affected leases or permits are generally extended for the same length of time. If a suspension lasts for five years, the Secretary may cancel a lease after a hearing if continued activity would likely cause serious harm. The OCSLA allows for the suspension of OCS activities for various reasons, such as national interest, proper lease development, transportation facility construction, and threats of harm. Suspension may also occur for compliance with judicial decrees, safety equipment installation, or environmental protection measures. When a suspension occurs, affected leases or permits are generally extended for the same length of time. If a suspension lasts for five years, the Secretary may cancel a lease after a hearing if continued activity would likely cause serious harm. Upon cancellation, the OCSLA entitles lessees to certain damages, calculated based on the fair value of the canceled rights or the excess of consideration paid for the lease, exploration- or development-related expenditures, plus interest, over the lessee's revenues from the lease. Compliance with OCSLA regulations is required for the continuance of any lease. The OCSLA allows for the cancellation of noncompliant leases, whether producing or nonproducing, through a notice process or court proceeding. It also regulates transfers of offshore oil and gas exploration and production leases, conditioning their issuance on compliance with OCSLA regulations. The OCSLA regulates transfers of offshore oil and gas exploration and production leases, requiring compliance with regulations and approval from BOEM before transfer. Lessees are bound by lease terms and conditions set by BOEM. The lessee must file any transfer of rights or ownership interest in the lease with the regional BOEM OCS office for approval. Regulations set by the agency detail requirements for transfers. Lessees are typically obligated to pay royalties based on production, with a minimum rate of 12.5%. ONRR is responsible for collecting and distributing royalties. Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) collects royalties from onshore and offshore oil and gas production on federal lands. Revenue is mostly deposited in the Treasury of the United States, but some is directed to state and local governments to offset impacts of offshore exploration. Section 8(g) of OCSLA addresses leasing details for lands within three nautical miles of coastal states. Under Section 8(g) of OCSLA, revenue from leases near state shorelines must be deposited in a dedicated account. The coastal state receives 27% of revenues collected from leases near their waters, adjusted based on the tract's location within the three nautical miles. OCSLA also outlines a process for resolving boundary disputes and diverts revenue from Gulf of Mexico leases to state governments through GOMESA. Under GOMESA, 50% of qualified Outer Continental Shelf revenues are deposited into a special account. 75% of this revenue is disbursed to Gulf Producing States based on a formula considering distance from lease tracts. States can use the funds for authorized environmental mitigation purposes. The remaining 25% is directed to states for expenditure under the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 apportions funds to states for land acquisition, planning, and development for recreational purposes. Various statutes govern offshore oil and gas development, leading to potential legal challenges. The Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act provide avenues for challenging actions related to offshore oil and gas production. Legal challenges often focus on agency actions during planning, leasing, exploration, and development phases under the OCSLA and environmental review required by the National Environmental Policy Act. Controversies over revenue collection and distribution in the leasing process are subject to review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Legal challenges to Five-Year Programs must be supported by substantial evidence as per the OCSLA. The court established the standard for reviewing policy determinations in the 1980-1985 program. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit established a standard for reviewing policy determinations in the 1980-1985 program. The court stated that policy judgments made by the Secretary must undergo searching scrutiny to ensure they are not arbitrary or irrational. Additionally, statutory interpretation by the agency would be subject to stricter scrutiny than fact or policy judgments. The court vacated some of the Secretary's findings in the 1980-1985 Five-Year Program, citing the need for revision. The court emphasized the importance of judicial review in matters of statutes and highlighted the Secretary's obligation to respond to state comments as outlined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The court clarified that the Administrative Procedure Act did not apply to the agency's decisions regarding state recommendations. The APA exempts agency management matters from its reach, including the leasing program related to the OCS, which is public property. The standards for review outlined in Watt have been upheld in subsequent litigation. OCSLA authorizes states to submit comments during the lease sale stage, directing the Secretary to consider a state's recommendations for a balance between national interest and state well-being. The OCSLA does not provide clear guidance on balancing national interest with state considerations, leading to agency actions being upheld if some relevant factors are considered. Federal courts in Massachusetts have found the Secretary's balancing of interests insufficient, but may afford more deference with a thorough record. Litigation has also focused on mandatory royalty relief provisions, as seen in Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Corp. v. Allred. In Oil & Gas Corp. v. Allred, an oil and gas company challenged the department's authority to collect royalties on deepwater production based on the 1995 Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. The act provides royalty-free production until a threshold volume is reached, categorizing leases based on issuance dates. The controversy surrounds Kerr-McGee's argument that its deepwater leases issued within the first five years after the DWRRA's enactment are subject to different legal requirements, specifically regarding royalty relief. Kerr-McGee contends that any price threshold included in these leases goes against DOI's statutory authority and is unenforceable. Section 304 of the DWRRA directs that such leases use a bidding system authorized in the OCSLA. Section 304 of the DWRRA stipulates that leases issued within five years must use a bidding system authorized in the OCSLA, with royalty suspension based on volume thresholds. The DWRRA allows for royalty suspension based on production volume only, with no price-related thresholds authorized for leases issued within a five-year period. Kerr-McGee challenged the Secretary's authority to impose price-based thresholds, which the court agreed with, stating that only volumetric thresholds were allowed under the DWRRA for leases issued between 1996 and 2000. The court ruled that the Secretary lacked authority to impose price-based thresholds on royalty suspension for leases under the DWRRA. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed this decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari. In Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Department of the Interior, the court found that the DOI's analysis of the five-year program for 2007-2012 did not meet the requirements of Section 18(a)(2)(G) of the OCLSA, as it only considered physical characteristics of shoreline areas and not non-shoreline areas of the OCS. The court vacated the five-year program for OCS leasing and remanded it to DOI for reconsideration due to inadequate environmental sensitivity analysis in the Chukchi, Beaufort, and Bering Seas. NEPA regulations require various levels of environmental analysis in the OCS planning and leasing process. The Natural Resources Defense Council v. Hodel case challenged the adequacy of environmental analysis in the OCS planning and leasing process. The court ruled that the agency did not have to examine every possible alternative and that the determination of adequacy was subject to the \"rule of reason.\" The court found the Secretary's choice of alternatives sufficient in this instance. The court found that the Secretary's failure to analyze certain cumulative impacts was a violation of NEPA, requiring inclusion of the analysis. NEPA procedures and standard of review remain the same in the leasing phase, with courts being deferential. Challenges under NEPA at this phase are often unsuccessful as there will be an opportunity to cure any defects in the analysis later in the OCSLA process. In Edwardsen v. U.S. Department of the Interior, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals applied the \"rule of reason\" to determine if the EIS adequately addressed environmental consequences of the development plan. Despite some omissions, the court held that NEPA requirements were satisfied, and challenges to agency action were not successful."
