    "content": "Congress has the power to regulate tort liability when it affects interstate commerce. Examples of limited tort liability include the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 contains provisions that limit tort liability for various entities involved in national security measures. Section 1402 of the Homeland Security Act immunizes air carriers and Federal flight deck officers from liability related to the use of firearms. Sections 1714-1717 limit tort liability for vaccine manufacturers and administrators, but were repealed in 2003. Section 304(c) of the Act amends the Public Health Service Act to address liability for administering vaccines. The Homeland Security Act provides immunity from liability for administering a smallpox vaccine during a public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Covered persons, including manufacturers, distributors, healthcare entities, and licensed professionals, are deemed employees of the Public Health Service for tort liability purposes. This provision was effective as of January 24, 2003. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides immunity for federal employees from liability for torts committed within the scope of their employment. While federal employees are immune from state tort law, they can be held liable for violating the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes. The FTCA makes the United States government liable for such torts, similar to private employers. However, punitive damages and jury trials are not permitted under the FTCA, and there are exceptions where the United States may not be held liable. The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides immunity for federal employees from liability for torts committed within the scope of their employment. The United States may not be held liable under state law imposing strict liability, among other exceptions. Manufacturers and sellers of defective products, including vaccines, may be held strictly liable under state law, regardless of negligence. A product can be considered defective if it was defectively manufactured, designed unsafely, or lacked necessary warnings. The government is not liable for injuries caused by a smallpox vaccine under the FTCA unless negligence is proven. Section 304 states that the US may be liable for injuries from a smallpox vaccine if administered by a qualified person during a public health emergency. If a person not vaccinated contracts vaccinia and lives with a vaccinated individual, they are presumed to have contracted it from the vaccinated person unless proven otherwise. Section 863 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, known as \"Litigation Management,\" allows individuals who contract vaccinia from a source other than the vaccine to sue the government. This federal cause of action applies to sellers of anti-terrorism technologies in cases involving acts of terrorism. Liability against these sellers is now under federal jurisdiction, rather than state law. The Secretary of Homeland Security determines liability protection for anti-terrorism technologies, placing them on an \"Approved Product List for Homeland Security\" and issuing a \"certificate of conformance.\" The SAFETY Act implemented federal liability limitations, allowing suits in federal court regardless of party domicile. Section 863 allows suits to be brought in federal court regardless of party domicile and the amount of damages sought. It grants exclusive jurisdiction to the appropriate federal district court for terrorism-related causes of action, preempting state law on punitive damages, interest, and joint and several liability for noneconomic damages. Joint and several liability is the rule that holds each defendant 100 percent liable if more than one defendant is found responsible for a plaintiff's injuries. This rule ensures that the plaintiff can recover all damages from one defendant, who can then seek contribution from other liable parties. Noneconomic damages are awarded in proportion to each defendant's percentage of responsibility, while joint and several liability still applies to economic damages. Section 863 eliminates the collateral source rule, allowing for a reduction in plaintiff's recovery by the amount of collateral source compensation received. It also permits the government contractor defense. The Supreme Court created the government contractor defense as a defense for product manufacturers in products liability cases alleging design defects or failure to warn. Manufacturers can argue they followed government contract specifications, avoiding liability. The SAFETY Act allows sellers of anti-terrorism technologies to obtain government contractor defense without designing to federal specifications. The Secretary's approval of technologies is required for the defense, separate from determining qualification for liability under state law. The SAFETY Act allows sellers of anti-terrorism technologies to obtain government contractor defense under section 863(d), which provides a rebuttable presumption that applies regardless of whether the claim arises from a sale to Federal Government or non-Federal Government customers. This language seems to immunize government contractors from liability for defects not required by contract specifications, including those occurring in the manufacturing process. The SAFETY Act provides immunity to sellers for defects not required by contract specifications, including those in the manufacturing process. The government contractor defense applies in design defect cases where the defendant followed government contract specifications. The Department of Homeland Security believes sellers of approved technology cannot be held liable for design defects or failure to warn claims under the Act. Section 864 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 requires sellers of anti-terrorism technology to obtain liability insurance and enter into reciprocal waivers of claims with contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, vendors, and customers. This provision aims to protect all parties involved in the sale and use of anti-terrorism technology. Section 864(c) limits a seller's liability to the amount of liability insurance coverage required under section 864(a). Section 890 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 limits the liability of air transportation security companies and affiliates for claims related to the September 11, 2001, air crashes to the amount of liability insurance they had on that date. This provision applies to persons engaged in providing air transportation security and their affiliates who meet specific criteria. Section 890 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 limits the liability of air transportation security companies and their affiliates for claims related to the September 11, 2001, terrorist-related crashes to the amount of liability insurance coverage they had on that date. This provision redefines \"air carrier\" to include these persons and extends the liability limitation for acts of terrorism committed on or to an air carrier through 2008. Section 201(b)(2) of P.L. 107-42 limits air carriers' liability for terrorist attacks post-9/11 to $100,000,000 for claims by third parties within 180 days of the act. Section 201(b)(2) of P.L. 107-42 limits air carriers' liability for terrorist attacks post-9/11 to $100,000,000 for claims by third parties within 180 days of the act. The government would be responsible for any liability exceeding this amount, and no punitive damages can be awarded against an air carrier or the government. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 extended this provision until December 31, 2003. The liability limitation under section 201(b) was extended to December 31, 2008 by P.L. 110-161. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 created a program to deputize volunteer pilots as Federal flight deck officers, with air carriers not liable for damages related to their use of firearms. The liability limitation for Federal flight deck officers extends to December 31, 2008. Federal flight deck officers are not liable for acts or omissions in defending the aircraft unless guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. They are treated as agents of the Federal Government for legal purposes, allowing the government to be sued under the Federal Tort Claims Act. However, government liability exceptions include claims based on assault or battery. The liability limitation for Federal flight deck officers extends to December 31, 2008, and they are not liable for acts or omissions in defending the aircraft unless guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct. However, they may be held liable for claims based on assault or battery. Federal flight deck officers are treated as federal employees for liability purposes, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Sections 1714-1717 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 amended the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program limits lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers to $1,000 for injuries listed in the Vaccine Injury Table. Claimants must first seek compensation through the Program, which offers fast, no-fault compensation funded by a vaccine tax. Awards cover unreimbursable expenses, up to $250,000 for pain and suffering, and $250,000 for vaccine-related deaths. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides compensation for vaccine-related injuries, including pain and suffering, loss of earnings, and attorneys' fees. Petitioners can sue vaccine manufacturers under state tort law if dissatisfied with the Program's recovery. Manufacturers are not liable for failure to provide warnings directly to the injured party. Petitions for compensation must be filed for a vaccine-related injury or death, excluding illnesses caused by intentional adulterants or contaminants. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 expanded the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to cover any component or ingredient of a vaccine. It also clarified that the Program does not cover an adulterate or contaminant, and it is not clear if claims pending before November 25, 2002, can be pursued if the statute of limitations had expired. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 had limitations on claims related to Thimerosal in vaccines, which contains mercury and has been linked to autism. Courts have ruled that Thimerosal is a vaccine component and not an adulterant or contaminant, making it covered by the Program before the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Courts have ruled that injuries from Thimerosal in vaccines are considered vaccine-related under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. Various cases have supported this ruling, including Liu v. Aventis Pasteur, Owens v. American Home Prods. Corp., McDonald v. Abbott Labs, Collins v. American Home Prods. Corp., Stewart v. American Home Prods. Corp., Strauss v. American Home Prod. Corp., Blackmon v. American Home Prod. Corp., and Owens v. American Home Prod. Corp. The Department of Health and Human Services has stated that Thimerosal is not an adulterant or contaminant in vaccines. Sections 1714-1717 would have only affected future court decisions regarding Thimerosal. P.L. 108-7 (2003) repealed these sections and stated that the Vaccine Program should be applied as if they had never been enacted, with no inference drawn regarding prior law or court decisions. P.L. 108-7 (2003), Division L, \u00c2\u00a7102, states that Congress should report a bill addressing vaccine supply, development, and liability issues within six months of enactment."
