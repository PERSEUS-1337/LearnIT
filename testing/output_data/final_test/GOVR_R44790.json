    "content": "The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a final rule on January 18, 2017, amending federal regulations to protect patient records in substance use disorder treatment programs. The changes aim to align Part 2 with advancements in healthcare while maintaining privacy protections. The original regulations were established in 1975 and had not been substantially revised since 1987. The aim of Part 2 is to encourage individuals with substance use disorders to seek treatment by establishing strong privacy protections. The healthcare system is adopting new models for delivering services and focusing on measuring performance and patient outcomes, relying on electronic health records and health information technology infrastructure. Disclosure of substance use disorder treatment records under Part 2 requires a patient's consent. Under Part 2, disclosure of substance use disorder treatment records requires written consent, except for specific statutory exceptions like medical emergencies. This contrasts with HIPAA Privacy Rule, which allows sharing for treatment and payment. Providers are frustrated with Part 2 restrictions on sharing patient records, hindering coordination of care. Under Part 2, patient records for substance use disorder treatment are protected and require written consent for disclosure. This contrasts with HIPAA rules that allow sharing for treatment and payment. Providers face challenges in coordinating patient care due to restrictions under Part 2. Integrated health systems must manage patient consent preferences for sharing Part 2 data with other healthcare facilities. Some health information exchanges exclude Part 2 data. Researchers and health information exchanges face challenges accessing Part 2 data due to difficulties in segregating and managing consent. CMS decision in 2013 to withhold Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement claims with substance use disorder diagnosis or procedure codes limited research data sets. Only substance use disorder program directors can authorize disclosures for research purposes, leading to researchers losing access to important data sources. SAMHSA revised Part 2 regulations to ensure individuals with substance use disorders can benefit from new systems of care without compromising privacy. The report summarizes changes made to the regulations and stakeholders' reactions. Part 2 is narrower in scope compared to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, providing privacy protections. New HIT standards and applications support data segmentation and consent management for exchanging Part 2 data. Part 2 regulations provide privacy protections for individuals with substance use disorders, with fewer uses and disclosures of patient information without consent compared to the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule applies to identifiable health information maintained by health plans, clearinghouses, and providers, including their business associates. The Privacy Rule allows for various uses and disclosures of PHI for treatment, payment, and routine health care operations. It also permits PHI use for public health and research purposes with patient authorization required for other uses. In contrast, Part 2 applies to substance use disorder treatment programs, covering over 12,000 facilities. Part 2 applies to specialized substance use disorder treatment units within facilities, restricting the disclosure of patient information identifying them as alcohol or drug abusers. Patient-identifying information can only be disclosed with written consent, except in specific circumstances like medical emergencies or research. The final rule for substance use disorder treatment programs under Part 2 and the HIPAA Privacy Rule states that patient information can only be disclosed in specific circumstances, such as medical emergencies, research, program audits, or court orders. Programs must comply with the regulations that are more protective of patient privacy, typically following Part 2 requirements. SAMHSA aimed to facilitate sharing patient data within health care networks. The Part 2 law restricts SAMHSA's rulemaking options due to its prescriptive nature, defining entities and information protections. Patient consent is required for disclosing protected information, with strict redisclosure prohibitions. In contrast, HIPAA grants the HHS Secretary discretionary authority to develop and amend the Privacy Rule based on detailed recommendations to Congress. The final rule modifies Part 2 requirements for patient consent forms to include explicit descriptions of substance use disorder information that may be disclosed, such as diagnostic information, medications, and history of substance use. Patients can now select specific types of disclosures on the consent form. The final rule for patient consent forms under Part 2 now allows patients to specify the recipient of their information, including individuals, entities with treating provider relationships, third-party payers, and entities like ACOs or research institutions. The final rule for patient consent forms under Part 2 now allows patients to specify the recipient of their information, including individuals, entities with treating provider relationships, third-party payers, and entities like ACOs or research institutions. Patients can consent to disclose data to organizations like health information exchanges (HIEs) acting as intermediaries, who can further disclose the information to providers with a treating provider relationship. Patients providing consent using a general designation are entitled to request an accounting of disclosures from the intermediary. The final rule modifies the written statement prohibiting redisclosure accompanying Part 2 disclosures made with a patient's consent. It specifies that the prohibition applies only to information identifying an individual with a substance use disorder, including clinical details and origin of the data. Patient-identifying information may be disclosed to medical personnel for a medical emergency without prior consent. The final rule requires Part 2 programs to document specific information related to medical emergencies and adopt policies to protect patient-identifying information. It eases restrictions on disclosures for research purposes. The final rule eases restrictions on disclosures for research purposes by allowing qualified researchers to access Part 2 information with IRB approval and agreeing to be bound by Part 2 regulations. Researchers can also link Part 2 data to federal and nonfederal repositories with IRB approval. Part 2 permits disclosure of patient-identifying information for program audits or evaluations with safeguards in place. The final rule expands access to Part 2 data for audit and evaluation activities, including financial and quality assurance reviews. It allows disclosure of patient-identifying information to a Qualified Service Organization (QSO) under a written agreement. Population health management is added as a service that may be provided by a QSO, with a focus on monitoring and identifying individual patients within a group. Disclosures for population health management must be limited to specific offices or units responsible for these activities. Care coordination and medical management are not considered part of population health management. SAMHSA did not address electronic prescribing and state PDMPs in its Part 2 rulemaking, despite the potential importance of PDMPs in combating the abuse of controlled prescription drugs. PDMPs collect and analyze prescribing data electronically, but patient consent is required for redisclosure. SAMHSA recognized the importance of PDMPs but concluded that these issues are not yet ready for rulemaking due to limitations in pharmacy data systems. SAMHSA's Part 2 rulemaking addresses the challenges in managing patient consent and segregating Part 2 data in pharmacy systems. A supplemental final rule allows third parties with lawful possession of Part 2 data to disclose it to contractors, subcontractors, and legal representatives under certain circumstances. Patient consent for disclosure of Part 2 records enables further disclosure for payment and health care operations activities. Recipients of this information become lawful holders subject to Part 2 requirements. SAMHSA's final rule allows for disclosure of Part 2 data for Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP audits. Advocacy groups support the confidentiality protections, while healthcare payers and providers criticize the rule for lacking improvement. The Legal Action Center and the Partnership to Amend 42 C.F.R. Part 2 support the final rule for maintaining core consent requirements and introducing flexibility in information sharing. They commend the new provision allowing patients to specify information disclosure on consent forms. The Partnership, representing health care payers and providers, criticizes the final rule for not enabling enough sharing of Part 2 data. They acknowledge SAMHSA's efforts but suggest that new legislation may be needed for more significant changes. Behavioral health and medical informatics communities support the general consent provisions but are critical of certain language requirements. Intermediaries like HIEs and ACOs are criticized for the IT requirements to limit access to Part 2 data and track disclosures. Stakeholders are concerned about the administrative burden and lack of additional privacy protections. The 21st Century Cures Act mandates a review of the final rule's impact on patient care, health outcomes, and privacy. SAMHSA conducted a listening session on this requirement. SAMHSA has worked closely with partners to develop HIT standards for sharing Part 2 data with patient consent preferences. Data segmentation allows for control over access to protected information by breaking down records into categories. SAMHSA collaborated with ONC on the DS4P initiative to develop standards for data segmentation and patient consent management. Consent2Share, an open-source tool, integrates with EHR systems to facilitate the exchange of health information among providers. It allows patients to manage their consent options and electronically sign forms for disclosing protected information. Consent2Share allows patients to specify who can access their information and what data can be shared. It verifies patient consent before disclosing information, including redacting sensitive data if necessary. SAMHSA's OTP Service Continuity Pilot ensures compliant electronic health information exchange among OTPs while minimizing treatment disruptions. SAMHSA's OTP Service Continuity Pilot aims to minimize treatment disruptions for individuals receiving behavioral therapy and medications for opioid addiction at OTPs. Arizona Health-e Connection (AzHeC) is working with three Arizona-based behavioral health organizations to integrate Consent2Share with the Arizona HIE, allowing patients to apply consent preferences to clinical documents. Patient consent preferences for clinical documents at OTPs are managed by HIE. Treatment information is recorded in the patient's electronic medical record and shared with HIE. Patients can modify consent settings through Consent2Share when visiting different OTPs. Consent2Share applies patient preferences to clinical summary documents and redacts unauthorized data for requesting providers."
