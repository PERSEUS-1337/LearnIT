    "content": "The U.S. policy for admitting lawful permanent residents is based on four principles: family reunification, skilled individuals, humanitarian assistance, and immigrant diversity by country of origin. These principles are outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act, providing pathways for acquiring LPR status. Employment-based immigration is one of these pathways, with five preference categories each having eligibility requirements and numerical limitations. The U.S. policy for admitting lawful permanent residents is based on principles like family reunification, skilled individuals, humanitarian assistance, and immigrant diversity by country of origin. Employment-based immigrants face numerical limits and a per-country ceiling of 7% to prevent dominance by any single country. Some Members of Congress are interested in reassessing the 7% per-country ceiling for employment-based immigration. The report discusses the current numerical limits on employment-based LPRs and the arguments for and against removing the per-country ceiling. It analyzes trend data on employment-based immigration and pending queues of petitions and applications. Recent congressional proposals to alter the per-country ceiling are also discussed. The report analyzes the current numerical limits on employment-based LPRs and recent congressional proposals to alter the per-country ceiling. It discusses the worldwide limit on permanent immigration and the exemption for immediate relatives from numerical limits. The total number of foreign nationals receiving LPR status each year has averaged around 1 million over the past decade. The INA sets a per-country ceiling of 7% for family-sponsored and employment-based immigrants to prevent monopolization by a few countries. The INA outlines five employment-based preference categories with individual numerical limits within the overall worldwide total of lawful permanent residents. Prospective immigrants can apply for employment-based LPR status from abroad or within the United States as \"status adjusters.\" Adjusting status involves changing from a temporary status to LPR status, with petitioning and application steps. Most require U.S. employers to petition on their behalf, with key roles played by DOS and DHS. Labor certification is needed for 2nd and 3rd preference category immigrants from DOL. Labor certification is required for employment-based LPR status. USCIS adjudicates immigrant petitions, adjusts status for those in the US, and DOS handles visa applications for those abroad. INA distinguishes between principal and derivative prospective immigrants. DOS allocates visa numbers regardless of residency. Prospective immigrants, including spouses and children, are entitled to the same status as principals. Employment-based LPR status is granted based on the order of filed petitions. Visa numbers are prorated according to preference categories. Unused visa numbers can roll down to the next preference category. If available visa numbers exceed applicants, the per-country ceiling does not apply. If the number of available visa numbers exceeds the number of applicants, the per-country ceiling does not apply for the remainder of available visa numbers for that quarter. Unused family-based preference immigrant visa numbers can be applied to employment-based preference immigrant visa numbers in the next fiscal year. Due to numerical limitations, approved immigration petitions may exceed visa numbers available for a specific category and country of origin. Individuals with approved petitions may be placed in a queue until a visa is available. DOS's Visa Bulletin for December 2018 presents action dates for employment-based preference immigrants. The Visa Bulletin provides cut-off dates for employment-based preference immigrants, indicating oversubscribed categories and availability of visa numbers. Cut-off dates can fluctuate based on demand, causing movement to slow or stop. DOS may regress cut-off dates if demand exceeds supply. Visa retrogression occurs when demand for visa numbers exceeds supply, leading to cut-off date regression. Priority dates in the Visa Bulletin may not accurately predict wait times for visa applicants. Changes in application rates can significantly impact waiting times. For example, Indian nationals with 2nd preference employment-based petitions filed before April 1, 2009, were eligible to apply for a visa in December 2018. Employers must first apply for a foreign labor certification from DOL before petitioning for 2nd and 3rd preference category workers. The expected wait time for LPR status for employment-based immigrants filing in December 2018 is about 9.5 years, but this could change based on the number of Indian nationals applying for LPR status. After obtaining a foreign labor certification from DOL, sponsoring employers and self-petitioning individuals must file one of three employment-based immigrant petitions with USCIS. These include USCIS Form I-140 for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd preference categories, USCIS Form I-360 for the 4th preference category, and USCIS Form I-526 for the 5th preference category. Approved immigrant petitions are sent to DOS's National Visa Center (NVC) for priority date assignment, determining the immigrant's place in the visa queue. Priority dates need to be current before proceeding, based on published \"final action dates.\" The final stage in the employment-based immigration process involves an interview with either a DOS consular official or a USCIS adjudicator, depending on the prospective immigrant's location. If residing abroad, a visa application to enter the US is required, while those already in the US must apply for adjustment of status. The final stage of the employment-based immigration process involves an interview with a DOS consular official or USCIS adjudicator. The DOS consular office schedules interviews for prospective immigrants living abroad to determine eligibility for an immigrant visa. Visa priority dates and numbers are assigned by DOS, with trends showing fluctuations in the admission of employment-based immigrants from 1997 to 2017. The data shows that 137,855 employment-based immigrants, representing 12% of all foreign nationals receiving LPR status, were allocated mostly to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd preference categories. Fluctuations in employment-based LPRs were seen due to the transfer of immigration functions in 2003 and the Real ID Act of 2005 allowing for the recapture of unused visa numbers. Annual numbers of employment-based preference LPRs have varied significantly over the past two decades. The number of 5th preference immigrants increased significantly in the past two decades, mainly due to the popularity of the USCIS EB-5 Regional Center Program. Most employment-based LPRs adjusted to LPR status from within the United States, with only a small percentage acquiring LPR status as new arrivals from abroad. The 5th preference immigrant investors were an exception, with a majority being admitted as new arrivals since 2006. Acquiring LPR status through employment-based immigration provisions involves various administrative steps by federal agencies. The employment-based immigration process involves various administrative steps by federal agencies, including labor certifications, immigration petitions, and visa applications. Six distinct groups of LPR petitions and applications are described in order of administrative processing, with a certain number being denied at each step. Foreign nationals at early stages have a lower likelihood of obtaining LPR status compared to those near the end of the process. The employment-based immigration process involves six distinct groups of petitions and applications representing prospective immigrants at different stages of processing. Only two pools are limited by numerical limits, including those waiting overseas for a visa or in the US to adjust status. These pools make up the employment-based immigration queue, which includes both principal immigrants and their derivative family members. Employers must obtain foreign labor certification from DOL before filing a petition with USCIS for professional and skilled/unskilled immigrant workers. DOL received 104,360 applications in FY2018, processing 119,776 applications from FY2018 and earlier years. 91% of beneficiaries received certification, while 5% were denied. In FY2018, 91% of beneficiaries received certification for foreign labor, while 5% were denied. Pending employment-based immigration petitions numbered 112,913 for I-140, I-360, and I-526 petitions as of June 30, 2018. Approval or denial is not based on numerical limits imposed by the INA. The third pool of pending employment-based applicants includes foreign nationals with approved immigrant petitions waiting for numerically limited visas. The National Visa Center reported 112,189 pending applications at the end of each fiscal year. The NVC reported 112,189 pending applications for employment-based LPR visas as of November 1, 2017. Almost half were for 3rd preference \"professional and skilled workers,\" followed by 5th preference \"investors\" and 2nd preference \"professionals with advanced degrees or of exceptional ability.\" China, India, and the Philippines are the dominant source countries for foreign nationals in this queue. The largest pool of pending employment-based applications in the United States includes foreign nationals already present with approved immigrant petitions who have not yet adjusted status. These individuals reside in the US as legal nonimmigrants, many working as skilled temporary workers with H-1B visas. Adjustment of status applications can only be filed after visa number availability is confirmed by the Department of State. The largest pool of pending employment-based applications in the United States includes foreign nationals with approved immigrant petitions waiting to adjust status. USCIS does not regularly publish reports on this population, but one recent report shows 395,025 approved petitions pending as of April 20, 2018, with Indian and Chinese nationals accounting for 95% of all petitions. Chinese nationals make up 95% of all petitions in the largest pool of pending employment-based applications in the United States. The USCIS report provides data on derivative immigrants receiving LPR status through principal immigrants, with estimated numbers of derivatives included in each preference category. The total estimated derivative figure, combined with the actual principal figure, yields an estimate of the total number of immigrants. The fifth pool of pending employment-based applications includes visa applicants overseas who have had their I-140 immigration petitions approved and have submitted their application for a visa. Most can expect to receive an interview with a DOS consular official, the last major step in this pathway to LPR status. DOS does not publish statistics on this pool of applications but presents visa application filing dates in its monthly Visa Bulletin. Prospective employment-based immigrants with priority dates on or prior to the filing dates may submit their visa applications and accompanying documentation to DOS. The filing dates, introduced by DOS in 2015, require applicants to submit paperwork early for an accurate count of visa numbers each quarter. The pool of pending employment-based applications includes foreign nationals with approved petitions who filed I-485 applications to adjust status. This pool, known as the \"I-485 Inventory,\" consists of two groups: those with visa numbers before March 6, 2017, and those after. The I-485 Inventory consists of two groups of pending employment-based applications: those with visa numbers before March 6, 2017, and those after. As of July 2018, USCIS's SCOPS was processing 29,471 applications, with India being the dominant source country. The second group of applications, processed by USCIS's FOD, is larger but data is not publicly available. Prospective immigrants can file an I-485 application once a visa number is available. DOS has allotted visa numbers for submitted applications, creating an administrative backlog. USCIS data show high approval rates for I-485 applicants, making them likely to receive LPR status. The discussion covers six pools of petitions and applications processed by DOL, USCIS, and DOS in the employment-based LPR process, with some caveats about timing discrepancies in reporting. The six pools of petitions and applications processed by DOL, USCIS, and DOS in the employment-based LPR process may not be strictly comparable due to different reporting dates. USCIS figures do not include prospective derivative immigrants, and some petitions in the fourth pool may be duplicates or inactive. The pools offer a cross-sectional view of petition and application processing, reflecting demand for foreign workers and approved pending visa queues. During the fiscal year, there are six pools of petitions and applications in the employment-based LPR process. The third and fourth pools represent approved pending visa and adjustment of status applications that are held back by numerical limits. Proposals to eliminate the per-country ceiling on employment-based immigration have been introduced in recent Congresses. For example, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) aimed to eliminate the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigration. In the 115th Congress, there was a proposal to eliminate the per-country ceiling on employment-based immigration. Supporters argue that the current system causes long waits for immigrants to acquire LPR status, preventing family reunification and leading to potential exploitation by employers. They believe that the current system discriminates based on country of origin, which they argue is irrelevant to workers' contributions to the labor market. Employers with power over potential immigrant workers can exploit them by discouraging negotiations for better wages and working conditions. These workers, especially Indian, Chinese, and Filipino nationals, face long waits for LPR status, making them relatively immobile and dependent on their employers. If they leave their employers, they risk forfeiting their pending immigrant petitions and may have to return to their home countries. Indian, Chinese, and Filipino nationals face long waits for LPR status due to queues of pending petitions and visa applications. Eliminating the per-country cap could level the playing field for employment-based immigrants. Eliminating the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants would equalize waiting times for LPR status across countries of origin, making immigrants more equally attractive to employers. This change could encourage skilled foreign workers, like those from India, to seek employment and immigration sponsorship in the United States. Some skilled foreign workers may choose to work in countries where permanent legal status is obtained more quickly, leading to competitive disadvantages for firms in the United States. Long waits for LPR status can impact the retention of highly trained STEM students in the U.S. Removing the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants could reduce country-of-origin diversity and favor Indian and Chinese prospective immigrants. Arguments against lifting the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants often focus on the H-1B visa program, which is criticized for being exploitative towards foreign workers, particularly those from India. Indian nationals dominate H-1B visa recipients, raising concerns about the impact of revising the per-country ceiling on future flows of employment-based immigrants. If the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants is eliminated, Indian and Chinese nationals are expected to dominate the flow of new LPRs for years to clear out the queue of prospective immigrants from those countries. The \"Yoder Amendment\" proposed in the 115th Congress aims to eliminate the per-country ceiling for all employment-based preference categories. The Yoder Amendment proposed in the 115th Congress aims to eliminate the per-country ceiling for all employment-based preference categories. It would phase out the ceiling over four years, allowing a single country to use a higher percentage of visa numbers each year until reaching 100% in the fourth year. The Yoder Amendment aims to eliminate the per-country ceiling for employment-based preference categories, potentially reducing wait times for LPR status for nationals from India, China, and the Philippines. This could lead to an increase in the number of applicants seeking employment-based LPR status. The removal of the per-country ceiling for employment-based preference categories could lead to certain countries dominating immigration, potentially benefiting specific industries. Additionally, it may alter the country-of-origin composition of family-based immigrants acquiring LPR status each year."
