    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Employees and Retirees in Municipal Bankruptcies Act of 2017\" determines eligibility for municipalities to be debtors under Chapter 9 of Title 11 of the United States Code. The Act \"Protecting Employees and Retirees in Municipal Bankruptcies Act of 2017\" amends Section 109(c) of title 11, United States Code by clarifying the term \"good faith\" for creditors who are employees or retirees, changing \"impracticable\" to \"impossible\", and adding a requirement for clear and convincing evidence to satisfy the subsection. The Act \"Protecting Employees and Retirees in Municipal Bankruptcies Act of 2017\" makes amendments to bankruptcy laws, including allowing immediate appeals to the Court of Appeals for determinations of debtor eligibility under chapter 9 of title 11. The amendments aim to expedite the appeal process and prevent the doctrine of equitable mootness from applying to these appeals. The Act \"Protecting Employees and Retirees in Municipal Bankruptcies Act of 2017\" makes amendments to bankruptcy laws to protect employees and retirees. Section 943 of title 11, United States Code, is amended to allow modification of collective bargaining agreements and retiree benefits in bankruptcy cases, with approval from authorized representatives of employees or retirees. The amendment to Section 943 of title 11, United States Code, allows for the modification of collective bargaining agreements and retiree benefits in bankruptcy cases. The authorized representative of individuals receiving retiree benefits covered by a collective bargaining agreement will be the labor organization signatory to the agreement, unless they no longer represent active employees in the same bargaining unit. If this is the case, the authorized representative will be the labor organization currently representing active employees in that unit, unless the organization elects not to serve or the court approves a motion by a party in interest. The court may appoint a committee of retired employees to represent individuals receiving retiree benefits if the labor organization elects not to serve or if the court finds different representation appropriate. This is done upon a motion by a party in interest, after notice and hearing. The court may appoint a committee of retired employees to represent individuals receiving retiree benefits if the labor organization elects not to serve or if the court finds different representation appropriate. The party requesting relief has the burden of proof. The court, upon motion by a party in interest, may require the United States trustee to appoint a committee of retired employees if the debtor seeks to modify or not pay retiree benefits. The United States trustee shall appoint on a proportional basis per capita based on an order issued under subsection (c)(3) or (d). The trustee appoints individuals from organizations representing retirees based on membership. A committee cannot recommend benefit modifications unless at least 2/3 of members support it."
