    "content": "Congressional concern over mercury in the environment has increased due to evidence of harm to children's nervous systems. Mercury exposure primarily comes from eating large fish, prompting warnings from the EPA and FDA. Legislative proposals in the 109th Congress aim to reduce mercury levels in various sources. Various proposals and regulations aim to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired electric utilities and other sources to address mercury contamination in freshwater lakes and streams. The urgency of emission controls, effectiveness in reducing fish contamination, and geographical distribution of reductions are key considerations in these policy proposals. The CRS report provides background information on mercury contamination in fish, discussing sources, fate, and toxicity of mercury in the environment. It summarizes recent scientific findings on how mercury moves through the environment, concentrates in fish, and the risks to human health and wildlife. The curr_chunk discusses arguments and questions in the policy context regarding mercury in the environment. It mentions specific regulatory proposals to reduce environmental mercury and provides information on the legislative and regulatory activities to control mercury. Mercury is described as a natural element found in various forms in rocks, soil, water, air, plants, and animals. Mercury occurs in elemental form as a liquid or vapor, often combined with other elements in compounds. Natural forces move mercury through the environment, from air to soil to water, and back again. Human activities have released mercury into the environment through mining and fossil fuel combustion. Mercury released into the environment through mining and fossil fuel combustion has increased the portion actively cycling through the atmosphere, surface waters, plants, and animals. Roughly three to five times more mercury is mobilized today compared to before industrialization, with some studies suggesting even higher levels. In 1995, about 1,913 metric tons of mercury were newly emitted. In 1995, approximately 2,427 metric tons of mercury were emitted globally from various human activities, accounting for 50% to 75% of total annual global mercury emissions. This is in addition to natural mercury emissions estimated to be between 1,600 and 3,200 metric tons per year. Mercury emissions range from 1,600 to 3,200 metric tons per year globally, with activities like mining, burning fossil fuels, and industrial processes contributing. In the United States, annual mercury emissions are decreasing, with coal-fired electric utilities being the largest source. The EPA estimates U.S. national emissions, with additional emissions from gold mines. The EPA emission inventory for 1995 was updated by CRS to include 12 tons of emissions from gold mines, which were previously unidentified. The \"other\" category in the inventory includes emissions from various industries, such as iron and steel mills. EPA noted that some sources, like iron and steel production using mercury-contaminated scrap, were not accounted for in the inventory. Mobile source emissions are not included in the inventory yet, as the agency is still developing an estimate. The implementation of medical waste incinerator rules under the Clean Air Act has occurred since the completion of the 1999 inventory. The Clean Air Act waste incinerator rules have been fully implemented, reducing emissions. Gold mining emissions have decreased due to a voluntary project. Chlorine production emissions may have declined, with some facilities closing. Seigneur et al. included emissions from landfills and electric arc furnaces in their estimates. EPA estimates for waste incineration emissions in 1999 differ from Seigneur's estimates for 1998. EPRI provided estimates for utility emissions. Power Research Institute (EPRI) provided estimates for utility emissions based on measurements of mercury content in coal and stack emissions collected in 1999. The chemical form of mercury determines its movement through air, water, and soil. Elemental mercury emissions can remain airborne for over a year, while particulate and reactive gaseous mercury are found in smaller amounts in the atmosphere. Reactive gaseous mercury from coal-fired electric utility emissions can deposit within 100 kilometers of the emission point. The chemical form of mercury in the atmosphere can change, affecting its fate and deposition. Gaseous mercury is more likely to form and deposit in sunlight, leading to lower concentrations during the day. Mercury deposition in North America peaks in summer. Summer mercury deposition in North America peaks due to increased solar energy sparking key chemical reactions, leading to rapid oxidation of elemental mercury by bromine, chlorine, ozone, or hydroxide in the lower atmosphere. This results in \"mercury depletion events\" where gaseous mercury is deposited to the surface without rain or snow. Ozone may also contribute to higher summer mercury deposition. Mercury deposition in summer is influenced by increased ozone levels and sunlight exposure. Mercury can be deposited onto plants or soil and may undergo various transformations. Soil, especially humus, can act as a significant repository for mercury. Atmospheric deposition is a major source of mercury contamination in surface water bodies. Mercury in water can be re-emitted to air, remain suspended, deposited in sediments, or absorbed by living organisms. Mercury deposited in the ocean surface may be re-emitted back into the air. The concentration of mercury in the deep ocean mixing layer is increasing slightly each year. Approximately 5,000 metric tons of mercury are deposited globally each year. Historical records from glaciers and peat cores show the impact of mercury emissions on land. The impact of mercury emissions on land is recorded in historical records from glaciers and peat cores. These records show the rise in mercury emissions and deposition due to mining and industrialization. However, the relationship between specific emissions and deposits is complex and depends on various factors such as chemical form, environmental conditions, and proximity to emission sources. Atmospheric deposition is higher in areas closer to emission sources and with more rainfall. EPA estimates that 60% of mercury deposited in the United States is from local or regional sources. Mercury deposition in the United States varies by region, with higher levels in the east. Factors like climate, soil types, and vegetation influence deposition, creating \"hot spots.\" Sources of mercury emissions can change over time, affecting deposition patterns. Historical records from glaciers show peaks in mercury deposition after volcanic eruptions and during events like the California Gold Rush. Ecosystem impacts are complex and influenced by both local and global factors. Mercury contamination in ecosystems is influenced by both local and global factors. Monitoring and modeling efforts are underway in the United States to determine sources of mercury contamination and develop plans to restore impaired waters. Over 700 bodies of water in the US are impaired by mercury, with air deposition being a common source. States are working on Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to address these impairments, with pilot projects in the Florida Everglades and Devil's Lake in Wisconsin. Mercury contamination in ecosystems is influenced by local and global factors. In the Florida Everglades, at least half of the mercury is emitted locally, while 5-29% is emitted regionally. EPA estimates 80% of mercury deposition in Pines Lakes, New Jersey, comes from U.S. sources. In contrast, most mercury in the Arctic comes from distant sources. Soil and sediment bacteria can convert inorganic mercury to methylmercury, which is more toxic to animals. Methylmercury is highly toxic and easily absorbed by animals, accumulating in their bodies when ingested. It is stored in muscle tissue, leading to higher exposure in animals higher on the food chain. Predatory fish, fish-eating birds, and fish-eating mammals at the top of food chains have the greatest concentrations of methylmercury. In the Florida Everglades, fish can have methylmercury concentrations up to ten million times greater than in water. Inorganic mercury does not transfer easily through the food chain and does not concentrate at higher levels with each nutritional link. Recent research indicates that some ecosystems are particularly sensitive to relatively small mercury inputs, leading to high rates of methylmercury production and accumulation. Sensitive ecosystems include low-alkalinity and humic lakes, wetlands, and surface waters connected to wetlands. In ecosystems with low oxygen and high acidity, methylmercury formation by sulfate-reducing bacteria is favored. Levels of sulfate and mercury determine methylmercury production and bioaccumulation. A decrease in mercury deposition led to a 30% decrease in methylmercury in yellow perch. The link between industrial emissions and mercury levels in oceans is unclear. The role of oceans in mercury cycling is poorly understood. Reactive inorganic mercury is deposited in oceans, and methylmercury is found in marine fish. Methylmercury levels are low in the surface layer but higher in fish, possibly from industrial emissions or natural ocean reservoirs. Formation of methylmercury in oceans is uncertain. Scientists argue that methylmercury is likely formed in deep ocean sediments or near thermal vents on the ocean floor, rather than being solely deposited from atmospheric sources. They believe that the current levels of methylmercury in ocean fish cannot be explained by atmospheric deposition alone, considering the large reservoir of mercury in the deep sea and the slow mixing of ocean depths with surface layers where fish feed. Even if all the mercury deposited into the oceans over the past century were mixed to the deepest depths, the increase in ocean water mercury concentration would only be around 1% to 10% from pre-industrial levels. On the other hand, some scientists suggest that sulfate-reducing bacteria in coastal sediments may be responsible for forming methylmercury, which is then taken up by aquatic organisms in near-shore waters. Small fish and other animals in near-shore waters concentrate mercury, which is then passed on to larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. While atmospheric mercury deposition has likely increased, leading to higher mercury levels in the oceans, data on mercury levels in ocean water and fish are lacking. One study found increased mercury levels in fish-eating seabirds' feathers, but overall measurements are inconclusive due to the difficulty of measuring mercury. The measurement of methylmercury has only been possible since about 1985, with past measurements of total mercury often inaccurate due to contamination. A study comparing mercury concentrations in yellowfin tuna from 1971 to 1998 found no significant differences. However, a study on fish-eating birds in the northern Atlantic Ocean showed a significant increase in methylmercury concentrations over time. Methylmercury concentrations in bird feathers increased annually between 1885 and 1994, correlating with rises in mercury levels in the atmosphere and oceans due to human activities. Birds consuming fish from deeper ocean layers showed higher methylmercury increases. Methylmercury is toxic to the nervous system of humans and animals, with health effects appearing after a delay from exposure. Absorbed methylmercury spreads throughout the body, potentially causing brain damage. Methylmercury can cause structural damage in the brain, leading to symptoms like tingling, numbness, coordination loss, weakness, tremors, and even death. Exposure can result in irreversible brain effects, even without observable symptoms. Pregnant women are at risk as methylmercury easily crosses the placenta, impacting fetal development. Lower exposure levels can affect coordination, concentration, and thought processes. Methylmercury easily crosses the placenta, affecting fetal brain development. Exposure can lead to cognitive developmental effects, even at low levels. Incidents in Iraq and Japan resulted in severe outcomes for exposed children. There is a consensus that even low levels of methylmercury exposure, such as 10 ppm in maternal hair, can have prenatal effects. Some studies suggest adverse effects may occur at levels as low as 3 ppm. Effects at very low levels may be subtle and only detectable on a population level. The EPA commissioned a report from the NRC in 2000, which confirmed the sensitivity of the human fetus to prenatal methylmercury exposure. A study published in 2003 strengthened and extended the findings of the single major study of children exposed to methylmercury before birth. Human sensitivity to cardiovascular toxicity might be greater than developmental neurotoxicity. Recent research results suggest that mercury exposure, particularly at levels of 2 ppm or higher in hair, is associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction. This risk may be due to mercury interfering with the protective effects of fish-derived fatty acids against heart disease. Studies have shown a reduction in the protective effect of fatty acids in individuals with higher mercury levels in their hair. The association between total mercury exposure and cardiovascular disease remains inconclusive. Further research is needed to understand the interactions among risk factors, fish-derived fatty acids, and mercury exposure in relation to heart disease. Different methods can be used to measure recent and longer-term mercury exposure in individuals, such as blood and hair analysis. However, measuring exposure from several years ago is not possible due to the breakdown and excretion of mercury in the body over time. Mercury is excreted over time, with about half eliminated within 44-80 days. Unlike lead, mercury does not accumulate in the body long-term. Adverse health effects are unlikely if toxic exposure ends before accumulation. The NHANES collected blood mercury data from U.S. women of child-bearing age. Mercury levels in blood are lower than in tissues like hair. Mercury concentrations in blood are much lower than in tissues like hair, expressed as parts per billion (ppb). The CDC found that mercury levels were generally low in women of child-bearing age and children in the U.S. population based on data from 2001-2002. Most mercury exposure in the U.S. comes from eating fish, especially predatory fish like bass, pike, tuna, or swordfish, which can be highly contaminated. NHANES 1999-2000 found that women who ate three or more servings of fish within a month had higher blood mercury levels. However, most women who ate fish frequently had blood mercury levels below 11 ppb. Fish mercury levels vary by species, age, and size, with some fish having very high mercury levels. High levels of mercury have been found in fish, especially in areas with water pollution. Different fish species have varying sensitivity to mercury, with toxic effects seen in adult fish with mercury levels between 6 ppm (e.g., walleyes) and 20 ppm (e.g., salmon) in muscle tissue. Older, larger fish tend to have higher mercury levels. Methylmercury levels in fish can vary greatly depending on the water they live in. The potential adverse health effects of consuming fish with high methylmercury levels are a concern for Congress. Federal agencies have set different maximum allowable concentration levels for methylmercury exposure, leading to inconsistencies in determining a \"safe\" exposure level. The EPA Reference Dose (RfD) is a risk assessment tool used to estimate safe daily intake levels of chemicals like methylmercury. Exposure above the RfD may increase health risks, especially for sensitive populations like pregnant women and infants. The RfD is calculated using a \"no observed adverse effect level\" (NOAEL) to determine the threshold of exposure without harmful effects. The EPA established its first Reference Dose (RfD) in 1985 for methylmercury exposure, based on adverse effects seen in poisoned individuals. The RfD is set at 0.3 micrograms of methylmercury per kilogram of body weight per day, derived from the lowest level of exposure causing nervous system issues in adult Iraqis and Japanese. In the mid-1950s, adverse effects of maternal mercury exposure on Iraqi children were observed. In 1995, EPA revised its Reference Dose (RfD) to 0.1 \u03bcg/kg bw/day based on developmental effects. This RfD remains in effect and would be exceeded with more than one fish meal per week containing over 0.21 ppm of mercury. The benchmark dose for methylmercury was calculated in 1997 at 11 ppm based on adverse health effects. The EPA calculated benchmark dose for methylmercury exposure in Iraqi children was 11 to 17 ppm, based on various studies. This level was deemed safe for unborn children of women who consumed contaminated grain in Iraq. The EPA established a Reference Dose (RfD) for mercury exposure at 0.1 \u03bcg/kg bw/day, based on a daily dose of 1.1 \u03bcg/kg bw/day divided by an uncertainty factor of 10. This level of exposure would result in mercury concentrations of 4-5 ppb in blood and 1 ppm in hair for adults. The Science Advisory Board supported the 1997 EPA RfD, but advised considering an additional uncertainty factor for long-term exposure effects. The NRC recommended that EPA base its Reference Dose (RfD) on evidence of chronic toxicity among island dwellers exposed to methylmercury through fish. Maternal exposure to 1.0 \u03bcg/kg bw/day of methylmercury could double the proportion of children functioning at an abnormally low level. Mothers with that level of exposure would have about 12 ppm methylmercury in their hair and fetuses would be exposed to about 58 ppb in cord blood. Recent analyses suggest that the relationship between cord blood and maternal mercury intake varies. EPA revised the RfD for methylmercury to 0.1 \u03bcg/kg bw/day, which is considered protective for all populations in the US. In 2001, EPA established a water quality criterion for methylmercury in fish tissue at 0.3 ppm to protect consumers. The EPA revised the RfD for methylmercury to 0.1 \u03bcg/kg bw/day, which is considered protective for all populations in the US. The ATSDR established a Minimum Risk Level (MRL) for chronic exposure to methylmercury at 0.3 \u03bcg/kg bw/day in 1999. This concentration should not be exceeded to protect consumers of fish and shellfish. The FDA established an action level in 1984 at a concentration of 1 ppm methylmercury in fish or seafood products sold through interstate commerce, with an Acceptable Daily Intake for adults at 0.42 \u03bcg/kg bw/day. This level is slightly higher than the EPA's RfD of 0.3 \u03bcg/kg bw/day. The FDA action level is based on the mid-point of the estimated range of the \"lowest observed adverse effects level\" (LOAEL) of 300 \u03bcg of methylmercury/day, with a margin of safety factored in. The FDA action level for methylmercury in fish and shellfish is set at 1 ppm, enforceable through seizure of contaminated products. FDA advises women of child-bearing age to limit fish consumption based on EPA's RfD. Discrepancies in safe exposure levels among FDA, ATSDR, and EPA are minimal and serve different purposes. EPA's level considers lifetime exposure, while ATSDR's is for chronic exposure. Table 4 consolidates quantitative information from various agencies for comparing methylmercury concentrations in popular fish with federal guidelines. Table 5 estimates the number of meals of fish with different contamination levels that can be consumed without exceeding the EPA RfD. Factors such as meal size, fish size, and consumer age can affect poisoning risks. Consumers' risk of poisoning from methylmercury in fish increases with factors like age, size, and amount consumed. Different fish have varying levels of methylmercury, so daily consumption of 7 ounces can result in different exposure levels. On average, U.S. fish consumption is 7-14 ounces per month, exposing fish eaters to 4 \u03bcg of mercury per day, below the RfD. The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates fish consumption rates in the United States annually. In 2002, per person consumption was 15.6 pounds of fish, with 77% being imported. Consumption rate estimates are higher when only fish eaters are considered. Data on fish consumption are limited. In the Mercury Study Report to Congress, EPA estimated that 85% of adults in the United States consume fish and shellfish at least once a month, with about 40% selecting fish and shellfish as part of their diets at least once a week. Data from NHANES 1999-2002 shows that exposure to methylmercury exceeds the RfD for approximately 6% of women of child-bearing age. This percentage is based on four years of data and is not statistically significant for a declining trend. More data is needed to confirm any changes in exposure levels. Approximately 16% of study subjects who identified as Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, or multiracial had blood mercury levels greater than the reference level. Data from certain areas of the California coast showed that 5% of consumers ate more than 161 grams per day of self-caught fish, resulting in high methylmercury intake. A 1988 study of Michigan anglers found that 5% consumed 98 grams of freshwater fish per day, exceeding recommended levels for contaminated species. More data is needed to confirm trends in blood mercury levels. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between fish consumption and methylmercury exposure, highlighting the importance of considering factors beyond methylmercury concentration, such as the health benefits of omega fatty acids. A study on mother-child pairs supported the benefits of fish consumption for infant intellectual development. The study found that VRM scores in infants increased with fish consumption but decreased when maternal hair mercury levels exceeded 1.2 ppm. Pregnant women are advised to eat fish high in fatty acids and low in mercury, such as lake trout and salmon. Wildlife exposure to methylmercury mainly occurs through fish consumption, leading to high mercury levels in fish-eating predators. Fish-eating birds can eliminate methylmercury when forming new feathers and demethylate it, making it less toxic. However, some species may still be harmed by methylmercury exposure in certain environments, potentially weakening their immune system and impairing their ability to reproduce. Common loons show increasing mercury levels in their blood from west to east in Canada, with the highest levels in southeast Canada. A study of loon eggs across eight U.S. states also found a similar trend of increasing mercury levels. Eggs collected across eight U.S. states from Alaska to Maine showed increasing mercury concentrations from west to east, consistent with the pattern of mercury deposition in North America. Studies have reported declining egg volume with increasing mercury concentrations in New England, but data on subtle effects of mercury exposure on mink are lacking. Mink and otter exposed to high levels of methylmercury in their diets exhibit poisoning symptoms and may die, with concentrations above 0.4 ppm linked to reduced egg laying in prey fish. Recent scientific studies have provided potentially useful information for policy makers regarding the effects of mercury exposure on mink. While there are no field data indicating adverse health effects on wildlife species at risk, such as those that eat fish, studies have shown chemical changes to mercury emissions in the atmosphere, rates of mercury deposition, and the relationship between mercury emissions and levels in freshwater fish. This information can help inform debates on reducing mercury emissions from utilities. Mercury emissions from electric utilities are a major concern for levels of mercury in freshwater fish, despite efforts to control other sources. Scientific studies show that human activities have significantly increased mercury levels in the atmosphere and on earth. Policy makers are debating on how to reduce mercury deposition, with a focus on controlling utility emissions. Local and regional emissions have led to a tenfold increase in mercury deposition in some areas, creating potential \"hot spots\" of contamination. Decreases in emissions have shown a proportional decrease in deposition and methylmercury levels in freshwater fish. Controlling mercury emissions from power plants could significantly reduce deposition in nearby hot spots, but the link between emissions and mercury in ocean fish is still uncertain. Scientists have found that significant amounts of mercury emissions end up in the oceans, leading to high levels of methylmercury in marine fish and seabirds. There are potential risks to both people and wildlife, even in areas far from emission sources. Research shows that low levels of methylmercury exposure can have subtle impacts on human health, especially for those who consume large amounts of certain predatory fish. Despite these risks, the nutritional benefits of consuming fish with low mercury contamination should not be overlooked."
