    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Ocean Habitat Protection Act of 2002\" and includes findings related to ocean habitats. Congress finds that fish and marine species in seafloor habitats within the US exclusive economic zone are valuable resources, essential for biodiversity, food supply, economy, and coastal community economies. Commercial and recreational fishing are significant for employment and the US economy's health. The United States relies on healthy and diverse ocean ecosystems for various benefits such as income, nutrition, medicines, and raw materials. Marine habitats contain a variety of species, including sponges and deep-sea corals, that have not been fully studied for their potential benefits to society. Geologic structures and marine biodiversity are crucial for numerous fish species, providing food and shelter from predation. Bottom trawling reduces habitat complexity and biological diversity in seabed ecosystems. Bottom trawling reduces biodiversity by altering geologic bedforms and exposing benthic organisms to predators. This practice is harmful to commercially important species and industries that depend on them. Technological advancements have enabled bottom trawling in complex marine habitats, impacting once-protected marine life. The expansion of bottom trawling to complex marine habitats over the past 20 years has had significant adverse effects on diversity and habitat complexity. Scientific studies show that bottom trawling is especially damaging to habitats like corals, boulder fields, and sponge beds, reducing their value for economically and ecologically important marine life. Recovery of these areas to their natural state after trawling may take decades or centuries. Prohibiting large rockhopper, roller, and other ground gear is a practical measure to protect marine habitats from bottom trawling damage. Prohibition on using large rockhopper and roller gear on bottom trawl nets is implemented to protect marine habitats from damage caused by bottom trawling. The purpose of this section is to prevent bottom trawls with large gear from damaging marine habitats needed by fish and other marine life. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to prohibit the use of bottom trawls with rollers, bobbins, tires, rockhoppers, or other devices over 8 inches in diameter. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to prohibit the use of bottom trawls with gear over 8 inches in diameter beyond the exclusive economic zone. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act prohibits the use of bottom trawls with gear over 8 inches in diameter beyond the exclusive economic zone."
