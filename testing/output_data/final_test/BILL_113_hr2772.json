    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rape Survivor Child Custody Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that men who father children through rape should be prohibited from having custody or visiting those children. Studies estimate 25,000 to 32,000 rape-related pregnancies annually in the US, leading to custody battles for women who choose to raise their children conceived through rape. Despite the challenges, a significant number of women decide to keep and raise their children born from rape. (6) Rape is severely under-prosecuted, with less than 5% resulting in criminal conviction. (7) The clear and convincing evidence standard is commonly used for termination of parental rights. (8) The Supreme Court ruled that this standard satisfies due process for parental rights termination. (9) Only 6 States allow rape survivors to petition for termination of parental rights of the rapist. (10) Rapists seeking parental or custody rights create challenges. (10) A rapist seeking parental or custody rights can traumatize the survivor and hinder her recovery. (11) This trauma can negatively impact the mother's ability to raise a healthy child. (12) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody to coerce survivors into not prosecuting rape. The Attorney General will provide grants to States with laws allowing mothers of children conceived through rape to seek termination of parental rights of the rapist upon clear evidence of rape. States must apply for grants by submitting required information, including details about the law. SEC. 5. GRANT AMOUNT.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $5,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year from 2014 to 2018."
