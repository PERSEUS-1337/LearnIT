The VA operates nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA), with the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) handling compensation and pensions, and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) maintaining veterans' cemeteries and providing burial benefits. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides health care services, medical research programs, and education for veterans. It offers primary and specialized care, inpatient and outpatient services, and support during national emergencies. Additionally, VHA provides headstones and markers for eligible persons in state veterans' cemeteries. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) offers health care services, research programs, and education for veterans. Eligibility for VA health care is based on military service and service-connected disabilities. Enrolled veterans may receive care from VA or other sources like Medicare and Medicaid without paying premiums. The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 aims to increase access and lower wait times for veterans seeking care at VA facilities. It establishes the Veterans Choice Program, allowing veterans to receive care outside the VA system if they meet certain criteria. Congress provided $10 billion in funding for the Choice Program over three years. The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 provided $10 billion in funding over three years to increase veterans' access to healthcare. Additionally, $5 billion was allocated to hire more physicians and staff and improve VA infrastructure. Approximately 9.1 million veterans were enrolled in the VA health care system in FY2014, with a 6.3% increase in total enrollees from FY2011 to FY2014. In FY2014, approximately 9.1 million veterans were enrolled in the VA health care system. VA anticipated treating about 6.7 million patients in FY2015, including over 757,000 OEF, OIF, and OND veterans, representing 11.2% of patients served. The total number of patients treated by VA has grown by 9.3% between FY2011 and FY2015. The total number of outpatient visits at VA has grown by 9.3% between FY2011 and FY2015, reaching 91.7 million in FY2013 and projected to increase to 94.6 million in FY2014 and 97.2 million in FY2015. The report focuses on appropriations for VHA, including a brief overview of budget formulation and recent legislative developments for FY2015. Congress authorized advance appropriations for three VHA accounts in 2009. The Department of Veterans Affairs receives advance appropriations for VHA accounts, including medical services, support, compliance, and facilities. Congress first provided advance appropriations in FY2010, with subsequent appropriations for FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) amended 38 U.S.C \u00a7117 to include three more accounts for advance appropriations for FY2016 within the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). These accounts cover compensation and pensions, readjustment benefits, and veterans insurance and indemnities. Starting with the FY2016 MILCON-VA Appropriations bill, these accounts will also receive advance appropriations for FY2017. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) provided advance appropriations for VHA accounts for FY2016, with funding shown in the memorandum for the corresponding fiscal year. The VA budget includes both mandatory and discretionary funding. Mandatory accounts fund various benefits and services, while discretionary accounts fund medical care, research, construction, and operating expenses. Enacted appropriations from FY1995 to FY2014 for the VA are provided in Appendix B, including allocations for VBA, VHA, and NCA. In FY2014, the total VA budget authority was approximately $147.9 billion, with discretionary budget authority accounting for about 42.8%. The VA's budget for FY2014 was approximately $147.9 billion, with discretionary funding accounting for 42.8%. Of the discretionary funding, 86.9% went towards VA health care programs, while mandatory funding accounted for 57.4% of the total budget authority. The FY2015 President's budget request included approximately $158.6 billion, with a major portion allocated to compensation and pension benefits for veterans and their families. The VA formulates its budget request 10 months before the President submits it to Congress. The budget is based on the Enrollee Health Care Projection Model and the CHAMPVA Model to estimate resources needed for health care services for veterans and their families. The EHCPM and CHAMPVA Model are used by the VA to estimate resources needed for health care services for veterans and their families. The EHCPM makes projections three or four years into the future, while the CHAMPVA Model projects the cost of providing medical coverage to CHAMPVA eligible beneficiaries. The enrollment model and claims cost model are used by the VHA to project the number of beneficiaries enrolled in CHAMPVA and the expenditures for providing care. The 2013 CHAMPVA Model was developed using data from fiscal years 2005 to 2012 and input from a development team. VHA is funded through four appropriations accounts, including medical care, research, and administration. Congress also appropriates funds for construction. In FY2004, Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure to provide better oversight and accurate accounting of funds. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act funded VHA through four accounts: medical services, medical administration, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care for veterans and dependents, including care in non-VA facilities and outpatient care on a fee basis. The medical services account covers expenses for inpatient and outpatient care for veterans and dependents, including care in non-VA facilities, outpatient care on a fee basis, medical supplies, equipment, salaries, and expenses of employees hired under Title 38, U.S.C., cost of hospital food service operations, aid to state veterans' homes, and assistance for family caregivers of veterans authorized by the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-163). The President's budget request for FY2013 proposed transferring funding for biomedical engineering services from the medical facilities account to this account, which was approved by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-6). The President's budget request for FY2014 continued funding for biomedical engineering services in the medical services account. The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2015 (H.R. 4486) continues to fund bioengineering services under the medical services account for expenses related to the management, security, and administration of the VA health care system. This includes funding for VA medical centers, community-based outpatient clinics, Vet Centers, Veterans Integrated Service Network offices, facility director offices, public health programs, quality management programs, and training programs. The medical facilities account funds expenses for VHA's capital infrastructure operations and maintenance, including utilities, administrative expenses, construction projects, leases, laundry services, grounds maintenance, and research programs for veterans' healthcare needs. VA researchers receive funding from various sources including the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and private sources. Research is primarily conducted by VA investigators at VA facilities. Unlike other federal agencies, VA does not have the authority to make research grants to non-VA entities. Congress allows VHA to bill some veterans and health care insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover costs. The VA health care system collects funds from copayments and insurance bills to defray the cost of medical services for veterans. Congress faced challenges with funding in FY2014, leading to a partial government shutdown. A temporary CR was eventually agreed upon to reopen the government. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) provided $147.9 billion in budget authority for VA programs in FY2014, with $54.9 billion allocated for VHA. $40 million was designated for the medical services account. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2014 provides additional funding of $85 million for FY2014 for medical facilities to address maintenance needs at VA hospitals. Advance appropriations of $55.6 billion for FY2015 are allocated for VHA accounts as per the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009. $229 million is rescinded from the FY2014 VHA accounts. The FY2015 President's Budget is requesting $158.6 billion for the VA as a whole, with $56.6 billion allocated for VHA. This includes funding for medical services, medical support and compliance, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The budget also includes $58.6 billion in advance appropriations for medical care accounts. The House approved a Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for FY2015 (H.R. 4486) with a total of $158.2 billion for the VA, including $93.5 billion for mandatory programs and $64.7 billion for discretionary programs. The bill proposes $56.2 billion for VHA for FY2015. H.R. 4486 proposes $56.2 billion for VHA for FY2015, with four accounts: medical services, medical support and compliance, medical facilities, and medical and prosthetic research. The House-passed measure does not include the additional funding amount requested by the President. H.R. 4486 also proposes $58.6 billion in advance FY2016 funding for various accounts. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2015, proposing $158.6 billion for the VA, including $56.4 billion for VHA. The committee recommended $45.1 billion for the medical services account, with an additional $1 million over the FY2015 advanced appropriations. The committee recommendation for the medical facilities account is $4.8 billion, including an additional $125 million over the FY2015 advanced appropriations to address maintenance needs at VHA hospitals and clinics. Additionally, $5.9 billion is recommended for the medical support and compliance account, and approximately $589 million for the medical and prosthetic research account. The MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2015 proposes an advance appropriation of $58.6 billion for medical services, support, and facilities accounts for FY2016, matching the President's request. The House and Senate passed a Continuing Appropriations Resolution (CR), 2015, on September 17 and 18, respectively, which was signed into law on September 19, 2014. The CR funded government agencies and programs, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, at a reduced rate through December 11, 2014. The VA's medical care accounts for FY2015 were not affected due to advance appropriations provided by a previous act. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) was signed into law on December 16, 2014, providing $159.1 billion in budget authority for VA programs in FY2015. $56.4 billion was allocated for VHA, including medical services, support, facilities, and compliance. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 83; P.L. 113-235) allocated $209 million for the medical services account in addition to the advance appropriation of approximately $45.0 billion for VA programs in FY2015. This additional funding is for higher than expected costs associated with Hepatitis-C drug therapies, demand for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, and unfunded provisions in the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) provides advance appropriations of $58.7 billion for FY2016 for VHA accounts. It also includes a pilot program called the ''Physician Ambassadors Helping Veterans Program'' to address difficulties non-VA physicians face when volunteering at VA medical facilities. The MILCON-VA Appropriations Act, 2015 provides advance appropriations for VHA accounts and includes the Physician Ambassadors Helping Veterans Program to address difficulties non-VA physicians face when volunteering at VA medical facilities. The VA is urged to appoint physicians on a volunteer basis to serve veterans' healthcare needs and establish a three-year pilot program in two VA medical facilities. The Explanatory Statement language urges the Secretary to select medical facilities for a pilot program addressing physician shortages and long appointment wait times. Each pilot location must have a volunteer coordinator to educate non-VA physicians about the program. Physician ambassadors must commit to a requisite number of hours per year to serve at a facility. Physician ambassadors at VA medical facilities must commit to serving a minimum of 60 hours and a maximum of 100 hours per year. There is no limit to the total number of hours they can volunteer annually. The facility must agree on the minimum hours required before starting the credentialing process."
