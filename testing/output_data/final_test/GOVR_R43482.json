Delayed periods of availability may be provided for specific programs to meet budgetary needs. Delayed periods of availability are typically provided for specific programs to meet budgetary needs, such as preventing funding shortfalls late in the fiscal year or gaps in the following year. Some programs like Medicaid, Veterans Health Administration, and Department of Education formula grants receive funds for delayed availability, authorized by statutory provisions. Delayed periods of availability for funds are authorized by statutory provisions to prevent funding shortfalls or gaps in specific programs. Congressional rules require a statutory authorization before appropriations can be made, and the authorizing statute or legislative history may dictate the timing of future funds. Congress can also decide to use a delayed period of availability during the annual appropriations process, even if the program's authorization is silent on timing. During the annual appropriations process, funds may be available for a delayed period, with appropriations provided on a schedule aligned with the budget year. Different approaches like \"advance appropriations,\" \"forward funding,\" and \"advance funding\" are used, each with specific periods of availability for obligation. Advance appropriations are available at least one fiscal year after the budget year, forward funding starts late in the budget year and extends into the following fiscal year, and advance funding is for the next fiscal year and becomes available late in the budget year. Advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding have specific periods of availability for obligation. Advance appropriations become available after the budget year, forward funding extends into the following fiscal year, and advance funds expire once the budget year ends. These concepts have distinct timing regarding when the funds become available. Advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding have variations in implementation, including the interval and duration of availability for funds. Funds may be provided one or two fiscal years in advance and be available for one or multiple fiscal years. Programs may receive funds on different timetables, which can have budget process implications for Congress. Funds provided for delayed availability are subject to budget enforcement and their effects are attributed to specific fiscal years. Budget resolutions since FY2001 have imposed limits on advance appropriations for discretionary spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of FY2014 set limits on advance appropriations for discretionary spending in the House and Senate. Congressional rules require statutory authorization for delayed availability before appropriations. This report explores the implications of delayed periods of availability for programs. It discusses advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding, along with budget process details. The report discusses advance appropriations, forward funding, and advance funding in the context of the budget process. Advance appropriations provide budget authority that becomes available in future fiscal years after the appropriations act. According to the Congressional Budget Office, advance appropriations were first provided in 1962. Advance appropriations were first provided in 1962 for grants-in-aid, including airport construction and urban renewal. Currently, advance appropriations are used for various programs funded by discretionary and appropriated mandatory spending, with a significant implication being funding gaps if annual appropriations are not enacted by the beginning of the fiscal year. Funding gaps may occur at the start of the fiscal year or when a CR expires without replacement. Advance appropriations can help programs avoid the need for continuing appropriations. CRs can impact program operations in terms of funding levels, delivery, management support, and revenue collection. Some argue that programs with advance appropriations can engage in advance planning and make long-term commitments. Advance appropriations can assist agencies in planning multi-year capital expenditures. However, the ability to make commitments may be limited by forecasting programmatic needs in advance. Congress may prefer to control programs through regular annual appropriations. Congress may exercise control over programs through regular annual appropriations or advance appropriations, which are typically enacted one fiscal year prior to becoming available. For example, FY2013 funds for the \"medical facilities\" account of the Department of Veterans Affairs were provided one year in advance in the FY2012 appropriations act for various necessary expenses. The Department of Veterans Affairs received advance appropriations for medical facilities in FY2013, provided in the FY2012 appropriations act. The project costs for hospitals and homes under the Department's jurisdiction, including leases, laundry services, and reimbursements, amount to $5,441,000,000 for FY2012. In FY2014, an advance appropriation of $445,000,000 was made available with specified limitations. Different options exist for the duration of availability, ranging from one quarter to no fiscal year limitation. For example, payments for foster care and permanency had a one-quarter availability in FY2013, while tenant-based rental assistance had a no-year availability. The Department of Housing and Urban Development allocates $4 billion for tenant-based rental assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937. Advance appropriations may be adjusted in subsequent acts, with funds sometimes provided a year in advance and the remainder for the budget year. Rescissions can reduce advance appropriated funds. The Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated $14.9 billion for tenant-based rental assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937, with an additional $4 billion available in the following fiscal year. Advance appropriations were adjusted downward in the FY2011 appropriations act. In the FY2011 appropriations act, $650 million was rescinded from the $4 billion available for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance. This resulted in a total budget authority of $18.26 billion as of October 1, 2011. Forward funding allows budget authority to be available from the last quarter of the budget year into the following fiscal year. Forward funding allows budget authority to remain available beyond the fiscal year, typically for more than 12 months. This practice began around fiscal year 1976 when the federal fiscal year changed from July 1 to October 1. It was implemented to address difficulties in obligating funds for activities that spanned multiple fiscal years. This funding mechanism enables programs to make obligations in the summer and have funds available into the following fiscal year. Forward funding allows budget authority to remain available beyond the fiscal year, typically for more than 12 months. This enables programs like the Department of Education and the Department of Labor to receive funding in advance for activities that coincide with the school year, allowing for obligations to occur up to three months prior to the fiscal year. Forward funds are available starting on July 1 and can last for one year or multiple years. For example, the Community Service Employment for Older Americans account had funds available from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013, totaling $449,100,000. In contrast, the School Improvement Programs account had funds available for 15 months for school improvement activities. The curr_chunk discusses the allocation of $4,550,018,000 for various school improvement activities authorized by different acts. $2,725,246,000 will be available from July 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013. Forward funding is used for specific program aspects requiring summer obligations, while the rest is funded through regular appropriations. The Office of Job Corps received $1,706,171,000 for operations, construction, and necessary expenses, with funds available for specific periods. The Education for the Disadvantaged account received forward funding combined with advance appropriations totaling $15,750,983,000 for the period October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012. This included $4,817,117,000 available on July 1, 2012, and $10,841,177,000 available on October 1, 2012, for academic year 2012-2013. Advance funding allows for additional obligations late in the budget year, counted as part of the succeeding fiscal year's funding. Advance funds are provided in addition to the annual appropriation for an account, becoming available in the last two months of the budget year and must be charged to the succeeding fiscal year's appropriation. For example, FY2016 appropriations act provided $100 million for an account with additional budget authority for obligations after September 1, 2016, totaling $1 million by the end of the year. Advance funds are provided in addition to the annual appropriation for an account, becoming available in the last two months of the budget year. The obligations of the advance funds total $1 million at the end of FY2016. Subsequent appropriations for FY2017 total $100 million plus advance funding for that account. The $1 million in obligations of the FY2016 advance funding is charged against the $100 million for FY2017. FY2017 budget authority for new obligations is $99 million plus the advance funds for FY2017. Advance funding provisions date back to at least FY1967, historically provided for accounts funding payments based on an entitlement formula. The legacy of advance funding for certain entitlements predates current budget practices. Currently, only two accounts receive advance funding: Office of Workers Compensation Programs\u2014Special Benefits and Federal Unemployment Benefits and Allowances. These funds may help prevent funding shortfalls due to unpredictable changes in eligible beneficiaries. The Office of Workers Compensation Programs\u2014Special Benefits receives advance funds for the last seven weeks of the fiscal year to pay compensation, benefits, and expenses authorized by various acts. The Office of Workers Compensation Programs\u2014Special Benefits receives advance funds for the last seven weeks of the fiscal year to pay compensation, benefits, and expenses authorized by various acts, including the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers program which is provided advance funds for the last two weeks of the fiscal year. This includes payments for trade adjustment benefits, training, employment services, and allowances for job search and relocation. The Trade Act of 1974 provides funding for training, employment services, and allowances for job search and relocation under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. The funds are allocated for benefit payments, training, employment services, and state administrative expenses. There are budget process implications for using delayed availability of funds, as it affects the fiscal year to which the funds are attributed for budget enforcement. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 imposed limits on advance appropriations for discretionary spending since FY2001. If a delayed period of availability is not authorized by law, funds made available on such a schedule may be subject to a point of order under House and Senate rules. Statutory processes and congressional procedures enforce fiscal goals during budget consideration and enactment based on estimated budgetary effects. New budget authority is attributed to the first fiscal year available for obligation, so advance appropriations are not scored against the budget year covered by the bill in which they are enacted. Forward funding is scored against the budget year of the bill in which it is enacted, while advance funding is for mandatory spending and is attributed to the total projected budget authority and outlays required for the budget year. Congressional controls limit advance appropriations to prevent future budgetary impacts and circumvention of budgetary controls. The FY2001 budget resolution and subsequent resolutions have included provisions to limit future advance appropriations to prevent potential impacts on budget flexibility. Points of order were established in the House and Senate against legislation enacting advance appropriations above a specified amount, with procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate. The FY2001 budget resolution and subsequent resolutions included provisions to limit advance appropriations to maintain budget flexibility. Procedures for waiver and appeal in the Senate were also provided. The FY2002, FY2004, FY2006, FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 budget resolutions had similar restrictions and exemptions for advance appropriations, with changes in the accounts exempted. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 reinstated limits on advance appropriations in the House and Senate for FY2015 and FY2016. The FY2016 budget resolution imposed separate procedural limits for advance appropriations in the House and Senate. The House and Senate had different restrictions on advance appropriations for FY2015 and FY2016. The provisions limiting advance appropriations since FY2001 are detailed in the Appendix. Rules in both chambers restrict the content of appropriations measures to prevent changes to existing law. The House and Senate have different restrictions on advance appropriations. House rules generally prohibit appropriations beyond the fiscal year covered by the bill, unless authorized by law. Senate precedents are more ambiguous but may also restrict no-year appropriations without proper authorization. The House and Senate have different restrictions on advance appropriations. House rules generally prohibit appropriations beyond the fiscal year covered by the bill, unless authorized by law.
