The order was based on findings that international terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have carried out attacks on US personnel and facilities, creating a state of armed conflict requiring the use of the US Armed Forces. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, a national emergency was declared due to the threat of further attacks by individuals involved in international terrorism.
