The \"Persian Gulf War Veterans Health Act of 1998\" establishes a presumption of service connection for illnesses associated with service in the Persian Gulf during the Persian Gulf War, regardless of evidence during the period of service. The \"Persian Gulf War Veterans Health Act of 1998\" establishes a presumption of service connection for illnesses associated with exposure to toxic agents or hazards during service in the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from August 2, 1990, to December 31, 1991. Illnesses in Persian Gulf War veterans during this period are presumed to be linked to the agent or hazard unless conclusive evidence proves otherwise. The Secretary will contract an independent scientific body to establish a panel to review literature on diseases associated with exposure to specified materials. The panel will consist of non-Government scientific experts from various disciplines and must submit a report to the Secretary within one year. Upon submission of a report identifying diseases and illnesses associated with Persian Gulf War veterans, those diseases manifesting in veterans will be presumed service-connected. $1,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. The list of presumed exposures will be updated as new information confirms exposure to additional materials, with periodic contracts for identification and confirmation of such exposures. The Secretary will add diseases manifesting in Persian Gulf War veterans to the list of presumed service-connected illnesses. Persian Gulf War veterans are presumed to have been exposed to various hazardous materials including organophosphorous and carbamate pesticides, nerve agent prophylaxis, and chlorinated hydrocarbons. The list of hazardous materials that Persian Gulf War veterans were exposed to includes chlorinated hydrocarbons, pesticides, nerve agents, synthetic chemical compounds, ionizing radiation, and environmental pollutants. Persian Gulf War veterans were exposed to environmental particulates, pollutants, and diseases endemic to the region, as well as received multiple vaccines in a compressed time frame. The term 'Persian Gulf War veteran' refers to those who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from August 2, 1990, to December 31, 1991. The term 'non-Government scientific expert' is defined as an individual who is a scientific expert not employed by the United States and received less than 15 percent of income from federally funded research activities in the preceding 12 months. Section 1118 establishes presumptions of service connection for illnesses related to service in the Persian Gulf War. It also includes conforming amendments to title 38, United States Code. Additionally, there is a plan for medical surveillance of Persian Gulf War veterans and their families. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit a plan to Congress within 180 days to contract with an independent scientific body to establish a panel of non-Government experts to review illnesses among Persian Gulf War veterans and their families. The panel will establish criteria and a review plan to be submitted to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives. The President must submit a plan to Congress within 180 days for a permanent expert advisory group on chemical, biological, and radiological defense. The group will provide expert advice on defense technologies, procurement practices, and doctrine to defend against various battlefield materials."
