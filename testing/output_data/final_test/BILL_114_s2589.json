    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Terrorist Release Transparency Act\". The detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba were established in 2002 to detain individuals involved in terrorism against the United States. The facilities have held terrorists who have harmed civilians and received training in terrorism. Guantanamo Bay's location protects the US and its allies. Guantanamo Bay, established in 2002, holds terrorists involved in terrorism against the US. No prisoner has escaped. President Obama ordered the closure of the detention facilities in 2009, directing reviews for possible transfers or releases. The Secretary of State is tasked with negotiating with foreign governments to implement the order. Since 2009, the Department of State has been involved in transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay to foreign governments. President Obama released detainees, some of whom later engaged in terrorist activities. The number of detainees at Guantanamo Bay decreased to less than 100 due to increased transfers from 2014 to 2016, often to countries near their origins. The administration must notify Congress before transferring Guantanamo detainees to countries that lack the capacity to monitor or restrict their travel, to ensure they do not pose a threat to the United States or its allies. The administration classifies notifications about transferring Guantanamo detainees, limiting access to information and preventing transparency. Congress believes that the American people should be informed about detainees being released from Guantanamo Bay, their origins, destinations, and the host nation's ability to prevent recidivism. Transparency in the Obama Administration's compliance with Executive Order 13492 is also emphasized. Additionally, unclassified notice is required before transferring detainees to foreign countries or entities from Guantanamo Bay. Prior to transferring any Guantanamo detainee, the Secretary of State must provide Congress with a notice containing the individual's details, destination, past transfers to that country, and any known terrorist activities post-transfer. A briefing to Congress is also required within 5 days of the notice submission. The Secretary of State must notify Congress before transferring any Guantanamo detainee, providing details on the individual, destination, past transfers, and post-transfer terrorist activities. A briefing to Congress within 5 days is also required, explaining the choice of destination country and future transfer considerations. This Act is not inconsistent with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Definitions include the appropriate committees of Congress and individuals detained at Guantanamo. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is defined in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016."
