    "content": "The federal government's role in providing geospatial information has shifted towards consuming rather than producing, with a focus on coordinating and managing data from various sources. Challenges in coordinating geospatial data acquisition and usage across different levels of government and the private sector remain unresolved. The Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations, and the Census held hearings on coordinating and sharing geospatial data between different government levels. Congress is concerned about quantifying the cost of geospatial information to the federal government. Representative Adam Putnam emphasized the need to understand government programs, spending, data sharing efficiency, and coordination with State and local governments. The federal government recognizes the need for better coordination with State and local authorities in managing geospatial data. Efforts to coordinate data collection and sharing have been ongoing since 1990 with the establishment of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and Executive Order 12906 in 1994. The Executive Order 12906, issued in 1994, aimed to enhance policies in Circular A-16 by coordinating the development of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and establishing a National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse. The FGDC, with high-level leadership and broad membership, plays a crucial role in managing geospatial information for the federal government. The FGDC, under Circular A-16, is tasked with managing federal geospatial data as a capital asset. Questions remain about its effectiveness, organizational structure, and coordination with state and local entities. The 112th Congress may consider reducing duplication and costs in managing geospatial information. The report discusses managing, sharing, and coordinating geospatial information, including legislative examples and recommendations from non-governmental entities. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations from non-governmental organizations to improve geospatial information coordination at federal and state levels. It also highlights how federal agencies use GIS for various purposes like producing floodplain maps and responding to natural hazards. The Department of the Interior states that 80% of government information has a geospatial component. Challenges in handling federal geospatial information include organizing and managing data, sharing data among stakeholders, and coordinating at the federal level. The challenges in handling federal geospatial information include coordinating among federal agencies and managing data duplication. The need to organize and share geospatial data among various stakeholders is a recurring theme. The challenges in handling federal geospatial information include coordinating among federal agencies and managing data duplication. The recurring theme is the inefficiency of collecting data multiple times for the same purpose. Efforts to create a national spatial data infrastructure have not fully achieved seamless coordination of geospatial data. The FGDC exists to foster development and coordination in this area. The FGDC aims to promote the development and implementation of the NSDI, facilitating data sharing across government, academia, and the private sector. Some in the geospatial community feel past efforts have fallen short and advocate for a new \"national GIS\" or \"NSDI 2.0\" to enhance efficiency and interoperability. They view NSDI as critical digital infrastructure akin to roads and telecommunications, essential for the national economy. The Circular A-16 issued in 1953 aimed to avoid duplication of effort in federal mapping activities. Revisions in 1990 and 2002 extended coordination to include digital data. Efforts to improve management and coordination continue with OMB's 2006 memorandum emphasizing maximizing geospatial investments. The Obama Administration issued a memorandum in 2010 providing supplemental guidance on OMB Circular A-16, labeling geospatial data as a capital asset and emphasizing the need for coordinated federal investments to avoid duplication and data deficiencies. The supplemental guidance on OMB Circular A-16 aims to address issues such as lack of transparency, data deficiencies, and inefficient resource use by promoting a portfolio-centric model for managing investments in geospatial data. This approach emphasizes consistent policy, improved organization, better governance, and understanding of the electorate to deliver better results. The management approach aims to enable the FGDC to make informed decisions about priorities for geospatial datasets and collaboration targets across agencies. It involves inventory, selection, organization, evaluation, and monitoring of Federal geospatial dataset priorities to support mission needs. It is unclear if this new approach differs significantly from the current one. A financial asset portfolio management approach could offer a more consistent way of managing diverse geospatial assets. The supplemental guidance outlines a process for managing geospatial assets within the annual budget cycle, calling it an annual investment review process. This approach aims to provide a consistent way of identifying, classifying, and managing diverse geospatial assets across multiple departments and agencies. OMB is identified as the entity capable of assessing the government-wide implementation of the geospatial-information-as-financial-assets approach. Congress could oversee the implementation and assess the results of this approach. The supplemental guidance outlines a process for managing geospatial assets within the annual budget cycle, aiming to address a disconnect between agency CFOs and geospatial managers. The guidance highlights the lack of geospatial expertise in the budget formation process and the opacity of geospatial spending within other program budgets. The impact of the new guidance on FGDC management will likely be seen in agency budget priorities and funding levels. The National Research Council (NRC) has reported that the value of geospatial data, especially land parcel data, is better understood at the county level. However, the benefits of sharing geospatial data for national needs are not widely acknowledged. Many local governments create data for their own use and do not see the benefits of a national effort. The NRC emphasizes the urgent need for complete national land parcel data. The urgent need for complete national land parcel data is highlighted, especially for emergency response purposes. The lack of readily available geospatial data during disasters like Hurricane Katrina has led to property fraud cases. Efforts to coordinate geospatial data among federal agencies have been challenging, with initiatives like The National Map still in progress. The USFS faced challenges in creating a national-level GIS for the forest ecosystem due to incompatible data from various local systems. They had to adopt the lowest-resolution format to cover all forests, unable to use higher-resolution local data. The federal government owns 650 million acres of land, with the BLM as the custodian for federal land parcel information. Other agencies like the USFS, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service also administer federal lands. The National Integrated Land System (NILS) aims to integrate federal land data among agencies. The BLM and USFS launched NILS, a partnership to manage federal land parcel information in a GIS environment. NILS provides limited federal land data and tools through its GeoCommunicator component. The National Map and NILS aim to share data nationally, but their utility is limited by data quality. The National Map aims to provide topographic information at a 1:24,000 scale, limiting its usefulness for certain detailed features like floodplain boundaries. NILS could potentially offer a comprehensive assessment of federal land administered by different agencies in the future, but currently, the best method is to contact each agency directly for up-to-date data. The OMB-issued supplemental guidance aims to manage geospatial assets as a portfolio of investments, with projects receiving indication of their priority compared to others. The Federal Land Asset Inventory Reform Act of 2011 proposes establishing a national cadastre, but has not been acted upon yet. H.R. 1620, introduced in the House, would require the development of a federal cadastre of \"real property\" by the Secretary of the Interior. The bill defines cadastre as an inventory of land, buildings, crops, forests, and other resources attached to the land. It also mandates coordination with the FGDC and the establishment of standards for interoperability of geospatial information. The legislation H.R. 1620 aims to establish a national cadastre to improve federal land management and resource conservation. Supporters believe it would enhance the interoperability of geospatial information for all users. There is uncertainty regarding whether the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) would expand its current geospatial activities or if custodial responsibilities would shift to another agency. Existing federal real property inventories are considered outdated and inaccurate, and a central inventory is needed to coordinate all data into one usable database. On March 21, 2012, Representative Lamborn introduced H.R. 4233, the Map It Once, Use It Many Times Act, which aims to establish a National Geospatial Technology Administration to create a National Geospatial Database of U.S.-owned or -managed lands. Funding for the database would be determined by the administrator through various sources. The new organization would assume geospatial functions currently held by the DOI, the National Forest System, and NOAA. H.R. 4233 aims to establish a National Geospatial Technology Administration to create a National Geospatial Database of U.S.-owned or -managed lands. The bill would require federal agencies to make their geospatial data available for inclusion in the database, which would be accessible to the public. Additionally, it would mandate the inclusion of building addresses and geographical coordinates collected by the Census Bureau. The bill also proposes the creation of a National Geospatial Policy Commission to develop a National Geospatial Data Plan. The bill, H.R. 4233, aims to establish a National Geospatial Technology Administration to coordinate geospatial activities and promote the use of private-sector firms. It includes titles on moving geospatial activities to private firms, contractor performance requirements, and encouraging geospatial research and development. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, enacted as part of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, established a federal program to develop a comprehensive mapping plan for coastal waters, the exclusive economic zone, continental shelf, and the Great Lakes. The program aims to address data sharing, cost-effectiveness, and interoperability by fostering cooperative mapping efforts and developing data standards consistent with FGDC requirements. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, part of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, established a federal program for comprehensive mapping of coastal waters, exclusive economic zone, continental shelf, and Great Lakes. The act emphasizes coordination with federal efforts like Digital Coast and Geospatial One-Stop, as well as international and coastal state activities. NOAA submitted a plan for an integrated ocean and coastal mapping initiative to Congress in 2010. The challenge of collecting and managing geospatial data to meet act requirements involves multiple federal agencies, states, communities, businesses, and stakeholders. The stakeholders involved in coastal mapping require various types of data, including coastal and marine resources, ecosystems, habitats, cultural resources, and energy projects. The development and implementation of the ocean and coastal mapping plan serve as a test case for managing a large data collection effort across different levels of government and involving various interest groups. Nonfederal organizations are increasingly collaborating with federal agencies on geospatial information management and data sharing. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee advises the FGDC on these matters. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee advises the FGDC on federal geospatial programs, NSDI development, and OMB Circular A-16 implementation. NGAC represents private sector, nonprofits, academia, and government agencies, providing a forum for nonfederal stakeholders in the geospatial community. In a January 2009 report, NGAC highlighted the shift of geospatial data production from the federal government to the private sector and state and local entities. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee noted the shift of data production from the federal government to private sector and state/local governments, highlighting the need for new partnerships for data sharing. Existing agreements are hindering productivity, especially in emergencies. The lack of detailed property data acquisition arrangements for decision-making during crises was also emphasized. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee emphasized the need for detailed property data for decision-making during emergencies. Recommendations were made to improve federal coordination of geospatial activities and partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments, the private sector, and academia. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee recommends establishing a geospatial leadership function within the Executive Office of the President, including it in the reauthorization of the E-Government Act. OMB and FGDC should enforce OMB Circular A-16 and EO 12906, designate Geographic Information Officers in each department, and oversee urgent implementation of geospatial programs. The appointment of Vivek Kundra as Federal Chief Information Officer at OMB addresses some aspects of these recommendations. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) recommended establishing a geospatial leadership function within the Executive Office of the President. NGAC also emphasized the importance of implementing geospatial programs at the national and state levels through organizations like the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and the National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC). The focus is on promoting the coordinated development, use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data to enable the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and Statewide Spatial Data Infrastructures (SSDI). The National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) identified 10 criteria for a \"model\" state program to effectively coordinate statewide GIS activities, reduce inefficiency, and waste. This includes strategic and business plans, a full-time GIS coordinator, clearly defined authority for coordination, and a relationship with the national geospatial structure envisioned as the NSDI. The National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) outlined 10 criteria for an effective state GIS program, including a full-time GIS coordinator with clearly defined authority, a relationship with the state chief information officer, sustainable funding, and the ability to work with various sectors. States vary in their approach to geospatial data sharing, with some being more open than others. NSGIC is developing a program called Imagery for the Nation (IFTN) to collect and share aerial and satellite imagery. This program aims to establish a unified set of geospatial data, specifically digital orthoimagery, to reduce costs and improve quality for various government entities nationwide. NSGIC is developing a program called Imagery for the Nation (IFTN) to collect and share aerial and satellite imagery. The program involves two federal programs: the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) and a companion program administered by the USGS. NAIP imagery would be enhanced to provide annually updated one-meter resolution orthoimagery over all states except Hawaii and Alaska. The USGS program would collect one-foot resolution imagery every three years for 50% of the U.S. land mass, with an option for states to enhance the remaining 50%. Matching funds would be provided for partnerships to acquire six-inch resolution imagery over urban areas with at least 1,000 people per square mile. NSGIC's program, Imagery for the Nation (IFTN), aims to collect and share aerial and satellite imagery over urban areas with at least 1,000 people per square mile. The program would cost $1.38 billion over 10 years and is seen as a crucial component in building the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) by providing consistency of geospatial information across states. NSGIC's Imagery for the Nation (IFTN) program aims to establish core data layers for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) to ensure consistency of geospatial information across states. The organization suggests the NGAC as an interim governance step for NSDI, emphasizing that federal efforts should not restrict states from customizing NSDI to their needs. NSGIC argues for federal funding contingent on compliance, similar to the federal highway program. The NSDI could be modeled on the federal highway program, contingent upon compliance with established criteria. The Census Bureau is prohibited from publishing private information. NGAC recommends revising restrictive statutory language regarding non-sensitive address data and geospatial data. Amending Title 13 to make geospatial data more accessible may raise privacy concerns about personal data collected by the government. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress, H.R. 4233, aims to make geospatial Census data publicly available, despite restrictions in Title 13 of the U.S. Code. The 2008 farm bill prohibits disclosure of geospatial information about agricultural land, with exceptions. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) suggests revising statutory language to enhance the value of geospatial data while addressing privacy concerns. The National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC) suggests revising statutory language to enhance the value of geospatial data while addressing privacy concerns, following concerns about access to geospatial information raised in a draft Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report on Internet privacy. Private-sector interests, such as the Management Association for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors (MAPPS), expressed concerns about how access to geospatial information might be affected under a proposed \"do-not-track\" mechanism for online data collection. MAPPS expressed concern with the undefined term \"precise geolocation data\" in the FTC report, stating it could hinder business activities and consumer access to desired products. They requested the FTC to remove, define, or exempt firms from obtaining consent before collecting geospatial data, citing the impracticality of obtaining individual consent for data like satellite imagery or aerial photography. The FTC issued a final report on geolocation data collection, stating that if data cannot be linked to a specific consumer, consent may not be needed. In 2009, proposals were made for a national GIS or NSDI 2.0. The proposals advocate for investments in national GIS and geospatial efforts as part of critical infrastructure, emphasizing the need for updated online information networks for rebuilding infrastructure in a smart, efficient, and sustainable way. They also highlight the potential economic benefits and future technological advancements that a national GIS could bring. This call for a \"national\" GIS raises questions about current efforts to build the NSDI. Efforts to construct the NSDI began in 1994 with Executive Order 12906, or even earlier when OMB revised Circular A-16 in 1990 to establish the Federal Geographic Data Committee. Recent proposals suggest that current efforts are lacking in national scope, planning, coordination, sharing, or implementation, despite the existence of various organizations focused on national geospatial issues. Congress may need to consider how a national GIS or geospatial infrastructure would differ from current efforts and examine its oversight role in the implementation of OMB Circular A-16. The federal government has made efforts to coordinate geospatial programs through the FGDC and Geospatial One-Stop project, but redundancies among agencies still exist. Federal agencies may be acquiring duplicative data sets and systems. It is unclear if agencies are effectively coordinating and eliminating duplication. Congress could play a more active oversight role in evaluating recommendations from nonfederal stakeholders, such as strengthening enforcement of Circular A-16 by OMB and FGDC. The Advisory Committee recommended strengthening enforcement of Circular A-16 and Executive Order 12906 by OMB and FGDC. However, enforcement alone may not address challenges in management, coordination, and data sharing. Supplemental guidance to Circular A-16 issued by OMB in November 2010 could lead to improved coordination among agencies, state/local governments, and the private sector. It will take time to see if agencies adhere to the \"portfolio-centric model\" for geospatial data management. Evaluating if this model is the best for federal geospatial assets will also require time. Circular A-16 was first issued in 1953 and revised in 1967 and 1990. The Bureau of the Budget (now the OMB) issued Circular No. A-16 in 1953 to coordinate federal Topographic Mapping Activities, National Atlas, Geodetic Control Surveys, and International Boundaries. The purpose was to ensure efficient surveying and mapping activities without duplication of effort, referencing Executive Order No. 9094 from 1942. The Federal Board of Surveys and Maps, established by Executive Order No. 3206 in 1919, directs the OMB to make recommendations for coordinating governmental map making and surveying. A revised Circular A-16 in 1967 added a new section on Responsibility for Coordination, outlining the roles of three federal departments. The focus remains on guiding the development of annual programs for individual agencies. The revised Circular A-16 in 1990 expanded to include spatial data activities, specifically digital data. The 2002 update emphasizes spatial data coordination and the use of geographical data to support multiple government services and electronic government."
