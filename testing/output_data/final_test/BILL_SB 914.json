    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4616.4 of the Labor Code is amended to require the administrative director to contract with licensed physicians or independent medical review organizations for medical provider network (MPN) independent medical reviews. The reviewers must be credentialed, privileged, and ensure timely, clear, and credible reviews that are monitored for quality. The administrative director must ensure fair selection of qualified medical professionals for reviews, maintain confidentiality of records, and guarantee independence through conflict-of-interest policies. Medical professionals conducting reviews must be physicians meeting specified requirements. The medical professional conducting reviews must be a clinician knowledgeable in the treatment of the employee\u2019s medical condition, hold a nonrestricted license in any state of the United States, have a current certification by a recognized American medical specialty board, and have no history of disciplinary action or sanctions. After three physician opinions, if treatment remains disputed, the injured employee can request an MPN independent medical review following Section 4616.3. The review standard is the same as the medical treatment schedule in Section 5307.27. An application for an MPN independent medical review must be submitted on a one-page form provided by the administrative director, including a signed release from the injured employee authorizing the release of medical information. The employer or insurer must provide all information considered in relation to the disputed treatment to the assigned MPN independent medical reviewer. The injured employee's treating physician's correspondence and medical records used for treatment decisions must be provided for an MPN independent medical review. The MPN independent medical reviewer conducts a physical examination of the injured employee and may order diagnostic tests to determine if the disputed health care service was consistent with medical treatment guidelines. The MPN independent medical reviewer issues a report to the administrative director within 30 days, or sooner if necessary, determining if the disputed health care service complies with medical treatment guidelines. If there is a potential serious threat to the injured employee's health, the report must be expedited within three days. The deadlines for analyses and determinations by the MPN independent medical reviewer may be extended by the administrative director for up to three days in extraordinary circumstances or for good cause. The MPN independent medical reviewer's analysis must include the injured employee's medical condition, relevant documents, and findings to support the determination. The administrative director must adopt the reviewer's determination promptly and issue a written decision to the parties. If the MPN independent medical reviewer determines that the disputed treatment is consistent with Section 5307.27, the injured employee can choose a physician within or outside the medical provider network. The employer is responsible for the cost of approved medical treatment as per Section 5307.1 or 5307.11."
