    "content": "The \"Choice in Welfare Tax Credit Act of 1995\" allows for a credit for charitable contributions to certain private charities providing assistance to the poor under section 23 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax code allows individuals to claim a credit for qualified charitable contributions made during the taxable year, with a limit of $100 ($200 for joint returns). A qualified charitable contribution is defined as a cash donation to a qualified charity, with specific details required on the tax return. A qualified charity, as defined by the tax code, is an organization certified by the Secretary under section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). The charity must primarily assist the poor by providing services to individuals with incomes not exceeding 150 percent of the official poverty line. The organization must ensure that its annual exempt purpose expenditures are at least 70 percent of its annual aggregate expenditures to meet the minimum expenditure requirement. The organization must ensure that its annual exempt purpose expenditures are at least 70 percent of its annual aggregate expenditures to meet the minimum expenditure requirement. Contributions deemed made for tax purposes include administrative expenses, expenses for influencing legislation, fundraising expenses, and litigation expenses on behalf of individuals. Contributions made by the taxpayer before the deadline for filing the tax return are treated as made on the last day of the taxable year. The credit for qualified charitable contributions is in lieu of any deduction allowable under the tax code. Taxpayers can elect to not apply this credit for a taxable year. Qualified charities must provide copies of their annual return for charities receiving creditable contributions. Every qualified charity must provide a copy of their annual return to individuals upon request at no charge, except for reproduction and mailing costs. The request can be made in person for immediate copies or within 30 days if made otherwise. This provision is only valid for the 3-year period after the filing date of the return. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include a new item after section 22. The amendments made by this section apply to charitable contributions made after the 90th day following the enactment of the Act in taxable years ending after that date."
