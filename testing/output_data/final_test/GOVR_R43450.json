    "content": "SPS/TBT measures related to food safety and public health are covered in multilateral trade agreements within the WTO. These rules, established in agreements like the SPS Agreement from the Uruguay Round, outline government rights and obligations regarding food safety, animal and plant health, and technical product standards. The GATT and TBT Agreements, established during the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, came into force on January 1, 1995, as part of the creation of the WTO. These agreements set rules for human, animal, and plant health protection measures and technical requirements for traded goods. They apply to governmental measures affecting international trade, emphasizing science-based standards. SPS/TBT measures are science-based standards set by countries to protect human, animal, and plant health in international trade. These measures should not be arbitrary or discriminatory and should align with established international standards. Improper use of SPS/TBT measures can create barriers to trade, such as quotas, sanitary regulations, and other non-tariff barriers. Non-tariff measures have become significant barriers to international trade, including quantitative restrictions, non-tariff charges, government participation in trade, and customs procedures. These potential trade barriers are addressed in other WTO agreements. The rules for settling trade disputes involving SPS/TBT measures are outlined in the WTO's Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes. The SPS Agreement under the WTO addresses health protection measures for humans, animals, and plants, including risks from pests, diseases, contaminants, and toxins in food. It also covers diseases carried by animals or plants and aims to prevent damage from pests. Sanitary regulations apply to animal-based products like meats, poultry, and dairy to meet specified standards. Phytosanitary regulations apply to fruits, vegetables, and plant-based products. The SPS Agreement ensures governments adopt measures to protect human, animal, and plant health, including food safety regulations and measures to protect crops and livestock. It also allows governments to set appropriate levels of protection without unnecessarily restricting trade. The WTO member countries are encouraged to harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures to improve human, animal, and plant health. The SPS Agreement requires notification and comments on proposed standards affecting trade, focusing on imported foods. The SPS Agreement focuses on SPS measures that impact international trade, including laws, regulations, testing procedures, quarantine treatments, statistical methods, and packaging requirements related to food safety. Key principles and provisions of the agreement are outlined in Appendix B. The SPS Agreement established a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (\"SPS committee\") for periodic reviews of the agreement's operation and implementation. Reviews in 1999, 2005, and 2010 covered a range of SPS issues, including equivalence, transparency, harmonization, technical assistance, special treatment for developing countries, and dispute resolution. Recommendations were made on these topics, as well as trade-related SPS concerns, cooperation with standard-setting bodies, and clarification of terms and provisions. The SPS Agreement's Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures conducts periodic reviews covering various topics such as equivalence, transparency, harmonization, technical assistance, and special treatment for developing countries. The committee reported that some WTO members were still adjusting to the new disciplines, but overall, the agreement is serving its purpose for both importing and exporting member countries. No proposed changes to the basic provisions or science-based requirements have been made. The TBT Agreement under the WTO addresses standards-related measures to protect human, animal, and plant life, ensure quality of goods, and prevent deceptive practices. It allows countries to take necessary measures for export quality, health protection, and environmental preservation, as long as they are not discriminatory or restrict international trade. Standards-related measures include standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures. The TBT Agreement covers standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures for products and processes. Standards define product characteristics, while technical regulations are mandatory. Conformity assessment procedures confirm product compliance. TBTs also include health and quality standards, testing, and certification. The TBT Agreement covers standards, technical regulations, conformity assessment procedures, health and quality standards, testing, registration, certification requirements, safety and industrial standards, packaging and labeling regulations, trademarks, quarantines, advertising, and media regulations. It distinguishes legitimate standards from protectionist measures and ensures fair and reasonable testing and conformity assessment procedures. Member nations are obligated to notify and allow comments on proposed standards affecting trade. The TBT Agreement addresses standards, technical regulations, conformity assessment procedures, and other obligations relevant to imported foods. It includes a \"Code of Good Practice\" for voluntary standards and establishes a committee for consultation. Bilateral and regional free trade agreements between the United States are also discussed. The United States has bilateral and regional free trade agreements addressing SPS and TBT matters, with provisions not as extensive as those in the WTO agreements. Recent negotiations aim to go beyond existing FTA provisions. NAFTA, in force since 1994, includes comprehensive SPS and TBT provisions in Chapter Seven. NAFTA's SPS agreement imposes disciplines on the development, adoption, and enforcement of measures to protect human, animal, or plant life from risks. Each country has the right to establish appropriate SPS protections based on scientific principles and risk assessment. NAFTA also established a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures to enhance food safety and SPS conditions. NAFTA's TBT provisions in Chapter Nine affirm each country's right to adopt non-discriminatory standards-related measures that do not create unnecessary trade barriers. The agreement also establishes a Committee on Standards-Related Measures for technical cooperation and consultation on bilateral issues. Since NAFTA's establishment in 1994, the US has negotiated multiple FTAs with various countries, addressing SPS and TBT matters to some extent. However, subsequent FTAs do not delve as deeply into these issues as NAFTA did. They generally refer to parties' rights and obligations under the WTO agreements and establish committees for ongoing consultation, but lack specific dispute settlement procedures for SPS and TBT measures. The U.S. has negotiated FTAs with countries to address SPS and TBT measures. For example, the U.S.-Australia FTA includes a chapter on SPS Measures establishing an SPS Committee and a working group on animal and plant health to resolve specific bilateral issues and facilitate trade. The U.S.-Australia FTA includes commitments to ease inspection procedures for U.S. imports of pork, citrus, apples, and stone fruit. Side letters address cooperation on international standards for BSE. Efforts are being made to go beyond WTO rules in SPS and TBT matters, known as \"WTO-Plus\" rules. The industry proposed adopting tougher WTO rules for animal health regulations in the TPP negotiations, later reinforced by U.S. and EU trade officials in the TTIP negotiations. The TPP is a proposed regional FTA involving the United States and countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A key focus in TPP negotiations on agricultural goods is addressing SPS matters, with calls for a 'WTO-Plus' SPS chapter to strengthen rules and emphasize science-based regulation. The May 2012 white paper recommends strengthening requirements for risk assessment and management in the TPP agreement to address concerns about non-science-based trade measures. It also suggests promoting trade-facilitating measures, enhancing transparency, and emphasizing the role of science-based international standards. The white paper recommends strengthening risk assessment and management in the TPP agreement, promoting trade-facilitating measures, enhancing transparency, and emphasizing science-based international standards. U.S. negotiators proposed enforceable rules to strengthen the role of science in resolving trade differences, including a consultative mechanism and rapid-response mechanism for SPS disputes. The U.S. is working to address SPS barriers in TPP negotiations, with proposals for increased transparency and science-based risk assessment. Some TPP countries support a dispute settlement process for SPS obligations, while the U.S. may be reconsidering its opposition to this. Current negotiations with the EU aim to establish a free trade area. The United States and EU are working on establishing a free trade area through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Concerns exist about regulatory differences, particularly regarding SPS matters like meat and poultry production methods. Negotiations aim to resolve trade disputes and enhance disciplines to address SPS issues and non-tariff barriers. The U.S. and EU are addressing SPS concerns such as biotechnology and pesticide regulations in their trade negotiations. There are worries about harmonizing regulatory standards and potential impacts on U.S. companies. EU is seen as promoting its own production values and aiming to set global standards. The U.S. and EU are negotiating a trade deal to address concerns about regulatory standards, particularly SPS/TBT measures. The U.S. aims to eliminate non-tariff barriers that hinder market opportunities for U.S. exports, while the EU is focused on promoting its own production values and setting global standards. The U.S. and EU are negotiating a trade deal to address regulatory standards, aiming to eliminate barriers for U.S. exports. USTR calls for EU regulators to adopt a transparent rulemaking process. Advocates in the agriculture and food industry seek to go beyond current WTO rules on SPS and TBT matters in TTIP negotiations. The U.S. and EU are recommended to negotiate ambitious 'SPS-plus' and 'TBT-plus' chapters. EU seeks to negotiate an \"ambitious 'SPS-plus' chapter\" and an \"ambitious 'TBT-plus' chapter\" under TTIP, with recommendations for improved dialogue and cooperation on bilateral SPS and TBT issues based on key principles of the WTO agreements. The EU aims to negotiate an \"SPS Plus\" and \"TBT Plus\" chapter under TTIP, focusing on enhancing transparency, reducing testing requirements, and improving cooperation globally. Concerns are raised by U.S. agriculture and food groups regarding potential trade negotiation outcomes. Several agriculture and food groups, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Members of Congress, are concerned that trade negotiations may not adequately address SPS barriers. They emphasize the need for ambitious regulatory provisions covering TBT, SPS, and regulatory cooperation. U.S. objectives include greater compatibility of regulations with the EU to reduce costs associated with non-tariff barriers. The objective of standards development processes is to reduce costs related to regulatory differences and promote transparency. The EU aims to improve regulatory cooperation, transparency, and eliminate trade barriers while ensuring human, animal, and plant health. Some in the U.S. agriculture and food industry are urging for these objectives to be addressed in the TTIP negotiations. Some in the U.S. agriculture and food industry are urging the TTIP agriculture negotiations to address the use of the \"precautionary principle\" in EU's risk management policy regarding food safety and animal and plant health. They argue that science-based decision making should be the defining principle in addressing SPS concerns. Some U.S. agricultural and food groups are pushing for changes in the EU's approach to approving biotechnology products in the TTIP negotiations, citing concerns about the precautionary principle undermining sound science. The EU is discussing changes to food and beverage designations related to geographical indications in the TTIP's intellectual property rights chapter. The SPS Agreement and TBT Agreement aim to harmonize food standards internationally, recognizing organizations like Codex, OIE, and IPPC as key players in facilitating trade and protecting public health. The SPS Agreement recognizes organizations like Codex Alimentarius Commission, International Office of Epizootics, and International Plant Protection Convention as key players in developing international standards for animal health, food safety, and plant health. Members are required to base their sanitary measures on these international standards to harmonize regulations. The SPS Agreement acknowledges Codex, IPPC, and OIE's role in setting international standards for sanitary and phytosanitary measures. These organizations actively participate in discussions of the SPS committee and are encouraged by the TBT Agreement to contribute to the development of standards. The United Nations General Assembly resolution emphasized the importance of adopting international food standards from organizations like Codex Alimentarius and the World Health Organization. The United States, as a member of the WTO, Codex, OIE, and IPPC, actively participates in developing voluntary SPS standards to guide national measures and resolve trade disputes. Codex Alimentarius Commission creates internationally adopted food standards and guidelines. Codex, part of the FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme, was established in 1963 to develop global food standards for safety and trade facilitation. It sets Maximum Residue Levels for pesticides in plant-based foods and veterinary drugs in meat products. Codex standards are widely recognized as benchmarks for national food measures. Codex standards are benchmarks for national food measures and regulations, playing a key role in resolving trade disputes. They are advisory but necessary for public health protection based on scientific evidence. Codex has developed over 200 standards for various food commodities and addressed concerns like pesticide residues, food contaminants, and labeling. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is responsible for improving animal health worldwide and is recognized as the relevant international standard setting organization for animal health. OIE's objectives include developing international standards to harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures based on scientific evidence. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) aims to develop international standards for animal health, food safety, and animal welfare. It collects and shares information on animal diseases, coordinates research, and establishes guidelines for safe animal trade to prevent disease spread. The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is an international treaty administered by FAO to protect plants from pests introduced through international trade. IPPC allows governments to apply phytosanitary measures to safeguard plant resources. The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) aims to prevent the spread of pests through international trade by establishing standards and policies for quarantine pests. The \"precautionary principle\" allows countries to take protective action if scientific evidence is inconclusive about potential impacts on health and the environment. The WTO allows members to set higher standards based on scientific justification, risk assessment, and the precautionary principle. This principle suggests that products or practices should be prohibited if there are reasonable concerns about their potential dangers to human, environmental, animal, or plant health in the face of scientific uncertainty. The WTO allows members to set higher standards based on scientific justification, risk assessment, and the precautionary principle in the fields of food safety, and plant and animal health protection. The EU's risk management policy regarding food safety and animal and plant health is guided by the precautionary principle, which was established in EU food legislation in 2002. The EU's regulatory definition of the precautionary principle allows for provisional risk management measures in cases of scientific uncertainty to ensure high health protection standards. It also outlines guidelines for its application in international trade to address potential dangers to health or the environment. The precautionary principle allows for provisional risk management measures in cases of scientific uncertainty to ensure high health protection standards and address potential dangers to health or the environment. However, its application has been challenged as protectionist by some countries, including the EU, leading to ongoing contention in international trade, particularly with the United States. The precautionary principle in international trade, especially with the United States, has been criticized for its ambiguity, arbitrariness, and bias against new technologies. Many U.S. agricultural and food organizations argue that it undermines \"sound science\" and imposes unjustifiable restrictions on exports. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports a science-based approach to risk management and opposes the precautionary principle in regulatory decision making. A 2005 study by the United Nations University emphasizes the need for a rational basis for concern based on available information when invoking precaution. The study emphasizes the importance of considering various factors in determining acceptable levels of risk in health and environmental decision-making. It suggests increased international discussions to avoid economically damaging unilateral measures without rigorous risk assessment. The WTO received 344 complaints related to SPS requirements between 1995 and 2012, with concerns raised by developed countries like the United States. About 40% of trade concerns were related to animal health. The SPS committee reviewed trade concerns related to animal health, food safety, plant health, and other issues. Complaints included foot-and-mouth disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, and avian influenza. One-third of concerns were resolved, while others required ongoing attention. The US government saw a significant increase in reviewing foreign SPS measures notified to the WTO from 1995 to 2009. The number of notified SPS measures increased from 200 in 1995 to 7,240 in 2009, with an additional 950 notifications in 2010. Brazil, China, and other Asian nations account for a large share of SPS notifications. Trade concerns related to TBT requirements have also been rising, with 278 new complaints submitted from 1995 to 2012. The United States raised many concerns reviewed by the TBT committee. The use of TBT measures in trade concerns often revolves around the protection of human health and food safety, accounting for about 30% of all TBT-specific concerns. The United States has formal trade disputes with the EU regarding SPS/TBT measures, including issues with growth-promoting hormones in U.S. meats, chemical treatments on U.S. poultry, and biotechnology product approvals. Other complaints involve Korean testing requirements on U.S. agricultural products, Japan's varietal testing on fruits and nuts, and India's restrictions on poultry products. The United States has trade disputes with various countries over concerns such as restrictions on agricultural biotechnology, antimicrobial residues, chlorine rinses on meat exports, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Other trade barriers include geographical indications, intellectual property protections, and restrictions on poultry products. Foreign countries have objected to various U.S. trade measures, including country of origin labeling and restrictions on poultry product imports from China. Concerns involve U.S. plant and animal health approval processes, differences with the EU on biotechnology products, and ongoing trade concerns detailed in USTR reports. These issues are addressed by U.S. government agencies to resolve before formal WTO involvement. In 2013, USTR reported about 150 ongoing trade concerns in more than 50 countries or trade regions involving agricultural products under both the SPS and TBT Agreements. The United States actively pursues the removal of SPS-specific trade barriers. The USDA made various requests in 2009 related to food additives, pesticides, and contaminants, including removal of certain tolerances and submission of risk assessments. Comments were also made on measures for processed products, live animals, and fish. In 2009, the USDA made numerous requests related to food additives, pesticides, and contaminants, as well as measures for processed products, live animals, and fish. The U.S. government's comments on foreign SPS measures have been increasing, with China, South Korea, Brazil, and Taiwan being the leading countries for U.S. comments. The total number of U.S. comments on foreign SPS measures rose from fewer than 30 in 1995 to more than 230 in 2009. SPS measures are impacting U.S. agricultural exporters in international markets, leading to potential trade disputes requiring WTO resolution. As of March 2014, 40 cases cited the SPS Agreement and 49 cases cited the TBT Agreement, with the U.S. involved in roughly half of them. These cases involve agricultural and fisheries products and processes. Trade disputes in the WTO arise when a member government believes another member is violating an agreement. Disagreements can be resolved informally through discussions among technical experts and higher-level trade officials. If informal methods fail, countries may conclude that a bilateral approach is not possible. If the trading partner is a WTO Member, the United States may consider WTO resolution. If a WTO Member believes a measure is inconsistent with WTO rules, they can escalate the issue to the WTO's dispute settlement system. If a dispute panel finds a measure violates WTO obligations, the defending country must withdraw it. Compensation and retaliation are temporary remedies if needed. The WTO panel can authorize trade retaliation if a mutually acceptable solution is not reached between the complaining and defending countries. This retaliation often involves higher tariffs on the defending country's exports. SPS/TBT measures aim to protect food safety but can unintentionally restrict international trade or be used as disguised protectionism. Under multilateral and free trade agreements, barriers on traded goods have been reduced. SPS and TBT measures can impose economic costs on agricultural and food exporters, requiring costly changes for compliance. These actions can lead to market losses. However, technical standards can provide benefits like protection against health risks and environmental degradation. The U.S. is actively involved in agricultural trade due to its importance to the economy. The United States is focused on reducing tariff and nontariff barriers in agricultural trade through negotiations. It has a trade surplus in agricultural products, with exports averaging $124 billion per year and imports averaging $91 billion per year. This surplus has resulted in over $30 billion in trade surplus. Agricultural exports support approximately 6,800 jobs per $1 billion and stimulate $1.29 in business activity. The U.S. agricultural exports support over 923,000 American jobs and generate a total economic output of $300 billion. Non-tariff measures like SPS and TBT can be used for protectionist purposes, causing economic losses for exporting countries. USDA published a report on the economic impact of technical trade barriers on U.S. agricultural exports after the Uruguay Round negotiations. The study identified technical barriers in over 60 countries affecting trade in 300 agricultural products, valued at $5.0 billion of U.S. exports. SPS measures caused 90% of revenue losses, with the rest from TBT measures and other trade barriers. The ERS survey data reveals that technical trade barriers significantly impact export revenue losses, with SPS measures causing 90% of revenue losses. Risk-reducing measures such as plant and animal health issues and food safety measures account for the majority of estimated export revenue losses. Process standards and product standards are the main policy instruments affecting trade effects, along with bans and other requirements. Various agricultural products are affected by these barriers, with four commodity groups being the most impacted. Trade barriers significantly impact export revenue losses, with SPS measures causing 90% of revenue losses. Four commodity groups, including further processed products, grains and oilseeds, animal products, and horticultural products, accounted for most of the total estimated export revenue losses. Technical barriers affecting U.S. agricultural exports were most prevalent in East Asia, followed by the Americas. Comprehensive analyses of the costs associated with foreign SPS/TBT measures are not readily available. Quantifying agricultural non-tariff barriers like SPS/TBT measures is complex due to regulatory schemes and lack of transparency. Private voluntary standards can impact market access more than government-imposed measures. Cost estimates often include various barriers, making it challenging to isolate the effects of SPS/TBT measures on trade. The USTR asserts that SPS trade barriers hinder U.S. agricultural exports, costing over $1 billion annually. The agency works to eliminate barriers and open new markets for agricultural products. The USTR works to eliminate SPS trade barriers to facilitate the safe movement of agricultural products, preserving exports valued at billions of dollars. Efforts to resolve SPS barriers have resulted in significant market value for U.S. exports. Trade disputes involving SPS and TBT measures are actively pursued by agricultural groups and trade associations to reduce trade costs and open new markets. Non-tariff measures, such as SPS and TBT barriers, play a crucial role in U.S. agricultural export markets. Studies indicate that these measures impact trade in a significant way, with only a few agricultural products not facing barriers in importing countries. Developing countries, like those in Africa and the Caribbean, are particularly affected by SPS and TBT measures, which hinder their agricultural exports. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that food regulation compliance costs have a higher economic impact in low-income countries than in high-income countries. Nontariff barriers restrict agricultural trade more than import tariffs, with higher levels of protection for agricultural goods compared to manufacturing goods. Agricultural goods have a higher overall average ad valorem equivalent (AVE) estimate of 44%, while manufacturing goods have a lower estimate of 19%. The WTO concluded that non-tariff measures may restrict trade more than tariffs, with SPS/TBT measures negatively affecting agricultural trade. Nontariff barriers can lead to higher retail prices for certain foods, especially in the EU, US, and some Asian countries. The WTO highlighted that non-tariff measures like SPS/TBT regulations can hinder agricultural trade. Studies show potential gains in apple exports to China if SPS barriers are reduced. The U.S. addresses foreign standards through the TPSC to overcome export barriers. The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), chaired by USTR, includes representatives from federal agencies dealing with foreign standards. They meet formally a few times a year and informally consult on SPS and TBT issues. The subcommittee comprises officials from USDA, Department of Commerce, Department of State, OMB, FDA, EPA, and other regulatory agencies. USTR also chairs an interagency group that regularly discusses WTO SPS issues and reviews globally traded goods' SPS and TBT measures notified to the WTO. The U.S. process for handling SPS and TBT measures for globally traded goods involves coordination by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and other regulatory agencies. FAS serves as the designated WTO \"enquiry\" point, shares information with industry groups, exporters, and various agencies, and maintains a database on foreign SPS and agriculture-related TBT measures impacting trade. Meetings are chaired by FAS to discuss technical staff from USDA. The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) chairs meetings to discuss emerging SPS/TBT issues and potential disputes in international trade agreements. Technical staff initiate dialogue with countries and affected industries to resolve issues. Discussions between government experts help clarify differences and establish mutually acceptable conditions for importing products. However, not all problems can be solved through these discussions. USTR can pursue bilateral consultations with foreign countries over SPS or TBT issues, with USDA's assistance. They may also escalate the issue through a complaint to the WTO or NAFTA for formal dispute resolution. In 2012, USTR reviewed 908 SPS notifications and provided comments on 119 measures. They are required to submit an annual report on foreign trade barriers to the President and relevant committees. The National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE report) identifies significant tariffs and nontariff barriers that threaten U.S. agricultural exports in over 60 major trading partners. USTR reports SPS and TBT trade barriers continue to hinder U.S. exports, with specific concerns in various countries. The NTE report highlights significant SPS/TBT-related trade concerns in various countries, including import policies targeting disease transmission, pesticide residues, and restrictive import procedures. USTR identifies key barriers for U.S. exporters, such as export certifications, biotechnology, BSE, AI, and MRLs for pesticides. The United States has an extensive system in place to protect consumers from unsafe food and agricultural products, as well as to safeguard animal and plant resources from foreign pests and diseases. This system includes various statutes, regulations, and administrative procedures that constitute the nation's SPS measures. U.S. officials also collaborate with other governments to develop internationally recognized guidelines for SPS measures to promote safe trade in plants, animals, agricultural, and food products. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is responsible for coordinating U.S. international trade policy. The USTR is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade policy, overseeing negotiations with other countries on SPS and TBT measures, and leading trade agreements. It consults with other government agencies through the TPRG and TPSC and coordinates processes for addressing SPS and TBT issues. The FDA oversees the safety of human and animal products within the Department of Health and Human Services. The FDA oversees the safety of human and animal foods and drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Meat and poultry products are regulated by USDA's FSIS. APHIS is responsible for animal and plant health, while EPA regulates pesticides. Each agency has regulations to implement these laws. The FDA, USDA's FSIS, APHIS, and EPA have regulations to implement laws for human and animal foods, drugs, meat, poultry, animal and plant health, and pesticides. Imports must comply with APHIS permits, risk assessments, FSIS evaluations, and FDA safety and labeling standards. Federal guidance for biotechnology products is the Coordinated Framework. The federal guidance for regulating biotechnology products is the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, published in 1986. Genetically engineered products are regulated based on their characteristics, not their production method. The Department of Homeland Security plays a role in inspecting imports, including food and agricultural products. The Bioterrorism Act of 2002 requires all food companies to register with the FDA and notify prior to food imports. Various laws, including the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, provide the basis for U.S. SPS measures and TBTs. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration enforces provisions related to these laws within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration enforces provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act to protect dolphins and sea turtles. The U.S. government and WTO reports highlight the benefits of SPS and TBT agreements in facilitating trade, but some groups express skepticism about potential downward harmonization of health and safety standards. The U.S. questions the scientific basis of a safeguard and may lower standards in negotiations. Some argue for the right of nations to enact stronger protections. The U.S. defends its health and safety policies as scientifically sound. The SPS and TBT agreements are seen as providing a foundation for transparent, science-based trade guidelines and dispute resolution. Some suggest revisiting aspects of these agreements in ongoing free trade negotiations like the TPP and TTIP. The SPS and TBT rules are being tested by changes in food production technology. Congress is closely monitoring ongoing SPS-related trade disputes. The 2014 farm bill reauthorized TASC to address SPS barriers. Congress has held hearings on FTA negotiations, including regulatory matters like SPS and TBT. In congressional hearings on trade agreements like TTIP, regulatory barriers such as SPS and TBT are discussed. Legislation introduced by Representative Devin Nunes aimed to address SPS issues in agricultural trade. The focus is on eliminating unnecessary regulatory barriers and promoting transparency and convergence in regulatory standards. The United States aims to address SPS measures in agricultural trade to facilitate trade. Lawmakers are concerned that as agricultural tariffs decrease, countries may use SPS and TBT measures to protect their farmers. SPS matters will influence lawmakers' decisions on new FTAs. Congress must pass implementing legislation for FTAs. International SPS and TBT rights could be relevant if new restrictions on food imports are considered due to recent adulteration incidents. The United States is addressing SPS measures in agricultural trade to facilitate trade, with concerns about countries using SPS and TBT measures to protect their farmers. Lawmakers' decisions on new FTAs will be influenced by SPS matters, and international SPS and TBT rights could be relevant if new restrictions on food imports are considered due to recent adulteration incidents. The agreement emphasizes the importance of harmonization and equivalence in SPS measures to facilitate trade. Harmonization encourages the use of international standards, while equivalence allows importing countries to accept different SPS measures as long as they achieve the same level of protection. The SPS agreement requires exporting countries to demonstrate equivalent protection levels through risk assessment based on scientific evidence, minimizing trade distortions. Measures must not be more restrictive than necessary, avoiding unjustifiable distinctions to prevent discrimination or trade restrictions. Countries can adopt provisional measures but must justify permanent restrictions through risk assessment. Notification and transparency obligations require publishing SPS regulations. Transparency and regionalization are key aspects of the SPS Agreement. Countries must publish regulations related to SPS controls and notify trading partners in advance about measures that could affect trade. The SPS Information Management System provides access to relevant documents and records. Regionalization allows for adaptation in implementing SPS measures. The SPS Agreement emphasizes transparency and regionalization. It allows for adaptation to regional conditions, such as pest or disease free areas. Dispute settlement involves formal consultations and may involve adjudication by a WTO panel. Implementation and oversight are carried out by a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The SPS Agreement establishes a Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures to monitor compliance, review implementation, and discuss trade disputes related to SPS measures. Key principles include non-discrimination and avoiding unnecessary obstacles to trade. The SPS Agreement requires conformity assessment procedures to be fair and non-discriminatory towards suppliers of like products from other Member territories. Fees must be equitable and confidentiality of assessment results must be maintained. Technical regulations should not be more trade-restrictive than necessary, and assessment procedures should not create unnecessary trade barriers. Members should use relevant international standards as a basis for technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, participating in the development of these standards within their resources. Members are encouraged to accept technical regulations as \"equivalent\" to their own if they fulfill the same objectives. Product requirements should focus on performance rather than design. International systems for conformity assessment are recommended, with recognition of results when equivalent assurance is provided. Mutual recognition agreements are also encouraged. Members are encouraged to enter into mutual recognition agreements for conformity assessment results. Transparency requirements include notifying other Members through the WTO Secretariat when proposing technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures. Technical assistance should be provided to Members. Members should provide technical assistance to each other in areas such as preparing technical regulations, establishing national standardizing bodies, and participating in international standardization bodies. The Committee on TBT is the main forum for WTO Members to discuss issues related to the Agreement, including trade concerns and dispute resolution under the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding."
