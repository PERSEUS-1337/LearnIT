    "content": "The USDA has faced accusations of discrimination against minority and female farmers in its loan programs. Despite efforts to address these allegations, reports have highlighted failures in the management of civil rights issues. Lawsuits have been filed under the ECOA and APA, including Pigford v. Glickman for African-American farmers, Keepseagle v. Vilsack for Native American farmers, and Love v. Vilsack for female farmers. A group of Hispanic farmers filed a lawsuit against USDA in Garcia v. Vilsack, alleging discrimination in credit transactions and disaster benefits. After years of litigation, the Garcia plaintiffs exhausted their final avenue of appeal to have their claims heard as a class action. The Garcia plaintiffs in a lawsuit against USDA alleging discrimination in credit transactions and disaster benefits must now pursue their claims individually or participate in a settlement process. The report provides background information on policy issues surrounding the litigation, other discrimination cases against USDA, and possible options for Congress to consider in response to the Garcia dispute. The history of civil rights issues at USDA and the Farm Service Agency's alleged discrimination against minority farmers have been well-documented. USDA has a long history of discrimination, including evidence found in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite reports of racial discrimination, the Farmers Home Administration was accused of perpetuating such practices. The USDA commissioned a study in 1994 to analyze discrimination against minorities and women in the Farm Service Agency programs. The study found that from 1990 to 1995, minority participation was low, and minorities received less than their fair share of USDA money. Few appeals were made due to slow processes and lack of confidence in decision makers. In December 1996, Secretary of Agriculture Daniel R. Glickman suspended government farm foreclosures nationwide pending an investigation into racial discrimination in the loan program. A civil rights commission was appointed to examine USDA's loan-making process and address discriminatory practices towards minority farmers. Through 12 listening sessions, a history of discriminatory attitudes and practices towards minority and socially disadvantaged farmers was documented. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported significant deficiencies in USDA's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in October 2008. The office failed to prevent a backlog of civil rights cases, had inconsistent progress reports, and unreliable data on minority participation in USDA programs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found deficiencies in USDA's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in 2008 due to unreliable data. GAO recommended creating a performance agreement, an oversight board, and an ombudsperson for meaningful investigations. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) provides loans to farmers on family-sized farms as a lender of last resort. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) offers modified loan servicing options to farmers facing financial difficulties to keep their farms viable. FSA county committees decide on loan approvals and terms, potentially leading to favoritism towards certain groups. The authority of county committees to extend or deny credit could indirectly dispossess minority and other disfavored farmers of their land and equipment. Community committees were removed from the official structure by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture. The county committee system was restructured by the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994. State, county, and area committees work together to administer FSA programs. These committees are predominantly white men, with 94% of county farm loan committees having no women or minorities in 1994. They are responsible for various agricultural programs and selecting the county executive director. The county executive director is responsible for reviewing, approving, and certifying applications, forms, reports, and documents related to FSA programs. The composition of FSA committees must be representative of agricultural producers within the area, with nominations accepted from organizations representing socially disadvantaged groups. Congressional farm bills have addressed the composition of these committees. The 2008 farm bill requires FSA offices to consolidate committees while maintaining representation of socially disadvantaged farmers. The Garcia v. Vilsack lawsuit alleged USDA discrimination against Hispanic farmers in credit transactions and disaster benefits. The Garcia v. Vilsack lawsuit alleged USDA discrimination based on various factors such as religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or source of income. The suit claimed USDA violated the ECOA and APA by failing to investigate discrimination complaints. Significant rulings included the denial of class certification to Hispanic farmers in 2002 and the dismissal of claims in 2009 that USDA failed to investigate civil rights complaints. In 2002, the district court denied class certification to Hispanic farmers in the Garcia v. Vilsack lawsuit. The court considered the farmers' motion for class action status, which requires showing numerous class members, common legal issues, typical claims, and adequate representation. The district court in Garcia denied the Hispanic farmers' motion for class certification due to a lack of common legal issues and typical claims among the class members. The district court denied the Hispanic farmers' class certification motion because there were no common legal issues or typical claims among the class members. The basis of the lawsuit was USDA's alleged failure to investigate discrimination complaints, but the court ruled that this claim was not available under the ECOA or the APA. The only remaining ground for commonality was the plaintiffs' allegation of discriminatory results from USDA's subjective decision-making process. The court found that commonality was lacking due to the inability to link discrimination with loan qualification criteria and the large number and geographic dispersion of decision-makers. After the district court denied class certification for Hispanic farmers in Garcia, they conducted additional discovery and submitted a renewed motion for class certification. However, the court once again found a lack of commonality and denied class certification. In contrast, the court in Pigford had not ruled on the failure-to-investigate claim when considering class certification for black farmers. The approval of class certification in Pigford played a crucial role in the DOJ's decision to enter into a settlement. The Department of Justice (DOJ) settled with black farmers due to the high potential liability in class actions, along with other factors like evidence strength. Initially hesitant, DOJ later settled individual claims and established a $1.33 billion settlement process for Hispanic and female farmers. In contrast, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the denial of class certification for Hispanic farmers in Garcia. In 2006, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court's denial of class certification to Hispanic farmers, stating that they failed to show commonality in discrimination policies or a common facially neutral policy leading to loan denials. Multiple USDA employees in various locations made eligibility decisions, making it hard to prove a centralized discriminatory policy. The D.C. Circuit upheld the dismissal of Hispanic farmers' failure-to-investigate claim under the ECOA but remanded it under the APA for further development. The district court later dismissed the farmers' allegation that USDA's failure to investigate their discrimination claims violated the APA, which was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in April 2009. The D.C. Circuit rejected the farmers' failure-to-investigate claim under the APA in April 2009, stating that they had an adequate remedy in court through ECOA claims or renewing administrative complaints with USDA. The farmers chose to file ECOA claims in federal court, forgoing the remedy provided by Congress. The D.C. Circuit rejected the farmers' failure-to-investigate claim under the APA in April 2009, stating they had an adequate remedy through ECOA claims. The plaintiffs sought en banc review, but it was denied. The Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal, exhausting their avenues for appeal. Garcia plaintiffs must now pursue their ECOA claims individually. Some Hispanic farmers, unable to pursue litigation on their own, have urged the executive and legislative branches for help in resolving their discrimination case against the USDA. Efforts intensified after settlement agreements with Native American and black farmers. DOJ eventually made a settlement offer in the Garcia case to address concerns of unfair treatment in class certification rulings. The USDA, in conjunction with the DOJ, established a voluntary settlement process in 2011 for Hispanic and female farmers. $1.33 billion is available for compensation, along with $160 million in debt relief. Awards of up to $50,000 or $250,000 are possible, with tax relief and loan forgiveness for successful claimants. The deadline for filing claims is March 25, 2013, and information on how to file can be found at http://www.farmerclaims.gov. The Garcia and Love settlement process is voluntary for qualifying Hispanic and female farmers. Some Hispanic farmers are unsatisfied with the settlement offer due to the lower award amount. They filed a separate lawsuit alleging discrimination, but the court dismissed the claim, stating that judges cannot coerce parties into settling. The court ruled that the plaintiffs lack standing to sue in a discrimination lawsuit against USDA, citing lack of authority to address their alleged injuries. The Cantu plaintiffs have filed an appeal. Other discrimination lawsuits, including Pigford by black farmers, Native American farmers, and female farmers, have been filed against USDA for similar claims of discrimination. The black farmers requested blanket mediation for discrimination allegations against USDA, but DOJ opposed it, leading to the end of settlement negotiations. A federal court later certified the plaintiffs as a class of African-American farmers who applied for federal farm programs between 1983 and 1997. The district court certified the plaintiffs as a class of African-American farmers who believed they were discriminated against by USDA. The court found that the plaintiffs met the requirements for numerosity, typicality, and adequacy of representation, and established common questions of law and fact related to USDA's failure to process discrimination complaints properly. The USDA's failure to process discrimination complaints properly was at issue in this case. The court distinguished the Pigford plaintiffs' claims from those in an earlier lawsuit, Williams v. Glickman, where class certification was rejected for black and Hispanic farmers alleging discrimination in USDA farm programs. The Pigford plaintiffs' allegations focused on USDA's centralized processing of written complaints of discrimination, leading to a settlement agreement and approval of a consent decree in 1999. In 1999, a consent decree was approved for black farmers, resulting in over $1 billion in compensation for 22,551 farmers. Despite the settlement, some farmers missed out on having their cases heard due to late filing. In 2008, a provision in the farm bill allowed these farmers to petition for a determination on the merits. A maximum of $100 million was authorized for new claims settlements, consolidated into a single case known as Pigford II. Attorney General Holder and Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack were involved in this process. In 2010, a $1.25 billion settlement known as Pigford II was announced by Attorney General Holder and Secretary of Agriculture Vilsack. Congressional approval was needed for an additional $1.15 billion in funding, which was eventually provided through the Claims Resolution Act of 2010. Native American farmers have also alleged discrimination by USDA, with over half of the 61,472 farmers located in Oklahoma, Arizona, Texas, and other states. In 1999, the plaintiffs in Keepseagle v. Vilsack filed a class action lawsuit seeking compensation for loan discrimination between 1981 and 1999. A $760 million settlement was reached in October 2010, providing fast-track payments of up to $50,000 or longer process for damages of up to $250,000. Up to $80 million was available for debt relief, funded by the Department of the Treasury's Judgment Fund. The settlement costs in the Keepseagle case were covered by the Judgment Fund. Final approval was granted by a federal district court, and all claims had to be filed by December 27, 2011. The Love v. Vilsack case alleged gender discrimination in farm loans from the USDA. Both cases sought class action status under the ECOA and APA. The litigation history for Garcia and Love is similar, with both cases being initially heard by the same judge and eventually consolidated on appeal. In 2001, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' failure-to-investigate claims under both the ECOA and the APA. In 2004, the court denied class certification for the plaintiffs' failure-to-investigate claims under the ECOA and the APA. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the denial of class certification and dismissal of the ECOA claim but remanded the APA claim. The district court later dismissed the APA claim, which was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit. The Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal on January 19, 2010. DOJ initially declined a class-wide settlement in Love, but eventually, USDA and DOJ established a process to settle the lawsuits. In conjunction with DOJ, a process was established to settle lawsuits by Hispanic and female farmers for $1.33 billion. Congress has responded legislatively to discrimination issues at USDA in the past and may intervene in the future. Past congressional actions include creating the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the 2002 farm bill to ensure compliance with civil rights laws. The 2008 farm bill established a moratorium on USDA foreclosure proceedings for farmers with discrimination claims. Interest and offsets are waived during pending complaints. Congress also addressed claims by socially disadvantaged farmers. The provision in the 2008 farm bill aimed to resolve discrimination claims against USDA by socially disadvantaged farmers in an expedited and fair manner. Congress approved the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 to provide $1.15 billion for the settlement in Pigford II. Congressional involvement in resolving the Garcia dispute or other USDA-related discrimination issues is being considered, with options ranging from neutrality to active intervention. The courts are considered the best institution to mediate legal disputes and provide remedies. Congress has already enacted the ECOA as a legislative remedy for discrimination against credit applicants. If Congress decides to get involved in the Garcia dispute, they could consider creating a fund to aid victims of discrimination. Congress has established programs to compensate victims in similar circumstances. Congress could consider creating a compensation fund for farmers who have faced discrimination by USDA, similar to existing programs for victims of negligence, terrorism, and natural disasters. Parameters would need to be established, such as eligibility requirements, types of benefits, and funding sources, potentially modeled after the Pigford case. The Pigford consent decree established a two-track dispute resolution mechanism for relief seekers, with funds for settlement costs coming from the Judgment Fund. Congress allocated $100 million in the 2008 farm bill and $1.15 billion in the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 for Pigford II claims. Congress has $1.15 billion available in the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 to settle Pigford II claims. One option for Congress is to change statutory requirements for filing discrimination claims against USDA, such as extending the statute of limitations under the ECOA for Hispanic farmers. Another option is to have claims under the Garcia case considered by the United States Court of Federal Claims as a non-binding congressional reference case. The United States Court of Federal Claims can consider claims under the Garcia case as a non-binding congressional reference case, requested by Congress to prepare an advisory report on claims against the United States. This process involves a private bill for compensation referred to the court by a House or Senate resolution. Congress has various options to address discrimination allegations against USDA, including changing statutory requirements and utilizing the available funds in the Claims Resolution Act of 2010."
