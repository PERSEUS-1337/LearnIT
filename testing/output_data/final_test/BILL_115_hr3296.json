The Congress recognizes the importance of manufactured homes, with over 17 million people benefiting from affordable and stable housing. Owners of manufactured homes are typically low-income households, with 75% earning less than $50,000 annually. Additionally, over 10% of US veterans live in manufactured homes, which have historically been a significant source of affordable housing in the country. Manufactured homes are affordable, with prices less than site-built homes. In 2009, 43% of new homes under $150,000 were manufactured. They account for 23% of sales under $200,000. There are over 50,000 manufactured home communities in the US, with 2.9 million homes. These communities provide critical affordable housing but receive little government funding. Owners of manufactured homes in communities do not own the land beneath their homes. Manufactured home residents do not own the land under their homes, making them vulnerable to rent increases and closure of communities. Eviction or closure is disruptive as residents may struggle to relocate their homes. A national network helps residents purchase and manage the land to preserve affordable housing. Over 1,000 stable ownership cooperatives exist nationwide. In more than a dozen States, residents own their homes and an equal share of the land in their neighborhood. In New Hampshire, over 20% of manufactured home communities are resident-owned. Resident-owned cooperatives and nonprofit ownership have thrived in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota. Nationwide, only 2% of manufactured home communities are resident- or nonprofit-owned. Owners often prefer to pass the property to heirs tax-free rather than sell to avoid capital gains taxes. When owners die, heirs often sell the community to the highest bidder, displacing many families. A Federal tax benefit should be established to encourage sales to long-term residents or nonprofit organizations to preserve the community. Tax credit for manufactured home community sale to residents or nonprofit entity under SEC. 45S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

A manufactured home community is defined as a community primarily comprised of manufactured homes used for residential purposes and owned by a cooperative or corporation established under state laws. The qualified manufactured home community must meet specific criteria regarding ownership and governance, including having only one class of membership for residents in a nonprofit corporation or no more than two classes of membership in a cooperative. An entity must adhere to these requirements to be considered a qualified manufactured home community cooperative. The qualified manufactured home community must have governance by members elected to a board of directors with equitable voting among all members. A member is an individual over 18 entitled to execute an occupancy agreement for one site in the community.
