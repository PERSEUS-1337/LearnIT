    "content": "The emergence of cable television systems in the 1940s allowed people in areas with poor broadcast reception to access TV signals. Satellite technology in the 1970s further expanded viewing options by delivering signals from great distances. Viewers also began watching TV programming on various Internet-connected devices, moving away from traditional television stations and cable. Technological innovation has enabled viewers to access TV signals through mobile phones and Internet-connected devices, bypassing traditional television stations and cable providers. Laws and regulations govern the distribution of television programs, focusing on protecting copyright owners, promoting competition among video distributors, and ensuring broadcast stations serve local communities. The Copyright Act governs the rights of copyright owners to programming carried in broadcast television signals retransmitted by cable and satellite operators. The Copyright Royalty Board sets the rates operators pay for this programming. The regulatory structure is under stress due to alternative ways of watching TV programming, raising questions about achieving public policy goals. The FCC is proposing to modify regulations to cover certain online video distributors (OVDs) in order to promote competition among distributors of video programming. Federal courts have conflicting conclusions about the extent to which OVD services are covered by existing copyright laws. This is due to the disparity between copyright laws applying to OVDs and cable/satellite operators. The FCC is looking to modify regulations for online video distributors (OVDs) to promote competition in video programming. There is a disparity in copyright laws between OVDs and cable/satellite operators, leading to the need for legal and economic parity. The FCC suggests that some regulations may no longer be necessary for broadcast television stations to serve their communities. Congressional committees are planning to review copyright and communications laws, as reform may require consideration of how these laws intersect. The television industry involves various players with different roles, and a standardized framework can help understand their relationships. The television industry involves different players with specific roles. Content owners hold copyrights to TV programs, movies, and sports events, while packagers assemble and license content to various distributors. Examples include television studios, movie studios, and sports teams. Television distributors purchase rights from packagers to deliver programs to consumers. Congress defines multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) with specific rights and obligations under copyright and communications laws, including retransmitting broadcast signals. MVPDs distribute programs, including signals from broadcast stations, to viewers. Television distributors, including MVPDs like cable and satellite operators, distribute programs to viewers. Broadcast stations can also deliver programming directly to viewers. The Big Bang Theory is a popular TV series that illustrates industry interactions between producers, distributors, and networks. Warner Brothers licenses the show to CBS for the current season and also licenses past seasons separately. The Big Bang Theory is licensed by Warner Brothers to CBS for the current season, and past seasons are licensed to TBS and local broadcast stations. TBS and broadcast stations act as packagers, relying on MVPDs for distribution to viewers. Viewers without MVPD subscriptions can watch the show on broadcast television stations via over-the-air reception. Approximately 86% of U.S. television households subscribe to an MVPD service, while about 11% receive broadcast signals over the air. The remaining 3% rely solely on an Internet connection for television programming. The number of cable subscribers has declined since the 1992 Cable Act, with 45% of U.S. television households subscribing to cable as of 2015. The emergence of alternative distributors like satellite operators has increased competition in the television industry. Mergers among MVPDs have led to concentration, giving larger operators more bargaining power in distribution agreements. Consolidation among broadcast stations, networks, and copyright owners has also strengthened their bargaining power. Large companies hold leverage over smaller ones in negotiations for transmission rights. Many leading companies in the industry are involved in various aspects of television production, packaging, and distribution. Television industry negotiations involve transmission rights, governed by laws and market forces. Exclusivity in programming distribution is based on time windows and local markets. Copyright laws play a role in delineating exclusive rights. Geographical zones of exclusivity in television markets are enforced by copyright laws and FCC regulations to protect broadcast stations' rights. The FCC licenses broadcast television station owners for eight-year terms to operate in the public interest. The FCC allocates airwaves for television broadcast frequencies to serve local communities. The allocation plan from 1952 is still in use and formed the basis for assigning digital channels in 2009. Initially, priority was given to major cities without television service, then to cities without local stations. The first broadcast television networks, CBS and NBC, selected affiliates from the first TV stations in large cities. Nielsen and Arbitron measured viewership in major metropolitan areas, impacting advertising prices and revenue generation for stations. Accusations arose that stations in large cities were influencing rating services to ignore smaller city stations. Arbitron and later Nielsen were involved in the controversy. Nielsen's Designated Market Areas (DMAs) are used to measure television audiences in 210 geographic zones, overlapping multiple states. These DMAs define exclusivity for broadcast television programming transmission and are utilized in carriage and copyright laws to protect stations' rights to invest in local programming. The FCC regulations rely on stations' communities of license to define geographic exclusivity for broadcast television programming transmission. The 1934 Communications Act, as amended by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, defines \"video programming\" as programming provided by television broadcast stations or comparable sources. Broadcast stations and MVPDs distribute video programming at prescheduled times, with MVPDs transmitting programming from cable networks and broadcast stations. This type of video programming distribution is referred to as \"linear.\" OVDs, or Over-the-Top Video Services, have become significant in the distribution of broadcast television programs. Networks have negotiated directly with OVDs like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu to make their programs available on-demand. This shift in distribution models began in 2005 when ABC and NBC allowed Apple's iTunes store to sell individual episodes of current season broadcast network programs the day after their initial air date. OVDs like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu offer unlimited content through subscriptions, while others like Apple's iTunes and Amazon Video allow for individual content purchases. Some OVDs offer limited content in exchange for watching ads, such as Sony's Crackle and Disney's ABC Go. Networks' ability to license programs to OVDs depends on agreements with studios, leading to networks airing more programs from their parent studios. Licensing from third-party studios may limit control over program distribution. In March 2016, Warner Brothers and ABC reached an agreement giving ABC exclusive in-season stacking rights to distribute current season episodes. Warner Brothers can sell distribution rights after the season ends and license programs to online retailers like iTunes. Networks prefer licensing on-demand availability to MVPDs over OVDs like Netflix for better control and advertising revenue. Some in the industry disagree with this strategy. In 2015, the cast and producers of the television series Bones sued 21st Century Fox, Inc., alleging they received fewer dollars due to \"sweetheart\" distribution deals with FOX and Hulu. Networks' ability to offer online and on-demand rights is a key issue in negotiations between broadcast networks and affiliates. The president of Broadcast Markets for Media General, Inc. emphasizes the importance of exclusivity in business partnerships with local stations. Broadcast stations have exclusive rights to network television broadcasts within their designated market areas. These rights have been challenged by Over-the-Top Video Distributors (OVDs) offering linear programming. OVDs have offered linear programming from broadcast networks only in DMAs where the networks own their affiliates. In February 2016, Sling TV started offering ABC network programming in selected markets where ABC owns its broadcast stations. Similarly, in April 2016, Sling TV began offering FOX network programming in DMAs where FOX owns its broadcast stations. Disagreements between broadcast networks and affiliate stations make it challenging for OVDs to offer nationwide linear broadcasting. Affiliate stations, with legal rights to negotiate signal retransmission, are hesitant to negotiate with OVDs. Federal regulations allow broadcast television stations to enforce contractual exclusivity provisions for linear Internet transmission of broadcast network programs within their geographic zones. These rules apply to television stations, cable, and satellite distributors, aiming to ensure the availability of local news, weather, emergency, and community-oriented programming. The FCC's exclusivity rules enable stations to be the exclusive distributors of linear programming based on their communities of license. The FCC's exclusivity rules for broadcast stations aim to protect local stations from losing advertising revenue and audience to distant television signals. Geographic zones for exclusivity rights vary based on distribution technology, with rules based on a 35-mile radius from the station's community of license. These rules also allow broadcast network affiliates to prevent other stations in the same community from affiliating with the same network. The FCC's exclusivity rules protect local stations by preventing distant signals from impacting advertising revenue and audience. These rules apply a 35-mile radius from the station's city of license and allow affiliates to block other stations in the same community from affiliating with the same network. The rules also extend to cable operators, requiring them to blackout broadcast network programming within the station's \"zone of protection.\" The FCC's protection rules extend 35 miles from a station's city of license in major markets and 55 miles in smaller markets. Non-duplication rules differ for satellite and cable operators, with satellite rules applying to nationally distributed superstations. Satellite operators cannot import distant network stations where local stations are available. The FCC rules require satellite operators to blackout network programming from superstations if the programming is also available on local stations within a 35-mile radius. This protection zone is the same for cable operators. The FCC also allows broadcast stations to prevent other stations in the same community from airing the same syndicated programming. In 1988, the FCC modified rules to allow superstations to have exclusivity rights for syndicated programming within a 35-mile zone surrounding their city of license. Cable operators must blackout syndicated programs if a local station has exclusive rights within that zone. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act directed the FCC to apply syndicated exclusivity rules for satellite operators within a 35-mile zone from the television station's city of license. This rule is similar to the one applied to cable operators in 1972 under the Communications Act of 1934. The debate on copyright liability for cable operators in the 1970s was a significant obstacle to updating the Copyright Act of 1909. Clay J. Whitehead proposed a solution while serving in the White House under President Nixon. In 1971, a compromise was proposed in the White House under President Nixon, endorsed by FCC Chairman Dean Burch and Senator McClellan. It included exclusivity rules by the FCC and a commitment from broadcast stations, cable operators, and studios to support separate copyright legislation for compulsory licensing. This compromise is still relevant today as a reason for not repealing FCC's exclusivity rules without Congress repealing statutory copyright licensing. Copyright owners have the exclusive right to \"perform\" their works and license them to distributors. The Copyright Act, amended in 1976 for cable operators and later for satellite operators, limits these rights. The Copyright Act limits the rights of owners of programming in retransmitted broadcast television signals for cable and satellite operators. They are guaranteed the right to publicly perform copyrighted programming, following FCC regulations and paying royalties. The Act contains three statutory copyright licenses for retransmission of television broadcast signals. The local satellite statutory license (Section 122) allows satellite operators to retransmit local signals without royalties, following FCC rules. The distant satellite statutory license (Section 119) permits retransmission of distant broadcast signals, with a \"no distant if local\" provision since 2004. Cable and satellite operators pay royalties every six months under the statutory license. Cable and satellite operators pay royalties every six months to the U.S. Copyright Office. The Copyright Royalty Board distributes these royalties to copyright claimants and adjusts rates every five years. The statutory licensing regime for cable operators was established in 1976, dividing them into small, medium, and large classes based on earnings from video subscriptions. The Copyright Royalty Board adjusts benchmarks for cable operators based on inflation or subscriber prices. Small and medium systems pay a fixed percentage of their revenues, while large systems pay differently. Smaller systems rely more on distant signals and may struggle with copyright payments. All systems incur liability with the first retransmitted broadcast signal. Large cable systems pay royalties based on the retransmission of distant broadcast signals, regardless of whether they carry them or not. Congress made distinctions between local versus distant signals and network versus nonnetwork programming in calculating fees owed by cable operators. Cable operators do not pay fees for retransmitted local or network programming, but they do pay for nonnetwork programming in retransmitted distant signals. The 1976 Copyright Act allowed the Copyright Royalty Tribunal to adjust royalty rates for cable operators retransmitting distant broadcast signals. In 1980, the FCC repealed quotas on importing distant signals and syndicated exclusivity rules. The Copyright Royalty Tribunal adjusted rates in 1983, which still remain in effect despite FCC reinstating modified exclusivity rules in 1988. The Copyright Act stipulates that cable operators do not pay content owners for retransmitting broadcast signals within the station's DMA. However, if the signal is retransmitted outside the DMA, operators pay a government-set rate. Congress established licensing regimes for satellite operators in 1988 for distant signals and in 1999 for local signals. The compulsory licensing regime for distant signals has been reauthorized five times since 1988. Satellite operators retransmitting local stations have similar requirements to large cable operators. In 2015, the CRB announced that a proceeding to determine rates for the statutory license covering the period 2015-2019 was not necessary. The rates will only be subject to an annual adjustment to reflect inflation. Satellite operators pay a rate of $0.27 per month for each residential subscriber in an area unable to receive over-the-air signals of broadcast network affiliates. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) oversees the collection and distribution of royalty fees from cable and satellite operators who retransmit broadcast network affiliate signals. Operators must file statements of account every six months with the Copyright Office and pay royalty fees, which are then invested in government securities until allocated to copyright owners. The CRB resolves royalty claim disputes and authorizes the distribution of fees, with copyright owners forming groups to negotiate and allocate royalties based on content categories. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) oversees the collection and distribution of royalty fees from cable and satellite operators for retransmitted broadcast programming. Royalties are allocated among categories like movies, sports, and music through negotiated settlements or CRB proceedings. Claimants are granted immunity from antitrust laws for agreements on royalty distribution. FCC regulations on cable operators included requirements from the 1960s to the late 1980s. In the late 1980s, the FCC's regulation of cable operators included the \"must-carry\" rule for local broadcast television signals. The courts voided this rule in 1985, leading to cable operators not paying copyright holders or broadcast stations for retransmitting local signals until 1992. The FCC recommended replacing the compulsory license with full copyright liability, but Congress retained the statutory licensing regime in the 1992 Cable Act. Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (1992 Cable Act; P.L. 102-385) amended the Communications Act, prohibiting MVPDs from redistributing broadcast signals without permission. Stations can choose \"must-carry\" for mandatory carriage or \"retransmission consent\" for negotiation of payment from cable and satellite operators. The Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 amended the Communications Act, giving stations the option of \"must-carry\" for mandatory carriage or \"retransmission consent\" for payment negotiation. Stations risk not being carried if an agreement is not reached with cable or satellite operators. Congress determined local station boundaries through a commercial research service. A station's local or distant status can impact mandatory carriage entitlement. Between 1992 and 1994, stations petitioned the FCC to be considered local for copyright purposes. The Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994 amended statutory license markets to align with FCC's market definitions for implementing must carry. Geographic zones determine copyright rates that MVPDs pay for retransmitted broadcast signals. In 1996, the FCC decided to use DMAs by Nielsen to define local markets. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 increased parity between satellite and cable services, creating a legal framework for satellite operators. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 established a legal framework for satellite operators, allowing them to retransmit local broadcast signals. It applied must-carry provisions to satellite operators on a case-by-case basis and limited their copyright liability. If the FCC modifies a market for must-carry rules, the modified market would be applicable for compulsory licensing. Cable operators were not required to seek permission before retransmitting broadcast television stations prior to the 1992 Cable Act. The 1992 Cable Act allowed cable operators to retransmit broadcast signals without seeking permission or compensating broadcasters. In contrast, the 1999 SHVIA required satellite operators to seek permission to retransmit local signals, aiming to create parity and competition between satellite and cable industries. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) aimed to create parity and competition between satellite and cable industries in providing local TV broadcast stations. It required broadcast stations to negotiate in good faith with cable and satellite operators, with this obligation being extended multiple times until January 1, 2020. The FCC implemented good faith negotiation provisions in 2000, with a list of standards. In 2014, rules were strengthened for retransmission consent. Congress revised the Communications Act to prohibit joint negotiation by top stations in a market. The FCC implemented new rules prohibiting joint negotiation between television broadcast stations in the same local market for retransmission consent. Section 103 of the Communications Act requires the FCC to prevent stations from limiting MVPDs' ability to carry signals deemed significantly viewed. The FCC implemented new rules to prevent joint negotiation between television broadcast stations in the same local market for retransmission consent. This includes prohibiting stations from limiting MVPDs' ability to carry signals deemed significantly viewed, unless they are under common de jure control permitted by the FCC. The FCC added a ninth per se good faith negotiation standard to its rules, allowing them to determine if parties have failed to negotiate retransmission consent in good faith based on the totality of circumstances. Increased competition among MVPDs has given broadcast television stations more negotiating leverage in retransmission consent negotiations since 1993. In 2005, Nexstar Broadcasting Group demanded cash from cable operators for retransmission consent, changing the traditional payment dynamic between broadcast networks and affiliates. This shift occurred as satellite operators and other MVPDs entered the market, increasing competition and negotiation leverage for broadcast stations. In recent years, broadcast networks have required stations to pay them \"reverse compensation\" or \"reverse retrans fees\" instead of paying affiliates to air network programming. CBS President/CEO Leslie Moonves emphasized the importance of getting paid for reverse compensation, stating that affiliates receive compensation primarily for primetime and football programming. Research firm SNL Kagan suggests that networks may ask stations to pay a fixed amount per MVPD subscriber for access to programming. Several networks require stations to pay fees for retransmission consent agreements, indirectly compensating content owners. Negotiations have become more complex due to consolidation among MVPDs and broadcast television station owners. CBS pulled its signals from Time Warner Cable in 2013, highlighting the contentious nature of these agreements. CBS pulled its signals from Time Warner Cable in 2013 due to a dispute over extra fees for on-demand access and licensing restrictions. After a monthlong standoff, they reached a five-year agreement with expanded on-demand rights. The increasing frequency of blackouts during retransmission consent negotiations has prompted a review of copyright and communications laws by congressional committees. In 2014, the FCC proposed changes to exclusivity rules for satellite and cable operators, aiming to modernize copyright and communications laws in response to technological advancements. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler highlighted the need to eliminate these rules to promote fair market operation and consumer welfare during retransmission consent disputes. The FCC sought comments on the elimination of exclusivity rules for satellite and cable operators during retransmission consent disputes. Key questions included the impact on the 1992 Cable Act, FCC's authority, \"localism\" policy goal, existing network/affiliate agreements, program suppliers' influence on exclusivity, and the effect on broadcasters. The FCC sought comments on updating rules for retransmission consent negotiations, including practices like blocking online access during disputes. The Senate Commerce Committee also directed the FCC to consider digital rights and online video programming in these negotiations. The FCC sought comments on updating rules for retransmission consent negotiations, including practices like blocking online access during disputes. Broadcast stations have begun to play a role in negotiations by relinquishing their right to grant retransmission consent to third parties. The FCC proposed new rules to include online video distributors offering linear programming in the definition of an \"MVPD\". The FCC proposed updating rules for retransmission consent negotiations, including considering exemptions for certain regulations. They are seeking comments on expanding the definition of \"MVPD\" to include online video distributors offering linear programming, ensuring fair competition with established providers. The FCC is considering expanding the definition of MVPD to include online video distributors, which would impact copyright law. Federal judges have been divided on whether online distributors qualify as \"cable systems\" for statutory copyright licensing. In Illinois, courts have ruled that online video distributors cannot use the statutory license. However, a U.S. district court in California has ruled that OVDs can use the statutory license."
