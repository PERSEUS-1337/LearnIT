    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Layoff Prevention Act of 2017\" and includes provisions for temporary financing of short-time compensation payments in states with existing programs, grants for short-time compensation programs, and assistance in implementing these programs. Payments to States will be made equal to 100 percent of short-time compensation paid under a program defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The payments will be reimbursed monthly based on estimated amounts, adjusted for any discrepancies in prior estimates. No payments shall be made to a State for short-time compensation exceeding 26 times the regular compensation amount for total unemployment in a benefit year. Payments to a State under a short-time compensation program are available for weeks of unemployment beginning after the enactment of the Act and ending within 5 years and 6 months. States can receive payments for not more than 260 weeks under this section and another section. The State can receive payments for up to 260 weeks under a short-time compensation program if a State law is enacted. Funding will be provided as necessary, and the Secretary will certify payments to each State. The section defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Labor and clarifies the meanings of \"State\", \"State agency\", and \"State law\". A technical correction to the Internal Revenue Code is also mentioned. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY FINANCING OF SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS. Federal-State Agreements allow states to participate in an agreement with the Secretary, as long as the state's law does not already provide for short-time compensation. States can terminate the agreement with 30 days' notice. The agreement requires the state agency to make payments of short-time compensation under an approved plan. The short-time compensation plan must adhere to payment requirements specified in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It limits the amount of compensation an individual can receive during a benefit year to 26 times the regular compensation under state law for a week of total unemployment. Additionally, the plan cannot provide payments to individuals employed seasonally by the participating employer. The short-time compensation plan requires employers to pay one-half of the compensation amount to the State, which is then deposited into the unemployment fund. States with agreements under this plan receive one-half of the compensation paid to individuals. The agreement between the State and the Secretary includes reimbursement for administrative expenses. Payments to the State are based on estimated entitlements for each month, adjusted for any discrepancies in prior estimates. The payment method is determined by mutual agreement between the Secretary and the State agency. The Secretary and State agency agree on funding for this section, with appropriations from the Treasury. The Secretary certifies payments to States. Agreements under this section apply to specific weeks of unemployment within a two-year timeframe. States have a two-year funding limitation. States may receive payments for up to 104 weeks under this section. If a State enacts a law for short-time compensation, they will no longer be eligible for payments under this section but can receive payments under a different section. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Labor. The terms \"State\", \"State agency\", and \"State law\" have specific meanings as defined in the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. SEC. 4.
