FINDINGS.\" The Congress finds that the United Nations Convention against Torture defines torture as intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering on a person for information, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights prohibits torture and cruel treatment. The prohibition on torture and ill-treatment is enshrined in various international treaties, including the ICCPR, Convention against Torture, European Convention for Human Rights, African Charter, and American Convention on Human Rights. This prohibition is also crucial in regulating parties' conduct in armed conflicts. The laws governing conduct in armed conflicts require protection of civilians and noncombatants, including captured soldiers. The Geneva Conventions prohibit violence, cruel treatment, and torture. The US government stated in 1999 that torture is not used in the country. In 1999, the United States categorically denounced the use of torture as illegal under existing Federal and State law, stating that no official is authorized to commit or condone torture. Torture violates provisions of the US Constitution and its Bill of Rights, including the Fourth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court has condemned the use of force amounting to torture or ill treatment during interrogations, including practices like whipping, slapping, and depriving prisoners of basic needs. This violates constitutional rights such as the right to remain silent, due process, and protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Article 4 of the Convention against Torture requires State parties to criminalize all acts of torture. Article 3 prohibits sending individuals to a state where they may face torture. Section 2242(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 states the US policy against expelling or extraditing individuals to face torture. The United States is prohibited from expelling or extraditing individuals to countries where they may face torture. This is in line with international human rights law and the Constitutional protections against torture. Transferring individuals to countries where torture is commonly used is inconsistent with these principles. Transfer of persons in custody. The Secretary of State must report to Congress every 6 months on countries where torture is common. No person in US custody can be transferred to a country on the list for detention. The Secretary can waive this prohibition under certain conditions. The Secretary of State must report to Congress every 6 months on countries with common torture practices. Congress must be assured of significant progress in eliminating torture or a mechanism to prevent it before transferring individuals to those countries. Assurances alone are not sufficient. The prohibition on transferring individuals to countries with common torture practices cannot be overridden by assurances from the foreign government. Extradition under treaties is allowed, but individuals can challenge it in a US court if they fear torture or inhuman treatment."
