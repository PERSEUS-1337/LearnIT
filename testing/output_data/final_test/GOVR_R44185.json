    "content": "The financial crisis of 2007-2008 was the worst since the Great Depression, prompting a swift and controversial federal policy response. The Federal Reserve utilized its emergency lending authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to create unprecedented tools to address financial instability. This section allowed the Fed to bypass statutory limitations on lending, collateral, and duration during the crisis. During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the Federal Reserve used Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to create emergency facilities and prevent the failure of firms like Bear Stearns and AIG. The Dodd-Frank Act later limited the Fed's discretion under this section, but some Members of Congress believe the changes were insufficient. The report reviews the history of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, including its use in 2008 during the financial crisis. It discusses the Fed's authority under Section 13(3) before and after the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as policy issues and legislation to amend the section. One of the main reasons for the Fed's creation was to act as a \"lender of last resort\" by providing liquidity to banks through the discount window. Discount window lending to banks occurs under the Fed's normal statutory authority. Nonbank financial firms also face liquidity needs, but the history of Fed lending to nonbanks is not as extensive. The Fed rarely invoked Section 13(3) for nonbank lending from 1932 to 2008, but extensively used it in response to the financial crisis in 2008. In 2008, the Fed utilized Section 13(3) to address financial crises surrounding Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, providing liquidity support and tailored assistance to prevent the failure of large firms. Credit extended peaked at $710 billion in November 2008, all of which has been repaid with interest. The Fed did not incur any losses and earned profits exceeding $30 billion, with a significant portion related to AIG. The Fed created six facilities under Section 13(3) in 2008 to extend credit to nonbank financial firms and financial markets. The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) were established to assist primary dealers. Loans were made to ensure the stability of primary dealers. The Fed established various facilities in 2008 to provide short-term loans to primary dealers and support the commercial paper market. These facilities included the AMLF, CPFF, MMIFF, and TALF, aimed at stabilizing financial firms and markets during the crisis. The Fed established facilities in 2008 to provide short-term loans to primary dealers and support the commercial paper market. TALF offered loans to private investors to purchase ABS, which are an alternative way to finance loans. ABS are often referred to as shadow banking activities. The decline in ABS value during the crisis reduced credit available to households and businesses. Table 1 summarizes the terms and uses of these facilities, with CPFF being the largest and TALF the smallest. None of these facilities extended credit after 2010. The Fed established facilities in 2008 to provide short-term loans to primary dealers and support the commercial paper market. Usage of the facilities spiked in 2008, peaked in December, and tapered off in 2009. From 2010 to 2014, there were only residual amounts of credit outstanding through TALF, with usage concentrated among a small number of borrowers. Section 13(3) was invoked to prevent the disorderly failure of four large financial firms on an ad hoc basis. In 2008, the Fed provided financial assistance to troubled firms like Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America to prevent their failure and stabilize the financial system. The assistance included bridge loans, lines of credit, and guarantees for troubled assets, totaling over $300 billion. The Fed provided financial assistance to firms like Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America in 2008 due to concerns about financial instability. The Fed viewed these firms as too big or interconnected to fail, not just needing short-term liquidity. Solvency evaluation was difficult during the crisis, with assets rapidly declining. Assistance was not a bailout as there was no clear evidence of insolvency. The Fed assisted firms like Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America in 2008 due to concerns about financial instability. While there was no clear evidence of insolvency, the firms eventually returned to profitability after the crisis. The Fed chose not to assist Lehman Brothers, leading to its bankruptcy filing. Bernanke later testified that Lehman Brothers lacked adequate collateral for assistance. The Fed's assistance to troubled firms like Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America in 2008 raised concerns about inadequate collateral. Lehman Brothers' failure marked a turning point in the financial crisis. Assets were purchased through Maiden Lane LLCs controlled by the Fed. Loans to Maiden Lanes and AIG tapered off until 2011 when they were fully repaid. Assistance to Citigroup and Bank of America took the form of asset guarantees under Section 13(3). The final profits to the Fed will be determined once residual asset holdings are extinguished. The Fed's authority to extend credit under Section 13(3) allows for assistance in unusual and exigent circumstances, with broad discretion on whom to lend to and what collateral to accept. This authority was added in 1932 and remained broad until the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The Federal Reserve can provide assistance in the form of loans to individuals or businesses, backed by approved collateral. The interest rate charged is limited, and evidence of inability to secure credit elsewhere is required. Despite these restrictions, the Fed took unorthodox actions in 2008, moving assets off institutions' balance sheets onto its own through structured loans. In 2008, the Fed took unorthodox actions by moving assets off institutions' balance sheets onto its own through structured loans, including creating limited liability corporations like Maiden Lane I, II, and III to purchase assets from AIG and Bear Stearns. Citigroup and Bank of America were offered guarantees on asset portfolios, while AIG received a direct loan backed by general assets. The Federal Reserve provided assistance during the 2008 financial crisis by extending facility expiration dates and making statutory revisions to allow for fully secured loans to securities firms. This change removed the requirement for collateral to be of a specific type and maturity, giving the Fed more flexibility in lending decisions. The Dodd-Frank Act amended Section 13(3) to prevent the Fed from bailing out failing firms while still allowing it to address market-access problems during a crisis. It replaced specific language with broader eligibility criteria and prohibited lending to insolvent firms. The Dodd-Frank Act amended Section 13(3) to prevent the Fed from bailing out failing firms, requiring loans to be secured to protect taxpayers and collateral to have a lendable value consistent with risk management practices. Proponents believed Fed assistance to too big to fail firms was no longer necessary, while the Fed justified its actions during the crisis due to perceived shortcomings in the bankruptcy process. The Dodd-Frank Act amended Section 13(3) to prevent the Fed from bailing out failing firms, creating the \"Orderly Liquidation Authority\" for non-banks. Critics oppose Title II, but proponents argue it eliminates the need for Fed assistance in preventing financial instability. Ben Bernanke stated that with the liquidation authority, the Fed's ability to make loans to troubled firms like Bear Stearns and AIG was no longer necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act amended Section 13(3) to prevent the Fed from bailing out failing firms, creating the \"Orderly Liquidation Authority\" for non-banks. Critics oppose Title II, but proponents argue it eliminates the need for Fed assistance in preventing financial instability. Ben Bernanke stated that with the liquidation authority, the Fed's ability to make loans to troubled firms like Bear Stearns and AIG was no longer necessary. Section 13(3) can be used only in \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" and had not been used for decades. The Fed had not promulgated a rule governing its use as of 2008, even though it had the discretion to do so. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Fed to promulgate a rule implementing Section 1101 \"as soon as is practicable,\" and the Fed issued a proposed rule in 2013. Critics believe that the vagueness of the rule is undesirable because it maximizes the Fed's future discretion. On December 18, 2015, the Fed promulgated a final rule implementing Section 1101. The final rule implementing Section 1101 provided more specificity and less discretion for the Fed compared to the proposed rule. It requires lending at a \"penalty rate\" and prohibits lending to firms in bankruptcy or insolvency, as well as those not current on debt. The final rule also prohibits lending to facilities unless open to at least five eligible borrowers, healthy firms, or firms to prevent third-party failure. The final rule implementing Section 1101 provides more specificity and less discretion for the Fed compared to the proposed rule. It requires lending at a \"penalty rate\" and prohibits lending to firms in bankruptcy or insolvency, as well as those not current on debt. Additionally, it prohibits lending to facilities unless open to at least five eligible borrowers, healthy firms, or firms to prevent third-party failure. Following the use of Section 13(3) in 2008, three laws have been enacted affecting congressional oversight of emergency lending, including requirements for Fed reporting and Government Accountability Office audits. The Dodd-Frank Act required reporting on emergency assistance within seven days and public release of lending records. GAO was allowed to audit Section 13(3) actions for various aspects. The Dodd-Frank Act required reporting on emergency assistance within seven days and public release of lending records. GAO audited various aspects of Section 13(3) actions, including financial reporting, internal controls, collateral policies, favoritism, and the use of third-party contractors. GAO conducted audits of all Fed emergency facilities created between December 2007 and enactment, but cannot disclose confidential information until lending records are released. Economists differentiate between liquidity and solvency problems faced by financial firms. Insolvency occurs when assets are worth less than liabilities, while liquidity problems arise from maturity mismatches between long-term assets and short-term liabilities. The Fed was created as a lender of last resort to provide short-term loans to banks facing liquidity crises, where depositors withdraw funds and banks struggle to meet withdrawals. Holding more cash and fewer loans can reduce the likelihood of a bank run, but it may make loans more expensive for customers. The Fed's ability to control the money supply puts it in a unique position to address liquidity issues in the financial system. The Fed was created as a lender of last resort to provide short-term loans to banks facing liquidity crises. It can potentially provide unlimited liquidity to end financial crises, but it cannot address solvency problems. Allowing panics to run their course was the approach before the creation of the Fed, but it led to significant economic contractions. Financial firms extend less credit during crises, causing economic contractions. Nonbank financial firms also face liquidity problems, justifying the Fed's emergency authority. Nonbank financial firms also face liquidity problems, justifying the Fed's emergency authority. In 2008, the availability of short-term lending sharply contracted, causing liquidity problems for banks and nonfinancial firms. Some nonbank financial firms could benefit from access to Fed lending in a liquidity crisis, but policymakers might grant them access only if there is a wider societal benefit. The nonbank financial sector has grown in size and importance relative to banks. The 2008 crisis showed that a nonbank crisis can have damaging effects on credit availability and the broader financial system. The 2008 crisis highlighted the damaging effects of a nonbank crisis on credit availability and the financial system. This raises questions about providing nonbanks access to the Federal Reserve system and whether they should be subject to Fed supervision. Some uses of Section 13(3) during the crisis aimed to revive long-term consumer and business credit. The 2008 crisis highlighted the damaging effects of a nonbank crisis on credit availability and the financial system. Some uses of Section 13(3) aimed to revive long-term consumer and business credit by increasing liquidity. The Dodd-Frank Act now requires that assistance provided under Section 13(3) be for the purpose of providing liquidity to the financial system. The advantage of providing long-term credit to nonfinancial firms is that it directly stimulates physical capital investment spending on plant and equipment, which in turn directly stimulates gross domestic product (GDP). However, a disadvantage is that it is more likely to put the Fed in the position of \"picking winners\", and the Fed lacks expertise in evaluating the creditworthiness of loan proposals. The potential disadvantage of the Fed's lending is the risk of crowding out private capital, especially in long-term credit scenarios. Congress may also need to consider excluding government-related entities from assistance under Section 13(3). Some Members of Congress are concerned about the possibility of using Section 13(3) to aid state or municipal governments, although the Fed has not done so in the past. During the crisis, the Fed utilized Section 13(3) to structure transactions as loans to a LLC it controlled, like the Commercial Paper Funding Facility in 2008. This allowed the Fed to purchase commercial paper by lending funds to the LLC for the purchases. The Fed utilized Section 13(3) during the crisis to lend funds to a LLC it controlled for purchasing commercial paper. Policy issues arise regarding whether the Fed should restrict lending to its controlled LLCs and modify Section 13(3) to allow for purchasing debt securities for short-term liquidity. This could make the Fed a more effective lender of last resort, but there are concerns about the \"slippery slope\" of allowing the Fed to purchase securities directly or through controlled LLCs. The Fed's use of LLCs in the Maiden Lanes case raised concerns about the \"slippery slope\" of providing short-term liquidity. The Dodd-Frank Act allows the Fed to create LLCs but prohibits programs that remove assets from a specific company's balance sheet. The costs of Section 13(3) lending include risks to taxpayers and broader economic consequences, which must be weighed against the potential benefits of restoring financial stability. The Fed can attach conditions to its lending to minimize default risk, including requiring short maturities, excess collateral, senior creditor standing, and recourse if collateral is insufficient. Loans to non-banks may not be inherently riskier than loans to banks, but the risk increases when conditions are loosened. The Fed's ability to safeguard lending to non-banks is limited compared to banks due to lack of supervision jurisdiction. In times of crisis, the Fed's broader ability to restore financial stability reduces default risk. The Fed protected taxpayers through unconventional terms like requiring equity stakes in exchange for loans. However, recent court rulings may limit the Fed's ability to protect against losses in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits assistance to failing firms, limiting future scenarios where the Fed would need to take an equity stake. Concerns about moral hazard in Section 13(3) lending have been raised, as firms may take greater risks if protected from negative outcomes. Some argue for repealing or curbing Section 13(3) due to moral hazard, but Bernanke compares it to shutting down the fire department to encourage fire safety. Fed cannot mitigate moral hazard through prudential measures like with banks. The Fed's broad discretion under Section 13(3) allowed swift action, pledging funds, creating diverse facilities, and addressing various problems. Limiting discretion is a common goal in proposals to alter Section 13(3) to reduce moral hazard concerns. Market discipline may help but cannot eliminate liquidity crises. The Fed's broad discretion under Section 13(3) allowed swift action, creating diverse facilities, and addressing various problems. However, there are concerns that assistance provided may not always align with the intended purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act. Critics question whether the Act successfully rules out aiding insolvent firms, despite limitations imposed by the Fed's final rule. The Fed's emergency authority allows for lending to prevent firm failures, avoid bankruptcy, and address financial crises. However, there are concerns about potential favoritism in decision-making and limited access to loans for certain investors. The Fed's emergency authority allows for lending to prevent firm failures, avoid bankruptcy, and address financial crises. Concerns about favoritism and limited access to loans for certain investors arise due to the potential for discretion in third-party vendor selection. The Fed argues that maintaining independence is crucial for credibility and effectiveness, but this complicates accountability to Congress. The Dodd-Frank Act requires preapproval by the Treasury Secretary for Section 13(3) assistance, reducing independence from the Administration. Fed governor Jerome Powell supports maintaining current discretion under Section 13(3) for monetary policy independence. The Fed's emergency lending authority under Section 13(3) should be maintained to allow flexibility in responding to future financial crises. Critics argue that discretion can increase uncertainty and systemic risk, citing the example of Lehman Brothers' failure. The Dodd-Frank Act has already reduced some of the Fed's independence in this area. The Dodd-Frank Act reduced the Fed's discretion under Section 13(3), with Governor Powell supporting the balance struck by the reforms. Chair Yellen warns that H.R. 3189 would limit the Fed's crisis response ability, while Chairman Hensarling believes Dodd-Frank failed to rein in the Fed's emergency lending authority. Congress could further restrict Section 13(3) or require approval for each action, potentially impacting the Fed's crisis response timeliness and credibility. Congress could add additional restrictions to Section 13(3) affecting the Fed's crisis response, such as eligibility criteria, terms of assistance, limits on total assistance, and penalty rates for lending. This discretion granted to the Fed by Congress raises questions about balancing policy considerations effectively. Economists and central bankers differ on how stringent penalty rates should be, with the general principle being to lend against good collateral at a penalty rate. Consensus is divided on the appropriate penalty rate for lending by the central bank. A higher penalty rate maximizes returns and discourages reliance on the central bank, but it may also pose risks to financial stability by deterring firms from borrowing. Balancing these goals is crucial for effective policy implementation. During a crisis, higher rates could harm borrowers and hinder stability. The terms of assistance to AIG were initially favorable but later renegotiated. Market rates are challenging to calculate during a crisis due to illiquidity and higher rates. Critics wrongly accused the Fed of charging below-market rates. The Fed charged rates above market rates influenced by monetary policy. Loans were given to banks and investment funds to relieve stress in the commercial-paper and private-securitization markets. Borrowers participated if they expected profits to exceed risks. The Fed made programs attractive to banks and investors by offering non-recourse loans. This arrangement may have benefits, such as avoiding the need to \"pick winners\" or develop financial expertise. The final rule requires the Fed to charge a penalty rate, with many Members of Congress arguing for transparency in Fed lending practices. The Fed argues against disclosing information on firms accessing its facilities, citing concerns about undermining investor confidence and potentially leading to destabilizing runs on institutions. Critics may see less Fed lending as positive, but it could make the financial system less safe if institutions are unwilling to access Fed facilities. The Fed's decision to discourage banks from using the discount window in the Great Depression worsened the bank panic. Disclosure of identities may impact investor willingness to borrow during crises. Examples like the RFC and TARP fund recipients show mixed evidence on the effects of publicizing loans. The Fed released aggregate information about TARP participation, with concerns from banks about repayment timing to avoid appearing weak. Disclosure policies vary between broad policy purposes and investor interests, with the latter only reluctantly released when compelled. Transparency for oversight purposes would suffice with aggregate information, while specific transaction details are necessary for issues like favoritism. Releasing borrower identities to prevent favoritism is debated, as it may deter future program uptake. Some suggest repealing Section 13(3) instead of stigmatizing recipients. The Dodd-Frank Act balanced stability and oversight by requiring public disclosure of borrower identities with a delay. Congress is considering revisiting this issue through the Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act (H.R. 3189). The Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act (H.R. 3189) was passed by the House on November 19, 2015. Section 11 of the bill limits the Fed's discretion to make emergency loans to \"unusual and exigent circumstances\" requiring the affirmative vote of nine presidents of Federal reserve banks. It also prohibits the Fed from accepting equity securities as collateral and requires rules for determining collateral sufficiency. The Fed Oversight Reform and Modernization Act (H.R. 3189) passed by the House limits the Fed's emergency loans to specific circumstances. It requires certification of borrower solvency by the Fed's Board and other regulators. Assistance is limited to financial institutions, and a minimum interest rate on emergency loans is mandated. The Bailout Prevention Act (S. 1320) would limit the Fed's discretion to make emergency loans by requiring certification of borrower solvency based on financial data for the most recent four months. Borrowers must have assets exceeding liabilities, and the Fed is forbidden from lending to a bridge company. The Bailout Prevention Act (H.R. 2625) limits the Fed's emergency lending by setting criteria for borrower solvency and eligibility. It prohibits lending to bridge companies and requires a minimum interest rate on loans. The Fed can create programs outside these criteria with congressional notification, but they must be authorized within 30 days or terminate. Section 4 of the bill is unrelated to Fed emergency lending. The Bailout Prevention Act (H.R. 2625) sets criteria for borrower solvency and eligibility for Fed emergency lending. It prohibits lending to bridge companies, requires a minimum interest rate on loans, and allows the Fed to create programs outside these criteria with congressional notification. The Bailout Prevention Act (H.R. 2625) establishes criteria for borrower solvency and eligibility for Fed emergency lending. It allows the Fed to create programs that do not meet the bill's criteria with congressional notification. The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) was created by the Fed to expand its securities lending program for primary dealers before Bear Stearns' liquidity crisis in 2008. The Fed created the TSLF and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility to provide short-term liquidity for primary dealers, including Bear Stearns. The TSLF allowed primary dealers to borrow up to $200 billion of Treasury securities for 28 days, signaling the Fed's willingness to lend on a larger scale. This was crucial for primary dealers who needed access to Treasury securities for repurchase agreements. The Fed created the TSLF Options Program within the TSLF in 2008, allowing primary dealers to pre-negotiate options to borrow securities. The program expired in 2010 with no losses and earned $781 million. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was established in 2008 after Bear Stearns' crisis, functioning as a discount window for primary dealers. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was established in 2008 as a discount window for primary dealers. Loans were made at the Fed's discount rate, fully collateralized, and with acceptable collateral including various securities. Borrowing from the facility was sporadic, peaking at $148 billion in October 2008 before expiring in February 2010 with no losses incurred. In 2008, the PDCF had no outstanding loans after May 2009 and earned $0.5 billion in interest income. Large firms issue commercial paper to meet liquidity needs, with three categories of issuers: financial firms, nonfinancial firms, and pass-through entities. Commercial paper is short-term debt purchased by investors with an average maturity of 30 days. Individual investors purchase highly rated commercial paper through MMMFs and money market accounts. On September 16, 2008, a MMMF called the Reserve Fund \"broke the buck\" due to losses from Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, leading to a run on MMMFs. The Fed created the AMLF to address disruptions in the commercial paper markets. The Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) provided nonrecourse loans to banks to purchase asset-backed commercial paper. At its peak in October 2008, it had $152 billion in loans outstanding. The AMLF was later replaced by the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) in October 2009. The AMLF had no losses, earned $0.5 billion in income, and expired on February 1, 2010. The CPFF was created to purchase highly rated U.S. commercial paper and charged an interest rate equal to the three-month overnight index swap rate. The CPFF purchased commercial paper from issuers at interest rates based on the type of debt. It held $351 billion at its peak in January 2009, with no losses incurred. The facility expired on February 1, 2010, earning $6.1 billion in income. The AMLF utilized banks as intermediaries to assist the commercial paper market, with 92% of credit extended through JPMorgan Chase and State Street. The AMLF extended credit through two custodial banks, JPMorgan Chase and State Street, which were major providers of fund administration for MMMFs. The CPFF provided Fed assistance directly to commercial paper issuers, bypassing banks as intermediaries. The Fed announced the MMIFF to lend up to $540 billion to SPVs investing in commercial paper from highly rated financial institutions, but the facility was never accessed and expired. The Fed created the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) in response to problems in the market for asset-backed securities (ABS). ABS issuance declined sharply, leading to high risk premiums. The Fed made nonrecourse loans to private investment funds to purchase ABS with the highest credit rating, aiming to maintain credit flow to consumers and mitigate the economic downturn. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) provided nonrecourse loans to investment funds to buy high-rated ABS as collateral, including auto loans, student loans, small business loans, and credit card loans. It later expanded to include commercial MBS. Loans had terms up to three years (five for some assets) and were repaid when ABS matured or sold. Interest rates were set above LIBOR or federal funds rate. Losses on ABS value were covered by the Fed and Treasury, making TALF riskier for taxpayers. Fed lent less than market. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was riskier for taxpayers than typical Fed lending facilities. The Fed lent less than the market value of the collateral, with losses covered by the Fed and Treasury. TALF peaked at $48 billion, smaller than envisioned due to low issuance of eligible assets and investor aversion to ABS. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) steadily rose through 2009, stopped new loans in June 2010, and all loans were repaid in full by October 29, 2014. TALF made profits of $1.6 billion for the Fed and $0.7 billion for the Treasury. Bear Stearns faced bankruptcy in 2008, and the Fed provided a $12.9 billion bridge loan to JP Morgan Chase to prevent it. JP Morgan Chase received a bridge loan from the Fed to acquire Bear Stearns, which was repaid with interest. The Fed also lent $28.82 billion to Maiden Lane I to purchase mortgage-related assets from Bear Stearns. Maiden Lane I was responsible for repaying the Fed, while JP Morgan Chase took a subordinated loan position. Any additional losses would be covered by the Fed. By November 2012, Maiden Lane I assets were sold to fully repay the Fed and JP Morgan Chase. Remaining assets as of December 30, 2014, were valued at $1.7 billion. The Fed stands to gain additional capital gains once these assets are sold, depending on their future value. AIG faced stock price declines and credit rating downgrades in September 2008 due to losses on various operations. In September 2008, AIG experienced a significant decline in stock price and credit rating downgrades, leading to demands for collateral payments. The Fed intervened with a $85 billion line of credit and warrants to purchase up to 79.9% of AIG's equity to prevent bankruptcy. In October 2008, the Fed announced an additional $37.8 billion loan to AIG against securities. In November 2008, the financial support for AIG was restructured, including reducing the Fed loan to $60 billion, purchasing $40 billion in preferred shares through TARP, and replacing the loan with up to $52.5 billion in asset purchases. The government maintained a 79.9% equity position in AIG. In March 2009, the assistance was further restructured with a partial payback of the Fed loan through a debt-for-equity swap in two AIG subsidiaries. In September 2010, AIG and the government announced a restructuring of the government's assistance, aiming to simplify the government's interest in AIG and provide a path for divesting its stake. This involved a partial payback of the Fed loan through a debt-for-equity swap in two AIG subsidiaries, reducing the maximum loan amount to $35 billion. Additionally, commitments were made for future TARP purchases of up to $29.8 billion in preferred shares at AIG's discretion. The restructuring closed on January 14, 2011, with the goal of ending the Fed's involvement with AIG and transferring the Fed's equity interests to the Treasury. The government and AIG restructured the assistance in September 2010 to simplify the government's stake in AIG. This involved converting preferred shares into common shares and selling them to the public. The Fed's loans were repaid, assets in Maiden Lane LLCs were sold, and Maiden Lanes II and III were terminated in 2014. The Fed earned interest on the loan to AIG and Maiden Lanes, while Treasury received additional funds from the sale of equity. In November 2008, the Treasury, Fed, and FDIC intervened in Citigroup with a $20 billion purchase of preferred shares and a government guarantee for $301 billion in assets. In December 2009, Citigroup and Treasury canceled the asset guarantee, with the Fed receiving a $50 million termination fee. On January 16, 2009, the Treasury, Fed, and FDIC intervened in Bank of America, providing $20 billion in preferred shares and a joint guarantee on up to $118 billion of assets to support the merger with Merrill Lynch. The Fed received a $50 million termination fee for the asset guarantee. Bank of America announced a guarantee for its assets acquired through the merger with Merrill Lynch, lasting 10 years for residential mortgage-related assets and 5 years for others. The bank would cover up to $10 billion in losses, with subsequent losses split 90% to the government and 10% to Bank of America. A final agreement was never signed, and on September 21, 2009, Bank of America negotiated a $425 million termination fee to withdraw from the Asset Guarantee Program."
