    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Enhancing America's Security through Strategic Redeployment from Iraq Act.\" Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The \"Enhancing America's Security through Strategic Redeployment from Iraq Act\" emphasizes the importance of ending the war in Iraq in a strategic manner to ensure national security, protect US Armed Forces, and maintain stability in the region. It highlights that an open-ended US involvement in Iraq is unsustainable and calls for the redeployment of military forces to prevent over-strain. Key supporting facts include the high percentage of Army equipment in Iraq and the lack of readiness of units for deployment in other contingencies. The lengthy redeployment process from Iraq involves challenges in redeploying troops and civilian contractors, closing bases, and handling Forward Operating Bases. It takes around 100 days to close one base, and decisions on closures depend on surrounding strife. The redeployment process from Iraq faces logistical challenges due to limited receiving facilities in Kuwait and the reliance on a single road for troop movement. Comparatively, the withdrawal of troops from Somalia in 1993 took six months and required additional troops for protection. The redeployment of United States forces from Iraq will take at least a year, more likely 15 to 20 months due to logistical challenges. SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY. Congress declares the critical need for a comprehensive security plan for Iraq and the region, including a deliberate redeployment of US forces to ensure the safety of troops and national security. This redeployment would allow for the return of troops to the US and deployment to other areas like Afghanistan where terrorists threaten national security. Congress declares that a planned end to United States involvement in Iraq will force Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for security and governance, while providing Iran and Syria with incentives to prevent violence. The United States intelligence community has found that Iran and Syria are currently involved in activities that pose a threat to national security. Iran and Syria, currently involved in the fighting in Iraq, want stability and can play a constructive role in improving security. The redeployment of US forces may take up to 20 months, providing an opportunity for diplomatic efforts with Iran and Syria for political accommodation in Iraq. Congress believes a \"date certain\" deadline for redeployment could incentivize Iraqi leaders and prevent violence with Iran and Syria. To ensure strategic approach for US security and Iraqi stability post-redeployment, Syria supports a goal-based end instead of a specific date, aiming to prevent violence and promote stability. SEC. 4. REDEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS. Redeployment of US Armed Forces in Iraq under Operation Iraqi Freedom must start within three months of this Act and troop levels should be 15,000 below pre-surge levels within six months. The goal is to have all forces deployed outside Iraq within twenty months or returned to the US. The redeployment of US Armed Forces in Iraq under Operation Iraqi Freedom must begin within three months of this Act. Troop levels should be reduced by 15,000 below pre-surge levels within six months, with the goal of having all forces deployed outside Iraq within twenty months or returned to the US. The redeployment is aimed at enhancing global security interests and improving military readiness, with exceptions for special operations forces and military liaison teams. Members of military liaison teams, Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps providing air support, Armed Forces securing US diplomatic missions in Iraq, and personnel conducting routine functions of the Office of Defense Attache are authorized activities under section 168 of title 10, United States Code. SEC. 5 of the Act limits funds for Operation Iraqi Freedom to support a maximum of 115,000 US troops in Iraq, with a goal of no funding for troops in Iraq within twenty months. SEC. 6 focuses on diplomatic efforts by the United States. SEC. 6 emphasizes the United States' leadership in diplomatic efforts for regional stability, including convening an international conference for economic aid and reconstruction in Iraq."
