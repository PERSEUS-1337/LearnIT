    "content": "The \"Predominantly Black Institution Act of 2006\" is a new section added to the Higher Education Act of 1965, specifically addressing predominantly black institutions. The Congress acknowledges the progress made by Black Americans in higher education but notes disparities in enrollment and graduation rates compared to Whites. White college participation was 46% from 2000-2002, while for Blacks, it was only 39%. The gap in baccalaureate degree attainment rates between White and Black students exceeds 10%. A growing number of Black American students are enrolling in urban and rural Predominantly Black Institutions, which cater to traditional and non-traditional minority students. The majority of students at these institutions come from low- and middle-income families and qualify for Federal student assistance programs. Data shows that 47% of Pell grant recipients are Black, compared to only 21% of Whites. Many Black students at Predominantly Black Institutions are first-generation college students with inadequate academic preparation. These institutions play a crucial role in providing opportunities for minority students and have a unique mission in higher education. Predominantly Black Institutions serve low-income, Black American, and minority students, providing access to higher education and opportunities in American society. These institutions face challenges in attracting, retaining, and graduating students, necessitating financial assistance for physical plants and financial management. The purpose of this section is to assist Predominantly Black Institutions in expanding educational opportunities through federal assistance. Strengthening physical plants, financial management, academic resources, and endowments of these institutions can reduce reliance on governmental financial support and encourage reliance on endowments and private sources. The section outlines eligibility criteria for institutions seeking federal assistance, including minimum student enrollment, percentage of low-income or first-generation students, and educational programs leading to degrees. The terms \"low-income individual\" and \"means-tested federal benefit program\" are defined within the section. The curr_chunk defines a means-tested Federal benefit program as a program where eligibility for benefits is based on income or resources. It also defines the term \"State\" as each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The curr_chunk outlines criteria for institutions eligible for a Federal benefit program, including enrollment of needy undergraduate students and low educational expenditures compared to similar institutions. The curr_chunk specifies eligibility criteria for institutions to participate in a Federal benefit program, including having at least 40 percent Black American undergraduate students, offering bachelor's or associate's degrees, and being accredited by a recognized agency. The curr_chunk outlines the criteria for determining eligibility of institutions for a Federal benefit program, emphasizing the enrollment of needy students as a key factor. The criteria for determining eligibility for a Federal benefit program include being Pell Grant recipients, coming from families receiving means-tested Federal benefits, and attending a qualifying secondary school. The paragraph discusses the criteria for determining eligibility for a Federal benefit program based on school enrollment of children exceeding 30% under specific regulations or being first-generation college students, with a majority being low-income individuals. Authorized activities are also mentioned. Grants awarded to Predominantly Black Institutions are used to enhance capacity to serve low- and middle-income Black American students, expand higher education opportunities, and strengthen financial ability to support academic needs. Grants awarded to Predominantly Black Institutions are used for authorized activities such as academic instruction in underrepresented disciplines, teacher education programs, and community outreach initiatives to enhance academic skills and interest in students. Predominantly Black Institutions can use grant funds for activities that contribute to academic skills and postsecondary education pursuits. Up to 20% of the funds can be used to establish or increase an endowment fund, subject to approval by the Secretary. Predominantly Black Institutions can use grant funds for academic activities, including establishing or increasing an endowment fund. Matching funds from non-Federal sources are required, and limitations apply to the use of funds for construction or maintenance of facilities. Predominantly Black Institutions receive Pell Grant allotments based on the number of Pell Grant recipients in attendance. The allotments are calculated as a ratio of recipients at the institution to total recipients at all eligible institutions. The Pell Grant allotments for Predominantly Black Institutions are based on the number of graduates seeking higher degrees and their attendance at specific institutions within two years of graduation. The allotments are calculated as a ratio of graduates per institution to total graduates at all eligible institutions.

Reallotment may occur to meet the minimum allotment requirement. The Pell Grant program for Predominantly Black Institutions allows reallotment of unused funds to other institutions in proportion to their original allotment. Institutions must submit an application to receive their allotment of Federal funds for grants.
