    "content": "The Samoan archipelago, located about 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii, consists of Western Samoa and American Samoa. American Samoa, with a population of about 60,000, became a permanent American presence after the Spanish-American War in 1898. President McKinley directed the Navy to assume responsibility for American Samoa in 1900, which lasted until 1951 when jurisdiction was transferred to the U.S. Department of the Interior. In the middle 1950s, an insular constitutional government was developed in American Samoa, with a formal constitution approved in 1960. The islands are mountainous with a tropical climate and limited land suitable for agriculture. Local produce like fruits, vegetables, and root crops are grown and consumed by families, while more diverse products are imported. Pago Pago harbor serves as a tuna port, and fish processing is the primary private-sector industry. Tourism has developed, but the islands' isolation makes it somewhat exotic. The insular minimum wage is set by the Secretary of Labor through a Special Industry Committee under the Fair Labor Standards Act. In 2007, the minimum wage for tuna canneries in American Samoa was $3.26 per hour, lower than the federal rate of $5.15 per hour. Congress later raised the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour over several years, leading to adjustments in the insular minimum wage system. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 aimed to establish minimum wages, overtime pay, and restrict child labor, but its application to territories like American Samoa was not well considered. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 exempted Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands from its full force, placing them under a special industry committee structure for special treatment. The act required the Department of Labor to convene industry committees to recommend higher wage rates. The committee recommends minimum wage rates for industries, considering economic conditions and employment impact. Rates should not exceed 40 cents per hour. The Administrator has discretion and must consider various factors. Post-World War II, American Samoa gained attention due to a Supreme Court decision regarding FLSA application to contractors in Bermuda. The Supreme Court decision in Vermilya-Brown identified \"possessions\" covered under the act as including Puerto Rico, Guam, the guano islands, Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. Justice Jackson noted a U.S. facility in Bermuda was different from \"our possessions.\" In 1953, a tuna canning operation began in American Samoa, becoming the island's main employer. The industry in Samoa became aware of likely enforcement of FLSA standards. William D. Moore, Jr. urged Samoa to be exempt from the act. William D. Moore, Jr., chair of the House Committee on Labor and Education, urged for Samoa's exemption from the FLSA due to the island's limited industries. He highlighted the success of a fishery and processing plant in Pago Pago, emphasizing the efficiency of American Samoans in the industry. Assistant Secretary of the Interior, Orme Lewis, also advocated for special consideration for American Samoa to attract American businesses to the island. Orme Lewis advocated for special consideration for American Samoa in terms of labor legislation, emphasizing the need for minimum wages to be established based on economic conditions. Secretary of the Navy, C. S. Thomas, urged for an amendment to the FLSA to prevent wage distortions in off-shore jurisdictions. Van Camp Sea Foods sought FLSA amendment in 1956 due to concerns about the local economy in American Samoa. William Moore reported on the lack of fish supply and poor condition of the refrigeration plant, noting the application of wage-and-hour laws in the region. Van Camp Sea Foods was awarded a 5-year lease in American Samoa to improve the economy by developing fishing skills and providing local income through wages. Despite operating at a loss, the company was the only industry on the island and had around 300 employees in 1956. The productivity of Van Camp Sea Foods in American Samoa was lower than mainland cannery workers due to climatic conditions. The temperature ranged from 70 to 90 degrees with high humidity. Most employees were women, and wages ranged from 27 cents to $1 per hour. Concerns were raised about the impact of paying minimum wage on the company's profitability. Representative James Roosevelt questioned the company's ability to make a profit. The witness, Roosevelt, questioned the impact of paying minimum wage on Van Camp Sea Foods' profitability and the productivity of their American Samoa operation. He pressed for clarification on the company's operations and the potential effects of wage law modifications. Moore stated that the company's operations in American Samoa would not be a substantial part of their production. He mentioned additional expenses for transporting materials to Samoa and a planned wage increase. Roosevelt questioned the impact of closing the cannery on the island's economy and its effect on other firms entering insular commerce. Moore discussed the company's operations in American Samoa, mentioning transportation costs and a planned wage increase. Roosevelt questioned the impact of closing the cannery on the island's economy and its effect on other firms entering insular commerce. The discussion revolved around the importance of receiving relief for the company to continue operations. As the hearing progressed, there was speculation about the impact of the minimum wage for Samoan workers. Wayne Aspinall stated that if the minimum wage were enforced in Samoa, Van Camp Seafood Co. would fail and close, putting people out of employment. Aspinall acknowledged the cultural significance of Samoa and the importance of retaining certain attributes among the people. Representative Orvin B. Fjare expressed concerns about the impact of industrialization on the traditional economy of Samoa, questioning if the people might resist the changes. President Roosevelt clarified that the Samoans were not seeking complete exemption from wage laws, but rather a review of the wage scale over time to prevent exploitation by industries. He emphasized the need to avoid blanket exemptions that could invite exploitation of the Samoan people. The Assistant Director of the Office of Territories, DOI, highlighted the negative impact of applying stateside wage scales in American Samoa, warning of economic disruption and inflation. Governor Richard Barrett Lowe advocated for exempting American Samoa from the Fair Labor Standards Act to protect the local economy. AFL-CIO legislative concerns were also raised. Walter J. Mason, AFL-CIO legislative representative, opposed exempting American Samoa from the Fair Labor Standards Act, citing concerns about setting a precedent for further exemptions and the negative impact on underdeveloped areas. He argued against making changes that would turn Samoa into a haven for runaway shops. Walter J. Mason opposed exempting American Samoa from the Fair Labor Standards Act, expressing concerns about creating a refuge for runaway shops and giving too much discretion to the Secretary of Labor. He emphasized the importance of fair wages for Samoan workers and urged a careful consideration of all repercussions before taking any hasty actions. Roosevelt questioned the need for hasty action and suggested setting up committees on a tripartite basis to determine the minimum wage. Economic concerns were raised by the Seafarers International Union regarding low-wage labor in Samoa impacting tuna cannery workers in the US. Representative Earl Chudoff raised concerns about unfair competition to the domestic tuna industry due to goods being manufactured in Samoa with cheap labor rates. Van Camp Sea Foods spokesman, Moore, criticized the existing minimum wage in Samoa as unrealistic and unwarranted, stating it would negatively impact the islands' economic and social structure. He attributed the difference in labor costs to efficiency. The difference in labor costs is attributed to efficiency, with Moore claiming that it takes 3 to 5 Samoans to produce what 1 stateside employee can. Van Camp must be relieved from its liabilities under the Fair Labor Standards Act to proceed with developing the fishery and processing plant. Senator Paul Douglas questioned if Samoa is covered by the act, to which Van Camp's counsel confirmed it is. Senator H. Alexander Smith introduced a bill to amend the FLSA in 1956, aiming to adjust the minimum wage in Samoa and exempt employers who did not comply with the Act. Senator John Kennedy supported the bill, emphasizing the need for this adjustment. Senator Kennedy supported the bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act in Samoa, stating that the provisions are essential for the Samoan economy to operate. Senator Holland confirmed that the rate of pay in the seafood canning industry was fixed by the Department of Defense to maintain the economy. The company in the industry mentioned by the Senator has been operating at a loss despite the current wage scale. The bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act in Samoa was supported by Senator Kennedy, who mentioned it would free employers from maintaining the minimum wage scale. The Smith amendment, modified by the Humphrey amendment, was adopted by a voice vote and sent to the House. The Samoan bill was called up in the House on July 26, 1956, and was adopted after a brief statement by Representative Roosevelt. President Dwight Eisenhower signed the measure into law (P.L. 84-1023) following the Puerto Rican example. The first special industry committee notice was published in October 1956. The first special industry committee (SIC) notice was published in October 1956 in the Federal Register. The SIC fell under the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. The notice outlined rules for hearings, evidentiary requirements, and committee member composition. Members were to represent the public, industry employees, and employers, with a focus on residents of the affected islands. The industry committee members must be disinterested, with one designated as chairman by the Secretary. Each committee is provided with a lawyer and economist for advice. Interested persons can participate, and the committee has subpoena powers. Factors considered include competitive conditions and costs, with no classification or minimum wage rates based solely on region, age, or sex. The curr_chunk discusses competitive conditions affected by transportation, living and production costs, wages established by collective labor agreements, employment and labor conditions, comparative production costs in mainland and foreign countries, and financial conditions reflected in profit and loss statements. The curr_chunk discusses financial conditions and trends reflected in profit and loss statements and balance sheets. Testimony on inability to absorb wage increases must be supported by tangible objective data. Committees recommend minimum wages to reach economically feasible levels without substantially curtailing employment. Industry committees operate on their own initiative, with the first committee for Samoa appointed by the Secretary of Labor in 1957. The first industry committee for Samoa was appointed on March 20, 1957, with the goal of reaching a minimum wage of $1.00 an hour. Different categories within the Samoan industry were identified, none of which initially met the federal minimum wage. Wage/Hour Administrator Newell Brown presented these findings in the Federal Register, highlighting the need to quickly reach the highest possible wage rate. The industry committee in Samoa aims to establish minimum wages for various industries. The canning, freezing, and processing of fish and aquatic life industry has a minimum wage of 38 cents per hour. The shipping and transportation industry, including air and water transport, has a minimum wage of 40 cents per hour. The petroleum marketing industry, which includes wholesale distribution of petroleum products, has a minimum wage of 45 cents per hour. The industry committee in Samoa sets minimum wages for various industries. Miscellaneous industries have a minimum wage of 35 cents per hour. The Federal Register announcement required posting of minimum wage rates for awareness. Committees were appointed with minor changes over time, adding new employment classifications. In 1961, 'shipping and transportation' was divided into two categories. In 1963, new categories were added to the minimum wage regulations, including the construction industry, hotels, retail trades, hospitals, educational institutions, laundry and dry cleaning, bottling industry, printing and publishing, wholesaling, warehousing, finance, and insurance. In 1971, Warren D. Landis proposed revisions to minimum wage regulations, requiring employers to provide tangible objective data and certified financial statements by an independent public accountant or sworn to conform with income tax returns. Affidavits could be submitted for absent persons, with the committee giving appropriate weight to the statements. In 1974, Secretary Peter Brennan expanded the scope of Industry Committee No. 11 to include government workers and others, instructing them to recommend the highest minimum wage rate that would not substantially curtail employment in the industry. In 1975 and 1976, the National Labor Relations Board investigated a contested election in the canning industry, raising concerns about its impact on the industry committee. Labor Secretary John Dunlop delayed the meeting of Industry Committee No. 12 in 1976 due to concerns about investigations affecting the industry process. In 1978, Industry Committee No. 13 faced complications following the Supreme Court's decision in National League of Cities v. Usery, which impacted the application of minimum wage and overtime provisions. Xavier M. Vela affirmed that the restrictions imposed by the Court should also apply in American Samoa. In 1985, the League of Cities case was overturned in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, impacting minimum wage and overtime provisions. American Samoa had been under administrated wage rates for nearly 30 years, with rates gradually increasing. In 1986, Labor Secretary William Brock appointed a new Special Industry Committee No. 17 to address wage issues. In March 1986, the Department produced an economic report on American Samoa, detailing the population, labor force, and employment statistics. The government and tuna canneries were primary employers in the region, with a significant interest in employee compensation. Within the tuna industry, the price of fish is negotiated between vessel operators and processors, with contract periods varying based on harvesting conditions and demand. Cannery workers in the U.S. received low wages, enabling imports to dominate the market. By the mid-1980s, tuna canneries were only operating in California, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa. In the mid-1980s, tuna canneries operated in California, Puerto Rico, and American Samoa. Cannery workers were represented by various unions, with some having collective bargaining agreements. State and local governmental employees were gradually brought under the FLSA. The Report advised that once wages in American Samoa reached mainland levels, they would follow the same time schedule for increases. The committee reviewed existing minimum wage rates for various industries in American Samoa, with rates ranging from $1.46 to $2.82 per hour. The tuna industry employed 72% of private sector employees under FLSA coverage. The SIC, chaired by Ronald St. Cyr, met in 1986 and heard from 20 witnesses. The Committee concluded that raising the minimum wage to mainland levels would not substantially affect employment in the island's industries. The Committee reviewed existing minimum wage rates in American Samoa, with varying opinions from employee and employer witnesses. Governmental opinion was mixed, with concerns about budgetary implications. Witnesses highlighted the need for higher wages, citing issues like underpayment in the medical sector affecting healthcare quality. Despite opposition, the committee ultimately recommended an increase in the minimum wage to $3.35 per hour. The committee concluded that increasing the minimum wage to $3.35 an hour in American Samoa would not significantly impact employment opportunities. The tuna industry argued against the wage increase due to competition from low-wage areas, but evidence showed declining production costs and increased tuna shipments. The industry also enjoyed advantages such as favorable tariffs and exemptions for landing raw fish. The Committee highlighted advantages for the tuna industry in American Samoa, including lower raw fish prices and minimum wages significantly lower than in Puerto Rico and the mainland U.S. Tax incentives and other advantages from the Samoan Government were also noted. The Committee mandated a minimum wage increase to $3.35 per hour by April 4, 1988, ending the thirty-year sub-minimum wage rate in American Samoa. The Special Industry Committee's report on the sub-minimum wage rate in American Samoa was met with mixed reviews. The findings were published in the Federal Register, with the minimum wage set to increase to $3.35 per hour after July 7, 1986. Litigation ensued to challenge the findings, but Congress ultimately overturned them, retaining the lower wage rates and appointing a new committee. The Special Industry Committee's report on the sub-minimum wage rate in American Samoa led to a new committee being appointed to recommend lower minimum wage rates. Representative Morris Udall expressed concerns about the potential economic impact, stating that the rate increases could cost the territorial government $7 million by FY1988 and force the tuna canning industry to shift operations to foreign locations. Proposed investments have already been discouraged. Representative Morris Udall expressed concerns about the new minimum wage rates in American Samoa, stating that they would make the territory less competitive for business. He argued that the proposed increases were unreasonable and that the Insular Areas Regulation Act does not amend the FLSA. Udall emphasized the need for a new industry committee to consider factors like maximum employment and business viability. The House and Senate approved the conference report on H.R. 2478, which aimed to increase the minimum wage in American Samoa to the national minimum wage. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on employment and business competitiveness in the region. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law on August 27, becoming P.L. 99-396. After H.R. 2478 was signed into law as P.L. 99-396 by President Ronald Reagan, a new committee was appointed to recommend minimum wage rates in American Samoa. The committee heard from various organizations and businesses, including the Government of American Samoa, tuna canning firms, and local businesses, to determine wage rates that would not significantly impact employment. At the committee meeting, Governor A. P. Lutali recommended no increase in the current FLSA minimum wage rates due to budget constraints and the need for more jobs in the tuna industry. Delegate Fofo Sunia also expressed concerns about the economic situation but suggested a possible wage increase in the future. Richard Montoya from Interior echoed the sentiment that American Samoa could not afford higher payroll costs at the moment, especially for tuna canneries and other businesses. Montoya recommended no increase in minimum wage rates to support job growth in American Samoa's private sector. The Committee considered factors like employment facilitation, regional competitiveness, and budget impacts. Economic data was presented by government and tuna cannery representatives. The committee could not agree on increasing the minimum wage, so no raise was given to government workers and cannery employees. Similar controversies arose in other industries like petroleum marketing and shipping, where evidence and testimony influenced decisions against a wage increase. In shipping and transportation, testimony indicated that business activity relied on the fish processing and canning industry. Workers in various industries were granted 10-cent increases. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed SIC No. 19 in March 1990, but a new issue delayed the Committee's work. In 1956, an SIC was established for American Samoa, assuming similar rules as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The issue of establishing higher wages without affecting employment led to court involvement. Regulations required tangible data to prove inability to raise wages. In Puerto Rico, farmers lacked financial statements. The Court found a lack of evidence to support recommendations. The House Committee later referred to this in 1974 FLSA amendments. The 1974 FLSA amendments aimed to ensure that findings of the SICs were based on adequate record-evidence to reveal the financial condition of employers. Senator Buckley opposed the evidentiary requirements, citing a lack of proof from Puerto Rican employers, while Senator Williams argued in favor of the bill. In the 1974 FLSA amendments, Senator Williams argued that industry committees must provide substantial documented evidence to support their conclusions on employers' financial conditions. The amendments required evidence like profit and loss statements to establish inability to pay wages. The Department of Labor began distinguishing between different territories in later reports. In the late 1980s, American Samoa was like a company town with canneries opposing minimum wage increases to keep costs low. The isolated location limited job options, leading to low-wage workforce. In March 1990, Secretary Dole appointed SIC No. 19 for American Samoa without mentioning evidentiary requirements. Governor Coleman raised concerns about the mainland minimum rate imposition, stating that smaller employers lack specific financial statements as evidence. He argued that DOL had exempted American Samoa from this requirement, warning that imposing high wage rates could be unreasonable. Delegate Faleomavaega of Samoa requested a correction to the 1989 FLSA amendments, highlighting the importance of maintaining the tuna canning industry in American Samoa to prevent devastating economic and social impacts. Delegate Faleomavaega of Samoa requested a correction to the 1989 FLSA amendments to prevent devastating economic impacts on the people in Samoa. On August 1, 1990, nine Members of the House wrote to Secretary Dole requesting a postponement of SIC No. 19. Stella Guerra, Assistant Secretary for Territorial and International Affairs, DOI, urged further delay to prevent potential bankruptcy of small businesses and abandonment of the territory by tuna canneries. She sought additional time for Congress to complete action on the proposed amendment. On August 4, S. 2930 was considered on the Senate floor and passed. In the House, Representative Austin Murphy introduced the bill to accommodate two groups of employers and clarify the minimum-wage level for American Samoa. Representative Steve Bartlett and Representative William Goodling supported the bill. On November 15, 1990, a bill was signed into law (P.L. 101-583) after passing the House and Senate. Representative Murphy proposed an amendment to soften the burden for private sector employers in American Samoa, requiring proof of economic hardship related to the island's economic and competitive conditions. On November 26, 1991, Representative Murphy introduced a bill to amend the FLSA and bring the minimum wage in American Samoa up to the wage in effect in the United States. Governor Peter Tali Coleman's testimony opposed the bill, stating it would artificially raise the minimum wage without considering the island's economic status. Governor Peter Tali Coleman opposed raising the minimum wage in American Samoa, citing the unique economic challenges of the islands and the heavy dependence on tuna canneries for economic growth. He expressed concerns about potential unemployment increases due to the lack of diversity, capital, and resources compared to the United States. Governor Peter Tali Coleman opposed raising the minimum wage in American Samoa, citing concerns about potential unemployment increases due to the heavy dependence on tuna canneries for economic growth. Delegate Faleomavaega highlighted the struggles of constituents facing rapidly increasing living costs that outstrip salary increases, emphasizing the need for help. Faleomavaega suggested that American Samoa's wage issues are growing, questioning why residents must accept low wages while executives earn significantly more. He urged canneries to be transparent with their finances to avoid appearing dishonest. John R. Fraser and Donald Senese expressed concerns about wage increases in American Samoa, citing potential negative impacts on the territory's economy and employment. They emphasized the delicate balance needed to maintain the canneries in the region and avoid job losses. H.R. 4011 was seen as a similar proposal that could potentially lead to the relocation of tuna canneries from American Samoa due to increased minimum wages. Robert W. Hetzler highlighted the shift in the tuna industry to foreign countries, resulting in job losses in the U.S. as production moved to lower labor cost areas. The elimination of domestic production in the U.S. will continue due to rising costs, impacting producers, workers, and communities. Tuna canneries in American Samoa face devastation from H.R. 4011, with differences in costs compared to other locations highlighted. The government covers nearly 100 percent of costs for cannery workers in American Samoa, who are mostly from Western Samoa. Rising costs due to labor regulations and environmental controls are impacting the industry, with no replacement in sight. Despite efforts to offset pricing, consumers are unwilling to pay more for canned tuna to protect U.S. jobs. In the tuna industry, efforts to offset rising costs have been hindered by consumer unwillingness to pay more. The Murphy proposal of 1992 was not adopted, and the SIC system continued with missions to Samoa every two years. In 2007, a new commission was appointed by Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao for an economic report on labor conditions in Samoa. In 2007, an economic report on labor conditions in Samoa was prepared and circulated. George Miller became chair of the Committee on Education and Labor in the 110th Congress. H.R. 2, the \"Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007,\" aimed to raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25 per hour and apply it to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The bill was passed in the House and Senate with strong support. In late May 2007, H.R. 2206 (P.L. 110-28) was adopted and signed by the President after various votes and new bills in the Senate. The final bill, a compromise, included minimum wage as a small part with concessions to industry. American Samoa was added to the bill without immediate hearings, sparking concerns about special exemptions for the Samoan islands. Samoa was included in the minimum wage bill with a unique procedure. Different industry classifications in Samoa would receive a 50 cent increase in minimum wage annually until reaching the national minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. A study on the impact of the minimum wage for Samoa and CNMI was requested by Congress, but it was purely advisory. Secretary Chao discharged the Industry Committee after the bill was enacted. Secretary Chao discharged the Industry Committee and closed the case of American Samoa. Representative Faleomavaega introduced H.R. 5154, an amendment to the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. The bill allows for minimum wage increases in American Samoa based on studies and consultations with relevant parties. The Secretary of Labor will make determinations annually before scheduled wage increases. The minimum wage in American Samoa is a unique case where it serves as both a floor and a ceiling for wages. Most fish processing workers are paid at or near the minimum wage. American Samoa had been under the Special Industry Committee structure for fifty years before Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands graduated to a full minimum wage, leaving only American Samoa under the SIC umbrella. H.R. 5154 requires determinations to be made at least 60 days before any scheduled wage increases. American Samoa, unlike the Caribbean territories, has not seen significant industrial development or economic diversification. It is isolated, located 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii, with a population of around 60,000. Despite high unemployment rates, workers from Western Samoa often come to engage in fish canning. The limited market for handicrafts is insufficient to support local workers. In the early 1950s, the Department of the Interior sought a tenant for a vacant fish processing plant at Pago Pago. Van Camp Sea Foods took up the challenge but faced the payment of a federal minimum wage. Van Camp sought two concessions from Congress - overturning the minimum wage for the island and seeking immunity from past underpayment of the minimum wage in Samoa. Congress agreed to both requests, allowing the tuna industry to dominate the island's private sector. The tuna industry dominates the island's private sector as the primary employer, with workers in the canneries having little option but to accept low wages. A minimum wage was established in 1957, starting at 38 cents an hour for cannery workers. Despite efforts to increase wages, in 1986, the federal minimum wage of $3.35 per hour was not implemented due to pressure from the canneries and the insular government. In 1990, Congress reduced the evidence required for employers to affirm inability to meet minimum wage payroll. In 1992, legislation to increase insular minimum wage to federal level faced industry opposition. In 2001, fish cannery workers' wage was raised to $3.26, with no further increases. Other insular workers' pay rates remained low. In 1992, concerns were raised about the impact of increasing the minimum wage for insular workers, particularly in the tuna industry. Industry representatives warned that a wage increase could lead to production shifting to lower-cost areas, potentially causing the collapse of the Samoan economy. Despite economic justifications, workers in the tuna and other industries may not be satisfied with the status quo. On May 15, 2007, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao announced the appointment of a new Special Industry Committee in Pago Pago. However, congressional action led to the abolishment of the SIC system and the implementation of a new insular minimum wage, to be raised annually until it reaches the new federal minimum rate."
