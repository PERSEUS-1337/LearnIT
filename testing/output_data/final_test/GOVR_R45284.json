    "content": "The Title X Family Planning Program, established in 1970, is the only federal program dedicated to family planning and preventive health services. HHS proposed a rule in 2018 to change the program's administration to ensure compliance with federal regulations and prevent funds from being used for prohibited activities like surgical abortions. The 115th Congress is debating the scope of the Title X program to determine if providing abortion-related services like counseling and referrals should be considered family planning services under Title X. Some Members of Congress argue that abortion referrals should continue to be provided upon request. The proposed rule is seen as a gag rule by some Members of Congress, referencing a policy from 1988 upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991. The gag rule was repealed by Congress in 1992 but vetoed by President George H.W. Bush. The Clinton Administration suspended the gag rule in 1993, allowing Title X providers to offer complete information to clients. In 1988, the \"Gag Rule\" was implemented by HHS, prohibiting Title X clinics from providing abortion information. The Bush Administration's attempts to modify the rule led to legal confusion. Some Members of Congress believe abortion referrals undermine the statutory requirement of not using Title X funds for family planning involving abortion. The Trump Administration's proposal is not as reported by the media. The HHS proposal does not include the 'gag rule' on abortion counseling from the Reagan Administration's Title X rule. Both sides agree it would make it harder for Planned Parenthood to receive Title X funds. The report provides an overview of the Title X program, discusses the proposed rule's elements, HHS' rationale, stakeholder reactions, and regulatory impact analysis. All states are eligible for Title X funds. Freely Associated States, public agencies, and nonprofit organizations can apply for Title X grants to establish family planning projects offering contraception and infertility services. In 2016, there were 91 Title X family planning services grantees, including state health departments, nonprofit organizations like Planned Parenthood affiliates, and community health agencies. Grants fund various services like contraceptive services, infertility services, adolescent services, and cancer screening. In FY2017, Title X funds were used for STD and HIV prevention education, counseling, testing, and referral, as well as preconception health services. Services must be provided with respect for individuals' privacy, dignity, and beliefs. Most Title X clinical service staff are not medical doctors but include various healthcare professionals. Title X funds support a variety of healthcare professionals, including nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, and registered nurses with an expanded scope of practice. Grantees can provide family planning services directly or through subawards to other entities. In 2016, Title X-funded clinics served 4.008 million clients, primarily low-income women and adolescents, with 64% having incomes at or below the federal poverty guidelines. Title X is a discretionary program that provides funding for healthcare services to low-income individuals. In 2016, Title X-funded clinics served 4.008 million clients, with 61% relying on these clinics as their main source of healthcare. President Trump signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which allocated $286.479 million for Title X in FY2018. The FY2019 budget request also includes the same amount for Title X funding. The FY2019 budget would fund Title X at the FY2018-enacted level and continue provisions prohibiting the use of Title X funds for abortion. S. 3158 and H.R. 6470 were reported by the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, with the latter providing no funding for Title X in FY2019. The FY2019 budget would fund Title X at the FY2018-enacted level and continue provisions prohibiting the use of Title X funds for abortion. HHS published a proposed rule to revise Title X regulations, focusing on abortion-related activities, grantee requirements, and definitions. OPA released a final rule in 2000 regarding abortion-related services in family planning projects, updating regulations from 1988 and revoking the \"gag rule.\" The 2000 rule revoked the \"gag rule\" that restricted family planning grantees from providing abortion-related information. It added requirements for projects to offer pregnant clients information and counseling on prenatal care, delivery, infant care, foster care, adoption, and pregnancy termination. Annual appropriations laws mandate that all pregnancy counseling under Title X must be nondirective. The proposed rule under Title X would remove the requirement for projects to provide pregnant clients with abortion-related information, counseling, and referrals upon request. Pro-life physicians, such as members of the Christian Medical Association, cannot refer for abortion due to conscience and medical ethics. The proposed rule under Title X would remove the current requirement on abortion-related information, counseling, and referrals, replacing it with a prohibition on promoting or supporting abortion as a method of family planning. The rule also prohibits any affirmative action to assist patients in securing an abortion. Opponents, like the National Association of Community, argue against this provision. Opponents of the proposed Title X rule argue that it violates medical ethics by restricting informed consent conversations between pregnant clients and their providers. The American Medical Association emphasizes the importance of patients having access to medical information to make independent decisions. The proposed Title X rule allows physicians to provide nondirective abortion counseling, promoting patient safety while empowering clients to make independent decisions. Nondirective counseling involves the client taking an active role in processing experiences and identifying the direction of the interaction. The proposed Title X rule allows physicians to offer a range of options to pregnant clients, including a list of comprehensive health service providers. If a pregnant client has decided to have an abortion, a doctor can provide a list of providers that offer comprehensive prenatal care, without identifying those that also provide abortions. Referrals to abortion providers are prohibited, but all other clients can receive a list of providers who do not offer abortions. The proposed Title X rule requires pregnant clients to be referred for prenatal and/or social services, including prenatal care, delivery, infant care, foster care, or adoption. Emergency care referrals are allowed, but abortion referrals are prohibited under Title X funds regulations. Title X funds cannot be used for abortion services within family planning programs. Grantees must ensure that abortion activities are separate from Title X project activities, even if they share facilities or staff. Non-Title X abortion services must be distinct from Title X projects to maintain compliance. Title X funds must be kept separate from abortion activities to comply with the law. Shared facilities and staff are allowed as long as costs are properly allocated and abortion-related activities are distinct from Title X projects. The proposed rule aims to ensure physical and financial separation between Title X projects and abortion-related activities to prevent commingling of funds and violations of Section 1008. The proposed rule aims to ensure separation between Title X projects and abortion-related activities, including through separate accounting records, facilities, personnel, and signage. The proposed rule would prohibit the use of Title X funds for infrastructure building related to abortion activities, potentially impacting abortion providers like the Boulder Valley Women's Health Center and PPFA-affiliated health centers. This could require restructuring of services for some PPFA-affiliated health centers if the rule is finalized. PPFA-affiliated health centers may need to restructure their delivery of Title X services, including separating abortion-related services from Title X funded activities. Current reporting requirements for Title X grantees are not specified in the regulations, but a new data reporting system, FPAR 2.0, is being developed to collect data directly from Title X service sites. The proposed rule for Title X grantees includes reporting requirements on child abuse, sexual abuse, and human trafficking. It also mandates detailed information on subrecipients and referral agencies to ensure oversight and accountability. Compliance with state and local laws regarding notification or reporting of abuse is emphasized. Title X projects must comply with state notification laws regarding child abuse, sexual abuse, and human trafficking. Compliance includes documenting obligations, staff training, counseling minors on resisting coercion, and screening for victimization. Records must be maintained to demonstrate compliance. The proposed rule for Title X projects would remove the requirement for family planning methods to be \"medically approved.\" Compliance with state notification laws regarding abuse and trafficking is mandatory, and records must be maintained to demonstrate adherence. The proposed rule for Title X projects would clarify that family planning methods include contraceptives and infertility services include adoption. Title X projects are not mandated to offer every family planning method. The President of AAFP criticizes the rule for potentially hindering access to necessary medical services. The revised regulatory provision emphasizes a broad range of approved family planning methods and services. The proposed rule for Title X projects clarifies that organizations offering family planning services must provide a broad range of methods, but not necessarily every method. This may conflict with the Healthy People 2020 campaign's goal of increasing access to all FDA-approved contraception methods. In 2010, 53.6% of family planning clinics offered FDA-approved contraception onsite. The federal campaign aims for 67% by 2020. Grantees must encourage family participation and counsel minors on resisting coercion. Under OPA's FY2018 funding announcement, minors seeking services will be screened for victimization. The proposed rule for Title X discounts maintains that minors seeking confidential services must rely on their own resources. Providers must document efforts to involve families in minors' decisions, except in cases of abuse or incest. Preliminary screenings for clients under the age of consent aim to detect victimization in cases of STDs, pregnancy, or abuse suspicion. The proposed rule for Title X requires providers to offer necessary referrals for comprehensive primary care services, promoting holistic health and seamless care for youth aged 0-19 with STDs like chlamydia and gonorrhea. Providers without primary care capacity should have strong links to community providers for client access to primary care. Title X service providers should offer comprehensive primary health services onsite or have strong referral linkages with nearby providers to ensure holistic care for low-income women and adolescents. Lack of transportation is a barrier to access care for this population, with some clients receiving public transportation vouchers for participating in a study on health insurance coverage. Previous studies show that many Title X clinics provide transportation assistance or are accessible by public transportation, highlighting the importance of addressing transportation barriers in healthcare access. The Department of Transportation reports that lack of transportation causes millions to miss medical appointments annually in the US. The proposed rule may improve Title X clients' access to care by reducing their need for transportation. Some believe the rule could shift demand from PPFA-affiliated health centers to federally qualified health centers, causing confusion among Title X grantees according to NACHC. The proposed rule may impact health centers by dictating discussions with patients and affecting revenue. Supporters claim women can receive better care at comprehensive healthcare centers than Planned Parenthood. In a 2015 survey, 38% of Title X clinics provided primary care services. An estimated 38% of Title X clinics offer primary care services, with family planning services defined by program guidance to include contraception, pregnancy testing, counseling, infertility services, preconception health services, and STD screening and treatment. The proposed rule aims to add a new definition. The proposed rule aims to add a new definition for family planning, which includes identifying goals for the number and spacing of children and the means to achieve them. This encompasses a range of choices such as contraceptive methods, natural family planning, infertility management, and reproductive health care to improve outcomes for women, men, and infants. Family planning services are voluntary and not coercive, aiming to prevent infections and diseases that may affect childbearing capability. Priority is given to low-income families for Title X services, which include reproductive health care like physical exams, cancer screenings, STD testing, and pregnancy counseling. Abortion is not considered a method of family planning under this definition. The proposed rule aims to expand the definition of \"low-income family\" to include women who cannot access job-based contraception coverage due to employer objections based on religious or moral grounds. The proposed rule aims to expand the definition of \"low-income family\" to include women who cannot access job-based contraception coverage due to employer objections based on religious or moral grounds. This change could increase access to free contraception services for eligible women, potentially requiring additional federal funds for Title X grantees. The rule does not specify priority for contraceptives based on income levels. The proposed rule expands access to free contraception services for low-income women, but lacks criteria for employer objections. OPA estimates costs of $45.5 million in 2019 and non-compliant Title X sites may incur additional expenses for compliance. The rule aims to ensure tax compliance and improve patient access. Tax dollars are being used in compliance with the law to increase patient access and improve quality of services in the medical field. The proposed regulation aims to align Title X regulations with statutory prohibitions on discrimination against healthcare providers who refuse to participate in abortion-related activities. This could lead to an expanded and more diverse field of medical professionals providing family planning services under Title X regulations. The proposed rule change for Title X may encourage more potential grantees with religious beliefs to apply, as current grantees must provide abortion referrals upon request. A study showed that religious women value knowing about a hospital's religious affiliation and restrictions on reproductive services. The proposed rule change for Title X would require compliance with physical separation requirements one year after publication, and other requirements within 60 days. Knowing a hospital's religious restrictions on reproductive care is important prior to seeking care."
