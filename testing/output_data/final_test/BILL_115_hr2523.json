    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Preserve Rights Of States and Political subdivisions to Encourage Retirement Savings Act\" or the \"PROSPERS Act\". It includes definitions. The \"Preserve Rights Of States and Political subdivisions to Encourage Retirement Savings Act\" (PROSPERS Act) amends Section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. It clarifies that individual retirement plans established through a State or qualified political subdivision's payroll deduction savings program are not considered employee pension benefit plans or pension plans. The PROSPERS Act amends ERISA to clarify that state or qualified political subdivisions can establish retirement savings programs, assuming responsibility for security and notifying employees of their rights. The PROSPERS Act allows states or qualified political subdivisions to create retirement savings programs, ensuring employees are informed of their rights and enforcing those rights through a voluntary program. Employers are only involved in collecting and remitting employee contributions, providing notice, and maintaining records. The PROSPERS Act requires employers to maintain records, provide information to the state or qualified political subdivision, distribute program information to employees, and allow publicizing of the program without contributing funds or providing monetary incentives to employees. The employer must participate in the state savings program as required by law, with no control or financial benefit, except for considerations that cover costs. The state savings program requirements include directing towards employers without other savings arrangements, using service providers while the state retains responsibility, and automatically enrolling employees in payroll deductions unless they opt out. The term \"qualified political subdivision\" refers to any governmental unit of a State with the authority to require employer participation in a payroll deduction savings program. A qualified political subdivision must meet specific criteria to implement a payroll deduction savings program for retirement income for its employees. The subdivision must have a population equal to or greater than the least populated State, no geographic overlap with other subdivisions with similar programs, and administer a plan that provides retirement income or income deferral for employees. The qualified political subdivision must meet specific criteria to implement a payroll deduction savings program for retirement income for its employees. Amounts withheld from an employee's wages by the employer must be transmitted promptly to the program, no later than the last day of the month following the month in which such amounts would otherwise have been payable to the employee in cash."
