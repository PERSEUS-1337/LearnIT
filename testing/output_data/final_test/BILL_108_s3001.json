    "content": "There is no information provided in the prev_chunk to assist with summarizing the curr_chunk. Sec. 165 of title 23, United States Code, defines a dedicated alternative fuel vehicle as one that operates solely on specific alternative fuels such as methanol, ethanol, natural gas, hydrogen, coal-derived fuels, electricity, or fuels from biological materials. A low-emission and energy-efficient vehicle is defined as a vehicle meeting Tier II emission levels set by the EPA for that make and model. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for a vehicle to be classified as a low-emission and energy-efficient vehicle under the Air Act. It must have propulsion energy from onboard hybrid sources, achieve a 10% increase in city fuel economy compared to a similar gasoline-fueled vehicle, and meet Tier II emission levels set by the EPA. The curr_chunk specifies the criteria for a vehicle to be classified as low-emission and energy-efficient, including propulsion from onboard hybrid sources and a 10% increase in lifetime fuel savings compared to a similar vehicle. The Administrator of the EPA will provide guidelines for calculating and comparing these increases within 180 days of enactment. The curr_chunk defines terms related to vehicle classification, including public transportation vehicle, State agency, and advanced lean burn technology vehicle. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for a vehicle to be classified as an advanced lean burn technology vehicle, including requirements for air intake, direct injection, fuel economy, and emission standards. The curr_chunk outlines the occupancy requirements for vehicles using a HOV facility, with a minimum of 2 occupants per vehicle, as established by state agencies. Exceptions include motorcycles and bicycles. The State agency allows motorcycles and bicycles to use the HOV facility, with a safety exception that permits restrictions if a safety hazard is certified and accepted by the Secretary after public notice. The State agency may allow public transportation vehicles and high occupancy toll vehicles to use the HOV facility under certain conditions, such as establishing vehicle identification requirements and toll payment programs. The toll program allows motorists to enroll and participate, with a system for automatic toll collection and policies for managing demand, enforcing violations, and offering reduced tolls for low-income individuals. Additionally, low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles may have special considerations. Before September 30, 2009, the State agency may allow inherently low-emission vehicles and other low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles to use the HOV facility if certain procedures are established for enforcement. Before September 30, 2009, the State agency may allow low-emission vehicles to use the HOV facility if enforcement procedures are in place. The selection, certification, labeling, monitoring, and enforcement of HOV vehicles are regulated to ensure performance and occupancy requirements are met. Before September 30, 2009, the State agency may allow advanced lean burn technology vehicles to use the HOV facility if certain criteria are met, including vehicle selection, certification, labeling, monitoring, and enforcement of occupancy requirements. Requirements for tolls on HOV facilities include ensuring performance is not degraded, allowing tolls on interstate HOV facilities, and giving priority consideration to excess toll revenues if certified by the State agency. The State gives priority consideration to projects developing alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel or improving highway safety using toll revenues. State agencies must certify responsibilities for managing, operating, monitoring, and enforcing HOV facilities for low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles. The State prioritizes projects for alternatives to single occupancy vehicles and highway safety using toll revenues. State agencies must manage and enforce HOV facilities for low-emission vehicles, ensuring compliance with regulations and maintaining a minimum average operating speed of 45 miles per hour. The operation of a HOV facility is considered degraded if vehicles fail to maintain a minimum average operating speed 90% of the time over a consecutive 180-day period during peak hours. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must establish rules for certifying and labeling low-emission, energy-efficient, and advanced lean burn technology vehicles within 180 days of this section's enactment. Additionally, a technical amendment to title 23, United States Code, allows for a 10-year period (or longer if requested by the State) before certain actions are required. The Secretary determines reasonable requests. Section 102 of title 23, United States Code, is amended for program efficiencies. Chapter analysis for subchapter I of chapter 1 of title 23, United States Code, is also amended. \"Amendment to HOV facilities under section 102 of title 23, United States Code for program efficiencies.\""
