The Ravi Thackurdeen Safe Students Study Abroad Act amends the reporting of crime statistics for programs of study abroad approved for credit by institutions of higher education. It distinguishes the location of criminal offenses without regard to institution ownership. The Ravi Thackurdeen Safe Students Study Abroad Act amends reporting requirements for study abroad programs to protect students from crime and harm. The Ravi Thackurdeen Safe Students Study Abroad Act requires institutions to conduct a biennial review of approved study abroad programs to assess their effectiveness in protecting students from crime and harm. The institution must report on deaths, accidents, illnesses, sexual assaults, and incidents during study abroad programs. The institution must report incidents involving program participants resulting in police involvement or a police report, specifying where the incidents occurred. An institution of higher education must report crime statistics for incidents involving students in various locations, including dormitories and other residential facilities. The institution must provide students interested in studying abroad with pre-trip orientation, including a list of countries, travel information, and program-specific details. The institution must provide pre-trip orientation for students studying abroad, and post-trip orientation for those who return, including an exit interview. The institution should not separate information if it is not statistically reliable or reveals personally identifiable information. The Secretary will periodically review these requirements. The Secretary will review programs at institutions of higher education to protect students studying abroad from crime and harm."
