    "content": "The \"Veterans Emergency Room Relief Act of 2017\" allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover urgent care and emergency room treatment for veterans. The \"Veterans Emergency Room Relief Act of 2017\" authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay for reasonable costs of urgent care for eligible veterans who are enrolled in the VA healthcare system and have received care in the past two years. The \"Veterans Emergency Room Relief Act of 2017\" allows eligible veterans enrolled in the VA healthcare system to receive urgent care from providers. The Secretary establishes a cost-sharing amount for veterans, except for those admitted to a hospital after urgent care or receiving care for a service-connected disability. The Secretary is the primary payer for urgent care provided to eligible veterans. The Secretary ensures all types of urgent care providers, including local ones, can contract under this section. Definitions for 'health-plan contract,' 'urgent care,' and 'urgent care provider' are provided. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is encouraged to contract with accredited urgent care centers for section 1725A of title 38, United States Code. A cost-sharing amount for veterans receiving emergency room care from the Department of Veterans Affairs will be established, with exceptions for certain veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may not require a veteran to pay multiple cost-sharing amounts if they seek urgent care under section 1725A of title 38, United States Code, and receive care at an emergency room of the Department for the same condition. Exceptions apply for veterans receiving care for service-connected disabilities, meeting hardship exceptions, or being admitted to a hospital after emergency room care. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must report on veterans' use of urgent care and emergency room facilities under VA laws to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs every two years."
