President Trump has criticized the agreement and notified Congress of intent to renegotiate it in 2017. The 115th Congress may consider legislation for a \"modernization\" of NAFTA. The Administration announced its objectives for forthcoming negotiations in July 2017. This report discusses the development of U.S. motor vehicle production under NAFTA. The development of U.S. motor vehicle production under NAFTA has led to significant changes in the industry. Mexico has become a major center for parts and vehicle manufacturing, integrated into the supply chains of the U.S. and Canada. The number of foreign automakers with U.S. production has also increased. In 2016, there were nearly 800,000 jobs in U.S. motor vehicle and parts manufacturing. In 2016, there were 800,000 jobs in U.S. motor vehicle and parts manufacturing, with the largest share in parts manufacturing. Employment in vehicle assembly and parts manufacturing has decreased by 27% since 1996. Domestic sales of motor vehicles have recovered, reaching 17.5 million units in 2016, the highest on record. Imported vehicles have maintained a relatively constant share of total sales. Integration of the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican automotive industries began before NAFTA, but tariffs and nontariff barriers added costs and complications to the flow of components and finished vehicles. The Canada-U.S. Auto Pact of 1965 eliminated tariffs on vehicles and parts for designated manufacturers, leading to closer integration of North American motor vehicle manufacturing. This integration complicated the flow of components and finished vehicles among the three countries, resulting in manufacturers producing similar products in each country. The Auto Pact of 1965 eliminated tariffs on vehicles and parts for designated manufacturers in Canada and the U.S., requiring 50% U.S. or Canadian content. It created an integrated market for motor vehicles and parts, ensuring a share of manufacturing in Canada. By the 1980s, the U.S. and Canadian motor vehicle industries were generally integrated. The pact did not lead to major changes in automotive trade but adjusted tariffs on imports from Europe and Japan. The Auto Pact of 1965 eliminated tariffs on vehicles and parts for designated manufacturers in Canada and the U.S., requiring 50% U.S. or Canadian content. It created an integrated market for motor vehicles and parts, ensuring a share of manufacturing in Canada. The pact adjusted tariffs on imports from Europe and Japan. Mexico also took steps to encourage manufacturing growth, starting with the maquiladora program in 1965 under President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz. The maquiladora program in Mexico allowed for duty-free imports of materials for production, with a requirement to export a percentage of the final product. This program initially operated in the U.S.-Mexico border region before expanding to other regions in Mexico after NAFTA. Maquiladoras under the Border Investment Program had lower trade and investment restrictions, duty-free imports of materials and equipment, and exemptions from certain regulations. Maquiladora operations in Mexico saw rapid growth during the 1970s and 1980s, with U.S.-based automotive manufacturers utilizing them for labor-intensive products initially. Production eventually expanded to include more sophisticated components like brakes and suspensions. The goal was to supply auto assembly plants in the U.S. and Canada, with companies like General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, and Volkswagen involved. After NAFTA took effect, Mexico merged maquiladora operations and domestic assembly-for-export plants into one program called Maquiladora Manufacturing Industry and Export Services (IMMEX). This allowed maquiladoras to import products duty-free into Mexico, regardless of the country of origin. The implementation of NAFTA in 1994 merged maquiladora operations and domestic assembly-for-export plants into the Maquiladora Manufacturing Industry and Export Services (IMMEX) program. This allowed duty-free importation of products into Mexico, regardless of their country of origin. However, in 2001, NAFTA rules of origin replaced special tariff provisions for maquiladora operations, enabling duty-free importation of North American origin products for any purpose. This change also led to increased costs for maquiladoras importing inputs from non-NAFTA countries due to Mexican tariffs. NAFTA gradually eliminated tariffs and nontariff barriers on goods traded within North America over a 15-year period, resulting in the removal of tariffs and quotas on imports from the United States and Canada by Mexico. NAFTA significantly reduced Mexican tariffs on imports from the United States and Canada, which were previously higher than those of the United States. Before NAFTA, the United States imposed tariffs on Mexican imports, while Mexico had more restrictive tariffs on U.S. and Canadian automotive products. NAFTA helped eliminate barriers to trade, phased out restrictive auto decrees, and enhanced protection of intellectual property rights. Since NAFTA, North American motor vehicle manufacturing has become highly integrated, with major Asia- and Europe-based automakers constructing their own supply chains within the region. Recent growth in the North American market has been largely in Mexico, which now accounts for about 20% of total continental vehicle production. Investments in U.S. and Canadian assembly plants have focused on modernization or expansion, while Mexico has seen the establishment of new assembly plants. Parts manufacturers have also opened plants in Mexico to be closer to vehicle assembly plants in all three countries. Mexico's rise as a motor vehicle manufacturing center is attributed to factors such as lower labor costs, government investment in education for engineers and technicians, and a network of free trade agreements. Mexico's exports of parts to the United States have increased by 85% since 2010, while U.S. exports of parts to Mexico have grown by 64% over the same period. In the NAFTA region, Mexico's vehicle exports have tariff-free access to countries that impose tariffs on vehicles made in the United States or Canada. The impact of these factors on U.S. and Mexican motor vehicle manufacturing exports is significant. Engines imported into the United States in 2015 originated from Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany, and South Korea. U.S. tariffs on auto parts imports from countries with large automotive industries are about 1.7%, compared to zero in NAFTA. Motor vehicle assembly plants are located in 14 U.S. states, Ontario, and 11 Mexican states, forming a concentrated north-south corridor in the United States known as \"automobile alley.\" Motor vehicle and parts trade made up over 20% of U.S. merchandise trade with NAFTA signatories in 2016. The U.S. exports over 2 million motor vehicles annually, with Canada and Mexico being the largest markets. The U.S. has trade deficits in assembled vehicles with both Canada and Mexico. The United States has trade deficits in assembled vehicles with Canada and Mexico. In 2016, the trade balance on vehicle trade with Canada was -$20.4 billion, and with Mexico, -$45.3 billion. The U.S. imported more vehicle parts from Mexico than it exported, resulting in a $26 billion deficit in 2016. Only in U.S. motor vehicle parts trade with Canada did the United States record a surplus of $7 billion in 2016. The motor vehicle industry involves complex supply chains with parts from multiple countries. Economists focus on value added rather than trade flows, with Mexico having a higher foreign content in its automotive exports compared to the United States and Canada. The United States and Canada have different import intensities in motor vehicle manufacturing, with the U.S. retaining a large base of domestic operations. Foreign value added in U.S. manufacturing increased from 2002 to 2008 but stabilized since then. Mexico saw a rise in foreign value added through 2011, possibly due to new investments in assembly plants using imported components. Trade agreements like NAFTA aim to prioritize products from signatory countries and protect import-sensitive industries through rules of origin. Trade agreements like NAFTA have rules of origin to prevent circumvention of duties. Determining the country of origin can be complex when products have components from multiple countries. Importers must meet specific rules to benefit from trade agreements like NAFTA, which have different rules for different products. The NAFTA region has a regional value content (RVC) test to ensure a percentage of a product's value originates there. Different methods, like the \"Build-Down\" method, are used to calculate RVC in automotive products under U.S. trade agreements. The regional value content is calculated by subtracting the value of non-originating merchandise from the adjusted value of the finished product. The \"Build-Up\" method starts with the value of originating materials and adds the value of NAFTA inputs, with a threshold of 35% for qualification. The \"Net Cost\" method captures only the costs involved in production. The \"Net Cost\" method in calculating Regional Value Content (RVC) for exports excludes non-manufacturing costs like sales, marketing, and profit. This method aims to simplify RVC calculations by focusing on factory labor, materials, and direct overhead. The 35% RVC requirement under this method is similar to the 55% requirement under the \"Build-Up\" method. RVC testing in NAFTA encourages sourcing within the region to save on tariffs. The U.S. tariff rates for passenger cars and light trucks vary, with a 2.5% tariff for cars and a 25% tariff for trucks. The higher tariff on trucks incentivizes manufacturers to build trucks in the NAFTA region to save on costs. NAFTA has the highest Regional Value Content (RVC) requirement for automotive products at 62.5%, promoting sourcing within the region to meet this requirement. The NAFTA region has a high Regional Value Content (RVC) requirement of 62.5% for automotive products, encouraging manufacturers to source parts within the region to benefit from tariff savings. Other trade agreements have RVC rules ranging from 30% to 50%, with some markets imposing tariffs as high as 20% on vehicles. This asymmetry in tariff rates can provide an incentive for U.S. vehicle manufacturers to meet preferential rules-of-origin requirements to access foreign markets. The Trump Administration notified Congress of its intent to renegotiate NAFTA with Mexico and Canada under Trade Promotion Authority, allowing for modifications to the agreement. Consultations were held with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and members of Congress before negotiations began. USTR received over 12,000 public comments on NAFTA renegotiation and published a summary of the Trump Administration's objectives. Negotiations with Mexico and Canada were set to start on August 16, 2017, under the expedited procedures of TPA. The President must notify and consult with Congress before and during negotiations, following specific reporting requirements. The negotiations must align with Congress's 2015 TPA authority objectives for implementing legislation. The President can implement a renegotiated agreement in domestic law through changes requiring U.S. law or by presidential proclamation. Expedited procedures, including guaranteed time-limited consideration, may be used for implementing legislation under TPA. Proclamations could include tariff modifications, changes to rules of origin, and customs provisions, with consultation and layover requirements applicable. Certain consultation and layover requirements apply to proclamations regarding rules of origin changes for autos and auto parts under NAFTA. Renegotiation of other provisions requiring changes to U.S. law may need implementing legislation, which could be considered under TPA. TPA is in effect until July 1, 2021, unless Congress passes an extension disapproval resolution. The Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations recommended modernizing NAFTA on June 28, 2017. The Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations recommended modernizing NAFTA on June 28, 2017, emphasizing the need to update the agreement to meet current standards. The report addressed concerns raised by the motor vehicle industry and unions, particularly regarding rules of origin. Most committee members cautioned against making significant changes to these rules to avoid disrupting supply chains, increasing production costs, and potentially leading to job losses in the U.S. The report also provided general recommendations on other policy issues relevant to the motor vehicle sector. The USTR held public hearings to gather recommendations on NAFTA negotiating objectives from various industry representatives, including the motor vehicle industry and unions. Key issues discussed included government procurement, customs procedures, environmental and labor standards, worker rights, currency manipulation, and investor state dispute settlement. Industry representatives emphasized the need for modernization and updates to meet current standards. The Auto Care Association and the American Automotive Policy Council advocate for changes to enhance NAFTA, supporting current rules of origin to promote exports, reduce costs, update customs procedures, expand intellectual property protection, remove trade barriers, align data protection laws, and update labor and environmental provisions. The United Auto Workers union (UAW) supports renegotiation of NAFTA to benefit workers in all three countries, calling NAFTA a \"failure\" and advocating for provisions to curb currency manipulation, enforce labor and environmental standards, eliminate investor-state dispute settlement, and strengthen rules of origin. The UAW supports renegotiation of NAFTA to benefit workers in all three countries by curbing currency manipulation, enforcing labor and environmental standards, and strengthening rules of origin. The Trump Administration's objectives do not include specific motor vehicle industry goals, but aim to maintain duty-free market access for industrial goods and remove nontariff barriers. Links to industry and labor union statements submitted to USTR in June 2017 are provided. The UAW supports renegotiation of NAFTA to benefit workers by addressing currency manipulation, enforcing labor and environmental standards, and strengthening rules of origin. Key objectives include updating customs procedures, improving intellectual property protection, and preventing restrictions on cross-border data flows. Labor and environmental provisions are to be integrated into the main NAFTA agreement, with a focus on avoiding exchange rate manipulation."
