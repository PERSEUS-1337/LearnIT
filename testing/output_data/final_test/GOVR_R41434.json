There were hopes for a quick rebound after the 2007-2009 recession, but evidence suggests a slow recovery. A jobless recovery persisted until October. After the end of the 11th postwar recession in June 2009, a jobless recovery prevailed until October 2010. Job growth began as private-sector employment continued to grow while public-sector employment fell more slowly. Despite temporary job growth from the Census Bureau, declining employment at state and local governments due to budget difficulties led to a decrease in overall jobs until September 2010. Since then, aggregate employment started to rise, with monthly job increases. Despite a jobless recovery until October 2010, private-sector job growth began after the 11th postwar recession in June 2009. By September 2012, private-sector firms had added almost 3.1 million jobs above the recovery's start, but sustained job growth only started nine months after the recession ended. Monthly job increases have been insufficient to significantly impact the U.S. unemployment rate, with about 130,000 private- and public-sector jobs added per month in the first nine months of 2012. The recent pace of job growth at private-sector employers suggests it will take a few more years to recover the almost 7.7 million jobs lost during the Great Recession. Private-sector employment rebounded more quickly in previous postwar recoveries, with a steady rise starting nine months into the current recovery. In September 2012, private-sector employment was 3.3% above its level at the recovery's start. Private-sector employment rebounded more quickly in previous postwar recoveries, with a steady rise starting nine months into the current recovery. In September 2012, private-sector employment was 3.3% above its level at the recovery's start, showing a less sluggish pace of job growth compared to the recovery from the 2001 recession. In September 2012, total nonfarm employment was 4.5 million jobs below its level at the start of the Great Recession, while private-sector employment was 4.1 million jobs below its level in December 2007. This contrasts with previous postwar recessions where employment levels had exceeded or approached pre-recession levels by 57 months. For example, at 57 months from the beginning of the 2001 recession, overall employment was 1.7% above its level at the start, and private-sector employment was also higher compared to the current recovery. Private-sector employment was 1.2% higher 57 months after the 2001 recession began. Productivity growth increased during and after both the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions, allowing businesses to produce more with fewer workers. Nonfarm business productivity rates rose to 2.3% in 2009 and 4.1% in 2010. In November 2011, 47 months after the latest recession started, all jobs lost during the 2007-2009 recession had not been recouped. By February 2012, 50 months from the latest recession's start, the private sector had not fully recouped all the lost jobs. The slow employment rebound is attributed to the financial crisis associated with the 2007-2009 recession, which takes longer for economies to recover from compared to recessions unrelated to financial crises. Some believe offshoring of jobs may be hindering job growth, leading to support for Buy America provision in ARRA. Tax incentives in HIRE Act also encourage firms to maintain U.S. employment. However, worker displacement during recession and characteristics of hard-hit industries suggest offshoring has had a smaller impact on job recovery compared to macroeconomic conditions. The Great Recession led to a reallocation of labor across sectors, with some industries permanently downsizing due to globalization and technological advancements. While most displacement during the recession is considered cyclical, some workers may face long spells of unemployment. Construction firms cut 1.5 million jobs during the recession, but the recovery has been different for cyclically sensitive industries. During the Great Recession, construction and manufacturing industries were heavily impacted, with construction firms cutting 1.5 million jobs and manufacturers cutting 2.0 million jobs. Manufacturing has recovered faster than construction, with manufacturers adding 217,000 jobs (1.9% increase) while construction lost 484,000 jobs (8.1% decrease). However, both sectors still need to gain millions of jobs to return to pre-recession levels. The housing bubble burst hit residential builders and specialty trade contractors the hardest, with a significant decline in employment in residential construction. During the recession, building construction and specialty trade contractors in residential construction saw significant job losses, with states like Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and California being hit the hardest. In manufacturing, companies like General Motors and Chrysler faced severe challenges. During the recession, the motor vehicle industry faced severe challenges, leading to a significant decline in employment. To support the industry, the Bush and Obama Administrations provided financial assistance, resulting in an increase in employment. Temporary programs like \"cash for clunkers\" helped automakers and parts suppliers recall laid-off workers. However, despite the recovery, motor vehicle manufacturers still employed fewer workers in September 2012 compared to before the recession. Manufacturing-dependent states are particularly vulnerable during economic downturns. During recessions, durable goods manufacturers and professional/business services industries are especially vulnerable to job losses. States like Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio saw significant decreases in employment during the recession, with a large percentage of job losses in these sectors. Manufacturing industries are sensitive to global demand and credit access, making them susceptible to economic downturns. During the recession, professional and business services providers, including temporary help agencies, experienced a significant decrease in employment. However, there has been a rebound with a gain of 1.4 million jobs, largely driven by a 780,000 job increase at temporary help agencies. Companies tend to hire temporary employees during uncertain economic times. Retail trade also saw job losses during the recession, with industries like automobile dealers and department stores being particularly affected. Retail employment fell during the recession, with stores and building material/garden supply stores accounting for 14% of job losses. Since the recovery, retailers have added 241,000 jobs, but would need to add 800,000 jobs to return to peak levels. In the financial activities industry, real estate agents saw significant job losses. During the recession, real estate employment declined significantly, with a small gain by September 2012. Job losses in the depository credit intermediation industry accounted for a significant portion of financial activities employment decline. Despite some job cuts, bank employment was close to its level in June 2009 by September 2012. During the recession, employment in the intermediation industry decreased by 74,000 jobs (4.1%). Securities brokers and other investment firms saw a decline of 51,000 jobs (6.0%) between December 2007 and June 2009. By September 2012, employment in this sector was still 56,000 jobs (6.5%) below pre-recession levels. Government was the only industry to gain jobs during the recession but has since lost jobs during the recovery. Federal employment patterns have been influenced by the Census Bureau. Federal employment during the recovery was initially boosted by the Census Bureau hiring workers for the population count in 2010, but this source of job growth ended once the temporary workers were let go. Since then, federal employment has decreased to around 2.8 million. The Budget Control Act of 2011 is expected to further reduce federal employment if sequestration occurs in early 2013. The decline in public-sector employment has mainly affected state and local governments, with state government employment 2.0% lower and local government employment 3.2% lower than in June 2009. Congress has considered providing assistance to state and local governments due to their budget problems. During the Great Recession, women lost jobs to a lesser degree than men, in part due to their employment distributions by industry. Men account for the majority in construction and manufacturing industries, where job losses were significant. Assistance for state and local governments was included in various acts to address budget problems. During the recession, women gained fewer jobs than men, with a 1.4% increase compared to 2.8% for men. Women in occupations like teaching were particularly affected by job losses in local government. Older workers aged 55 and above saw an increase in employment during the recession and recovery, benefiting from their seniority. In contrast, younger workers, especially those aged 16-19, experienced a more significant decrease in employment due to the \"last hired, first fired\" practice. During the recession, employment decreased more among 16- to 19-year-olds than any other age group. Black workers initially lost more jobs than white workers, but their situation improved during the recovery. Hispanics experienced strong job growth after a decline during the recession. In 2012, Hispanic employment exceeded pre-recession levels, particularly in construction and food services industries. Workers with lower education levels fared worse during the recession, with employment decreasing for those without a high school diploma. Employment increased for workers with some college, an associate's degree, or a bachelor's degree during the recession."
