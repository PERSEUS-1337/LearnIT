    "content": "Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is amended to add a new section called \"Community Arts Partnership Act of 1993\". The findings state that there is a lack of arts programs in schools due to budget cuts, arts education improves academic performance, and students who receive arts instruction are more successful. The purpose of this part is to provide demonstration grants to eligible entities to improve the educational performance of at-risk children and youth by offering comprehensive educational and cultural services. Grants are authorized for this purpose. The Secretary can award grants to eligible entities for activities promoting educational and cultural services, serving at-risk children and youth, integrating community resources, and linking preschool programs to elementary education. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act aims to facilitate school-to-work transition, increase parental and community involvement, and replicate programs providing coordinated educational and cultural services. Grants are awarded to eligible entities that agree to coordinate activities with other federal, state, and local grants for integrated service delivery. Grants under this part aim to integrate services for at-risk youth at community-based sites, renewable for up to 5 years based on progress. Geographic distribution ensures equity in urban and rural areas with high at-risk youth populations. \"Eligibility for grants under this part is outlined in SEC. 4805.\" Eligible entities for grants to serve in-school youth must be partnerships between a local education agency and an institution of higher education or cultural entity. This may include nonprofit institutions, museums, libraries, zoological, botanical facilities, and for-profit entities with a history of training youth in the arts. Eligible entities for grants to serve out-of-school youth must be partnerships involving at least one entity. An 'eligible entity' is a partnership between a local education agency eligible for funds under chapter 1 of title I and at least one cultural entity. The eligible entity must serve students in participating schoolwide projects under chapter 1 of title I, out-of-school youth at risk, or a combination of both. Authorized activities are outlined in section 4807. Funds under this part can be used for school-based or community-based educational and cultural programs for at-risk youth, integrated cultural activities for smooth transitions, and child care services. The funds under this part can be used for various purposes such as providing child care, transportation, developing curriculum materials in the arts, staff development activities, stipends for local artists, cultural programs for parental involvement, reforming school practices using arts, acquiring equipment and supplies. The Secretary shall prioritize eligible entities offering comprehensive services beyond traditional hours. Planning grants up to $50,000 for not more than 1 year can be applied for, with a limit of 10% of annual appropriations for such grants. Planning grants of up to $50,000 for eligible entities offering comprehensive services beyond traditional hours, with a limit of 1 grant per entity. SEC. 4808. GENERAL PROVISIONS. Each eligible entity seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with details about the cultural entities involved, target population, services provided, program evaluation plan, sustainability plan for educational services, and strategies to enhance educational outcomes for at-risk youth. The program aims to support at-risk youth by coordinating cultural services in the community, outlining goals, and describing planned service sites and services provided at each site. \"SEC. 4809. PAYMENTS; FEDERAL SHARE.\" The Secretary will pay the Federal share of approved applications to eligible entities under section 4808, with grants ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 in the first year. The Federal share is 80%, while the non-Federal share is 20% in cash or in kind. Up to 25% of the grant can be used for noninstructional services, and funds should supplement, not supplant, non-Federal sources. The Secretary will disseminate successful models under this part through the National Diffusion Network. Authorization of funds for fiscal years 1994-1998: $50,000,000 for 1994, $75,000,000 for 1995, and unspecified amounts for 1996-1998."
