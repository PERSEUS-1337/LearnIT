    "title": "AB 1057",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to establish conflict-of-interest policies for charter schools, ensure transparency in their operations, provide autonomy while maintaining transparency in the use of public funds, and adhere to standards to avoid conflicts of interest. A new section (47604.1) in the Education Code requires charter schools to adhere to the Ralph M. Brown Act, California Public Records Act, and Political Reform Act of 1974 for transparency and accountability. An individual can serve on a charter school's governing body and work in a separate position at the school, but must abstain from voting on matters related to their own employment. They must also abstain from voting on personnel matters involving a relative, but can vote on collective bargaining agreements and personnel matters affecting a group of employees to which the relative belongs. A person disqualified from holding a civil office in California cannot serve on a charter school's governing body. The governing body's activities unrelated to the school's operation are not subject to certain acts. Meetings discussing charter school operations cannot include unrelated activities. The governing body of a charter school can meet within the physical boundaries of the county where the school's facilities are located, with proper notices posted. They can also meet in a contiguous county if at least 10% of enrolled pupils reside there. Nonclassroom-based charter schools can meet where the majority of enrolled pupils reside. Closed sessions can be held for pupil discipline matters. For charter schools, the jurisdiction is based on the county where the facility is located. Nonclassroom-based schools without a facility are based on where at least 10% of enrolled pupils reside. Late filing of economic interest statements will not solely lead to charter revocation. \"Facility\" refers to various school locations. This section will be effective starting July 1, 2016."
