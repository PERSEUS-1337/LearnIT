    "content": "The Act titled \"Treatment of Indian Tribal Natural Resource Income Act of 1995\" addresses the federal tax treatment of income derived by Indians from natural resources activities. It introduces a new section, SEC. 7874, in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to govern the federal tax treatment of income derived by Indians from the harvest of tribally owned natural resources. The Act \"Treatment of Indian Tribal Natural Resource Income Act of 1995\" exempts income from natural resources activities conducted by Indian tribes or qualified Indian entities from income and self-employment taxes. It also exempts remuneration for services in natural resources activities within tribes or qualified Indian entities from employment taxes. The term \"natural resources-related activity\" includes cultivating, harvesting, processing, extracting, or transporting natural resources. The Act exempts income from natural resources activities conducted by Indian tribes or qualified Indian entities from certain taxes. Qualified Indian entity refers to an entity engaged in natural resources-related activities of Indian tribes, with all equity owned by tribes or their members, and management functions performed by tribal members. Entities engaged in processing or transportation of natural resources can be considered qualified Indian entities if their annual gross receipts are 90% or more derived from activities of Indian tribes, with each tribe owning at least 10% of the equity interests in the entity. Equity interests owned by tribe members are treated as owned by the tribe. Special rules apply to distributions from qualified Indian entities to tribe members, where the distribution must be related to natural resources activities. Unrelated amounts can be excluded if they are de minimis. The text discusses rules for distributions from qualified Indian entities to tribe members related to natural resources activities. It also mentions that no inference should be made regarding tax exemptions for income from tribal rights secured before January 1, 1995. Sec. 7874 addresses federal tax treatment of income from the harvest of tribally owned natural resources. The amendments apply to periods before, on, or after the enactment of the Act."
