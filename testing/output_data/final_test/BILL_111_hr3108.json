Congress acknowledges the importance of medications in managing chronic diseases and recognizes pharmacists as key in helping patients adhere to their prescribed therapies. Nonadherence to medications is a significant issue, with only 50% of patients in developed countries following their treatment plans. Nonadherence to medications costs over $177 billion annually, particularly impacting patients with chronic diseases. Adherence to medication therapy can reduce medical costs and improve health outcomes, with community-based medication therapy management services by pharmacists showing positive results. Pharmacists play a crucial role in improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare spending. The Asheville Project, a diabetes program delivered by community pharmacists, led to significant cost savings and increased productivity. Another project focusing on high cholesterol saw a substantial increase in medication compliance. Programs like ChecKmeds NC in North Carolina have also shown significant healthcare cost savings through pharmacist-provided care. Enhancing the MTM benefit under part D of the Medicare program could lead to significant cost savings and improved health outcomes for seniors. Similar successful results have been seen in other programs utilizing community pharmacists. Improvement in Part D Medication Therapy Management (MTM) programs is emphasized. The Medication Therapy Management Benefits Act of 2009 requires PDP sponsors to offer medication therapy management services to targeted beneficiaries to increase adherence to prescription medications. The Medication Therapy Management Benefits Act of 2009 mandates PDP sponsors to provide comprehensive medication reviews by licensed pharmacists, including medication review, personal medication record creation, medication action plan, and a written summary. Targeted medication reviews must also be offered by pharmacists no less frequently than once. The Medication Therapy Management Benefits Act of 2009 requires pharmacists to offer targeted medication reviews at least quarterly to assess medication use, monitor unresolved issues, identify problems with new drug therapies, or after a transition in care. Follow-up interventions can be provided person-to-person or through other interactive means as recommended by the prescriber or pharmacist. The Medication Therapy Management Benefits Act of 2009 mandates pharmacists to provide medication reviews quarterly for beneficiaries with chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, respiratory disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and mental health conditions. The PDP sponsor must identify a process approved by the Secretary for pharmacists or qualified providers to offer medication therapy management interventions to enrollees who are not targeted beneficiaries or receiving other services. Additionally, medication reviews are required for dual eligibles. The medication therapy management program offers comprehensive medication reviews for full-benefit dual eligible individuals at initial enrollment and targeted medication reviews for all enrollees during transitions of care. The medication therapy management program includes pharmacy access requirements for community pharmacies to offer medication therapy services to enrollees. Reimbursement and incentives are provided based on performance. The medication therapy management program requires appropriate reimbursement for services provided by pharmacists and entities based on resources used and time required. Evaluation of performance for payment incentives includes data collection and provider measures. The Secretary will establish measures and standards for data collection by PDP sponsors to evaluate pharmacies and entities providing medication therapy management services. These measures aim to improve quality of care by reducing adverse reactions, enhancing medication adherence, and lowering drug spending. Comparisons will be made based on outcomes. The Secretary will establish measures and standards for data collection by PDP sponsors to evaluate pharmacies and entities providing medication therapy management services. This includes comparing outcomes based on the type of entity offering services and ensuring broader participation of entities with better outcomes. The Pharmacy Quality Alliance will develop measures for pharmacist providers, and there will be continual development of medication therapy management measures in broader health care outcomes. The Secretary will establish performance measures for pharmacies and entities providing medication therapy management services, including incorporating medication use measures into broader health care outcomes measures. Incentive payments will be provided to these entities starting in 2011. In 2011, incentive payments will be given to pharmacies and entities for meeting quality measures in medication therapy management services. Payments will come from the Medicare Prescription Drug Account, with the possibility of funds from other trust funds if services result in reduced expenditures under Medicare parts A or B."
