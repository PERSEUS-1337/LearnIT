The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to integrate engineering skills and practices into science standards by the 2016-2017 school year. Each State plan must demonstrate the incorporation of engineering design skills into science academic content standards. SEC. 112 amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to integrate engineering concepts into science assessments. SEC. 121 establishes a fund for teacher and principal training and recruiting. Section 2113 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to reserve 10 percent of funds for subgrants and establish STEM Professional Development and Instructional Materials Grants. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to reserve 10 percent of funds for subgrants and establish STEM Professional Development and Instructional Materials Grants for nonprofit organizations and entities with expertise in STEM fields to develop and provide professional development and instructional materials. SEC. 122. STEM PARTNERSHIPS. Part B of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to replace \"mathematics and science partnerships\" with \"STEM partnerships\" throughout the text. This includes changing references to \"engineering, mathematics, and science\" to simply \"STEM.\" In subsection (c), references to \"mathematics and science\" are replaced with \"STEM\" in paragraphs (1) and (2), and in paragraph (3) before subparagraph (A). In subsection (c), references to \"mathematics and science\" are replaced with \"STEM\" in paragraphs (1) and (2), and in paragraph (3) before subparagraph (A). In paragraph (4), terms like \"mathematics, engineering, and science majors\" are changed to \"individuals with a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field\" and \"mathematics, engineering, or science\" is replaced with \"a STEM field\" where applicable. In subsection (c), references to \"mathematics and science\" are replaced with \"STEM\" in various paragraphs. This includes changing terms like \"mathematics, engineering, and science majors\" to \"individuals with a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field\" and replacing \"mathematics, engineering, or science\" with \"a STEM field\" where applicable. In subsection (c), references to \"mathematics and science\" are replaced with \"STEM\" in various paragraphs, including terms like \"mathematics, engineering, and science majors\" being changed to \"individuals with a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field\" and replacing \"mathematics, engineering, or science\" with \"a STEM field\" where applicable. In subsection (c), references to \"mathematics and science\" are replaced with \"STEM\" in various paragraphs, including terms like \"mathematics, engineering, and science majors\" being changed to \"individuals with a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field\" and replacing \"mathematics, engineering, or science\" with \"a STEM field\" where applicable. Changes also include replacing terms like \"mathematics and science teaching\" with \"STEM teaching\" and updating language to focus on careers in STEM fields rather than specific disciplines like mathematics and science. In subsection (c), references to \"mathematics and science\" are replaced with \"STEM\" in various paragraphs, including terms like \"mathematics, engineering, and science majors\" being changed to \"individuals with a baccalaureate degree in a STEM field\" and replacing \"mathematics, engineering, or science\" with \"a STEM field\" where applicable. Changes also include updating language to focus on careers in STEM fields rather than specific disciplines like mathematics and science. In subsection (c), references to \"mathematics, engineering, and science\" are replaced with \"a STEM field\" to focus on careers in STEM fields. PART C--AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS\n\nSEC. 131. 21ST CENTURY LEARNING CENTERS.\n\nAmends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to replace \"mathematics and science\" with \"STEM\" in after school programs.\n\nPART D--RURAL EDUCATION\n\nSEC. 141. RURAL AND LOW-INCOME SCHOOL PROGRAM.\n\nAmends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to include \"professional development in the area of engineering education\" in rural and low-income school programs.\n\nPART E--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 151. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 151 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 amends the definitions to include STEM as science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. SEC. 201 of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 amends sections to include STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 202 focuses on research in engineering education. The Secretary of Education will support research on engineering education, focusing on connecting science inquiry and mathematical reasoning to engineering design in K-12 curricula. Best practices and innovations in K-12 engineering education will be identified, and information will be disseminated to the public based on research results. The Secretary of Education will provide information and technical assistance on best practices in K-12 engineering education. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018."
