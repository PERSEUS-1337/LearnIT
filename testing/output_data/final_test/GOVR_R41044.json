    "content": "Congress is interested in increasing access to care for veterans by establishing Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). This report provides an overview of the impetus for the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish CBOCs, how they are managed, medical services provided, quality and cost compared to primary care clinics at VAMCs, and the process for developing a new CBOC. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers various benefits and services to eligible veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs provides employment services, assistance to homeless veterans, home loan guarantees, life insurance, traumatic injury protection insurance, and death benefits for servicemembers. VA's programs are carried out nationwide through various administrations. VA health care services are available to honorably discharged veterans enrolled in the system, organized into priority groups based on funding availability. The VA's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) and operates numerous medical centers, nursing homes, outpatient clinics, and counseling centers. It also pays for care provided by private-sector providers and collaborates with the Department of Defense in sharing health care resources. The VA's health care system collaborates with the Department of Defense in sharing resources and services. VHA's missions include providing patient care to veterans, conducting medical research, serving as a backup during national emergencies, supporting disaster medical systems, and training health professionals. The establishment of Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) was driven by the need to shift from a primarily hospital-based system to expand outpatient care eligibility. In the mid-1990s, the VA recognized the need for restructuring its health care delivery network to improve outpatient care services. This included establishing regional networks (VISNs) and decentralizing budgetary authorities. Advances in medical technology allowed for more outpatient care options, especially for primary care, reducing the need for hospital admissions. The VHA began implementing a system for approving and establishing CBOCs to provide outpatient primary care closer to where veterans reside. In 1995, VHA issued a directive to eliminate restrictions on CBOCs and expand its network based on various criteria. Since 1995, the VHA has opened over 700 clinics known as Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) to provide primary, specialty, mental health, and pharmacy care for veterans. CBOCs are separate from main medical facilities and must have professional staff, diagnostic capabilities, and referral arrangements. Currently, there are 783 active CBOCs in the United States. There are 783 active Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in the United States and its territories, serving over 2.8 million patients. CBOCs improve access to healthcare services for veterans and are managed under the supervision of a VA hospital or medical center. CBOCs are categorized as VA-Owned, Leased, or Contracted. VA has the authority to enter into contracts for establishing CBOCs under certain statutes. The VA has the authority under various statutes to obtain health care resources, including providers and facilities, through contracts with schools of medicine, dentistry, and other entities. Additionally, agreements with the Department of Defense can be made to share health care resources and establish CBOCs using DOD personnel, VA personnel, or a combination of both. The VA contracts with healthcare providers to ensure quality care for veterans, following VHA standards and JCAHO guidelines. Contractors refer veterans to VAMCs for specialty care and use VA's CPRS for documentation and patient care functions. Contract CBOCs operate under a capitated payment system, with providers paid a monthly rate for each enrolled patient. Renewal of CBOC contracts is subject to review and approval by the VA Central Office, with options for renewal, solicitation of new contracts, or conversion to a VA-staffed model. Facilities must submit justification for continued operation under a contract, along with demographic, utilization, and cost information. The VA operates Contract CBOCs under a capitated payment system, with providers receiving a monthly rate for each enrolled patient. The establishment of CBOCs in collaboration with the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services/Indian Health Services is discussed, along with the use of MOU agreements. VA/DOD agreements can involve using each other's space to treat their own beneficiaries or using common space for joint CBOCs. The VA collaborates with DOD and IHS to establish joint CBOCs, sharing resources and personnel to increase access to primary and mental health care for veterans. Veterans receiving care through VA are provided with a standard medical benefits package, including preventive care, diagnostic and treatment services, and medication. Services at CBOCs vary, but primary care and mental health services are generally offered at all locations. Primary care and mental health services are generally provided at all CBOCs. This includes assessment, diagnosis, treatment for various conditions, health promotion, disease prevention, and pharmacological management. CBOCs offer enhanced mental health services through routine screening for depression, problem drinking, TBI, PTSD, and MST. Mental health providers like psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and mental health nurses work together with primary care staff to serve veterans' mental health needs. Performance evaluations were initiated in 1998 to study if Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) provide consistent, safe, and high-quality care for veterans. The evaluations focused on access to care, cost, mental health, quality, satisfaction, and utilization. Several studies on access, utilization, quality of care, patient perceptions, and cost were published in 2002 based on data from performance reports. Several studies on the quality and cost of care provided through Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) were published in 2002. One study found that CBOCs have improved geographic access to primary care and mental health services for veterans, particularly in underserved areas. The increase in clinics has led to more veterans from these areas using VA services, reducing the need for beneficiary mileage travel reimbursements. VA's goal in establishing CBOCs was to enhance access to healthcare for veterans, ensuring a uniform standard of care across different geographic locations. VA policies mandate that veterans receive consistent care at all VHA health facilities, including contract CBOCs, which must meet VA standards for quality, patient safety, and performance. The Office of Quality and Performance monitors CBOC performance through patient satisfaction surveys and clinical guidelines. CBOCs are required to integrate into VAMC quality management programs and meet The Joint Commission standards. VISNs oversee quality assurance and improvement to ensure CBOC compliance with evidence-based practices. VA monitors CBOC performance through quality improvement and compliance assessments. VISNs may decide not to open or close clinics based on various factors. The VA Office of Inspector General conducts systematic reviews to ensure CBOCs operate in line with VA policies. Recent CBOC inspections focus on various areas such as patient privacy, access for disabled patients, health record security, clinical competencies, physician assistant practices, medication dispensing standards, contract compliance, and physician privileges. Studies show that CBOCs deliver similar quality of care as primary care clinics at parent VAMCs. The VHAs Prevention Index (PI) and Chronic Disease Care Index (CDCI) were compared between CBOCs and parent VAMCs, showing no significant differences in 15 out of 16 indicators. These indices measure compliance with clinical guidelines for primary prevention and chronic disease care. Quality of care between contract and VA-staffed CBOCs was found to be similar based on flu shot and retinal exam rates. Cost studies have focused on costs per patient, visit, and total direct costs, considering factors like geographic access and patient drive time. Cost studies comparing CBOCs and parent VAMC clinics have shown lower total direct costs for VA-staffed CBOC patients due to reduced specialty and ancillary care expenses. This shift aims to lower the cost-per-user by 30% and provide care at a lower cost than traditional VA Medical Centers. In 2000, a VA evaluation found that VA-staffed CBOC patients had higher direct costs per primary care visit than VAMC patients due to resource-intensive care. However, when including ancillary costs, CBOC patients had lower total care costs than VAMC patients. This difference can be attributed to various factors such as the separation of primary care and specialty clinics, procedural requirements for specialist referrals, and possibly CBOC patients using non-VA services. The VA found that VA-staffed CBOC patients had higher direct costs per primary care visit than VAMC patients, but lower total care costs when including ancillary costs. Factors contributing to this difference include the separation of primary care and specialty clinics, procedural requirements for specialist referrals, and CBOC patients possibly using non-VA services. Further study and analysis of cost data are needed to confirm these results using patient-level data on a larger sample of patients, including contract CBOCs. The process for planning and establishing CBOCs involves VISN Directors having decision-making responsibility, as mandated by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-144). The VA's process for planning new CBOCs involves a national analysis of underserved populations, followed by a call for business plan submissions from VISNs. Proposals meeting technical requirements are reviewed by a CBOC National Review Panel for funding primarily through existing VISNs. The process for planning new CBOCs involves a review by a National Review Panel (NRP) against national planning criteria. VISNs submit business plans for approval, ensuring they can be implemented within existing funds. Criteria include location in underserved markets, space deficits, projected patient increases, market penetration, and unique considerations like minority populations and geographic barriers. The National Review Panel (NRP) reviews and recommends new CBOC sites based on various criteria such as geographic barriers, population density, and specialty care impact. The approval process involves DUSHOM, Under Secretary for Health, Secretary, and OMB. VA notifies Congress, and it takes about two years from planning to patient treatment initiation."
