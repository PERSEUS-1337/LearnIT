    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians Reaffirmation Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, also known as the Cheboigan Band, are descendants of signatories of the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty of Detroit. The Band was twice recognized by the United States through these treaties, which provided for reservations that were not fulfilled by the Federal Government. Between 1845 and 1850, the Cheboygan Band used treaty annuity payments to purchase land in Burt Township, Michigan, called Colonial Point. The land was placed in trust with the Governor of Michigan. However, questions arose about the taxability of the property, leading to its sale for back taxes in 1900. The Band was later forcibly evicted from Colonial Point, and their village was burned down by the new owner, John McGinn. In 1911, the United States filed suit in the United States Federal District Court for Eastern Michigan seeking to regain possession of the Colonial Point Lands from the Cheboygan Band of Indians. The United States claimed that the Band was under its care, control, and guardianship, and was recognized through its chiefs or head men. In 1917, the Federal District Court ruled against the United States in the McGinn case regarding the taxation of Colonial Point lands. Despite requests from the Band, no Federal action was taken to appeal the decision. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 authorized the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide assistance and funds to petitioning tribes. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided assistance and Federal funds to tribes in Michigan for reorganizing their governments and improving their economies. Landless tribes, including the Cheboigan Band, submitted petitions for assistance, while bands with communal lands also petitioned. Possession of tribal land was necessary to receive Federal funds. Although the Act aimed to assist landless bands like Burt Lake, no funds were allocated to acquire new tribal lands in Michigan. The Bureau of Indian Affairs extended benefits of the Indian Reorganization Act to only 4 Michigan tribes with existing land base. The Cheboigan Band did not receive benefits but still maintains a government-to-government relationship with the US. The Burt Lake Band's Federal acknowledgment has not been terminated. The Bureau lacks legal authority to terminate acknowledged tribes. In recent years, Federal recognition of Michigan tribes reaffirmed by various authorities includes the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe, Grand Traverse Band, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indian, and Little River Band of Ottawa Indians. The Lac Vieux Desert Band, Pokagon Indian Nation, Huron Potawatomi Nation, and Gun Lake Tribe had their Federal status reaffirmed by different authorities on various dates. The Band has been recognized as a distinct Indian community since before 1900. Its adult members are descendants of Indian persons who lived near Colonial Point or Indian Road during the Burn Out. They have close social and political ties, provide mutual aid, practice traditional arts, gather for ceremonies, and decorate ancestors' graves. The Band's members have maintained the Indian Mission Church of St. Mary's and the Tribe's 2 Indian cemeteries for almost 200 years. They have their own tribal government and elders who speak the Ottawa language. Before World War II, over 50% of Burt Lake families spoke the traditional language at home, and over 50% of married tribal members were married to Ottawa and Chippewa individuals. SEC. 3.
