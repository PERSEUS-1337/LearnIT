    "content": "Since its establishment in 1938, the federal crop insurance program has grown significantly, providing over $102.5 billion in insurance protection for various crops on 238 million acres in 2015. The program also offered $1.3 billion in liability for the livestock sector. Government spending on the program from 2007 to 2016 totaled $72.1 billion, with the majority going towards direct benefits to producers and delivery subsidies to Approved Insurance Providers. The federal crop insurance program has different spending categories, with delivery subsidies to Approved Insurance Providers being a significant portion. These subsidies are calculated as a percentage of premium and are not based on actual delivery expenses. The report explains how these subsidies are calculated and how AIPs spend them. The Federal Crop Insurance program, discussed in CRS Report R45193, operates through a public-private arrangement funded by taxpayers and producers. Private insurance companies (AIPs), FCIC, and RMA are the key entities involved. A mutually negotiated Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) governs the financial arrangement between FCIC and AIPs. USDA was previously responsible for policy delivery before 1980. The Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 established a public-private partnership with Approved Insurance Providers (AIPs) for delivering policies and sharing underwriting gains and losses with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). FCIC subsidizes AIPs' delivery costs for catastrophic (CAT) and buy-up coverage policies through Catastrophic Loss Adjustment Expense subsidy (CAT LAE) and Administrative and Operating subsidy (A&O). These subsidies are calculated as a percentage of premium and paid separately to AIPs. The SRA sets subsidies for AIPs: A&O for buy-up coverage at 12-21.9% of premium, CAT LAE for catastrophic coverage at 6% of premium. A&O subsidies have a minimum of $1.0 billion and a maximum of $1.3 billion per year, adjusted for inflation. The formulas in the SRAs use defined terms like Average A&O rate. The 2015 SRA sets the cup for A&O at $1,020,485,108 using specific formulas and definitions, as calculated by CRS. The 2015 SRA sets the cap for the A&O subsidy at $1,283,432,191, with an inflation multiplier of 1.0509 used in the formulas. The inflationary adjustments from 2011 to 2015 increased the cup by $49,426,865 and the cap by $62,162,622. Future inflationary adjustments are not mentioned in the 2011 SRA. The 2011 SRA did not mention future inflationary adjustments. Changes to inflation multipliers for A&O cup and cap were outlined in a 2010 bulletin. Delivery subsidies averaged $1.5 billion annually from 2007 to 2016. Total spending on subsidies has exceeded the A&O cap every year since 2011. Delivery subsidies have consistently exceeded the A&O cap every year, reflecting policies, coverages, and SnapBack not subject to the cap. RMA sets premium rates for federal crop insurance policies, prohibiting AIPs from competing on price. Concerns arise regarding excessive compensation to agents and potential price competition through rebating mechanisms. The largest delivery expense for AIPs is compensation to crop insurance agents. Since 2011, AIPs have limits on agent compensation, with a base commission of up to 80% of A&O and CAT LAE by state. They can pay up to 100% under certain conditions, creating a competitive market for federal crop insurance agents. There is no cap on individual agent earnings as long as it falls within the state maximum. Limited data is available on the actual expenses of AIPs, with three sources for information: state insurance department statements, SEC reports by publicly traded AIPs, and AIP survey data. State insurance departments require detailed expense data on all lines of insurance, including federal crop insurance, in annual financial statements. State insurance departments use calendar years for annual statements, while SEC reports provide comprehensive data on publicly traded companies. AIPs submit financial data to the SEC, available through EDGAR. NCIS maintains that A&O and CAT LAE do not cover all AIP delivery expenses, and contracts with Grant Thornton for an annual report on industry profitability. The most recent Grant Thornton report on the crop insurance industry's profitability and effectiveness is the 2016 update for reinsurance year 2015. It uses governmental and company information as sources, with specific source information from public RMA reports and a survey by NCIS of its member companies. Grant Thornton's services are provided in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' standards and do not constitute the compilation, review, or audit of any information. AIPs spent more in expenses than they received in A&O from 1998 to 2015. Grant Thornton reported that AIPs spent more in expenses than they received in A&O up to 2015. Delivery subsidies accounted for $14.8 billion of government spending on federal crop insurance from 2007-2016. Congress may need to reconsider the current formula-based delivery subsidy for AIPs to ensure optimal allocation for stakeholders. The current method of subsidizing delivery expenses lacks comprehensive and publicly available data on actual expenses incurred by AIPs, hindering analysis of subsidy efficacy. AIPs are required to report expenses to RMA, but data is not easily matched with delivery subsidies, leaving uncertainty about subsidy sufficiency. Congress could consider requiring AIPs to certify reported expenses to RMA or undergo independent audits to improve the program. Requiring AIPs to certify reported expenses to RMA or undergo independent audits would enhance program transparency and efficiency. Congress could also consider if RMA should provide delivery expense information periodically to improve verification."
