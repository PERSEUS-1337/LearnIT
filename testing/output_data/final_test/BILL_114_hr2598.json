The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will conduct scientific testing to determine the extent of marijuana impairment on driving ability, how impairment varies among individuals based on certain characteristics, and if impairment can be reliably measured by THC concentration in the bloodstream or saliva. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will conduct scientific testing to determine the most accurate methods for law enforcement officers to measure THC concentration in individuals suspected of marijuana-impaired driving, including blood and oral fluid testing, the impact of delays on testing effectiveness, and the most accurate field sobriety tests for assessing impairment in drivers who have ingested marijuana. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will conduct scientific testing to determine the impact of marijuana on driving performance, including physical and cognitive areas like reaction time, motor coordination, and hazard perception.

The marijuana must have a THC concentration similar to that sold in states where marijuana is legal. The Administrator must issue a report with recommendations to states within 180 days of the Act's enactment.
