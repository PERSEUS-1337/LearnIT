The \"Executive Accountability Act of 2002\" allows for an exception to the $1,000,000 limitation on deductible compensation in certain cases. Paragraph (4) of section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to exclude certain factors from being taken into account when determining if performance goals are met. The amendment made by this section applies to taxable years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 409A denies deferral for funded deferred compensation of corporate insiders if the corporation funds a defined contribution plan with employer stock. If an employer maintains a defined contribution plan with employer stock and a funded deferred compensation plan, deferred compensation of corporate insiders must be included in gross income when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture. The tax treatment of amounts available under the plan is determined under section 72. The term \"plan\" refers to any compensation deferral plan where the employee's rights are no greater than a general creditor, all funds for deferred compensation are owned by the employer until paid out, and the funds are available to creditors at all times. The term \"plan\" refers to a compensation deferral plan that does not include a qualified employer plan. Special rules apply, such as deferred compensation being paid only upon separation from service, death, or at a specified time, and no acceleration of payment by any event. If there is a modification to accelerate payment, all previously deferred compensation is affected. If a modification accelerates payment in a compensation deferral plan, all previously deferred compensation becomes taxable in the year of the modification. The taxpayer must pay interest on the underpayments that would have occurred if the compensation had been included in gross income when deferred. Additionally, a plan must meet certain requirements regarding creditor's rights for amounts set aside in a trust. The term \"corporate insider\" refers to individuals subject to Securities Exchange Act requirements.
