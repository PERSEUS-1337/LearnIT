    "content": "The Construction Quality Assurance Act of 2009 may be cited as the \"Construction Quality Assurance Act.\" Congress finds that specialty subcontractors play a significant role in the construction industry, with their performance and pricing being crucial factors in project costs. Detrimental practices like \"bid shopping\" and \"bid peddling\" are prevalent, especially in construction projects for the Federal Government. Bid shopping involves contractors undercutting subcontractor prices after winning a contract. Bid shopping and bid peddling threaten the integrity of the competitive bid system for construction, benefiting the Federal Government, the construction industry, and the economy. Bid shopping and bid peddling threaten the integrity of the competitive bid system for construction in the United States, compromising national security, depriving taxpayers of benefits, exposing projects to substandard performance, and can be deterred by modifying the Federal Acquisition. The Federal Acquisition Regulation can be modified to require bid listing for Federal construction contracts, including listing subcontractors and procedures for substitution, to deter bid shopping and bid peddling. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"contract\" as any Federal Government contract over $1,000,000 for construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings. \"Contractor\" refers to an individual or entity awarded or seeking a construction contract. \"Subcontractor\" is an individual or entity subcontracting over $100,000 for work on a contract. Each solicitation for construction over $1,000,000 by an executive agency must require bidders to list subcontractors for work over $100,000. Bidders can list only one subcontractor per work category unless specified otherwise. Multiple subcontractors can be listed for a category if each is specified. The executive agency requires bidders for construction projects over $1,000,000 to list subcontractors for work over $100,000. Bidders can list themselves for specific work portions, indicating their qualifications to perform that work. Failure to list subcontractors will result in being considered non-responsive, and bids will not be considered. Additionally, procedures for substituting listed subcontractors require consent and good cause. Subcontractor substitution requires consent from the contracting officer for good cause, such as failure to sign a contract, bankruptcy, or death/disability of the subcontractor. The subcontractor may be dissolved, fail to meet surety bond requirements, be ineligible due to suspension or debarment, or have a series of performance failures resulting in withheld payments. The subcontractor may face consequences such as withholding of requested amounts, failure to comply with laws, or refusal to perform the subcontract. Requests for substitution must be submitted in writing to the contracting officer, with reasons provided, and a copy sent to the subcontractor for verification. The subcontractor must submit objections to a substitution within five working days of notification. No subcontract can be assigned or transferred without the contracting officer's consent, which must be in writing and included in the contract file. The contractor listed for work under the contract cannot subcontract that work without authorization from the contracting officer. Substitution of subcontractors must be approved in writing and included in the contract file. The penalties for subcontracting work without authorization from the contracting officer must be approved in writing and included in the contract file. Contractors and subcontractors can face penalties for unauthorized subcontracting without approval from the contracting officer. Penalties include replacing a listed subcontractor or awarding work to a subcontractor that was supposed to be done by the contractor. The amount of penalties imposed is 10 percent of the bid amount by the listed subcontractor. Subcontractors can also be penalized for knowingly participating in non-compliance with substitution regulations. Penalties for unauthorized subcontracting include deductions from the contract balance, with the amount being 10 percent of the bid by the listed subcontractor or the difference between bids. Penalties are deposited into the fund from which the contract was awarded. The imposition of penalties on a contractor or subcontractor for failure to comply with subcontractor substitution procedures on 2 contracts within a 3-year period is considered evidence of an offense affecting a Government contractor's business integrity. This is implemented through the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Federal Acquisition Regulation will be revised to implement the provisions of the Act within 120 days of enactment, with a 60-day public comment period. Final regulations will be published within 180 days of enactment and will be effective 30 days after publication."
