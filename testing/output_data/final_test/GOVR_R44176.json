    "content": "The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 granted U.S. passenger airlines freedom to determine markets and airfares. Concerns arose about small communities losing air service, leading to the establishment of the Essential Air Service program. Initially, 746 communities were eligible for EAS subsidies, but not all required them. Some communities received unsubsidized service, while others received subsidized service from the beginning or later sought subsidies. The Essential Air Service program was established to ensure airline service to small communities. Initially, 746 communities were eligible for subsidies, with some receiving unsubsidized service. Congress has tightened conditions for receiving subsidies, leading to increased program expenditures. By FY2018, 174 communities were receiving subsidized EAS service. The program was set to expire after 10 years but was extended and is now administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Airline Deregulation Act authorized the CAB to require carriers to continue providing scheduled service at eligible communities with subsidies if necessary. Nearly 300 of the 746 eligible communities received subsidized service under EAS between 1979 and 2016. Congress extended EAS for another 10 years in 1988 and removed the time limit in 1996, extending the program indefinitely. The Airline Deregulation Act in 1978 led to scheduled air service for communities, with Congress later limiting subsidies for communities near major airports. The Department of Transportation Act of 2000 set eligibility requirements for subsidies, and in 2003, the Vision 100 Act directed the establishment of Community and Regional Choice Programs. The Department of Transportation established pilot programs in response to the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, allowing communities to explore transportation options while controlling costs. In 2011, restrictions were placed on EAS subsidies, and the use of smaller planes for EAS flights was permitted. The Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 introduced EAS reform measures, including amending the definition of an \"EAS eligible place\" and capping the number of eligible communities. Subsequent acts in 2016 and 2018 reauthorized the program with some modifications. The Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 introduced EAS reform measures, including amending the definition of an \"EAS eligible place\" and capping the number of eligible communities. The program will continue through FY2023, with legislative measures such as Section 453 sunsetting the ATNEP program in 2020. The law also allows the Secretary of Transportation to waive the subsidy-per-passenger cap under certain conditions. New communities cannot enter the program after October 1, 2012, except in Alaska and Hawaii. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program, except in Alaska and Hawaii, has specific eligibility criteria for communities to receive subsidized air service. Communities must meet distance requirements from large or medium hub airports, have a subsidy per passenger of $200 or less, maintain an average rate of subsidy per passenger below $1,000, and have at least 10 enplanements per service day. Additionally, communities in Alaska have different criteria. The DOT is satisfied that any decline below 10 enplanements is temporary. Alaska and Hawaii are generally exempt from EAS eligibility requirements, except for a measure established by specific laws. This requirement affected one community in Hawaii, Kamuela, which entered a cost-sharing arrangement in 2018. 237 Alaska communities were originally listed as EAS-eligible, with 63 receiving subsidized service by the end of FY2018. In FY2018, 63 communities in Alaska received subsidized service, leaving 174 unsubsidized communities eligible for EAS subsidies. The increase is due to additional Alaskan communities requesting subsidized service. Diomede, not originally on the list, is receiving service from EAS funds via ATNEP. Section 453 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 would sunset the ATNEP program in two years. The EAS program in Alaska does not track the number of passengers served by EAS flights. In Hawaii, two communities, Hana and Kamuela, received subsidized service under EAS in FY2018. There are 10 EAS-eligible communities in Hawaii, including Kalaupapa, which became a permanent EAS community in 2012. The EAS program is overseen by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, which determines the minimum level of service required at each eligible community. The Department of Transportation (DOT) subsidizes flights from Essential Air Service (EAS) communities to hub airports, with specific requirements for round trips, available seats, aircraft characteristics, and maximum stops. DOT issues a request for proposals (RFP) to carriers, using a bid system and four key criteria for carrier selection: service reliability, contractual and marketing arrangements with a larger carrier at the hub, interline arrangements with a larger carrier at the hub, and community needs. The Department of Transportation (DOT) issues RFPs to carriers for Essential Air Service (EAS) communities, with criteria including service reliability, interline arrangements, and community input. DOT selects carriers based on community preferences and sets service patterns, subsidy rates, and contract periods. The Department of Transportation (DOT) pays air carriers in arrears at the end of every month based on completed flights, not passenger numbers. Carriers must give a 90-day notice before discontinuing service to EAS communities, and hold-in authority prevents service suspension until a replacement carrier is found. DOT aims to avoid service disruptions by finding carriers willing to enter the market without subsidies. The Department of Transportation (DOT) aims to find carriers willing to enter the market without subsidies to avoid service disruptions. If unsuccessful, DOT issues an order prohibiting suspension and requests proposals for replacement service. Incumbent carriers serving EAS-eligible communities may receive compensation for being held in after the 90-day notice period. The EAS program is funded by overflight fees and discretionary appropriations from Congress. Total EAS program expenditures have increased since FY2002. Total EAS program expenditures have increased sharply over time, with spending rising 600% since 1996 and 132% since 2008. Two spikes in spending occurred after the 2001 terrorist attacks and during the 2008 recession. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 aimed to reduce discretionary spending on EAS through FY2015 but ended up increasing total outlays for EAS subsidies. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 provided $263 million in total EAS funding for FY2015, with funding from overflight fees and discretionary appropriation. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 authorized appropriations for EAS funding from FY2018 to FY2023, with total funding reaching $288 million in FY2018. Funding for EAS has increased significantly over the years, with spikes in spending after the 2001 terrorist attacks and during the 2008 recession. Between FY2012 and FY2018, EAS expenditures increased by over 49% despite efforts to contain costs. The program faces challenges such as limited competition for contracts, leading to higher subsidy requests. The subsidy cost is not a major factor considered when evaluating bids, and local officials are not obligated to favor any specific proposal. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program offers subsidized flights to communities, with local officials not required to choose the lowest cost proposal. EAS flights can serve multiple hub airports, and carriers may use larger planes than necessary, leading to high per-passenger costs. Around 20% to 25% of EAS communities may be affected by these issues. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program offers subsidized flights to communities, with carriers potentially using larger planes than needed, resulting in high per-passenger costs. EAS flights had an average of 49% seats filled with paying passengers in 2013, compared to 83% for all domestic flights. Carriers may charge high fares to fewer passengers rather than maximizing passenger load with lower fares, leading to high costs per passenger. EAS subsidies in FY2017 ranged from $9 to over $778 per passenger. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program offers subsidized flights to communities, with carriers potentially using larger planes than needed, resulting in high per-passenger costs. Congress has attempted to limit the program's scope by eliminating subsidies for communities near major airports and imposing a cap on per-passenger subsidies. Efforts to reduce overall spending on EAS have been largely unsuccessful, with some provisions in the 2012 FAA reauthorization potentially delaying or negating the program's shrinkage. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 included provisions allowing waivers for communities exceeding the $200 subsidy-per-passenger cap under certain conditions. The Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2000 prohibited DOT from subsidizing carriers providing EAS service. The Appropriations Act of 2000 prohibited DOT from subsidizing carriers for EAS service to communities within 70 miles of large or medium hub airports. Some communities lost eligibility, like Hagerstown, MD, and Lancaster, PA. However, Vision 100 allowed these communities to petition DOT with certifications from the governors, reinstating their eligibility for EAS subsidy. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 extended eligibility for subsidized flights for Hagerstown and Lancaster through FY2023. The annual per-passenger subsidy was approximately $344 for Hagerstown and $268 for Lancaster. A 2011 law limited EAS subsidies to $1,000 per passenger, making eight communities ineligible for subsidies. The EAS program subsidy limit of $1,000 per passenger cannot be waived. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, eligibility requirements were revised due to funding issues. The subsidy cap was set at $300 per passenger in 1989, then lowered to $200 in 1990, and eventually made permanent at $200 per passenger, except for Alaska and Hawaii. Between 1990 and 2006, 33 communities lost their eligibility for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program because their per-passenger subsidy exceeded the $200 maximum. In late 2006, no communities exceeded the cap, but enforcement was halted for eight years due to various challenges in the EAS program. On May 20, 2016, DOT issued order 2016-5-17 regarding the EAS program. In May 2016, DOT issued order 2016-5-17 finding 30 communities exceeded the $200-per-passenger subsidy cap in FY2015. Eight communities had service hiatus and received waivers, while the remaining 22 communities received waivers later. In September 2017, 27 communities exceeded the subsidy cap in FY2016, with waivers granted to eight communities with service hiatus. In December 2017, waivers were granted to 18 of the 19 communities seeking waivers. In FY2016, DOT granted waivers to 18 out of 19 communities seeking waivers for eligibility requirements. Jamestown, NY was denied a waiver due to non-compliance but had the second-highest subsidy per passenger ($460) and lowest enplanements (seven). In FY2017, 25 communities did not meet eligibility requirements, with four granted waivers for service hiatus. The remaining 21 communities received waivers in August 2018 per DOT Order 2018-8-2. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 allows the Secretary of Transportation to waive the subsidy-per-passenger cap for communities meeting certain criteria. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 amended eligibility requirements for the Essential Air Service program, stating that communities must maintain an average of 10 or more enplanements per day to be eligible. The law allows for waivers of the subsidy-per-passenger cap if a community's subsidy per passenger is lower than previous years, exempting them from the $200 cap. The Essential Air Service program requires communities to have an average of 10 or more enplanements per day to be eligible, with exceptions for locations in Alaska, Hawaii, or those far from a large airport. The Secretary of Transportation can waive this requirement annually for communities with temporary declines in enplanements. In 2014, DOT proposed enforcing the 10-passengers-per-day rule, potentially ending subsidized service to 13 communities. In 2014, DOT granted temporary waivers to 12 communities for not meeting the 10-passengers-per-day requirement. EAS service to Athens, GA, ended in September 2014. In May 2015, DOT intended to enforce the rule based on FY2014 data, affecting three communities. All three communities filed petitions for a waiver and were granted. In FY2015, 12 communities exceeded the subsidy cap and failed to meet the enplanement requirement. DOT granted waivers to four communities that had experienced service hiatus. In 2014, DOT granted temporary waivers to 12 communities for not meeting the 10-passengers-per-day requirement. EAS service to Athens, GA, ended in September 2014. In May 2015, DOT intended to enforce the rule based on FY2014 data, affecting three communities. All three communities filed petitions for a waiver and were granted. In FY2015, 12 communities exceeded the subsidy cap and failed to meet the enplanement requirement. DOT granted waivers to four communities that had experienced service hiatus. DOT Order 2016-8-21 granted waivers to a group of eight communities with service hiatus. The remaining eight communities filed for and were granted waivers by DOT Order 2016-11-8. In September 2017, DOT's Order 2017-9-23 stated that six communities failed to meet the average daily 10-enplanment requirement. DOT later updated the traffic data and determined that one community, Bradford, PA, met the enplanement requirement. Among the remaining five communities, waivers were granted to all except Jamestown, NY. EAS service to Jamestown, NY, ended on January 16, 2018. On May 11, 2018, DOT indicated in Order 2018-5-14 that 25 communities did not meet one or both statutory eligibility requirements in FY2017. Four of these communities had service hiatus in FY2017 and were therefore tentatively granted waivers. Among the remaining 21 communities, waivers were granted to all except Jamestown, NY. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, the Continued Appropriations Resolution, 2015, and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, directed that no EAS funds \"shall be used to enter into a new contract with a community located less than 40 miles from the nearest small hub airport before the Secretary has negotiated with the community over a local cost share.\" This requirement does not exempt communities in Alaska and Hawaii. Lancaster, PA, and Kamuela, HI, are within a 40-mile distance of a small hub airport. Lancaster's EAS contract was extended multiple times due to uncertainty. After multiple short-term extensions of EAS authority, Lancaster's eligibility was confirmed in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. A one-year cost-share agreement for Kamuela was reached with the County of Hawaii paying 5% of the subsidy cost. DOT established the Alternate Essential Air Service Pilot Program and the Community Flexibility Pilot Program in 2004 as part of the Community and Regional Choice Programs. The Alternate Essential Air Service Pilot Program (AEAS) allows communities to forgo subsidized EAS for a period in exchange for a grant to improve transportation options. Currently, seven communities are participating in AEAS, using the grant to secure public charter service. The Community Flexibility Pilot Program allows communities to forgo subsidized EAS for 10 years in exchange for a grant. Currently, Visalia, CA is the only participating community. The growth rate of average subsidy per EAS community has been significant, rising from $1 million in FY2002 to $2.6 million in FY2018. The average subsidy per non-Alaska community increased from $1 million in FY2002 to $2.6 million in FY2018. Government regulations, such as the 2013 FAA pilot qualification rule, have impacted air service provision to small communities by forcing carriers to raise pilot salaries to meet new requirements. GAO suggested options for modifying the EAS program in a 2009 report, including limiting program eligibility, allowing carriers more flexibility, and incorporating financial incentives. The EAS program has undergone changes to limit community eligibility and permit the use of smaller aircraft, but there is a lack of incentives to minimize program expenditures. GAO recommended a multimodal approach for financial assistance in its 2014 report, suggesting cost-effective solutions like bus service to large airports or air taxi service. Despite efforts to control costs, recent changes have not been effective. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 aims to control program costs by waiving certain eligibility requirements for communities that meet specific criteria."
