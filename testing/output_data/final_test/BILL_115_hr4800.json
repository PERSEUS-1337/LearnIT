The Act \"Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2018\" mandates States to assess the need for broadband conduit in highway construction projects in consultation with telecommunications providers. If the evaluation indicates a future need, the conduit must be installed under hard surfaces during the project. The Broadband Conduit Deployment Act of 2018 mandates the installation of broadband conduits under hard surfaces in highway construction projects. The Secretary must ensure the installation of an appropriate number of broadband conduits along the highway to accommodate multiple providers, with consideration for existing conduits. The size of each conduit should align with industry best practices and be sufficient to meet potential demand. Hand holes and manholes for fiber access must also be included. The Secretary, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, will establish standards for the placement of hand holes and manholes for fiber access in broadband conduits in highway construction projects. These standards will consider factors such as the ability to accommodate broadband installation without impacting safety, operations, and maintenance of the highway facility, as well as population density in the project area. The Secretary will ensure that broadband conduits installed in highway construction projects include a pull tape and are capable of supporting fiber optic cable placement techniques. The depth of installation will be consistent with industry best practices, taking into account existing utilities and cable separation requirements. Broadband providers will have access to the installed conduits. The broadband provider has access to broadband conduits installed in highway construction projects on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis. The Secretary may waive this requirement for certain projects based on undue burden, existing infrastructure availability, cost-benefit analysis, or other relevant factors. Coordination with the FCC is required for implementation. The Secretary and Assistant Secretary of Commerce coordinate with the FCC on broadband conduit determinations and publication of conduit availability for the National Broadband Map. Broadband is defined as an Internet Protocol-based transmission service for voice, video, data, and graphics. The curr_chunk defines terms related to broadband infrastructure, including broadband conduit and covered highway construction projects. It also defines hard surfaces as asphalt and concrete pavement. The curr_chunk discusses the inclusion of broadband conduit installation in certain highway construction projects."
