    "content": "The economic impact of business-related tax provisions that expired in 2014 and were extended or made permanent by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 is discussed in this report. The provisions not made permanent would expire by the end of 2016 or 2019. These provisions have been extended in previous legislation, such as the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The Senate Finance Committee had proposed legislation to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 extended expired tax provisions through 2016, including employer-related benefits, international provisions, cost recovery provisions, and business-related provisions. Bonus depreciation would decrease from 50% to 30% by 2019. The extenders provisions cost $628.8 billion over FY2016-2025, including provisions for child credit, education credits, and earned income tax credit. The remaining cost of the tax provisions not included in the \"extenders\" bill is $426.8 billion. 71% of this amount is due to permanent business-related provisions, with 79% of the total cost associated with these provisions. Three provisions account for 63% of the total cost: research and experimentation credit (27%), small business expensing provision (18%), and deferral of tax on active financing income. The cost of extending expired tax provisions through 2016, as proposed in S. 1946, would have been $96.9 billion over a 10-year budget window. More than 60% of this cost is from business-related provisions, with the extension of the provision allowing businesses to expense 50% of investments expected to increase economic growth. Including macroeconomic effects, the total cost would have been $86.6 billion. The cost of extending expired tax provisions through 2016, as proposed in S. 1946, was less than the cost estimate that does not incorporate macroeconomic effects. Part of the gain in economic growth from extending expired business-related tax provisions is expected to be offset by higher interest rates, which tend to slow economic growth. The one-year extension enacted late in the 113 th Congress cost $7.6 billion, with the tax credit for research and experimentation expenditures being the provision with the largest cost. The House has considered legislation to make certain business-related extender provisions permanent, including Section 179 expensing and R&E tax credit. Other bills aimed to extend provisions like Subpart F exemption and look-through treatment of payments between related controlled foreign corporations. The House Committee on Ways and Means approved legislation in the 114th Congress to modify bonus depreciation and cost recovery provisions. The Jobs for America Act passed by the House aimed to make five expired provisions permanent, costing $499.3 billion over 10 years. In the 113th Congress, the House Committee on Ways and Means reported legislation to permanently extend expiring provisions related to active financing income and payments between controlled foreign corporations. These measures did not pass the House. The President's FY2016 budget identified provisions like increased expensing under Section 179, 100% exclusion for qualified small business stock, R&E tax credit, and certain employment-related credits for permanent extension. The President's budget proposed permanently extending certain tax credits and exceptions under Subpart F for active financing income. The cost of permanently extending certain cost recovery provisions is significantly higher than temporarily extending them. For example, the cost of making bonus depreciation permanent would be $244.7 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for a one-year extension. The cost of permanently extending tax provisions, such as Section 179 and expensing allowances, is significantly higher than temporary extensions. For example, a permanent extension of Section 179 would cost $77.1 billion over 10 years, compared to $1.4 billion for a one-year extension. This report excludes provisions classified as charitable, community development, individual, or housing-related. Tax incentives at the federal level encourage employers to hire specific groups of employees through provisions like the work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) and the Indian employment tax credit. These incentives are detailed in various CRS reports on housing-related tax provisions. The work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) is a non-refundable wage credit aimed at increasing job opportunities for disadvantaged individuals. Eligible hires include those receiving TANF or food stamp benefits, ex-felons, and certain veterans. Employers can claim a tax credit equal to 40% of wages paid during the worker's first year of employment, up to a statutory maximum. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) offers a tax credit of up to $2,400 for most eligible hires, with varying maximums for veterans and summer youth hires. The credit equals 25% of a qualified worker's wages if they work at least 120 hours but fewer than 400 hours. The WOTC originated from the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC) and has been expanded and extended since its creation in 1996. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) has been expanded and extended since 1997, with instances of lapses before retroactive reinstatements. It aims to incentivize employers to hire disadvantaged individuals by offsetting training costs. Studies evaluate its effectiveness in increasing job opportunities for targeted groups. Initial evidence showed limited impact on hiring decisions, while recent studies suggest some benefits from the WOTC. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) has been found to benefit certain groups like disabled veterans and long-term welfare recipients. Studies have not found evidence of employers \"churning\" their workforce to take advantage of the credit. The Indian employment tax credit is similar to the WOTC, encouraging the hiring of enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses. The Indian employment credit is a tax incentive for hiring enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses. It offers a 20% credit on qualified wages and health insurance costs over base year expenses, up to $20,000. The credit was enacted in 1993 and is not available for wages exceeding $30,000. The employer must reduce their deduction for wages by the amount of the credit. The Indian employment credit, enacted in 1993, offers a 20% credit on qualified wages and health insurance costs for hiring enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses. It has been regularly extended, with proposals to update the base year to simplify record-keeping and encourage hiring. Extending the credit may increase employment among tribe members, similar to the WOTC. Certain small businesses may qualify for a tax credit to offset costs associated with providing military pay differentials. Eligible businesses can claim a 20% tax credit for wage payments to National Guard or Reserves members on active duty for over 30 days, up to $20,000 per year per employee. This provision was added as part of the Heroes Earnings. The Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 added a tax credit for employers offering pay differentials to employees on active military duty. This provision has been extended multiple times and aims to support National Guard or Reserve members called up to active duty. Small businesses may benefit from this tax credit to offset costs and increase the total amount of pay differentials provided. The tax credit for employers offering pay differentials to employees on active military duty benefits small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. However, not all employees called up to active duty may be eligible for differential pay, especially middle-income individuals whose military salaries are equal to or higher than their civilian salaries. This tax benefit tends to favor employers of middle- to higher-wage earners, while businesses employing middle- to lower-income wage earners may not have the opportunity to provide differential pay. The tax rules for income earned abroad by foreign subsidiaries include provisions to prevent tax avoidance through payments to the U.S. parent. Subpart F income, which includes dividends, interest, rent, and royalty payments between related firms, is subject to current taxation unless exceptions apply. The extenders package includes international provisions that provide exceptions from the Subpart F rules. Subpart F income includes dividends, interest, rent, and royalty payments between related firms, allowing for income shifting to avoid taxes. Multinational firms may avoid Subpart F classification by treating high tax subsidiaries as unincorporated entities for U.S. tax purposes. Methods of avoiding Subpart F taxation were simplified in 1997 with the introduction of \"check-the-box\" regulations, allowing firms to elect treatment as unincorporated entities to avoid Subpart F income classification. Treasury regulations in 1998 initially disallowed this practice but later allowed it due to protests from firms. The \"check-the-box\" regulations introduced in 1997 allowed firms to elect treatment as unincorporated entities to avoid Subpart F income classification. This option was initially disallowed in 1998 but later permitted after protests. The regulations allowed for combining subsidiaries into a single firm by treating them as disregarded entities under U.S. law, although this approach did not work in every circumstance. The check-the-box rules, introduced in 1997, allowed firms to elect treatment as unincorporated entities to avoid Subpart F income classification. However, this approach did not work in every circumstance, as related firms without the same 1st tier parent were not eligible. The look-through rule, enacted in 2005, allows for this type of planning in the tax code, disconnecting it from regulations' creation of disregarded entities. Related firms do not need a parent-child relationship, just common control. The look-through rules, enacted in 2005, allow firms to shift and reinvest excess foreign earnings among distantly related operations without repatriating them to the U.S. parent, increasing the disincentive to repatriate earnings. The main argument for the provision is to allow firms flexibility to redeploy earnings without U.S. tax consequences. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) provided a temporary exception from subpart F income tax rules for active financing income, allowing firms to shift profits to low-tax countries and defer U.S. taxes. This planning reduces taxes collected by foreign governments and encourages investment in countries with high nominal tax rates. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) introduced a temporary exception for active financing income, allowing American corporations to defer taxes on income from banking, financing, or insurance activities abroad. This exception was originally part of Subpart F but was eliminated in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 due to concerns about profit shifting to tax havens. President Clinton vetoed this provision. The active financing exception allows U.S. financial services businesses to defer taxes on income from activities abroad. Industry advocates argue it levels the playing field with international competitors. Some U.S. corporations have significant financial service operations through subsidiaries. Depreciation deductions are spread over time for assets like machines or buildings. Depreciation deductions for assets like machines or buildings are spread over a period of years, with different schedules based on the asset's life. Straight-line depreciation is common for structures, while equipment is depreciated over 5 or 7 years. Non-residential structures are depreciated over 39 years. The goal is to align tax depreciation with economic depreciation, allowing for earlier deductions valuable due to the time value of money. Bonus depreciation allows firms to deduct part of the cost of equipment in the year it is placed into service, providing an economic stimulus during a recession. Introduced in 2002 and 2008, it has not been continuously extended like other expiring provisions. The bonus depreciation introduced in 2008 was in place for seven years, but its effectiveness was questioned compared to other tax cuts or spending increases. Research suggests it was not very effective, especially as a permanent provision favoring equipment investments over structures. Bonus depreciation has lowered effective tax rates for equipment, with some cases even resulting in negative tax rates. Compared to a 35% statutory corporate tax rate, bonus depreciation reduces the effective tax rate for equipment from 26% to 15%. Buildings are taxed at the statutory rate, but total effective tax rates for corporate assets are slightly higher due to stockholder taxes. With debt financing, effective tax rates can be negative, with rates as low as -37% for equipment with bonus depreciation. If made permanent, bonus depreciation would significantly lower U.S. effective tax rates on equipment compared to the OECD average. Bonus depreciation has significantly lowered effective tax rates for equipment, with some cases resulting in negative tax rates. If made permanent, rates on equipment would be much lower than the OECD average. The cost of extending bonus depreciation provisions is a fraction of the cost of permanent provisions, making it a more cost-effective option. The provision allows firms to immediately deduct the cost of investment in equipment, with dollar limits. The expensing provision allows firms to deduct the cost of investment in equipment, with dollar limits. In 2014, the amount eligible was $500,000, but it reduces once investment reaches $2 million. Off-the-shelf computer software and a $250,000 expensing provision for leasehold property will no longer be eligible. The provision was first adopted in 1958 and allowed a deduction of 20% of the first $20,000. The expensing provision, first adopted in 1958, allowed a deduction of 20% of the first $20,000. Over time, the limits were revised, with temporary increases in 2003 and 2007. The maximum allowance reached $125,000 with a phase-out point of $500,000. The so-called Bush tax cuts were extended at the end of 2010. The expensing provision, first adopted in 1958, allowed a deduction of 20% of the first $20,000. Temporary increases in 2003 and 2007 raised the maximum allowance to $125,000 with a phase-out point of $500,000. The Bush tax cuts were extended at the end of 2010, with subsequent legislation increasing the limit to $500,000 and the phase-out point to $2 million through 2011. These provisions were part of stimulus bills to address the 2007-2009 recession and may be extended or made permanent along with other tax provisions. The expensing provision, first adopted in 1958, allowed a deduction of 20% of the first $20,000. Temporary increases in 2003 and 2007 raised the maximum allowance to $125,000 with a phase-out point of $500,000. The Bush tax cuts were extended at the end of 2010, with subsequent legislation increasing the limit to $500,000 and the phase-out point to $2 million through 2011. The original expensing provision was meant to simplify depreciation rules for small firms and encourage investment. Extending temporary provisions like Section 179 may not be an effective stimulus, as it has no incentive effect after reaching the maximum cap and increases the cost of capital in the phase-out range. Bonus depreciation, without limits or phase-outs, also did not appear to be an effective stimulus. The Consolidated Appropriations Act indexes the $500,000 and $2 million amounts for inflation after 2015, and the expensing and phase down for certain longer-lived property is delayed for one. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included special rules for expensing film and television production costs to discourage \"runaway\" productions. The provision has been regularly extended since 2008 as part of \"tax extender\" packages. Investments in film and television productions are recovered using the income forecast method based on expected earnings patterns. Under special expensing rules, taxpayers can deduct up to $15 million of production costs ($20 million for certain communities) for film and television production. Eligible productions must have at least 75% of compensation for services in the US. The deduction is not allowed if production costs exceed $15 million ($20 million for specific communities). This benefit allows for earlier deductions, deferring tax liability based on production to income lag time. The special expensing rules allow taxpayers to deduct up to $15 million of production costs for film and television production, with the aim of accelerating cost recovery by one year. This benefit may not be advantageous for taxpayers with limited tax liability. The primary objective is to prevent productions from moving overseas for lower costs and incentives. Under the special expensing rules, film and television production costs can be deducted up to $15 million to accelerate cost recovery by one year. Non-residential structure investments like leasehold improvements, restaurant property, and retail improvements can be depreciated over 15 years instead of 39 years under this provision. Qualified leasehold improvements must be made at least three years after building construction, while restaurant property improvements require over 50% space for meal preparation. Retail property improvements must be made at least three years after building construction and apply to the sale of goods. The special expensing rules allow for accelerated cost recovery of film and television production costs up to $15 million. Non-residential structure investments, such as leasehold improvements, restaurant property, and retail improvements, can be depreciated over 15 years instead of 39 years. Qualified leasehold improvements must be made at least three years after building construction, while restaurant property improvements require over 50% space for meal preparation. Retail property improvements must also be made at least three years after building construction and apply to the sale of goods. The provisions were originally enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and extended through 2009 by the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008. The current provision allows for bonus depreciation on specific building components, undermining the composite depreciation system established in 1981. Component depreciation, where different parts of a building were depreciated separately, was eliminated to ensure a more balanced treatment of depreciation across all components. The provision for faster depreciation on leasehold improvements and retail/restaurant properties undermines composite depreciation. An exception exists for the theme and amusement park industry, with a recovery period of seven years for assets. Ambiguities in the law led to questions about the categorization of motorsports racing facilities for depreciation purposes. The tax provision for motorsports racing facilities allows for faster depreciation over seven years, providing a subsidy to the industry. Supporters argue it preserves historical treatment and stimulates business competitiveness. The tax provision for motorsports racing facilities allows faster depreciation over seven years, supporting competitiveness. Race horses now have a three-year recovery period, aligning with their racing life and economic value. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included a provision for accelerated depreciation for businesses on Indian reservations to increase investment. This provision has been regularly extended to encourage additional investment on Indian Reservations. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included a provision for accelerated depreciation for businesses on Indian reservations to increase investment. However, it is uncertain if this tax subsidy will effectively benefit workers living on Indian Reservations, as the subsidies are received by businesses and may not directly benefit workers. Capital equipment subsidies could potentially make workers worse off by encouraging more capital-intensive businesses. Additionally, workers may not benefit from higher wages resulting from an employer subsidy if wages are regulated by a minimum wage higher than the market wage. A regulated investment company (RIC) is an entity that earns income from passive investments, distributes at least 90% of its income, and elects to be taxed as an RIC. Mutual funds are examples of RICs, which can deduct income distributed to shareholders. The RIC tax regime allows for income distributed to shareholders as dividends to be deducted, passing the tax forward to shareholders. Certain dividends are subject to a gross-basis tax and withholding, with exceptions for interest-related and short-term capital gains dividends paid to foreign persons. This provision, enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, aims to simplify the tax code for businesses and mitigate disparities in tax treatment between direct and indirect investments by foreign persons. Foreign persons are generally not taxed on U.S. source capital gains income, except for income from selling U.S. real property which is taxed under FIRPTA rules. There are exceptions for investments made through qualified entities or if the property is regularly traded on a U.S. securities market. The temporary exception was enacted in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 enacted a temporary exception for foreign persons regarding U.S. source capital gains income. This exception has been extended multiple times through tax extenders legislation. The provision encourages investment in U.S. real property through eligible entities and increases the limit for Real Estate Investment Trusts. Additionally, the research and experimentation credit allows for a 20% credit on qualified research expenses exceeding a base amount. The research and experimentation credit offers a 20% credit on qualified research expenses exceeding a base amount. The credit can be reduced to 10% if the base is limited by the 50% spending minimum. The alternative credit of 14% applies to research in excess of the average qualified research over the past three years, with the incentive reduced to 7.9% due to increased base amounts. The credit also has a basis adjustment and is reduced by 35% for corporations expensing these costs at the top tax rate, resulting in an effective credit rate of 13%. The research credit rate is 13% (6.5% with the 50% minimum rule, and 5.1% with the alternative credit). Additional credits include 20% for university basic research not aimed at commercial objectives and 20% for contract energy research. Qualified research expenses must be experimental and technological in nature, used in developing new products or processes. Expenses include researcher wages, supplies, computer costs, and 65-100% of contract research. Research must be conducted in the US. The original research credit was established in 1981 at a 25% rate without a basis adjustment. The research credit, established in 1981 at a 25% rate without a basis adjustment, has undergone various revisions over the years. Changes include reducing the rate to 25% in 1986, adding a partial basis adjustment in 1988, and creating a three-year fixed base in 1989. The credit has been extended multiple times, lapsed for a year, and has been extended retroactively. The research credit, established in 1981, has undergone revisions over the years, including rate reductions and basis adjustments. Different alternative credits were added in subsequent legislation, with the current form established in 2006. Economists support subsidizing research and development due to market failure in capturing full returns from innovation. The research credit, established in 1981, has undergone revisions over the years, including rate reductions and basis adjustments. Economists support subsidizing research and development due to market failure in capturing full returns from innovation. Despite patents and secrecy, an innovation may provide information to others that can be exploited, leading to higher social returns than private returns. The research credit is seen as a blunt instrument to address this market failure, as it does not vary based on the size of the spillover effect. Targeted grants are suggested as an alternative method of subsidizing research, while some argue that certain types of research should not be subsidized. The uncertainty over the extension of the credit likely reduces its effectiveness. The Consolidated Appropriations Act allows small businesses with receipts of $50 million or less to take the credit against. The Act allows small businesses with receipts of $50 million or less to take a credit against payroll taxes for qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures. Eligible taxpayers qualify for a 50% business tax credit, limited to $3,500 times the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased. Maintenance expenditures include repairs or capitalized costs for maintaining railroad track owned or leased by Class II or Class III railroads. Eligible taxpayers are smaller railroads and those who transport property or furnish services using these rail facilities. The taxpayer's basis in railroad track is reduced by the credit allowed, which cannot be carried back to years before 2005 and is allowed against the alternative minimum tax. The provision substantially lowers the cost of track maintenance for qualifying short line railroads, with tax credits covering half the costs. Tax credits cover half the costs for qualifying short line railroads, accounting for 31% of the nation's rail miles. The purpose is to encourage rehabilitation and prevent abandonment of these regional railroads, which are vital for transporting agricultural products. Advocates fear the threat posed by heavier 286,000-pound cars and believe preserving these local lines will reduce local truck traffic. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) supports tax credits for short line railroads to address the need for rehabilitation and improvement due to heavier cars. Special subsidies for industries can lead to inefficient investment allocation, but subsidizing rail transportation may reduce congestion and pollution. A tax credit may not be as effective as a direct grant for firms with limited tax liability. Closely held corporations with 100 or fewer shareholders can elect to be taxed as S corporations, where income flows through to individual owners like a partnership. Firms switching from C to S corporations are taxed separately at the top corporate rate for gain attributable to C corporation years, with a 10-year period reduced to 5 years by an extender provision. Converting from C to a non-corporate entity triggers both corporate-level and individual-level taxes on gains. S corporations can sell assets after conversion with a single level of tax on gains at a low rate. The 10-year period for taxing gains from the C corporation period was reduced to five years, incentivizing businesses to convert to S corporation status. This benefit primarily applies to closely held businesses with 100 shareholders or fewer. Firms can elect to forgo bonus depreciation and accelerated depreciation for AMT and regular tax calculations, increasing AMT credits by 20% of bonus depreciation. These refundable credits are limited to $30 million or 6% of credit forwards before January 1, 2006. This election can provide tax reductions for firms with limited tax liability. The provision allowing firms to increase AMT credits by 20% of bonus depreciation was enacted in 2008 and extended through 2014 as part of stimulus measures during the recession. It does not directly impact investment but affects cash flow, potentially stimulating spending for distressed firms. Federal excise taxes do not apply in the United States. The special excise tax on items produced in Puerto Rico or the US Virgin Islands and shipped to the United States was imposed to prevent producers in these territories from having a tax advantage over US producers. Revenue from the equalization tax on rum is mostly returned to the treasuries of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands by the federal government. The cover-over provisions for rum date back to 1917 for Puerto Rico and 1954 for the US Virgin Islands, and were expanded in 1983 by the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 placed a cap on the rebate of excise taxes on rum and other distilled spirits, with temporary increases routinely enacted. The revenue from federal excise taxes on rum imported into the United States is remitted to the treasuries of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands based on their rum production shares. Controversy arose from the use of funds in the USVI to subsidize rum producers, leading to increased subsidies in Puerto Rico. The USVI and PR increased subsidies for rum producers, funded by federal excise taxes. State and local incentives for industrial development are seen as a redistribution of tax dollars without a net gain in national GDP. The rum cover-over program's efficacy is questioned by U.S. taxpayers. Some question the effectiveness of the rum cover-over program, with concerns that Congress may reconsider or end it if revenue is used for \"unreasonable\" subsidies. Current tax laws result in lower rates for long-term capital gains, with higher brackets taxed at 15% or 20%. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 is relevant to these tax rates. The tax rate for long-term capital gains is 15% or 20%. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 allowed an exclusion of 50% of gain from qualified small business stock (QSBS) sales. This exclusion increased to 100% in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. Stock must be acquired at original issue and held for at least five years to qualify for the exclusion. Annual limit on exclusion is $10 million. The provision for qualified small business stock allows for an exclusion of part or all of the gain, providing investors with an incentive to acquire equity in small firms. This benefits firms organized as C corporations involved in developing new manufacturing technologies and may result in different effective tax rates for investors in firms of various sizes. The Section 199 domestic production activities deduction reduces tax rates on certain types of economic activity, primarily domestic manufacturing activities by 3.15 percentage points, from 35% to 31.85%. It aims to correct capital market imperfections and promote small business formation and growth. The Section 199 domestic production activities deduction, enacted in 2004, includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia for eligible activities. Special rules in 2006 allowed Puerto Rico to be considered part of the U.S. for this deduction. Puerto Rico has its own tax system but is interconnected with the U.S. tax system. Companies with operations in Puerto Rico may benefit from structuring as a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) to defer U.S. tax on income. The Section 199 production activities deduction allows for similar tax treatment for manufacturing activities in Puerto Rico compared to the rest of the United States. Extending the Section 199 deduction to Puerto Rico raises concerns about creating incentives for U.S. companies to adopt a bifurcated structure, potentially leading to higher effective tax rates for manufacturing activities in Puerto Rico compared to other domestic locations. Extending Section 199 deduction to Puerto Rico may provide greater benefits to manufacturers with operations there, potentially encouraging more manufacturing activity. Tax-exempt organizations must pay taxes on unrelated business taxable income. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 included rules to prevent tax-exempt organizations from avoiding unrelated business income taxes by receiving payments from controlled entities. Payments in excess of an arms-length price cannot be excluded from UBTI. These rules have been regularly extended as part of tax extenders legislation. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 introduced rules to prevent tax-exempt organizations from avoiding unrelated business income taxes by receiving payments from controlled entities. Setting up a controlled subsidiary to sell merchandise and pay royalties to the charity can help avoid taxes on business activities. However, treating payments from controlled organizations as UBTI while similar payments from third parties are not taxed may raise fairness concerns. The provision modifying tax treatment of certain payments to controlling exempt organizations limits abuse by ensuring fairness in taxing payments from controlled entities."
