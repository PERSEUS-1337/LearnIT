    "content": "Many Members of the 116th Congress are interested in Trump Administration's efforts to reform USAID, known as Transformation at USAID. The reform process began in 2017 with an executive order and OMB memorandum, aiming to improve agency efficiency. USAID submitted its own reform plan to OMB separate from the State Department. USAID submitted its own reform plan to OMB, separate from State, with OMB prescribing government-wide reforms related to USAID. USAID then implemented its reforms, known as Transformation, focusing on restructuring programs and changing bureau structure. The details of Transformation are not comprehensively documented. The Transformation initiative at USAID includes testimony from Administrator Mark Green, implementation documents like Country Roadmaps and the Private Sector Engagement Strategy, and the new USAID Policy Framework. These sources vary in content and emphasis, making it challenging to determine the full scope and prioritization of reform components. Congressional involvement is important, with some reforms requiring notification to Congress for input and potential holds on actions. Administrator Green has actively engaged Congress in shaping reforms. Administrator Green has actively involved Congress in shaping USAID Transformation, emphasizing the importance of congressional support. Congress holds power to influence reforms through oversight and funding. The report analyzes key elements of current USAID reform efforts under Transformation, focusing on objectives, process, structure, and workforce reforms. It highlights changes in policy and practice but is not a comprehensive overview. Congressional perspectives on USAID reforms are discussed, emphasizing the need for support and collaboration. Transformation at USAID is an implementation framework for multifaceted reforms that aim to optimize structures and procedures for maximum effectiveness. While similar to general government reform efforts, it also signals a distinct vision for USAID's role in foreign affairs. Key objectives include supporting country transitions. Transformation at USAID aims to support country transitions towards self-reliant development, increase collaboration with the private sector, enhance national security strategy, strengthen core capabilities, and use taxpayer dollars efficiently. The core objective is to end the need for foreign assistance by moving partner countries towards economic self-sufficiency. Other objectives like advancing national security goals are less emphasized in later Transformation materials. Many proposed reforms align with these objectives. Many proposed Transformation reforms align with past USAID Administrations' efforts to refine foreign assistance deployment for national security and foreign policy strategy. Various Administrations have aimed to improve USAID's efficiency and effectiveness through workforce capacity building and leadership initiatives. The self-reliance goal central to Transformation has been a longstanding objective in USAID documents. Transformation represents the latest step in ongoing efforts to enhance USAID's impact and efficiency. USAID's Transformation is the latest step in the agency's evolution, aiming to establish a more flexible and field-responsive approach to programming. The agency's policy reforms under Transformation focus on the \"Journey to Self-Reliance,\" where countries can address their own development challenges without foreign assistance. USAID has developed a matrix with 17 indicators to measure countries' progress towards self-reliance. USAID has developed a matrix with 17 indicators to measure countries' progress towards self-reliance. These indicators are maintained by third-party sources and divided into commitment and capacity measures to assess a country's desire and resources to move beyond poverty. USAID has introduced a new approach called the \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" to prioritize self-sufficiency in country development plans. This approach aims to tailor country-level programming to address unique challenges and enhance a country's capacity to achieve self-reliance. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" approach by USAID aims to tailor country-level programming to address unique challenges and enhance a country's capacity for self-reliance. The self-reliance indicators used by USAID encompass a wide array of issues and reflect theories connecting economic growth to democratic institutions and markets. These indicators continue to generate debate among researchers and practitioners. The debate over whether a country must lower trade barriers to achieve prosperity is heavily contested in academic circles, especially for developing countries. USAID suggests examining trade freedom indicators in the local context and evaluating them based on each country's unique conditions. This approach represents a shift from previous administrations' focus on global development challenges like climate change and HIV/AIDS. USAID's \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" focuses on global development challenges like climate change and HIV/AIDS, shifting strategic planning to subnational regions. Progress is tracked at the national level, raising concerns about aid cuts to underperforming countries. USAID clarifies that these metrics are not used to determine aid eligibility based on country performance. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework by USAID uses matrices as a tool for programmatic allocations, not to grade countries. It may lead to directing programs through independent NGOs instead of national governments. The agency's approach to tracking countries' progress over time is unclear due to reporting lag times and variances. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework by USAID focuses on financing self-reliance and private sector engagement as key tools to end the need for foreign assistance. It emphasizes countries' ability to generate capital for investment and partnering with the private sector for development. This approach aligns with global development frameworks and aims to facilitate access to capital for countries to reinvest in their progress. The approach focuses on financing self-reliance by leveraging Official Development Assistance (ODA) to mobilize private sector investments in developing countries. It emphasizes domestic resource mobilization, strong public finance management, and fiscal transparency to enable effective administration of the public sector. The initiative prioritizes creating a market-based environment for private investment, emphasizing financial markets for economic development. Private sector engagement is key to repositioning USAID's role in development. USAID's Private Sector Engagement Policy builds on efforts to leverage resources for international development, including the Global Development Alliance program. The Global Development Alliance (GDA) program, launched in 2001, is USAID's flagship mechanism for public-private partnerships. The Obama Administration introduced the U.S. Global Development Lab (the Lab) to source breakthrough innovations, with programs like Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) integrating venture capital approaches. The focus on private sector engagement in the Lab's Transformation includes components not seen before. Private sector partnerships are emphasized as a way to attract solutions from scientists and technology innovators. The PSE Policy emphasizes private sector partnerships to attract solutions from scientists and technology innovators, shifting focus from economic development programs to individual enterprises. It aims to engage the private sector across all programming, without specifying preferred partners like MSMEs, indicating collaboration with a range of enterprises from multinational corporations to smallholder farmers. This broadens USAID's partner makeup. The PSE Policy aims to broaden USAID's partner makeup by engaging nontraditional partners in program design. The USAID Acquisition and Assistance Strategy indicates a shift towards private sector engagement and restructuring sourcing mechanisms to promote partner self-sufficiency. The A&A Strategy aims to diversify USAID's partner base, support local partners' self-reliance, and establish a more flexible partnering approach. Reforms include the New Partnerships Initiative and revisions to operational policies. Past experience, such as the USAID Forward initiative, informs the strategy implementation. Transformation aims to promote recipient country \"ownership\" of development, enhance collaboration with partners, and align USAID's organization with U.S. international development goals. This includes new partnering modalities like \"co-creation\" and structural changes subject to congressional oversight. The Administrator presented proposed structural changes to congressional oversight committees in July and August 2018. Each proposal was put on hold for further review. USAID is divided into field missions and headquarters' bureaus and offices, each with specific functions. Geographic bureaus correspond with country missions, functional bureaus manage sectoral issues, and central bureaus and independent offices oversee agency operations. Under Transformation, USAID is proposing to reorganize its chain of command by adding two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators. The Associate Administrator for Relief, Response and Resilience (R3) would oversee the Bureaus for Humanitarian Assistance, Conflict Prevention and Stabilization, and Resilience and Food Security. The Associate Administrator for Strategy and Operations would manage the Bureaus for Legislative and Public Affairs, Policy, Resources and Performance, and Management. This change aims to streamline agency operations and improve efficiency. Under Transformation, USAID is proposing to reorganize its chain of command by adding two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators. The Deputy Administrator would oversee functional and geographic bureaus, while the two new Associate Administrators would focus on specific areas like relief, response, resilience, and strategy. Some concerns have been raised about potential politicization of development decisions with these changes. The reorganization aims to allow the Administrator to focus on agency-wide management priorities and bring specialized leadership voices to represent the agency globally. The USAID is proposing a reorganization of its structure, moving from four functional bureaus to five, three central bureaus, and four independent offices. One major change is the creation of a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, combining the Offices of Food for Peace and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. This consolidation aims to streamline functions and improve efficiency. The USAID is proposing a reorganization to create a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance by merging the Offices of Food for Peace and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. This aims to elevate U.S. humanitarian assistance globally and remove duplication of efforts, providing a unified voice for humanitarian aid. The USAID is proposing a reorganization to create a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance by merging the Offices of Food for Peace and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. This aims to respond more effectively to complex humanitarian emergencies and streamline humanitarian aid efforts. Some stakeholders support the proposed creation of a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance by merging the Offices of Food for Peace and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, seeing it as a positive reform. However, concerns have been raised about the potential impact on global humanitarian funding, U.S. leadership, and the provision of U.S. agricultural commodities for emergency food assistance. The Administration's repeated requests to eliminate Title II funding in its annual budget requests have raised concerns about the nonemergency programs being deemphasized in the new bureau context. The proposed creation of the Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) aims to consolidate the agency's functions for better coordination and efficiency by pulling technical staff from regional bureaus and merging offices from different bureaus into one. The proposed Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) aims to consolidate technical experts into a one-stop-shop for field missions, comprising centers and hubs offering coordinated consultancy services in various areas. Supporters believe it will provide cohesive support, while detractors worry about managing unrelated functions within DDI. The absorption of the Global Development Lab into this bureau raises concerns about the future of innovation in development. USAID's Transformation initiative aims to enhance workforce management structures and processes to adapt to complex situations. Changes include a new noncareer hiring mechanism, leadership philosophy, and knowledge management framework. These employee-led efforts aim to improve agency operations and staff hiring mechanisms. The Transformation initiative at USAID aims to enhance workforce management structures by introducing new hiring mechanisms for different positions, such as DH positions funded through USAID's Operating Expenses account and non-DH positions funded through program funds. The new hiring mechanism addresses staffing concerns raised after the agency's 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola response, where 94% of the crisis roster was deployed, leaving little capacity for other responses. The USAID agency deployed 94% of its crisis roster during the West Africa Ebola response, leading to staffing challenges. To address this, a working group was formed in 2016 to develop a new hiring mechanism for crisis response. The group, now part of the Transformation initiative, consists of 80 employees and experts from NAPA. The proposed mechanism, called the Adaptive Personnel Project (APP), aims to provide more flexibility in workforce management. The Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) would offer the agency workforce flexibility by allowing time-limited positions based on hiring managers' needs. Employees would not be locked into specific roles, promoting talent-based mobility within the agency. The APP pilot program by USAID offers noncareer positions with government benefits, streamlined processes, and 300 positions for crisis response offices. It aims to provide flexibility and talent-based mobility within the agency. USAID's APP pilot program requires congressional approval to use program funds for 300 positions in 2020. If approved, the agency plans to expand to an additional 1,200 positions in the following years. Congress is monitoring USAID's reform activities closely. Members of Congress are considering USAID reform activities, focusing on the role of foreign assistance in U.S. foreign policy and national security interests. The goal of ending the need for foreign assistance is being evaluated in light of concerns about rival powers like China and Russia. Foreign assistance programs serve multiple purposes, including supporting security, diplomatic, and commercial interests, as well as promoting social and economic development in partner countries. If successful, USAID's efforts could reduce the need for foreign assistance. USAID is undergoing Transformation while facing proposed budget cuts. Congress has not supported the cuts, and appropriations for USAID have remained stable. Alternative forms of engagement, such as cultural exchange programs and business ties, may help maintain relationships and U.S. influence in countries transitioning away from U.S. aid. The Transformation proposal for USAID includes adding new Associate Administrator positions, potentially politicizing development decisions. Concerns arise over the vacancies in high-level positions and the impact on policy crafting. The focus is on new strategies, indicators, and hiring mechanisms, with less discussion on potential changes or eliminations in existing activities. The Transformation proposal for USAID aims to streamline the workforce by phasing out old hiring mechanisms. Administrator Green emphasizes the importance of self-reliance roadmaps in guiding congressional allocation decisions. Congress typically funds priority accounts and sectors rather than countries, but there is a shift towards a country-specific aid agenda under Transformation. The Transformation proposal for USAID aims to streamline the workforce and prioritize self-reliance roadmaps for congressional allocation decisions. There is a shift towards a country-specific aid agenda, which may conflict with transnational programming priorities. Other initiatives in Transformation, such as operational flexibility in nonpermissive environments and countering violent extremism, have not been prominently featured in recent media coverage. Congress may consult with USAID to ensure indicator configuration aligns with priorities. The Transformation proposal for USAID aims to streamline the workforce and prioritize self-reliance roadmaps for congressional allocation decisions. Congress may also consider seeking additional information on how Transformation would align with the Administration's planned Prosper Africa trade and investment initiative. The State Department's Office of Foreign Assistance Resources has maintained a database of indicators to quantify the results of U.S. foreign assistance programs since 2006. The proposed merger of the Offices of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace into the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance has raised questions about the future of Food for Peace Act Title II programming, impacting Food for Peace programming. The Office of Food for Peace is currently dual-funded, receiving funding through the agriculture appropriations bill and regular farm bills. Congress may need to consider broadening reforms to include State Department policies and structure. The proposed merger of the Offices of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace into the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance may impact Food for Peace Act Title II programming. The Office of Food for Peace is currently funded through the agriculture appropriations bill and regular farm bills. Congress may need to understand how the HA Bureau would be structured to ensure it meets its mandates outlined in the farm bill."
