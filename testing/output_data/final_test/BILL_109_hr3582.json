The Attorney General will redistribute withheld funds to states that comply with the requirements. The Act allows for grants to States for computerizing data and criminal history files, improving existing files, and assisting in transmitting data to national systems. Authorization of $50,000,000 for grants to improve child abuse crime information from 2006 to 2009. Requirement to equalize sentencing for intrafamilial and extrafamilial child sexual abuse. State Study of Laws Regarding Intrafamilial and Extrafamilial Child Sexual Abuse requires states to study and examine laws related to intrafamilial and extrafamilial child sexual abuse, including disparities in charging and sentencing perpetrators. The State must report the results of a study on laws related to child sexual abuse to the Attorney General. Legislative actions must be taken to ensure equal charging and sentencing of perpetrators, regardless of their relationship to the child victim. The Attorney General may extend the 1-year time requirement for a State if legislation is needed to meet the additional requirements of the Act.
