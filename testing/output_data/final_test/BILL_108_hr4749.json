    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Transparency and Accountability in Security Contracting Act\" and includes requirements for contracts with private security contractors. The \"Transparency and Accountability in Security Contracting Act\" mandates that covered contracts with private security contractors must provide the government contracting officer with information on personnel numbers, training, and salaries/benefits. The covered contract must include full cost accounting requirements, such as providing cost estimates before award and reporting actual costs before closeout. Additionally, casualty reporting of all personnel casualties is mandatory. Before a covered contract is awarded, the agency must ensure funds for oversight. The agency head can waive requirements in emergencies, submitting a report to Congress. The agency head must submit a report to Congress within 30 days of awarding a contract, detailing the contract, waiver, justification for the waiver, and a plan for compliance. The Federal Acquisition Regulation must be revised within 120 days. The Secretary of Defense must establish hiring standards for private security contractors within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Defense will set hiring standards for private security contractors under the Act, including addressing past criminal activity and security clearance requirements. Before entering into a contract, a cost and effectiveness analysis will be conducted for each potential activity comparing private security contractors to civilian employees. The Secretary of Defense will establish hiring standards for private security contractors, ensuring that the military mission is not significantly affected if contractors refuse work. \"Covered contracts\" refer to agreements with private security contractors, and \"private security contractor\" includes entities under contract with the Federal Government. The Federal Government can hire personnel for contracts involving carrying weapons or duties like military logistics, interrogation, convoy security, guarding facilities, intelligence gathering, tactical security, and local force training. This section applies to contracts entered into 60 days after the enactment of the Act."
