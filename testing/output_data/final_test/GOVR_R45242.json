    "content": "Congress is considering reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) amidst financial impacts from the 2017 and 2018 hurricane seasons. Total losses for the 2017 season were estimated at $273 billion, with Hurricane Harvey at $128.8 billion, Hurricane Maria at $92.7 billion, and Hurricane Irma at $51.5 billion. The 2018 season saw losses of $49.4 billion, with Hurricane Florence at $24.2 billion and Hurricane Michael at $25.2 billion. NFIP claims for these hurricanes totaled over $10.1 billion for 2017 and over $850 million for 2018. Congress canceled $16 billion of NFIP debt in 2017 to pay claims and avoid exceeding the borrowing limit. Increasing private insurer involvement in flood insurance could shift risk from policyholders to the private sector, benefiting households and businesses by enabling quicker recovery after floods. Private insurers are showing more interest in providing and underwriting flood risk. Private insurers are increasingly interested in providing and underwriting flood risk, which could benefit policyholders by offering wider coverage choices and potentially lower premiums. However, this shift may have implications for the operations and fiscal solvency of the NFIP. Congressional concern has been raised about the extent of private sector involvement in the U.S. flood insurance market, with legislation being proposed but not enacted. The NFIP is currently operating under a short-term reauthorization until May 31, 2019. This report discusses the role of private insurers in U.S. flood insurance, barriers to their involvement, potential effects of increased private sector participation, and provisions in House and Senate NFIP reauthorization bills. NFIP is the main provider of primary flood insurance coverage in the U.S., with nearly $1.42 trillion in coverage for over 5 million residential properties. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) collected $3.5 billion in premium revenue in FY2018, with over 22,000 participating communities. Unlike other property risks covered by private insurers, flood insurance is primarily provided by the federal government. Private property and casualty insurance totaled $611 billion in premiums in 2018. NFIP aims to provide access to primary flood insurance and reduce the nation's flood risk. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) aims to reduce federal expenditure on disaster assistance after floods by implementing floodplain management standards. It provides flood insurance in flood-prone areas to property owners who cannot obtain it elsewhere and engages in non-insurance activities such as disseminating flood risk information and promoting community resilience. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) aims to promote community resilience by funding rebuilding after floods and protecting lenders from mortgage defaults. The program has multiple objectives, including ensuring reasonable insurance premiums, encouraging risk-based premiums, and earning income to cover claims and expenses. Flood insurance is offered to property owners in participating communities, with purchase generally being voluntary. Flood insurance purchase is generally voluntary, except for property owners in Special Flood Hazard Areas with federally backed mortgages. NFIP policies have low coverage limits, with maximum coverage for single-family dwellings at $100,000 for contents and up to $250,000 for building coverage. Other residential buildings can have up to $500,000 for building coverage and $100,000 for contents coverage, while non-residential business buildings can have up to $500,000 for building coverage and $500,000 for contents coverage. Property owners in Special Flood Hazard Areas with federally backed mortgages are required by law to purchase flood insurance. Lenders may also require borrowers outside of these areas to maintain flood insurance. The mandatory purchase requirement is enforced by the lender, who can be fined up to $2,000 for non-compliance. Flood insurance can be purchased through the NFIP or a private company, as long as it meets certain conditions. Property owners in Special Flood Hazard Areas with federally backed mortgages are required to purchase flood insurance. Lenders can be fined up to $2,000 for not requiring flood insurance. Failure to obtain flood insurance may make property owners ineligible for certain disaster assistance. Flood insurance rates are based on risk and actuarial principles, with some properties receiving discounts. FEMA borrows from the U.S. Treasury to pay NFIP claims due to subsidies and discounts. The NFIP provides discounted rates for properties built before 1974, newly mapped properties, and grandfathered properties. The NFIP is authorized until May 31, 2019, with multiple short-term reauthorizations. As of the 116th Congress, no NFIP legislation has been considered in the Senate. The House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on NFIP reauthorization, with four draft bills circulated. H.R. 2874 passed in the House, authorizing NFIP until September 30, 2022. Three bills in the Senate aimed to reauthorize NFIP provisions but were not considered by the full Senate. In the 115th Congress, several bills aimed to reauthorize the NFIP, with varying provisions on private flood insurance participation. House legislation was more supportive of private insurance compared to Senate bills. The House previously passed H.R. 2901 to encourage private insurance but the Senate did not consider it. In the 115th Congress, the House included provisions in H.R. 2874 and an unrelated bill for the Federal Aviation Administration. The Senate removed flood insurance language from the FAA bill before passing it. Private flood insurance provisions were a major concern. The Senate did not address H.R. 2874. Private insurers can participate in the flood insurance market in various ways. Private insurers have played a major role in administering the NFIP since 1983, handling marketing, selling policies, and claims management. The NFIP retains the financial risk of paying claims, but has purchased reinsurance since 2016 to transfer some flood risk to the private sector. FEMA oversees the NFIP, while private companies handle day-to-day operations. FEMA has established arrangements with private industry, such as the Direct Servicing Agent (DSA) for selling NFIP policies. The NFIP works with private contractors like Direct Servicing Agents (DSA) and private insurance companies through the Write-Your-Own (WYO) program to sell flood insurance policies. The NFIP retains the financial risk of paying claims, with 13% of policies managed by DSAs and 87% by WYO companies. Compensation for WYO companies is not directly based on costs incurred. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 required FEMA to develop a methodology for reimbursing insurance companies in the WYO program. FEMA has not yet published a rulemaking to revise the compensation structure for WYO companies. Proposed bills in Congress aimed to cap the allowance paid to WYOs at different percentages. In the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-89, HFIAA), Congress revised FEMA's authority to secure reinsurance for the NFIP from private markets, reducing the need to borrow from the Treasury. Reinsurance helps FEMA price flood risk upfront and manage losses over time, but it is unlikely to lower the overall cost of the NFIP. Reinsurance through private markets helps FEMA manage flood risk and reduce the need to borrow from the Treasury. However, it is unlikely to lower the overall cost of the NFIP as reinsurers charge premiums to compensate for the risk they assume. A $16.8 billion reinsurance coverage for Katrina-level losses could cost $2.2 billion per year, a large portion of total NFIP premiums. This could leave insufficient funds for claims outside of large disasters and other NFIP purposes like flood mitigation and mapping. FEMA has purchased reinsurance through traditional methods and catastrophe bonds. Traditional reinsurance involves multiple companies sharing the risk, while catastrophe bond reinsurance transfers risk to investors. Coverage typically starts after $4 billion in losses, with higher payouts for greater losses. This has only been triggered by three events: Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and Hurricane Harvey. The reinsurance purchases vary in coverage amount, premiums paid, and type of reinsurance. The NFIP has purchased reinsurance to mitigate losses, with $655 million in premiums paid and $1.042 billion received from claims. The balance of premiums vs. claims may turn negative in the next few years. Legislation in the 115th Congress aimed to transfer NFIP risk to the private reinsurance market due to the unavailability of flood insurance from private insurers in 1968. Private flood insurance was offered between 1895 and 1927, but most insurers stopped offering flood policies after significant losses. Private flood insurance companies found flood peril uninsurable due to the catastrophic nature of flooding and other factors. Currently, the private flood insurance market mainly offers commercial coverage, secondary coverage above NFIP maximums, or coverage in the lender-placed market. Premiums for private flood insurance totaled $644 million in 2018, up from $589 million in 2017 and $376 million in 2016. Private flood insurance market focuses on high-value properties with higher premiums. Few private insurers compete with NFIP in primary residential flood insurance market. Private insurers face barriers to wider involvement. Congress allows private flood insurance to fulfill mandatory purchase mortgage requirement. The implementation of the mandatory purchase mortgage requirement for private flood insurance has been challenging. Lending institutions struggle with evaluating if policies meet the required coverage standards. Federal agencies issued Notices of Proposed Rulemaking in 2013 and 2016, with a final rule announced in 2019. The final rule announced in 2019 allows institutions to rely on insurer assurances in private flood insurance policies and accept policies that do not meet the Biggert-Waters Act criteria. This exception is based on the more general term \"flood insurance\" in the statutory definition and aims to promote private insurance. The rule takes effect on July 1, 2019. The final rule announced in 2019 promotes private insurance in BW-12, taking effect on July 1, 2019. Press reports suggest the banking industry welcomes the rule, but it remains unclear how much it will encourage private flood insurance. Legislative changes may be necessary to further develop the private flood insurance market. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 2874 and S. 1313 proposed revising the definition of private flood insurance, removing the requirement for coverage as broad as NFIP. In the 115th Congress, legislation was proposed to address issues related to continuous coverage in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). H.R. 2874 included a provision for property owners to maintain continuous coverage when switching between private flood insurance and NFIP. S. 1313 also included a provision allowing private flood insurance to count as continuous coverage. In the 116th Congress, H.R. 1666 proposed allowing private flood insurance to be considered as continuous coverage, unlike S. 1368 and S. 1571. Before FY2019, Write Your Own carriers were restricted from selling standalone private flood products due to non-compete clauses in NFIP contracts. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 2874 aimed to eliminate the non-compete clause for Write Your Own (WYO) carriers, while S. 1313 proposed temporary authorization for WYOs to sell private flood insurance. FEMA made changes to WYO contracts in FY2019, allowing WYO companies to offer private flood insurance while keeping it separate from NFIP business. This removed the non-compete clause without legislation, with FEMA retaining the authority to reinstate it in the future. The implications of removing the non-compete clause for Write Your Own (WYO) carriers are discussed in the context of private sector involvement in flood insurance. The NFIP's subsidized rates are a barrier to private insurers, as their full-risk rates must include a profitable return on capital. Private insurers would need to charge premium rates that reflect the full estimated risk of flood losses while still making a profit to enter the flood insurance market. A reformed NFIP rate structure could attract more private insurers to the flood insurance market by aligning rates with private insurers' likely charges, potentially leading to higher rates for households. H.R. 2874 in the 115th Congress proposed phasing out pre-FIRM subsidies for primary residences at a rate of 6.5%-15% over three years, while other property categories would remain at a 25% subsidy. Senate bills did not address premium rate subsidies. FEMA's role in this reform is crucial. The Senate bills did not address premium rate subsidies. FEMA is developing Risk Rating 2.0 for the NFIP, with new flood insurance rates for single-family properties to be announced on April 1, 2020. The new rates are planned to go into effect on October 1, 2020, and will consider replacement cost value and distance from water sources. Risk Rating 2.0 will also include new sources of flooding, such as intense rainfall. The potential impact of private flood insurance on the market, regulatory uncertainty at the state level, and the involvement of state regulators could increase oversight burden and costs for insurers. State-specific insurance solutions may better suit local conditions, but state intervention in controlling rates has led some insurers to withdraw from markets. H.R. 2874 and S. 1313 in the 115th Congress referenced state laws. Private flood insurance in the 115th Congress referenced state laws and regulations for meeting mandatory purchase requirements. Insurers face barriers due to limited access to NFIP data on flood losses and claims. Private companies argue that increased access to NFIP claims data would help in estimating future losses and pricing premiums. However, FEMA cites privacy concerns under the Privacy Act of 1974 as a hindrance to providing property-level information to insurers. Insurers suggest better flood risk assessment tools like improved flood maps for accurate risk evaluation. In the 115th Congress, H.R. 2874 and S. 1313 proposed measures related to NFIP claims data availability and flood insurance market participation. Insurers emphasize the need for better flood risk assessment tools and increased consumer participation to manage risk exposure effectively. The NFIP's objective is to boost flood insurance policy purchases through mandatory requirements. The mandatory purchase requirement aims to increase flood insurance policy purchases, but compliance rates vary across different regions. A 2006 study found compliance as low as 43% in the Midwest and as high as 88% in the West. A more recent study in New York City showed an increase in compliance from 61% in 2012 to 73% in 2016. Escrowing insurance premiums since 2016 may further improve compliance, but data is not yet available. The possibility of expanding the mandatory purchase requirement to more mortgage loans is being considered. The mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance may be expanded to include all mortgage loans made by federally regulated lending institutions for properties in NFIP communities. Another option is to mandate flood insurance for all properties in Special Flood Hazard Areas, not just those with federally backed mortgages. Increasing consumer participation could involve mandating flood coverage in homeowners' insurance policies or requiring all homeowners to purchase flood insurance. Bills in the 115th Congress included provisions for studying compliance with the mandatory purchase requirement, with H.R. 2874 proposing increased civil penalties for lenders failing to enforce it. NFIP policies offer limited coverage compared to private markets for non-flood perils. Private insurance companies could potentially compete with the NFIP by offering coverage not available under the NFIP, such as business interruption insurance, living expenses while a property is being repaired, basement coverage, coverage of other structures on a property, and/or by offering policies with coverage limits higher than the NFIP. Private companies may have a shorter waiting period before coverage goes into effect and could offer flood coverage as an add-on to a standard homeowners' policy, eliminating the need to distinguish between flood and wind damage. Unlike the NFIP, private flood insurance companies may issue a policy without necessarily having a waiting period. Private flood insurance companies may issue policies without requiring elevation certificates, potentially offering lower premiums tied to individual risks. Some non-subsidized NFIP policyholders could obtain cheaper flood insurance from private insurers. The extent of cross-subsidization within the NFIP is unknown, making it difficult to quantify potential savings from private insurance. Private companies like Milliman and KatRisk conducted a modeling exercise comparing NFIP and private insurance premiums for single-family homes in Louisiana, Florida, and Texas. Their findings showed that a majority of homes in these states could pay less with private insurance, but some could end up paying more. Details on coverage and basis for estimates were not provided by Milliman. Consumer protections with private policies vary by state, and private insurers have the freedom to accept or reject policyholders based on risk management. Private flood insurance policies offered by private insurers may not be renewed like NFIP policies. They could be cheaper but provide less coverage, leading to potential surprises during claims. The language in private policies is not standardized, leading to variability in claims outcomes. Private sector competition may increase NFIP's financial exposure as private markets target profitable policies. This could result in cherry-picking of lower-risk NFIP policies by private insurers. Private insurers may avoid writing policies for properties deemed undesirable by private insurers, leaving the NFIP with a higher density of financially unsound policies. Private insurers prioritize profits and may not offer flood insurance at affordable rates, potentially leading to cherry-picking of lower-risk NFIP policies. Private insurers may avoid writing policies for high-risk properties, leaving the NFIP with more financially unsound policies. The emergence of new entrants in the flood insurance market led to the introduction of Flood Re in the UK, as these new insurers could cherry-pick lower-risk business for higher profits. The introduction of Flood Re in the UK aimed to level the playing field between private insurers by including new entrants and charging clients for cross-subsidy. An increase in private flood insurance policies could depopulate the NFIP, making it harder for remaining policyholders to subsidize policies and potentially leading to a shift towards private insurance in the long term. Residual market mechanisms in insurance, like auto insurance, provide coverage for higher risk individuals who cannot obtain it from regular insurers. The form of these mechanisms varies by state and insurance type, often requiring support from the government or insurers. In the 115th Congress, the CBO estimated that eliminating non-compete agreements in H.R. 2874 would lead to about 690,000 properties opting for private flood insurance instead of NFIP coverage over a 10-year period. Subsidized property owners were not expected to leave the NFIP program. S. 1313 would have required FEMA to report on the risk classifications of private flood insurance policies and give the FEMA Administrator power to limit WYO companies' participation in the flood insurance marketplace if private insurance adversely impacts the NFIP. This could lead to increased spending of $39 million for the 2018-2022 period and $393 million for the 2018-2017 period. If NFIP policyholders decrease significantly, it may be challenging to support the NFIP's flood risk reduction functions. NFIP flood mapping is funded through annual appropriations and the Federal Policy Fee (FPF). The FPF is paid to FEMA and funds floodplain mapping and management. Concerns arise as private flood insurance policies may reduce revenue for these activities. Private flood insurance policies could impact revenue for floodplain mapping and management activities. Stakeholders suggest implementing a form of FPF equivalency or user fee for private flood insurance. In the 115th Congress, mechanisms were proposed for private insurance companies to contribute to mapping costs instead of paying the FPF. Enforcement of floodplain management standards may be more challenging with private insurance, as NFIP insurance availability is tied to these standards. The ASFPM is concerned that widespread private flood insurance could lead communities to drop out of NFIP and relax management standards. The debate over NFIP and private insurance has evolved, with suggestions to address issues by allowing private policies in NFIP communities. FEMA proposed tying federal disaster assistance to mitigation policies, which could increase private market participation. The discussion in 2012 focused on privatization of NFIP. The 2012 discussion focused on privatization of the NFIP to reduce the federal government's role in flood insurance and promote private sector involvement for innovation in flood risk analytics and modeling. The 2012 discussion focused on privatization of the NFIP to reduce the federal government's role in flood insurance and promote private sector involvement for innovation in flood risk analytics and modeling. FEMA considered steps to address barriers to private sector involvement, including the purchase of reinsurance and reducing premium subsidies. FEMA presented a report on privatization without a specific recommendation, citing the complexity of any privatization strategy. The report on privatization of the NFIP concluded that there is no clear solution due to the complexity and politicized nature of the issue. FEMA aims to increase flood insurance coverage by doubling policies by 2023 through a mix of NFIP and private policies, following the 2017 hurricane season which exposed the flood insurance gap in the United States. The 2017 hurricane season revealed the flood insurance gap in the United States, with many exposed to flood risk not covered. In Texas and Florida, less than a third of flooded structures in SFHAs were insured, and only 10%-12% outside SFHAs. Insured flood victims receive significantly more from NFIP insurance than FEMA Individual Assistance. For example, in the 2015 South Carolina floods, NFIP claims averaged $35,172 compared to IA payments of $3,199. In the 2016 Louisiana floods, NFIP claims averaged $91,507 while IA payments were about $9,349. Hurricane Harvey saw average NFIP claims of $116,823 compared to IA payments of $4,426 in Texas. Hurricane Irma had average NFIP claims of $51,773 in Florida. FEMA emphasizes the need for both NFIP and private market to increase flood insurance coverage and reduce uninsured losses. Private market expansion requires congressional action due to concerns about mandatory purchase requirement and adverse selection. Provisions in 115th Congress legislation address barriers to private sector involvement in flood insurance. H.R. 2874, 21st Century Flood Reform Act, Section 102, would phase out pre-FIRM subsidies for primary residences at a rate of 6.5%-15% over three years. Other property categories would remain at a 25% phaseout rate. FEMA's authority to implement these changes would be affected. H.R. 2874, Section 201, would have allowed FEMA to raise premiums more rapidly by changing the definition of private flood insurance to rely on state compliance. Private flood insurance would have included surplus lines insurance, with regulation primarily at the state level. The proposed legislation would have shifted regulation of private flood insurance to individual states, while federal regulators would oversee financial strength requirements for private insurance companies. Property owners could switch between private insurance and the NFIP without penalty, and private insurers could offer policies with varying coverage options. H.R. 2874, Section 202, would have changed the mandatory purchase requirement for residential improved real estate only, potentially reducing the number of commercial properties covered by NFIP. H.R. 2874, Section 203, would have allowed WYO companies to sell both NFIP and private flood insurance policies. H.R. 2874, Section 203, would have allowed WYO companies to offer their own insurance policies while also receiving reimbursement for their participation in the WYO program. FEMA's proposed changes for FY2019 aimed to remove the WYO non-compete clause. Section 204 of the bill would have required FEMA to make flood risk assessment data publicly available and develop an open-source data system for immediate public access. The NFIP database provides community information without personally identifiable details. H.R. 2874, Section 506, limits WYO companies' allowance to 27.9% of the premium and reduces costs. Section 507 increases civil penalties for lenders not enforcing mandatory flood insurance. Section 513 requires updated compliance guidelines. The guidelines on compliance with mandatory purchase would be updated and reissued. H.R. 2874, Section 513, requires a report on the implementation of the mandatory purchase requirement. H.R. 2874, Section 511, mandates FEMA to transfer a portion of NFIP risk to private markets. S. 1313, Flood Insurance Affordability and Sustainability Act of 2017, requires annual risk transfer to maintain program ability to pay claims and limit exposure to catastrophic losses. FEMA would conduct a study as per S. 1313, Section 102. S. 1313, Section 102, required FEMA to conduct a study with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to increase flood insurance participation. Options included expanding coverage, automatic enrollment, and bundled insurance. Section 401 allowed state-approved private insurance to fulfill the mandatory purchase requirement and count as continuous coverage. S. 1313, Section 402, provided temporary authority for WYO companies to sell private flood insurance for certain properties with the possibility of expanded participation after two years. Section 403 required FEMA to study the feasibility of selling NFIP claims data to non-governmental entities while protecting policyholder privacy. Section 404 of S. 1313 authorized FEMA to sell or license claims data for the National Flood Insurance Fund. Section 602 required insurance companies to impose an annual surcharge equivalent to the Federal Policy Fee for private flood insurance policies. FEMA was also mandated to create a searchable database of claims filed, paid, and denied within a year of enactment. The SAFE National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 included provisions such as limiting FEMA reimbursement to WYO companies, developing a fee schedule for Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and determining actual costs of WYO companies within 12 months of enactment. The SAFE National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 included provisions to limit FEMA reimbursement to WYO companies based on actual costs, develop a fee schedule for Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and study the mandatory purchase requirement for properties in SFHAs and the 500-year floodplain. FEMA was also authorized to consider various forms of risk transfer for the National Flood Insurance Program. The SAFE National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 included provisions to limit FEMA reimbursement to WYO companies based on actual costs and study the mandatory purchase requirement for properties in SFHAs and the 500-year floodplain. S. 1571, Section 303, would have required federal banking regulators to conduct an annual study on compliance with the mandatory purchase requirement and FEMA to study participation rates and financial assistance for individuals living outside SFHAs."
