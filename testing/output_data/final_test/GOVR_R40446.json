This was done to reduce the attraction of employment for unauthorized immigrants. The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 aimed to address unauthorized immigration by legalizing certain segments of the population and implementing measures to deter future unauthorized immigration. However, the IRCA provisions did not effectively curb illegal immigration, as the unauthorized population began to grow again after initially decreasing. The I-9 process was undermined by the availability of fraudulent documents, leading Congress to attempt to strengthen the employment verification process with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). Under INA Section 274A, employers in a pilot program confirm identity and employment eligibility of new hires. IIRIRA tasked the Attorney General to establish a confirmation system for inquiries through a toll-free line. DHS took over responsibility from INS in 2003. The Basic Pilot program, the first of three IIRIRA verification pilots, began in 1997 in five states with high unauthorized alien populations. The Basic Pilot program, later renamed E-Verify, was established in 1997 to confirm identity and employment eligibility of new hires. It became available nationwide in 2004 and has been extended multiple times by Congress, most recently until September 30, 2018. Administered by DHS's USCIS, the program is internet-based and part of the I-9 process for all employers. As part of the I-9 process, employers review documents presented by new hires to verify identity and employment authorization. Employers participating in E-Verify submit new hire information for confirmation, which is compared with SSA's database to verify work authorization. If employer-submitted information matches SSA records but individual self-identifies as noncitizen, it is sent to USCIS for work authorization verification. USCIS confirms work authorization or notifies employer of nonconfirmation. The E-Verify process involves checking work authorization through electronic checks and additional databases. Employers must notify employees of any tentative nonconfirmation findings and employees have the opportunity to contest these findings within a specified timeframe. If a final nonconfirmation is issued, employees can contact USCIS for a review. The E-Verify program has seen significant growth in employer enrollment and queries. As of April 2, 2018, there were 779,722 enrolled employers with over 2.5 million participating sites. This represents about 13% of U.S. employers. Between FY2007 and FY2017, the annual number of E-Verify queries increased more than tenfold, from about 3.3 million to about 34.9 million. In 2017, there were 65.3 million nonfarm hires in the US. E-Verify is a voluntary program, but violators of immigration laws may be required to participate. Federal departments and agencies were mandated to verify new hires through E-Verify starting in October 2007. E-Verify is funded by Congress with at least $100 million annually since FY2009. The unauthorized alien resident population in the US was estimated at 11.3 million in 2016. The Pew Research Center estimated 8.0 million unauthorized workers in the civilian labor force in 2014. Policymakers are considering expanding electronic employment verification, such as E-Verify, to address unauthorized employment. Various bills have been introduced in Congress to make E-Verify permanent, mandatory for all employers, and verify previously hired workers. Limited provisions have been enacted to extend the E-Verify program. In recent years, legislative action has been taken on bills with electronic employment eligibility verification provisions. The 113th Congress passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included such provisions. The House Judiciary Committee considered similar versions of the Legal Workforce Act in the 113th and 114th Congresses. The 115th Congress has also acted on electronic employment verification measures, ordering the reporting of the Legal Workforce Act. The Judiciary Committee has ordered the reporting of the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 3711), a bill similar to previous versions in the 113th and 114th Congresses. The Act is also included in the Securing America's Future Act of 2018 (H.R. 4760). E-Verify, a provision to make electronic employment eligibility verification permanent, was considered in the Senate but not made mandatory. Federal rules from 2008 and 2009 require employers to participate in E-Verify for certain business benefits, including a rule for federal contractors issued by President George W. Bush. The Executive Order mandates the use of E-Verify for federal contractors to verify the employment eligibility of all hires and employees working on federal contracts in the United States. E-Verify was designated as the required system by the Secretary of Homeland Security, with a final rule published in November 2008. The E-Verify system was mandated for federal contractors to verify the eligibility of their hires and employees working on federal contracts in the US. The rule became applicable in September 2009, with additional regulations requiring employers to use E-Verify to hire certain temporary residents. DHS also extended the optional practical training period for foreign students with STEM degrees to 29 months. The 2008 rule requiring students to be employed by an E-Verify enrolled employer was replaced in May 2016 with a new rule allowing for a 24-month STEM OPT extension. A DHS final rule in 2009 also mandated E-Verify participation for H-2A workers seeking employment authorization benefits. The primary goal of an employment eligibility verification system like E-Verify is to ensure that individuals holding jobs are authorized to work in the United States. Policymakers should consider potential impacts on unauthorized employment, system accuracy, efficiency, discrimination, employer compliance, privacy, and usability. Independent studies have evaluated whether E-Verify has reduced unauthorized employment and met policy goals. The evaluation by Westat in 2012 found that E-Verify helps reduce unauthorized employment by confirming that most individuals receiving final nonconfirmations are not authorized to work. This reduction depends on factors like finding other employment and deterrence from applying to E-Verify participating employers. The effectiveness of E-Verify in reducing unauthorized employment is limited by program size and fraud detection capabilities. The system checks I-9 information against SSA and DHS databases to detect document fraud. In the future, E-Verify may deter unauthorized employment by increasing the cost of securing such employment. The authors speculate that as it becomes harder to obtain fraudulent documents undetected by E-Verify, the cost of such documents will increase, potentially reducing unauthorized employment. However, this may lead to some working under the table, increasing risks of worker exploitation. The opinion piece on Reason Online argues that E-verify may not effectively reduce unauthorized employment and could lead to workers being exploited underground. The electronic employment eligibility verification system must confirm eligibility accurately and efficiently to prevent job opportunities for legal workers from being affected. The E-Verify system aims to maximize reliability and accuracy in verifying employee eligibility. Independent evaluations have shown a decrease in the erroneous tentative nonconfirmation rate from 4.8% to 0.3% over the years. The E-Verify system has seen a significant decrease in the erroneous tentative nonconfirmation rate from 4.8% to 0.3% in recent years. However, there are limitations to this rate as it does not account for work-authorized individuals who do not contest tentative nonconfirmations. The data used may also include false positives, leading to an underestimation of the inaccuracy rate for authorized workers. The E-Verify system has limitations in accurately measuring the inaccuracy rate for authorized workers. New measures of inaccuracy were developed in 2009 to assess the system's performance, including the inaccuracy rate for authorized workers not initially found to be authorized to work through E-Verify. The inaccuracy rate for workers authorized to work through E-Verify was 0.8% from April to June 2008. In contrast, unauthorized workers had an inaccuracy rate of 54%, with a total inaccuracy rate of 4.1% for all workers checked during that period. In 2008, E-Verify had an overall inaccuracy rate of 4.1%, with data input errors and outdated records causing inaccuracies for authorized workers, while fraud, including document and identity fraud, led to incorrect findings for unauthorized workers. Identity fraud was highlighted as a significant issue in inaccurate work authorization findings for unauthorized workers in 2009 and 2012 Westat reports. E-Verify has limited ability to detect certain types of document fraud. E-Verify has limited ability to detect document fraud when counterfeit documents are of reasonable quality and contain information about actual work-authorized persons. Concerns have been raised about potential identity fraud if E-Verify becomes mandatory for all employers. USCIS has made changes to address inaccuracies in the system. Changes to E-Verify have been made over the years to reduce inaccuracies for authorized workers, including addressing data input errors and incorrect federal government records. Enhancements include recognizing European date formats and common clerical errors, as well as checking additional databases before issuing a tentative nonconfirmation. In May 2008, changes were made to E-Verify to reduce tentative nonconfirmations for naturalized citizens by automatically checking USCIS naturalization databases. In February 2009, Department of State passport records were added to verify work eligibility. Real-time arrival data for noncitizens was also incorporated in May 2008, and in October 2012, access to DHS's Arrival and Departure Information database was granted. In October 2012, access to DHS's Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) database was added to E-Verify to reduce mismatches for recent arrivals. E-Verify Self Check allows individuals to check their work authorization status online and correct any mismatches in SSA or DHS databases. USCIS implemented enhancements like the Photo Screening Tool to detect identity fraud when new hires present an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). The Photo Tool in E-Verify helps verify the authenticity of documents like EADs, green cards, and U.S. Passports by comparing the photo with USCIS databases. However, it is limited as new hires can use other documents to prove identity and eligibility. Approximately 5% of E-Verify cases in FY2016 and FY2017 used the Photo Tool. Another feature, Records and Information from DMVs for E-Verify (RIDE), aims to detect document fraud. The Records and Information from DMVs for E-Verify (RIDE) program was launched in June 2011 to detect document fraud when new hires present driver's licenses or state-issued identification cards. Mississippi was the first partner in this effort, with nine other states joining later. E-Verify can now lock Social Security numbers that appear to be used fraudulently, using algorithms and analysis to identify patterns of fraud. The myE-Verify enhancement builds on this feature and the Self Check initiative. The myE-Verify program, launched in October 2014, incorporates Self Check and allows individuals to track E-Verify case status and lock their Social Security numbers. Biometric proposals for E-Verify are controversial due to concerns about costs and worker privacy. Accurate verification relies on precise data to avoid false positives. The Basic Pilot program and other pilots aimed to maintain accurate records for verifying work eligibility. Evaluations in 2002 and 2007 highlighted issues with database timeliness and accuracy. The SSA Numident database was found to be generally accurate but with some discrepancies that could lead to incorrect information for employers using E-Verify. The SSA Inspector General identified discrepancies in Numident records that could lead to incorrect feedback in the employment eligibility verification process, particularly concerning citizenship information for foreign-born individuals. Evaluations in 2009 and 2012 noted efforts to improve database accuracy in E-Verify. The challenges in providing timely and complete biographic data for immigration and citizenship status to Federal databases accessed by E-Verify are due to the changing nature of immigration status and lack of public knowledge about reporting name changes. Efficiency of the employment eligibility verification system is measured by the percentage of cases verified automatically or after initial review by USCIS Immigration Status Verifier, with high rates reported in recent years. In FY2017, 98.9% of cases were verified automatically by E-Verify. Some groups argue that mandatory E-Verify usage would increase bureaucracy and hiring delays. The capacity of E-Verify to handle queries for all newly hired workers is a concern with proposals to expand electronic verification. E-Verify received about 34.9 million queries in FY2017. E-Verify has the capacity to handle 60 million electronic queries annually, with the potential to process up to 240 million queries. System upgrades have increased performance to support additional traffic. USCIS indicated that E-Verify can handle up to 10,000 concurrent users. IRCA added Section 274B to address discrimination against work-authorized individuals based on national origin or immigration status. GAO reported widespread discrimination resulting from IRCA in 1990, but Congress did not take action. The IIRIRA employment eligibility verification pilot programs aimed to reduce discrimination related to the I-9 process by implementing safeguards in the confirmation system. Prohibited behaviors include selective or unauthorized use of the system, using it before an offer of employment, and excluding individuals based on perceived likelihood of additional verification. E-Verify system prohibits these actions, but evaluations have found issues with compliance. The IIRIRA pilot programs aimed to reduce discrimination in employment eligibility verification by implementing safeguards. Despite prohibited behaviors under E-Verify, evaluations have found some employers still practice them. Debate surrounds the potential impact of electronic verification on hiring foreign-born individuals, with concerns raised about increased discrimination even with proper procedures in place. Evaluations of E-Verify in 2013 found that most users were unaffected in their willingness to hire foreign-born job applicants. However, the system has shown a tendency to give erroneous nonconfirmations to foreign-born workers compared to U.S.-born workers. The 2009 Westat report highlighted that E-Verify can lead to post-hiring discrimination against foreign-born workers due to the increased likelihood of receiving an erroneous TNC. Workers may face missed work time, financial costs, and potential job loss if they receive a TNC. Naturalized U.S. citizens have historically experienced higher erroneous TNC rates, mainly due to SSA records not reflecting their naturalization status. USCIS has made efforts to address this issue successfully. The Naturalization Phase I and Phase II initiatives successfully reduced erroneous TNC rates for foreign-born citizens. USCIS added passport data to decrease mismatches among foreign-born citizens. Employer compliance in E-Verify involves submitting queries within three days of hiring to verify eligibility. Employer compliance with E-Verify involves submitting an E-Verify query to verify a new hire's employment eligibility within three days after the hire date, providing notice of tentative nonconfirmation findings to employees, and not taking adverse actions against employees who contest TNC findings. Noncompliance can reduce the program's effectiveness in curbing unauthorized employment and may lead to discrimination. Certain employer behaviors, such as selective use of the system and prescreening job applicants, are prohibited by law. Compliance with E-Verify requirements is generally higher than noncompliance, as shown in the 2009 Westat evaluation. The 2009 report focused on employer compliance with E-Verify, identifying prohibited behaviors such as not training employees on the system, using E-Verify for screening job applicants, and taking adverse actions against employees with tentative nonconfirmation findings. Some employers discouraged employees from contesting TNC findings. Some employers took prohibited adverse actions against employees contesting TNC findings, including restricting work assignments, delaying training, or reducing pay. Failure to promptly terminate employees with FNC findings was noted. The 2012 Westat report highlighted the negative impact on E-Verify accuracy when proper procedures are not followed for TNCs. Properly informing workers of TNCs could significantly reduce FNCs issued to authorized workers. The FNC accuracy rate was estimated at 94% for unauthorized workers in FY2009. The 2013 Westat survey of E-Verify employers found high compliance levels with E-Verify policies, but some engaged in prohibited behavior like selective use of E-Verify. Adverse actions were taken against workers with TNC findings, including restricting work assignments and delaying training. Westat reported that a small percentage of employers agreed with discouraging workers from contesting TNCs due to perceived time constraints or low work authorization outcomes. The impact of mandatory participation in E-Verify on compliance levels was also considered, with Westat finding little difference in compliance between mandated and voluntary users in their 2013 survey. Employee privacy was another issue addressed. The 2009 Westat report highlighted steps taken by SSA and USCIS to protect worker privacy in connection with E-Verify, including policies to ensure database security. Potential privacy-related weaknesses of E-Verify were also noted, such as concerns about improper use and lack of employer notification to workers. In the 2008 and 2013 employer surveys on E-Verify, a high percentage of employers consistently informed workers of Tentative Nonconfirmations (TNCs) in private. Concerns about expanding E-Verify, especially making it mandatory for all employers, have raised privacy issues. Jim Harper of the Cato Institute warned about serious privacy consequences of a nationwide electronic employment verification system compared to a paper-based I-9 system. The ACLU and Jim Harper raised concerns about privacy threats posed by a mandatory E-Verify system, warning that it could lead to a national ID system and undermine personal privacy and freedom. A national ID system through E-Verify could make the right to work contingent upon government approval. Most employers found E-Verify effective and not burdensome, with a decreasing percentage finding it impossible to meet obligations over the years. Employers are not charged a fee to participate in E-Verify. Employers using E-Verify may face set-up and operating costs, with most reporting no direct costs in surveys. Satisfaction with E-Verify among users has been consistently high according to surveys conducted by the CFI Group for USCIS. If E-Verify becomes mandatory, more employers in the higher-cost group may be affected. Some employers may struggle with the required participation due to lack of resources. Policy issues related to mandatory electronic employment eligibility verification should consider potential impacts on unauthorized workers and concerns about inaccuracies, inefficiencies, and privacy breaches. Employer compliance and burden are key issues, with implications for discrimination. If E-Verify becomes mandatory, more employers in the higher-cost group may be affected. Employer burden and implications for discrimination are important considerations. A mandatory system may require new strategies to address these issues."
