These exports have grown from 1.4 million barrels daily in 2007 to 1.9 million barrels daily in 2008, representing 10% of total U.S. oil consumption. A significant portion of these exports are heavier oil products like petroleum coke and residual fuel, which the U.S. market cannot fully absorb. Keeping these products in the U.S. would be costly and impractical to refine for automotive or residential heating use. Prohibiting U.S. oil exports would not lower crude oil prices as oil is a global commodity. The price is primarily determined by world demand, not a nation's dependence on imported oil. Restricting exports would lead buyers to seek supply elsewhere, causing a re-balancing in global oil trade without significantly affecting prices. The United States ended crude oil exports from Alaska in 2000. Current U.S. oil exports are minimal and do not originate from Alaska. There are proposals to restrict U.S. oil exports to lower gasoline and diesel prices. When the Arab oil embargo began in late 1973, oil development on Alaska's North Slope had not yet commenced. Two plans were considered for oil transportation from Prudhoe Bay, one through Canada to the Midwest and the other to Valdez, Alaska for shipment by tanker. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) ultimately chose the Valdez route for its cost savings and efficiency. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) was chosen to transport oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez for shipment by tanker, despite opposition claiming the intent was to export North Slope crude. Legislation was passed to authorize the pipeline route, with a provision that the oil would not be exported. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) was completed in 1977 to transport oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. Oil production peaked at 2.0 million barrels per day in 1988 but declined to 700,000 bd currently. A surplus of oil on the West Coast led to depressed prices for California and ANS producers, with some crude being shipped via the Panama Canal to the U.S. Gulf Coast. In the 1990s, concerns were raised about the impact of the ban on Alaskan oil exports on the West Coast oil market. California producers believed that allowing exports would increase production and create jobs. A 1994 DOE study suggested that exporting Alaskan crude would benefit both California and Alaska producers by increasing their receipts. The ban on Alaskan oil exports was lifted in 1995, leading to transportation savings and job creation. The DOE estimated 16,000 new jobs and predicted increased oil output from Alaska and California. Bills to repeal the ban passed in Congress with large margins, supported by the Clinton Administration. The ban on Alaskan oil exports was lifted in 1995, leading to increased exports of ANS oil to foreign countries. Exports grew from 36,000 bd in 1996 to a high of 74,000 bd in 1999, with Korea, Japan, and China being the main importers. Before exports stopped in 2000, about 7% of North Slope output was shipped abroad. During the period of January through June 2008, U.S. oil exports averaged 1.7 mbd, with petroleum coke exports making up roughly 22%. Finished motor gasoline accounted for about 9.5% of exports, while distillates and residual fuel oil comprised the rest. Approximately 35% of total U.S. oil exports went to Canada and Mexico. Oil is a global commodity, and restricting U.S. oil exports would not lower prices for gasoline and diesel. U.S. oil exports do not lead to lower prices for gasoline and diesel fuel globally. Economic theory suggests that commodities find efficient distribution at market prices. Most U.S. oil exports are products not used in the U.S., and restricting exports would not impact world demand for crude oil. Price is primarily determined by demand and future supply expectations. Restrictions on U.S. oil exports are unlikely to lower world prices. Restrictions on U.S. oil exports are unlikely to lower world crude prices but may lead to upward pressure. The new import/export equilibrium could be less efficient, with higher transportation costs. While reducing U.S. dependence on petroleum imports may ease supply concerns, any production disruption globally will impact oil prices for all."
