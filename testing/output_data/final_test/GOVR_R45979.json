In the US, most households use traditional banks, while some opt for non-bank financial services. These alternative products may better suit certain needs but could lack consumer protections. Different barriers affect different populations in accessing financial products and services. For younger consumers, a lack of a co-signer or knowledge about financial institutions can hinder building credit history. Those living paycheck to paycheck may face obstacles due to bad credit or lack of funds. Immigrants may struggle with no US credit history or language barriers. Older Americans without internet or mobile access may find technology a barrier. Some consumers face barriers accessing traditional bank products, credit system, and financial services, hindering financial well-being. Research shows money management is key to financial well-being. Access to financial products like bank accounts, nonbank transaction products, and liquid savings is strongly correlated with higher financial well-being. Research suggests that having a bank account can lead to increased savings, especially with debit accounts reducing costs and monitoring expenses. Faster and secure payment services also provide significant benefits to consumers. The evidence on the effect of small-dollar short-term credit on individuals' financial well-being is mixed. Many Americans struggle with low financial well-being, living paycheck to paycheck, and facing difficulty covering expenses and bills. A sizable portion of the adult population report they would have difficulty meeting an unexpected expense. Many Americans face financial struggles and have difficulty covering unexpected expenses. The banking sector provides essential services like savings, payments, and credit. Opening a bank account is a secure way to store money, with FDIC insurance up to $250,000 per depositor. Checking accounts offer payment services like bill pay and debit cards for convenient transactions. Opening a bank account provides secure and affordable access to payment transactions through a debit card. It is relatively easy for consumers to open a checking or savings account, often done when starting a job or post-secondary education. This initial relationship with a financial institution can lead to other financial products and services like loans or investments. According to the FDIC's 2017 National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, 6.5% of households in the United States were unbanked, meaning they do not have a bank account. Additionally, 18.7% of households were underbanked, meaning they had a bank account but still used alternative financial services like check cashing and payday loans. Unbanked consumers, who make up 6.5% of US households, often choose not to open a bank account due to costs, lack of trust, or other barriers. They may use alternative financial services like check cashing, payday loans, and rent-to-own services. Immigrants may find the account verification process challenging, and trust in banks may be influenced by their country of origin. The availability of free or low-cost checking accounts has decreased, leading to high and unpredictable bank fees. The availability of free or low-cost checking accounts has decreased, leading to high and unpredictable bank fees. Some accounts require minimum balances to avoid maintenance fees, with common fees being overdraft and nonsufficient fund fees. Maintaining bank account minimums and avoiding overdrafts can be challenging for consumers living paycheck to paycheck, potentially leading to unaffordable fees and involuntary account closures. Depository institutions incur expenses to provide checking and savings accounts, recouping costs through various fees. Depository institutions make money from interest rate spreads and account fees. Some banks may initially lose money on checking and savings accounts to establish a relationship with clients for more profitable business later. Banks with a checking account relationship may offer more attractive loan terms. Lower-balance or less credit-worthy consumers may be less profitable for banks to serve. Bank fees are a way for banks to recoup costs from less credit-worthy consumers. Consumers with lower balances tend to incur more fees. Some communities lack nearby bank branches, despite the popularity of online banking. Branch offices remain important for many consumers. In the past decade, the number of bank branches in the US has decreased due to factors like consolidations and online banking. This has led to concerns about limited access to banking services in some communities, especially in lower-income areas. Unbanked households rely on nonbank financial services like check cashing and money orders. Unbanked consumers often use cash, money orders, and prepaid cards for transactions, while banked consumers prefer direct deposit and electronic payments. Alternative financial products can be cheaper and more convenient, offering quicker access to cash, especially for those with tight budgets. Nonbank stores have longer hours, providing accessibility to financial services. Nonbank stores offer longer hours and cater to local communities, providing convenience for working households. Alternative financial products like prepaid cards are popular among unbanked households, offering quick access to cash but may lack benefits of traditional bank accounts. Prepaid cards, like Visa and MasterCard, offer features similar to debit accounts, allowing bill payments, ATM cash withdrawals, and online purchases. However, they are not always federally insured and may have monthly maintenance fees. Nonbank innovations could provide more affordable financial products to unbanked consumers. Technology can reduce costs for credit-worthy consumers, such as internet-based mobile wallets for unbanked consumers. M-pesa, a non-bank mobile payment system, is popular in parts of Africa. New mobile products help with money management and savings. Concerns exist about data privacy and cybersecurity. Policymakers debate the need for new regulations to accommodate financial innovation. Emergency savings are crucial for financial stability. Having emergency savings is crucial for financial stability, as most households face unexpected financial shocks each year. Families with even a small amount of non-retirement savings are less likely to face eviction or miss payments. One barrier to building emergency savings is not having a separate savings account, especially for lower-income households in rural areas or belonging to ethnic minorities. Unbanked households, often ethnic minorities or working-age disabled, are less likely to save for emergencies compared to banked households. They tend to save at home or with family/friends, or use prepaid cards. Research shows saving through prepaid cards can help avoid high-cost credit. Access to affordable electronic payment services and a safe way to manage finances can benefit consumers. The government, private sector, and nonprofit sector can help increase access to financial products for underserved populations. Proposed changes to bank regulation, like updating the Community Reinvestment Act, aim to improve access to bank accounts for low- and moderate-income individuals. The Federal Reserve is considering expanding qualifying activities under the CRA in response to public feedback. The Federal Reserve is considering expanding the list of products eligible for CRA credits, including financial services for LMI consumers. Improvements in payment systems could benefit unbanked consumers who currently rely on alternative financial services. The Federal Reserve is working on initiatives to make bank payment systems faster, including introducing a real-time payment system called FedNow in 2023 or 2024. This could help consumers access funds quickly and avoid overdraft fees. Other proposals include the government providing accounts to retail customers through postal offices or online banking services through the Federal Reserve. Opposition to these proposals often focuses on the appropriate role of government in banking services. Some argue that the government should not compete with the private sector in providing bank accounts to consumers. Government bank accounts may not attract demand, as seen with the myRA program. Financial education programs could support financial inclusion. CFPB aims to increase consumer savings through initiatives and research projects with the financial industry. The \"Bank On\" movement, a coalition involving various government agencies, community organizations, and financial institutions, promotes opening bank accounts for unbanked consumers. These accounts have no overdraft fees, minimal monthly fees, federally insured deposits, and offer traditional banking services. Around 3 million accounts have been opened through this movement, mainly for new bank customers who actively use them. Congressional interest and legislative proposals, such as H.R. 4067 in the 116th Congress, focus on addressing the issue of unbanked individuals. The CFPB has introduced legislation to address unbanked and underbanked consumers, including reporting to Congress on the issue and proposing the creation of an office within the CFPB. Other proposals aim to develop short-term non-retirement savings accounts for consumers through automatic paycheck deductions or using tax refunds. The credit reporting industry focuses on consumers' past financial performance and repayment history, lacking information on income, assets, or alternative financial services. The credit reporting industry, led by major bureaus like Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, collects payment data to assess individuals' creditworthiness through numerical scores. This data influences consumer access to financial products, as lenders use it to make decisions on providing credit. Consumers without traditional credit history face challenges in accessing products like mortgages or credit cards. The credit reporting industry, dominated by major bureaus like Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, collects payment data to evaluate individuals' creditworthiness through numerical scores. This data affects consumer access to financial products, with some facing challenges due to limited credit histories. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) highlights that approximately 20% of the U.S. population cannot have credit scores generated for them. This includes groups like credit invisibles, who have no credit record at nationwide agencies, and unscorable consumers with insufficient or stale credit histories. Limited credit history is correlated with age, income, race, and ethnicity. Many credit invisible or unscorable consumers are young, with 40% under 25 years old. Those in lower-income neighborhoods or black/Hispanic individuals are also more likely to be credit invisible or unscorable. Most young adults transition into the credit reporting system in their early twenties, with 80% becoming credit visible before age 25 and 90% before age 30. Common ways for young consumers to become credit visible include credit cards, student loans, and piggybacking. Young adults in LMI neighborhoods tend to become credit visible at older ages than those in higher-income areas. Consumers over 25 in LMI neighborhoods have higher rates of credit invisibility in urban areas. The highest rates of credit invisibility for consumers over 25 are in rural areas, with little variation based on income. Credit invisible consumers in LMI and rural areas are less likely to enter the credit bureaus through credit cards, possibly due to less common piggybacking. Using student loans is also a way to become credit visible. Recent immigrants and individuals in LMI communities face challenges in establishing credit in the United States. Existing credit history from other countries does not transfer, and alternative forms of identification may not be accepted by financial services providers. Policymakers can address this issue by expanding uptake of financial products or including alternative data in the credit reporting system. Financial education and partnerships with nonprofit groups can help consumers understand credit reporting and build a credit history. Financial wellness programs at workplaces are a popular way to provide these services. However, providing financial education and counseling can be costly. There are tensions between expanding credit access and consumer protection, such as regulations limiting young consumers' access to credit cards. Stakeholders suggest that financial services providers should offer profitable entry-level credit products without compromising consumer protection. Secured credit cards, which require a security deposit, may not be as effective as unsecured cards in building credit visibility. Some believe the deposit poses a challenge for lower-income consumers. Developing safe and accessible credit-building products for unscorable consumers is a complex task. Alternative data, not traditionally used by credit agencies, can include nonfinancial information. The CFPB has sought input on this issue in the past. The CFPB has sought input on alternative data, such as telecommunications payments, rent, and social media information, to expand credit access for invisible or unscorable consumers. This data could improve credit scoring accuracy and visibility, potentially lowering credit costs. Using alternative data for credit reporting can increase access to credit for credit invisible individuals, but it may also harm existing credit scores if negative information is included. There are concerns about privacy, consumer protection, and fair lending risks associated with the use of alternative data. Regulatory compliance questions limit the adoption of alternative data in the credit reporting system, with the Fair Credit Reporting Act being the main statute regulating the industry. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates consumers' rights and permissible uses of credit reports, imposing responsibilities on data collectors. Alternative data providers may find FCRA requirements burdensome due to accuracy issues and managing disputes. Some organizations may be discouraged from furnishing alternative data, even though it could help consumers improve their credit scores. Many firms in the consumer data industry only use alternative data with consumer opt-in. Congressional interest and legislative proposals continue to focus on using alternative data for credit reporting. In the 116th Congress, legislative proposals focused on alternative data for credit reporting, including directing the CFPB to report on its impact. Small-dollar loans, with low principal amounts and short repayment periods, are offered by traditional financial institutions and alternative providers. Many U.S. consumers lack access to affordable small-dollar credit, leading to expensive options for them. Access to small-dollar credit is crucial for many consumers, especially those living paycheck to paycheck. While this type of credit can help households during emergencies, unsustainable debt can harm them. Concerns about the affordability of small-dollar loans and debt traps are often raised by consumer groups. Regulations are aimed at reducing costs and protecting borrowers from financial harm. Access to small-dollar credit is essential for many consumers, particularly those struggling financially. Regulations to lower borrower costs may inadvertently restrict credit availability for those in need. Policymakers aim to increase access to affordable credit to promote financial stability. Most U.S. households have access to traditional credit products like credit cards, mortgages, and loans, with credit cards being the primary source for small-dollar credit. Lenders typically require a credit score for loan approval, limiting access for some consumers. Access to small-dollar credit is crucial for many consumers, especially those facing financial difficulties. While most households have access to traditional credit products, around 20% lack access due to being unscorable or having poor credit history. This group is often unbanked, low-income, and minority households, with factors like age, education, disability, and citizenship status playing a role. An estimated 12.9% of households have unmet demand for bank small-dollar credit, with the majority being current on bills, indicating a need for accessible credit options. Policymakers face a trade-off between consumer protection and access to credit when regulating the banking sector. Laws limit profitability of small-dollar loans, making them expensive for banks to provide. Excluded consumers with poor credit history pose challenges for banks in underwriting loans. Regulatory restrictions also impact banks' permissible actions. Banks face regulatory restrictions on offering credit products to certain consumers, leading them to avoid providing certain services like direct deposit advances and subprime credit cards. Despite interest in small-dollar financial services, banks may encounter disincentives due to concerns from regulators and legislators. Deposit advance products, for example, were offered by some banks before 2013 but faced scrutiny for intensive consumer usage. In 2013, regulators advised banks to ensure deposit advance products complied with regulations due to concerns about consumer default risk. Many banks stopped offering deposit advances as a result. Additionally, policymakers have implemented policies to increase credit availability, particularly in LMI neighborhoods. The CRA encourages banks to meet the credit needs of consumers in the areas they serve. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) applies to individuals with established bank relationships, excluding unbanked consumers. Small-dollar loan products may not qualify, and the CRA does not incentivize banks to engage in unprofitable activities. Credit alternative financial products, like payday loans, are used by 6.9% of American households, often by lower-income, younger, and minority populations. Critics argue these products are expensive and can lead to debt traps. Credit alternative financial products, like payday loans, are used by 6.9% of American households, often by lower-income, younger, and minority populations. These products may be more likely to lead to debt traps compared to bank small-dollar credit. New technology, such as nonbank digital or mobile-based financial products, may help expand access to affordable credit for underserved consumers. Some lenders are exploring alternative lending models, like employer-based lending, to reduce default risk and increase access to credit. Some lenders use alternative data for credit decisions, potentially expanding credit access and lowering costs for consumers. Alternative data like education, employment, and cash-flow information show promise in increasing access to credit without increasing disparities based on race, ethnicity, gender, or age. Upstart Network's credit model, for example, has shown positive results in approving more consumers for credit and reducing average credit costs. Some new lenders, known as marketplace or fintech lenders, rely on online platforms and alternative data for loan underwriting. Fintech lending has grown rapidly, with personal loans totaling $17.7 billion in 2017, up from $2.5 billion in 2013. Incumbent lenders have also adopted some of these technologies and practices. New technology in small-dollar lending markets, including online platforms and algorithmic platforms, create risks for consumers such as data security risks and potential disparate impacts. Policymakers are exploring ways to make affordable and safe credit more accessible, including potential changes to bank regulation to increase access to credit for underserved consumers. The Federal Reserve is considering expanding CRA-eligible products and services, such as payday loan alternatives, for LMI consumers. Bank regulators need to balance new CRA criteria with federal prudential regulations. Financial regulators are encouraging banks to re-enter the small-dollar lending market by reducing regulatory barriers. The OCC and FDIC are encouraging banks to re-enter the small-dollar lending market. Questions remain about compliance with fair lending regulations and the use of new technology in consumer lending. The CFPB has outlined principles for consumer-authorized financial data sharing. The CFPB outlined principles for consumer-authorized financial data sharing in response to a request, including consumer access, control, and data security. The GAO recommended regulatory clarification for fintech lenders and banks working with them. Some suggest the government provide small-dollar loans directly to consumers if the private sector fails to serve them. Opponents of the government providing consumer loans argue that the private sector is better equipped to manage credit risks. Access to bank accounts, credit reporting, and affordable small-dollar credit is crucial for households to improve financial well-being. In the US, consumer credit markets allow most consumers to access financial services, but some still rely on family or community connections for financial needs. Consumers currently rely on family or community connections for their first bank account and credit history. Financial inclusion is crucial for well-being, and new financial products can lower costs and expand access. Laws and regulations may need updating to address technological advancements. Policymakers may consider policy changes to increase affordable access to financial products. Disagreements persist on the role of government programs in supporting financial services. The debate revolves around whether government intervention hinders or helps the private sector in providing financial services to underserved consumers."
