The Congress finds that the region including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio was once the Northwest Territory, with indigenous peoples like the Delaware, Shawnee, and Wyandotte Indians. The landscape was shaped by the Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established self-government in the frontier region, while the Treaty of Greeneville of 1795 ended Indian resistance. The local landscape was defined by various river systems. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established self-government in the frontier region, while the Treaty of Greeneville of 1795 ended Indian resistance. The local landscape was defined by various river systems, including the Joseph River, St. Mary's River, and Wabash River in Indiana; Detroit River, St. Mary's River, and St. Joseph River in Michigan; and Great Miami River, Maumee River, and St. Mary's River in Ohio. Additionally, the Great Lakes and River Portage Trails, such as the 3 mile portage from St. Joseph River to Little Wabash River in Fort Wayne, played significant roles in connecting the upper Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. The military history of the Northwest region includes LaBalme's Defeat in 1780 and the defeat of General Harmar in 1790. It also encompasses the development of 13 forts, such as Fort Dearborn in Chicago, Fort Wayne in Indiana, Fort Mackinac in Michigan, and Fort Defiance in Ohio, as well as settlements like Native American villages, trading posts, and territorial capitals. The military history of the Northwest region includes the defeat of General Harmar in 1790, General St. Clair in 1791, General Wayne's victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, and the Battle of Lake Erie in 1832. Tecumseh and \"The Prophet\" organized a confederacy of Indian Nations to stop American advancement, leading to General Harrison's victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. The War of 1812 was saved from potential loss to Canada by Commodore Perry's victory at Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie. The rush of settlers to the Northwest region after the War of 1812 led to treaties and conflicts with Native Americans, resulting in their removal by 1833. The Act aims to conserve and interpret the historical, cultural, and natural resources of the Northwest Territory from 1785 to 1835.
