    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"E911 Surcharge Fairness Act of 2011\". The Wireless E911 system was established by Congress to provide emergency communications for mobile users. Funding methods should be fair and neutral among all providers. Prepaid wireless services are becoming more popular, requiring new funding models for E911. Prepaid mobile services are purchased on a pay-as-you-go basis with no bills. States lack a uniform approach to collecting E911 surcharges from prepaid customers, leading to unfair treatment and reduced funding. Postpaid providers simply add the E911 charge to monthly bills. Prepaid mobile service providers are exempt from collecting E911 charges from customers, unlike postpaid providers. There is a need for a uniform collection method for prepaid customers to contribute to E911 funds, as encouraged by Congress. E911 surcharges are required for prepaid mobile service providers to contribute to E911 funds. Beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, no State or local jurisdiction can impose new unfair E911 fees on prepaid mobile services. The term \"E911 fee\" refers to any fee designated for 911 communication systems. The term \"prepaid mobile service\" refers to mobile service paid for in advance without monthly bills, while \"postpaid mobile service\" is paid for after use with periodic billing arrangements. The term \"unfair or inequitable E911 fee\" refers to fees that cannot be collected from end-users who are supposed to pay them under the existing prepaid mobile service provider model, or fees enforced in a way that holds the provider strictly liable for not collecting them. The term \"unfair or inequitable manner\" means imposing E911 fees on prepaid mobile service providers that they cannot collect from their end-user customers who are supposed to pay the fees. The term \"provider\" refers to a telecommunications carrier offering mobile service. It includes scenarios where E911 fees cannot be collected from prepaid mobile service customers as intended, leading to strict liability for the provider. Additionally, it covers cases where E911 fees are subject to other taxes not equally imposed on postpaid mobile service customers."
