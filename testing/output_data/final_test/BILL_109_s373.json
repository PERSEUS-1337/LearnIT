    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Renewable Hydrogen Passenger Vehicle Act of 2005\". This Act establishes a Renewable Hydrogen Transportation Demonstration Program. Congress finds that reductions in local air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil imports from hybrid vehicles with gasoline-powered engines will be temporary due to increased vehicle miles traveled. Substituting farm-based renewable fuels for gasoline in these vehicles can further reduce pollution and imports. To achieve permanent reductions, Congress should establish renewable hydrogen development as a national goal. The development of vehicles powered by hydrogen from renewable resources will reduce air pollution, improve energy security, and create jobs. However, current fuel cell technology is costly and unreliable for consumer acceptance in the near term. In the near term, hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles can achieve most environmental and oil import reduction benefits of fuel cell vehicles. Research and development for fuel cell vehicles should be accompanied by a program for renewable hydrogen production. Reforming ethanol at fueling stations may be a cost-effective way to produce renewable hydrogen. A low-cost renewable hydrogen vehicle demonstration program can provide valuable insights for an interim transition strategy. The interim transition strategy involves using hydrogen-powered internal combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles to pave the way for fuel cell vehicles once they become affordable and reliable. This strategy can be implemented in 1 year and aims to accelerate the adoption of renewable hydrogen as an alternative to gasoline made from imported crude oil. Additionally, a demonstration program is proposed to stimulate the development of hydrogen fueling systems at existing gasoline stations. The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with the Secretary, will conduct a 3-year program to develop and demonstrate the cost-effective operation of at least 10 direct hydrogen passenger vehicles using ethanol or other renewable feedstocks. Goals include converting ethanol to pure hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles at local fueling stations. The program aims to develop and demonstrate the cost-effective operation of at least 10 direct hydrogen passenger vehicles using ethanol or other renewable feedstocks. This includes converting ethanol to pure hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles at local fueling stations, installing ethanol reformers or other renewable feedstock reformers at fleet operator facilities, and converting internal combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles to operate on hydrogen. The program involves operating 10 hydrogen internal combustion engine hybrid electric vehicles for 2 years and collecting emissions and fuel economy data under various conditions. $5,000,000 is authorized for this subsection."
