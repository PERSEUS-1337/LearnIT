The \"Startup Innovation Credit Act of 2012\" allows qualified small businesses to treat the payroll tax credit portion of the credit determined under subsection (a) as a credit allowed under section 3111(f) if it does not exceed $250,000. A business is defined as a corporation, partnership, or S corporation with gross receipts less than $5,000,000 for the taxable year and no gross receipts in the preceding 5-taxable-year period. It also includes any person meeting the criteria of subparagraph (A). The term \"business\" is defined as a corporation, partnership, or S corporation with gross receipts less than $5,000,000 for the taxable year and no gross receipts in the preceding 5-taxable-year period. It also includes any person meeting the criteria of subparagraph (A). The term does not include an organization exempt from taxation under section 501. An election under this subsection for a partnership or S corporation must be made at the entity level. An election under this subsection must be made at the entity level and cannot be revoked without the Secretary's consent. A taxpayer cannot make this election if they have done so for 5 or more preceding taxable years. Aggregation rules apply for determining limitations and gross receipts, treating all members of the same controlled group of corporations or persons under common control as one entity. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subsection, including preventing avoidance of rules, minimizing compliance burdens for start-up companies, and recapturing credits in case of adjustments. The subsection (a) requires amended returns for adjustments, and a conforming amendment is made to Section 280C(c) regarding the treatment of qualified small business credit. Additionally, a new credit for research expenditures of qualified small businesses is introduced against FICA taxes in subsection (b). The tax code allows a credit against wages for qualified small businesses that have made an election under section 41(i). The credit is equal to the payroll tax credit portion of the research credit determined under section 41(a). Unused credits can be carried over to the next calendar quarter. The tax code allows a credit against wages for qualified small businesses that have made an election under section 41(i). The credit is reduced by the amount allowed for preceding calendar quarters. Controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer for credit allocation. Definitions are provided for this subsection. The tax code provides definitions for the term \"applicable calendar quarter\" for qualified small businesses claiming a payroll tax credit portion of the research credit under section 41(a). The first applicable calendar quarter is the quarter following the filing of a return under section 6012 for the taxable year. The tax code defines terms for qualified small businesses claiming a payroll tax credit portion of the research credit. Amounts are appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to offset revenue reductions. Transfers are made from the general fund to replicate the transfers that would have occurred without the amendments. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
