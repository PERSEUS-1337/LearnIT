    "content": "The \"Medicare Information Act of 2011\" is cited as the short title. A new section is added to provide annual Medicare beneficiary Part A contributions and benefits statements. The \"Medicare Information Act of 2011\" adds a new section requiring the Secretary to provide an annual Medicare Part A information statement to eligible individuals. This statement will be coordinated with social security account statements to avoid duplication. The Secretary will coordinate with the Commissioner of Social Security to include the annual Medicare Part A information statement with social security account statements. The methodology for estimating lifetime contributions and benefits will be specified in consultation with relevant authorities. The methodology for computing an individual's lifespan for the social security account statement will also be used for the annual Medicare Part A information statement. This statement will include a summary of the Medicare Part A program, benefits, and enrollment options under parts B, C, and D of title XVIII. The annual Medicare Part A information statement for eligible individuals will include details on total contributions, projected lifetime contributions, and breakdown of contributions by employer, employee, and self-employment. This information is in addition to the summary of the Medicare Part A program, benefits, and enrollment options under parts B, C, and D of title XVIII. The Medicare Part A information statement for eligible individuals will include total contributions from employer, employee, and self-employment, details on benefits received, and an estimate of lifetime benefits. The Secretary will retain information indefinitely for eligible individuals with a social security number, aged 25 or over, and entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A or have had contributions made on their behalf. The amendment includes individuals eligible for Medicare Part A who receive an annual statement, expanding the definition of eligible individuals under the Act."
