LIRR police officers are excluded from the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, and related taxes, clarifying their tax treatment. No amount is taxable for covered LIRR police officers or beneficiaries due to transfers or payments to the N.Y. System from LIRR pension plans, in relation to canceling rights under the Additional Plan. There is a limitation on the total transfers and payments to not exceed the necessary funding for the officer under the N.Y. System. For covered LIRR police officers, transfers or payments to the N.Y. System from LIRR pension plans are not taxable. The total transfers and payments should not exceed the necessary funding for the officer under the N.Y. System, as outlined in the controlling agreement. The agreement between the LIRR and The Long Island Rail Road Company Police Benevolent Association, along with the Additional Plan for Additional Pensions, was made to implement Article XXXVI of the collective bargaining agreement. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms such as \"covered LIRR police officer\" as an LIRR police officer eligible for benefits, \"LIRR\" as The Long Island Rail Road Company, and \"LIRR police officer\" as individuals appointed or expected to be appointed as police officers in the LIRR police department. The term \"N.Y. System\" refers to the New York State and local Police and Fire retirement system. The Act will take effect once the LIRR elects to participate in the N.Y. System, which is the New York State and local Police and Fire retirement system."
