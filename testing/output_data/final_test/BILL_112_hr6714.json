    "content": "The Act is named the \"Cainaan Putuga Wendt Shock of Life Act\" and aims to address the high rate of sudden cardiac arrest deaths, especially among young people. Congress acknowledges the alarming statistics, including the fact that 95% of victims do not survive until reaching a hospital. Additionally, it highlights that around 2,000 individuals under 25 years old die from sudden cardiac arrest annually in the United States, with one high school student succumbing to cardiac arrest every three days. The Act includes a grant program for automated external defibrillators. The \"Cainaan Putuga Wendt Shock of Life Act\" establishes a grant program for local educational agencies to purchase automated external defibrillators for eligible schools and provide training to meet requirements. Eligibility for the grant requires submission of an application to the Secretary of Education. The Act requires grant recipients to provide funds from non-Federal sources, fulfill specific requirements, and allows for waivers under certain conditions for local educational agencies. Eligible schools may be required to contribute funds, and waivers can be granted based on poverty levels. The Act mandates that eligible schools must have at least 5 individuals certified in using automated external defibrillators and CPR, who are employees or volunteers aged 18 or older. Training can be conducted by recognized organizations like the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross. The eligible school must ensure the availability of individuals certified in using automated external defibrillators and CPR, notify local emergency services about defibrillator locations on school grounds, and integrate defibrillators into the school's emergency response plan. Priority for grants under this Act is given to local educational agencies with eligible schools lacking automated external defibrillators, having a significant presence of individuals on school grounds daily, and experiencing longer emergency medical service response times compared to other public facilities in the community. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"eligible school\" as any secondary school under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"local educational agency\" as defined in the same Act. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2019 to implement this Act."
