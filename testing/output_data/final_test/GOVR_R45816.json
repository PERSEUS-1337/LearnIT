    "content": "The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense and defense-related programs. It establishes defense policies, restrictions, and addresses administrative matters. The bill covers military compensation, acquisition processes, and DOD policy towards other countries. It does not provide budget authority but serves as a congressional sentiment indicator for defense funding. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) historically serves as a reliable indicator of congressional sentiment on funding for specific programs within the Department of Defense (DOD). It authorizes funding for DOD activities in line with corresponding defense and military construction appropriations bills, with defense authorizations often seen as funding targets. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that an authorization act directs Congress on funding levels, which can be adjusted in subsequent appropriation acts. Committee reports accompanying the NDAA may include directives for DOD officials, although not legally binding, are generally viewed as congressional mandates. The FY2019 NDAA, while not legally binding, is considered a congressional mandate by agency officials. The Trump Administration requested $708.1 billion for programs under the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The House passed H.R. 5515, authorizing $639.1 billion for the base budget, slightly less than the President's request. The Senate passed its version of H.R. 5515, authorizing $707.9 billion for the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act. This included $639.4 billion for the base budget and $68.5 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations, slightly less than the President's request. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $707.9 billion, including $639.4 billion for the base budget and $68.5 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The bill was signed into law by President Donald J. Trump on August 13, 2018 (P.L. 115-232). The FY2019 NDAA authorized $708.1 billion for national defense programs, including adjustments to DOD appropriation titles. This included $132.3 billion for procurement, $91.7 billion for RDT&E, and $198.5 billion for operations. The FY2019 NDAA authorized $708.1 billion for national defense programs, with adjustments to DOD appropriation titles. This included $198.5 billion for operations, $147.1 billion for military personnel, and $10.3 billion for military construction and family housing. The budget reflects ongoing debates about defense spending and aligning priorities with the 2018 National Defense Strategy. The Trump Administration released its National Security Strategy in alignment with the 2018 National Defense Strategy and budget constraints set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The strategy emphasizes the need to address great power rivalry, enhance domestic security, boost economic competitiveness, and rebuild the military to advance U.S. interests effectively. The 2018 National Defense Strategy emphasizes the need to rebuild the military to address great power rivalry and potential technological superiority from China and Russia. The strategy aims to advance U.S. interests effectively by countering external threats outlined in the White House's National Security Strategy. The 2018 National Defense Strategy identifies China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as key external threats to U.S. interests. It prioritizes maintaining a strategic edge over China and Russia, emphasizing the need for increased investment to counter evolving threats from these countries. The strategy acknowledges the shift towards operating in contested domains where freedom of access is no longer guaranteed. The National Defense Strategy focuses on rebuilding military readiness, strengthening alliances, and reforming business practices to address threats from China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups. General Dunford recommended a 3-5% increase in the defense budget to maintain a competitive advantage. Congressional action on the FY2019 NDAA was crucial for national security and prosperity. Congressional action on the FY2019 NDAA was influenced by the need to control federal spending amidst rising debt. The Budget Control Act focused on limiting discretionary spending, including defense. However, mandatory spending, which makes up the largest share of federal spending, is projected to increase at a faster rate than discretionary spending. OMB estimated significant increases in outlays for defense and non-defense discretionary programs since 9/11, as well as for mandatory programs. The Congressional Budget Office projected a significant increase in mandatory spending and net interest payments on the national debt. President Trump's FY2019 budget request included $726.8 billion for national defense, the largest discretionary spending category. The national defense budget request for FY2019 was $726.8 billion, with $716 billion in discretionary budget authority and $10.8 billion in mandatory budget authority. Approximately $708.1 billion was subject to authorization by the National Defense Authorization Act, with the remainder for mandatory funds or discretionary funds under other congressional committees. The Trump Administration's revised request included $639.1 billion in discretionary funding. The Administration's revised request for FY2019 included $639.1 billion in discretionary funding for the base budget, with an additional $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. This request was in line with spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The total defense spending cap for FY2019 was $647 billion, excluding OCO programs. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce federal budget deficits by $2.1 trillion from FY2012 through FY2021, with half of the savings from defense. Spending limits apply separately to defense and nondefense discretionary budget authority, enforced by sequestration. Certain discretionary spending, like Overseas Contingency Operations, is exempt from the limits. The Trump Administration's initial request for the Department of Defense budget included $597.1 billion for the base budget and $89 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Congress amended the budget to shift $20 billion from OCO to the base budget, addressing long-standing budget issues. The Trump Administration's amended request fixed budget gimmicks by shifting certain costs from OCO to the base budget. The request included an increase in active-duty and reserve component end-strength. The House version of the bill supported the request, while the Senate amendment authorized fewer personnel. The final act authorized the requested end-strength. Title 37, Section 1009 of the United States Code provides for an automatic annual increase in basic pay for military personnel, indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The FY2019 budget proposed a 2.6% pay raise, which was ultimately enacted without any changes. The Defense Officer Personnel Management Act was also modified under Title V of the act. The act modified key provisions of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act, allowing civilians with relevant training to enter the military up to the rank of O-6. It also created an alternative promotion process for officers in specialized fields. The Administration requested $11.4 billion for DOD military construction projects, with less funding authorized for some projects. The MIT-Lincoln Laboratory, West Lab Compound Semiconductor Laboratory and Microsystem Integration Facility at Hanscom Air Force Base, MA, received $120 million less than requested. $181 million was allocated for Phase 1, Increment 2 of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency complex in St. Louis, MO, which was $33 million less than requested. Additionally, $140 million was designated for Phase 2 of the long-range discriminating radar system complex at Clear Air Force Station, AK, which was $44 million less than requested. The act also authorized $30.4 million for flight line support facilities and $40 million for a personnel deployment processing facility at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar. The NDAA does not authorize the $69 million requested for a detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Congress has been active in legislating acquisition reform over the last four years, with an average of 80 provisions related to acquisition reform in recent years. Examples of recent provisions include changes to the role of the Chiefs of the Military Services. Provisions in recent NDAA bills include changes to the role of the Chiefs of the Military Services, splitting the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, strengthening the role of military departments in acquisitions, increasing the simplified acquisition threshold, and creating or expanding rapid acquisition authorities. The FY2019 NDAA includes provisions for defense acquisition reform, such as consolidating statutes, increasing the micro-purchase threshold, and studying bid protest frequency and effects. The FY2019 NDAA includes provisions for defense acquisition reform, such as studying bid protest frequency and effects, splitting the Title 41 definition of commercial item, and limiting the government-wide use of lowest price technically acceptable source selection criteria. It authorizes $6.3 billion in OCO funding for the European Deterrence Initiative and $250 million for Ukraine security assistance, including $50 million for lethal assistance. $50 million was authorized for \"lethal assistance,\" including anti-armor weapon systems, mortars, crew-served weapons and ammunition, grenade launchers and ammunition, small arms and ammunition; as well as counter-artillery radars. Most of the funding is intended for prepositioning equipment in Europe and boosting U.S. forces' regional presence. The act also authorizes $1.4 billion in OCO funding for activities to counter ISIS by training and equipping Iraqi Security Forces and vetted Syrian opposition forces. The National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions to limit foreign access to sensitive U.S. technology, particularly by Chinese firms, to address national security concerns. This includes expanding the purview of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) through the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA). The Export Controls Act of 2018 expands controls on exporting dual-use civilian and military items, including establishing an interagency process to identify emerging technologies. Section 889 prohibits federal agencies from procuring telecommunications equipment from Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE. Huawei has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. over this provision. Another provision (Section 1091) prohibits the Department of Defense from obligating funds. The Export Controls Act of 2018 expands controls on exporting dual-use civilian and military items, including identifying emerging technologies. Section 1091 prohibits the Department of Defense from using funds for Chinese language instruction from Confucius Institutes and supporting Chinese language programs at institutions hosting Confucius Institutes. Upgrading the nuclear triad is a top priority for DOD, as stated in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. The Department of Defense emphasized the importance of the nuclear triad for ensuring nuclear deterrence, highlighting the need for programs like the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, B-21 long-range strike bomber, and Long-Range Standoff cruise missile. These programs would be fully funded if the FY2019 budget requests were met. The Navy's top priority program is the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine to replace the Ohio-class SSBNs. The FY2019 budget includes funding for the Columbia-class program, refurbishment of Trident II missiles, and development of the B-21 long-range bomber. The budget also supports increased research and development for these efforts. The acquisition priorities for the new bomber include the development of the Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO) and the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) to replace aging weapons systems. The budget request supports the President's request for the B-21 bomber and authorizes increased funding for these programs. The budget request includes funding for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent and the W76-2 warhead modification program, aimed at creating lower-yield nuclear options. The United States has a history of developing ballistic missile defenses since the late 1940s, with significant funding allocated by Congress for this purpose. The United States has a history of developing ballistic missile defenses with significant funding allocated by Congress. Lawmakers have appropriated over $200 billion for research, development, and deployment of BMD systems. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request included $12.9 billion for defense against ballistic missiles, with $9.9 billion allocated to the Missile Defense Agency. The request also included approximately $2.6 billion for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system. The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system requested approximately $2.6 billion for improvements and expansion. It currently has 44 interceptor missiles at two sites, with plans to add 20 more at Fort Greely. The system is designed to destroy intercontinental ballistic missiles launched towards the U.S. from countries like North Korea. Funding was also requested for additional interceptors, silos, and the development of a new warhead called the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV). The House and Senate supported the request for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, including funding for the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV) to replace the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV). A provision requires a successful flight intercept test of the RKV before production, along with a report on accelerating the fielding of 20 interceptors with RKVs at Fort Greely. The budget request also included funding for Terminal High-Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) interceptors to intercept ballistic missiles. The House and Senate supported the Administration's request for funding for the THAAD and Patriot missile defense systems. The THAAD system has performed well in testing but has not been used in combat. The Patriot system, which has been used in combat with mixed results, is designed to defend military bases and airfields. Patriot works in conjunction with THAAD to provide integrated defense against incoming missiles. The act supports the Administration's request for an integrated defense against incoming missiles in their final phase of flight. It includes a provision requiring a report on the survivability of air defense artillery and funding for National Security Space acquisition programs. The FY2019 budget request for military space programs includes funding for NSS acquisition programs, specifically $2 billion for satellite launchers and developing a replacement for the Russian-made rocket engine. The act designates the EELV program as the National Security Space Launch program and requires consideration of reusable launch vehicles in future solicitations.

The budget request includes $842 million for Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) projects, focusing on secure and survivable communications. Funding supports the fifth and sixth AEHF satellites and programs to enhance operational resiliency. The act includes a provision for the Secretary of Defense to report on the evolved strategic satellite program. The act includes a provision for the Secretary of Defense to report on the evolved strategic satellite program, PTS, and PTES to meet the Department of Defense's requirements for resilience, mission assurance, and nuclear command, control, and communication missions. It also establishes U.S. Space Command as a subordinate unified command under U.S. Strategic Command for joint space warfighting operations, with the commander responsible for ensuring combat readiness and monitoring preparedness of space forces. The Administration's FY2019 budget request included funding for modernizing ground forces' armored combat vehicles like the M-1 Abrams tank, M-2 Bradley IFV, and Stryker combat vehicle, with newer capabilities for mobile defense and improved firepower and mobility for infantry units. The budget authorized approximately $2.7 billion to upgrade the Army's fleet of M-1 Abrams tanks with new armor, electronics, and weapons stations, as well as equipping three brigades with the Trophy active protection system. The Trophy active protection system (APS) is designed to automatically acquire, track, and respond to various threats, including RPGs and ATGMs. Additional funds are authorized to upgrade Stryker vehicles with a V-shaped bottom for better protection against explosives, and to replace the chassis of the M-109 Paladin with that of the Bradley troop carrier. The National Defense Authorization Act authorizes funds for the Army's combat vehicle fleet, including $875 million for Bradley modernization, $244 million for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV), and $797 million for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV). It also requires the development of a strategy for competitively procuring a new transmission for the Bradley fighting vehicle. The Administration requested $449 million for developing and purchasing vehicles to enhance Army Infantry Brigade Combat Teams. The funds were mainly for a lightweight tank called Mobile Protected Firepower (MPF) and for off-road vehicles for reconnaissance and troop transport. The act authorizes $370 million for the programs, with a reduction due to a decrease in Mobile Protected Firepower. A provision requires a report on active protection systems for armored combat and tactical vehicles. The Administration requested $504 million for programs to enhance mobile Army defense against aircraft, including unmanned aerial systems and cruise missiles. This includes equipping a Stryker combat vehicle to launch Stinger missiles and a larger, truck-mounted missile launcher.
