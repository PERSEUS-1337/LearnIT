    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research Act of 2001\" is cited as the short title. The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic, and incurable lung disorder with a poor survival rate. Around 300 new cases are diagnosed in the US each year, with the majority occurring in women aged 21 to 40. PPH can affect men and women of all ages and ethnicities. It is challenging to study due to its low prevalence and lack of a good animal model. In some cases, PPH is familial. In advanced stages, patients have limited activity and symptoms even at rest, potentially leading to complete bedriddenness. Diagnosis is often missed in routine medical exams. In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH-patient registry, which followed 194 people with PPH for up to 7.5 years. Research is focused on understanding the cause and progression of PPH, including immunologic and genetic factors, agents causing narrowing of pulmonary blood vessels, and factors leading to smooth muscle growth and scar tissue formation in vessel walls. Almost 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs from January 1996 to December 1997, leading to pulmonary hypertension (PPH) in some cases. SPH, where the cause is known, can be due to conditions like emphysema, bronchitis, or collagen vascular diseases. Other causes include congenital heart defects causing extra blood flow through the lungs. Many more cases of PPH from diet drugs are expected to be diagnosed in the future. Certain risk factors for pulmonary hypertension include ventricular and atrial septal defects, chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, and liver disease. The text chunk discusses the expansion, intensification, and coordination of activities of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute regarding research on pulmonary hypertension. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will expand and coordinate research activities on pulmonary hypertension, collaborating with other national research institutes and agencies. Grants and contracts will be provided to public or nonprofit entities for this purpose. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will collaborate with other research institutes to develop and operate centers for pulmonary hypertension research, training, and education programs. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute collaborates with other research institutes to establish centers for pulmonary hypertension research, training, and education programs. These centers conduct programs for public information dissemination and provide stipends for scientists and health professionals. The Director coordinates information among centers, ensures regular communication, and may require reports on center activities. Each center operates within a single institution. The Director may establish not less than three centers for pulmonary hypertension research, with support lasting up to 5 years and potentially extended for additional periods. The centers must operate within a single institution or consortium and meet specified requirements. The Director of the Institute will establish a data system and clearinghouse for pulmonary hypertension research, including data collection, storage, analysis, and dissemination to identify individuals at risk. Public input will be solicited for the program. The Director of the Institute will provide information on National Institutes of Health programs for primary hypertension and receive public comments. Biennial reports on activities will be prepared, and up to $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002-2006."
