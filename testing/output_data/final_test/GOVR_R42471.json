    "content": "Indian gaming has become a significant industry, with 237 out of 565 federally recognized tribes operating 422 gaming enterprises that generated $25.6 billion in revenues in 2010. It accounts for 25% of the total revenues in the legal gaming industry and is the fastest-growing segment. Indian gaming initially started with high-stakes bingo in the 1980s as tribes sought alternative funding due to cuts in federal funds. Despite legal uncertainties and state opposition, tribal gaming continued to expand. In 1987, the Supreme Court ruled in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians that Indian tribes could conduct gaming on tribal land without state interference. This decision led to the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), which established regulations for Indian gaming and divided authority between tribes, states, and the federal government. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) was passed in response to a Supreme Court ruling allowing tribes to conduct gaming on tribal land. IGRA created the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) to regulate tribal gaming at the federal level. It divides Indian gaming into three classes: class I, class II, and class III, each subject to different regulations and approvals. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) created the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) to regulate tribal gaming. IGRA divides Indian gaming into three classes: class I, class II, and class III. Class III gaming requires a tribal-state compact negotiated in \"good faith,\" with tribes able to sue states in federal court for bad faith. In Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot waive states' sovereign immunity for tribes to enforce class III gaming compacts. This shifted power to states, leading to demands for revenue sharing and unrelated concessions from tribes. Congress is now focusing on off-reservation gaming with proposed amendments to IGRA. In the 1980s, federal agencies supported tribes in developing gaming operations to raise funds for their governments. Tribal bingo operations violated federal laws, making it a federal crime to conduct gaming in Indian country if it would violate state law. The Johnson Act prohibited gaming devices in Indian country. Despite federal officials not shutting down tribal bingo, operations were at risk of closure if federal enforcement changed. In 1987, the Supreme Court considered whether states could enforce state gaming laws against tribal gaming operations on tribal land. The Cabazon and Morongo Bands of Mission Indians conducted bingo and card club games on their reservations, which were open to the public and a major source of income and employment for tribal members. The state sought to enforce Section 326.5 of the California penal code, which permits bingo under certain conditions. The Supreme Court ruled that states and counties do not have authority over tribal bingo and card games on reservations, as tribal sovereignty is subordinate only to the Federal Government. California and the county argued for their authority under Public Law 280, but the Court held that state laws can only be applied to tribes if Congress expressly allows it. The Supreme Court ruled that under Public Law 280, states like California have jurisdiction over Indian country for criminal and civil matters. However, the Court clarified that the applicability of state laws depends on whether they are prohibitory or regulatory, based on the state's public policy. California's gaming laws were deemed regulatory, not criminal, as the state allows various forms of gambling. The Supreme Court determined that California's gambling laws are regulatory, not prohibitory, as the state permits and promotes gambling activities. Therefore, California does not have the authority to enforce its gambling laws on Indian reservations under Public Law 280. The Court rejected the state's argument that they could enforce state law on reservations, stating that there is no basis for California to make arrests on reservations and enforce its gambling laws against Indian tribes. The Supreme Court ruled that California cannot enforce its gambling laws on Indian reservations under Public Law 280, as the state's laws are regulatory, not prohibitory. The Court emphasized that state authority is pre-empted by federal law in cases involving state burdens on tribal Indians in their dealings with non-Indians. The Supreme Court ruled that state jurisdiction is pre-empted if it interferes with federal and tribal interests, unless state interests justify state authority. The inquiry considers Indian sovereignty, congressional goals of self-government, self-sufficiency, and economic development. Federal goals of tribal self-sufficiency and economic development were deemed important, supported by executive branch policies and actions. The Supreme Court ruled that federal policies actively promoted tribal bingo enterprises, crucial for tribal self-sufficiency and economic development, despite state and county attempts to downplay tribal interests. In Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation, the Supreme Court allowed the State to tax cigarettes sold by tribal smokeshops to non-Indians, despite the impact on tribal revenues and competitive advantage. The Court emphasized that tribes cannot market an exemption from state taxation to individuals who would typically shop elsewhere. The distinction was made between revenue from gaming and revenue from cigarette sales based on the value generated by the tribes in the products or services sold. The Tribes have modern facilities providing recreational opportunities and services, aiming to increase attendance by offering well-run games. The Court distinguished bingo enterprises from smokeshops based on the tribes' investment and customer attraction beyond just gaming. The state and county argued that their laws could be applied to tribal gaming, citing the Court's opinion in Rice v. Rehner. The Court's decision in Rice was based on the difference in federal policies regarding tribal and state authority over liquor and gaming on Indian reservations. The States have concurrent authority to regulate liquor on Indian reservations, but federal policy promotes Indian gaming free from state regulation. California's attempt to prevent organized crime in tribal bingo was deemed insufficient to override federal and tribal interests. The Court ruled that California's attempt to regulate tribal bingo operations to prevent organized crime was not justified, as federal and tribal interests supported tribal gaming. Three Justices dissented, arguing that Congress, not just the executive branch, must exempt Indian gaming from state law. The dissent disagreed with the majority's decision on tribal bingo operations, stating that recent court decisions have shown that commercial transactions on reservations are not immune from state regulation. The majority distinguished this case from a previous ruling on alcohol sales on reservations, arguing that Congress never recognized tribal sovereignty over alcohol. The dissent disagreed with the majority's decision on tribal bingo operations, arguing that recent court decisions have shown that commercial transactions on reservations are not immune from state regulation. The dissent also rejected the majority's interpretation of tribal sovereignty over alcohol on Indian reservations, stating that Congress never recognized tribal sovereignty over alcohol and that states would have concurrent jurisdiction over alcohol on Indian reservations. The dissent disagreed with the majority's decision on tribal bingo operations, arguing that recent court decisions have shown that commercial transactions on reservations are not immune from state regulation. The dissent believed that even if Public Law 280 did not authorize the state to apply its gaming laws to the tribes' bingo operations, the state had authority to apply the gaming laws under Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation. The majority seemed to accept the argument that the revenue from gaming was necessary for the tribes to realize the policy goals of self-determination and economic. The dissent disagreed with the majority's decision on tribal bingo operations, stating that the tribes' exemption from state gambling laws was the main attraction for customers. The state argued that its interests in generating revenue for public fisc and charities outweighed the benefits of allowing tribal bingo. This drained funds from state-approved recipients of lottery revenues, similar to tax-free cigarette sales. The dissent disagreed with the majority's decision on tribal bingo operations, stating that the state's concerns about criminal activity were dismissed too readily. The dissent emphasized that the decision to allow or regulate commercial gambling ventures should be made by Congress, considering the substantial public policy concerns of a sovereign State. The decision on tribal bingo operations should be made by Congress, not the Court or non-Indian entrepreneurs. Indian gaming escaped state regulation due to executive branch support for tribal self-determination. If the executive branch stops supporting Indian gaming, states could enforce their laws. IGRA was enacted to secure tribes' ability to engage in gaming free from state regulation, promoting economic self-sufficiency and strong tribal governments. Congress aimed to regulate Indian gaming to prevent criminal infiltration, with IGRA being the culmination of four years of legislative efforts following the Cabazon decision. IGRA was enacted to secure tribes' ability to engage in gaming free from state regulation, promoting economic self-sufficiency and strong tribal governments. Congress aimed to regulate Indian gaming to prevent criminal infiltration, with IGRA being the culmination of congressional efforts focused by the Court's decision in Cabazon. Congress sought to preserve tribal self-government while protecting tribes and the gaming public from unscrupulous individuals. States wanted state regulation of Indian gaming, while tribes lobbied for exclusive tribal regulation. In IGRA, Congress maintained the current regulatory scheme of tribal and federal regulation of bingo and provided a framework for regulation. IGRA provided a statutory basis for Indian gaming on \"Indian lands\" and created the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) to regulate Indian gaming on the federal level. It allows tribes to determine the extent to which they subject themselves to state jurisdiction through tribal-state compacts. \"Indian lands\" are defined as lands within a reservation or held in trust. The tribe must exercise governmental power over trust or restricted fee land, which requires jurisdiction under federal law. This jurisdiction is necessary for land to be considered \"Indian country,\" including reservations, dependent Indian communities, and trust or restricted fee allotments. Unilateral actions like obtaining consent or posting tribal symbols are not sufficient to establish governmental authority. Land set aside for Indian use and superintended by the federal government qualifies as Indian country, including tribal trust land. Jurisdiction over land can be exercised by a tribe outside of a reservation if it is tribal trust land or an allotment belonging to a tribal member. Courts look for concrete manifestations of governmental authority, such as receiving funds for federal programs and establishing housing authorities. Indian lands encompass land within an Indian reservation, trust, or restricted fee land where the tribe exercises governmental power. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act prohibits gaming on land acquired in trust after October 17, 1988, unless it is within or contiguous to the tribe's reservation boundaries on that date. Exceptions exist for this prohibition. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act prohibits gaming on land acquired in trust after October 17, 1988, unless it is within or contiguous to the tribe's reservation boundaries on that date. Exceptions exist for this prohibition, including the \"two part determination\" process for gaming on newly acquired lands. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allows tribal gaming on newly acquired lands with the Governor's approval. IGRA divides gaming into three classes and assigns regulation responsibilities to tribes, states, and the federal government. Class I gaming includes social games and traditional Indian gaming for ceremonial purposes. Class II gaming, regulated by tribes, includes bingo and similar games where players must compete against each other, not machines. Electronic aids can broaden participation by allowing remote play or more players. Under class II gaming, card games authorized by state laws or not explicitly prohibited can be played on Indian lands. However, banking card games like baccarat, chemin de fer, or blackjack are excluded. Class II gaming is subject to tribal regulation with federal oversight, allowing for games like bingo and card games with limitations on wagers. IGRA defines class III gaming as all forms of gaming that are not class I or class II gaming, including card games played against the house, casino games like roulette and craps, slot machines, sports betting, and lotteries. Class III gaming must be authorized by a tribal gaming ordinance that meets certain requirements. Class III gaming can only be conducted in states that permit such gaming for any purpose by any person or entity, and must be authorized by a tribal gaming ordinance approved by NIGC or the Secretary under IGRA. In Cabazon, the Court recognized the state's interest in preventing organized crime infiltration in Indian gaming but did not find sufficient evidence to justify state regulation of tribal bingo operations. The reasoning did not apply to casino gaming. The drafters of IGRA believed states had a legitimate interest in regulating casino gaming due to its vulnerability to criminal activity. Congress recognized both tribes and states have interests in class III gaming on tribal lands, with tribes focusing on revenue generation and public safety, while states consider the impact on public policy, safety, and their regulatory system. The compact provision in IGRA was a compromise between state and tribal regulation interests. It identifies subjects for negotiation such as laws, jurisdiction, fees, taxation, and remedies for breach of contract related to gaming activities. Congress intended that gaming compacts would be limited to gaming issues and not used to impose state jurisdiction on tribal lands. IGRA prohibits states from imposing taxes or fees on Indian tribes for class III gaming activities. Compacts are approved by the Secretary and must comply with federal law and trust obligations to Indians. NIGC regulates Indian gaming and is funded through gaming fees. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) regulates class II and class III gaming by approving gaming ordinances and management contracts, making determinations on Indian land eligibility for gaming, and enforcing regulations. NIGC is funded through gaming fees and is composed of a chairman appointed by the President, two associate members appointed by the Secretary, and members serving three-year terms representing both political parties and Indian tribes. The IGRA provisions ensure that tribal gaming is conducted responsibly, with revenues benefiting the tribe and its members. The chairman of NIGC must approve ordinances that grant the tribe sole responsibility for gaming, limit revenue uses to benefit the tribe, require audits of gaming operations and contracts, and ensure environmental and public safety protection in gaming facilities. The IGRA provisions require the chairman of NIGC to approve ordinances for tribal gaming that ensure environmental and public safety protection, background checks for key persons, and integrity in gaming operations. If the chairman does not act within 90 days, the ordinance is deemed approved. For class III ordinances, there are limitations on the chairman's authority to approve them to safeguard tribes and gaming integrity. Indian tribes can enter into management contracts for class II and class III gaming with NIGC approval. NIGC reviews contracts to ensure tribal control, protect tribal benefits, and maintain gaming integrity. The chairman can disapprove contracts that do not meet trustee standards. The chairman has authority to impose fines and order temporary closure of Indian gaming operations for violations of IGRA, NIGC regulations, or tribal ordinances. Appeals can be made to the full commission, and a hearing must be held within 30 days. The commission must make a decision within 60 days. The NIGC has the authority to take action against Indian gaming operations for violations, including fines, closure, or contract modifications. They can issue written complaints, adopt regulations for fines, establish fees, issue subpoenas, monitor gaming activities, inspect premises, conduct investigations, demand access to records, and hold hearings. The NIGC has the authority to take action against Indian gaming operations for violations, including fines, closure, or contract modifications. They can issue complaints, adopt regulations for fines, establish fees, issue subpoenas, monitor gaming activities, inspect premises, conduct investigations, demand access to records, and hold hearings. Additionally, the NIGC makes determinations on Indian land and classification of games, with class III gaming requiring a tribal-state compact or procedures approved by the Secretary under IGRA. A tribe must request the state to negotiate a class III gaming compact under IGRA. Federal district courts have jurisdiction over any cause of action by tribes for states failing to negotiate in good faith. In Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot waive states' sovereign immunity for tribes enforcing good faith bargaining. After Seminole, IGRA no longer guaranteed tribes the ability to engage in class III gaming if a state refused to negotiate. The Secretary adopted Secretarial Procedures as an administrative process for tribes to conduct class III gaming when a state asserts sovereign immunity. This process allows tribes to submit a gaming proposal to the Secretary after a state claims immunity. The Secretary allows tribes to submit class III gaming proposals, giving states 60 days to respond. If no state proposal is submitted, the Secretary reviews and either approves the tribe's proposal or holds a conference to address disagreements. If a state submits a proposal, a mediator is appointed to resolve differences. The Secretary must then prescribe procedures for gaming within 60 days. In Texas v. United States, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Secretary's regulations apply when a state asserts sovereign immunity, regardless of good faith negotiations. IGRA mandates a mediator selected by the court and limits the Secretary's discretion in prescribing class III procedures to be consistent with the mediator's proposal. The court found the Secretary's Secretarial Procedures unauthorized under IGRA as they did not involve judicial findings of bad faith or mediator selection. After Texas v. United States invalidated the Secretarial Procedures in the Fifth Circuit, uncertainty surrounds their legality. The Supreme Court's decision in Seminole has shifted the balance of power between tribes and states regarding Class III gaming. The decision in Seminole shifted power from tribes to states, allowing states to negotiate for a share of gaming revenues despite IGRA's prohibition on state taxation of Indian gaming. The increase in revenue sharing percentages raises concerns about violating IGRA. In Rincon Band of Luiseno Mission Indians v. Schwarzenegger, the Ninth Circuit found California's demand for a substantial percentage of gaming revenues problematic. In Rincon Band of Luiseno Mission Indians v. Schwarzenegger, California's demand for a significant portion of gaming revenues was deemed bad faith as the state did not offer greater exclusivity than the tribe's existing compact. This case has limited implications outside of California due to the state waiving its sovereign immunity for negotiation requirements. Most tribes engaging in class III gaming have no choice but to agree to revenue sharing if demanded by the state. Some states are also seeking tribal concessions unrelated to gaming as conditions for class III compacts. In California, tribes have agreed to state taxation on-reservation cigarette and gasoline sales. Environmental and labor issues are included in class III compacts with tribes. Proposed amendments to IGRA focus on gaming on newly acquired lands near population centers. Controversy surrounds gaming on land acquired in trust under IGRA exceptions. As of June 2010, 31 applications for land into trust were granted under the exceptions. Off-reservation gaming remains controversial. Off-reservation gaming has sparked controversy and caught the attention of Congress. S. 771 in the 112th Congress aims to restrict gaming on newly acquired lands by requiring tribes to demonstrate a modern and aboriginal connection to the land. The Secretary must certify certain criteria, including proximity to tribal headquarters or member residences, routine presence on the land since October 17, 1988, and no restoration of federal recognition within the past five years. The tribe must demonstrate a routine presence on the land within 25 miles of where members live, with an aboriginal connection to the land based on historical presence, lineal descent, language spoken, proximity of sacred sites, forcible removal, and other factors. S. 2676 in the 110th Congress proposed amending IGRA to address off-reservation gaming issues. S. 2676 in the 110th Congress aimed to amend IGRA by removing exceptions to the prohibition on gaming on newly acquired lands, requiring consultation with tribal, state, and local jurisdictions within 60 miles, and mandating a study on the economic impact of the gaming establishment. The bill also required state legislature and governor concurrence for the two part determination, and set criteria for tribes to demonstrate a geographic, social, and historical nexus to the land. The proposed bill aimed to restrict class II gaming to Indian lands on the date of enactment or acquired afterwards with tribe's indication for gaming. It also limited tribes from changing non-gaming trust land to gaming use and authorized background checks for gaming enterprises. H.R. 2562 from the 110th Congress would have removed exceptions for gaming on newly acquired lands under IGRA. The proposed bill aimed to amend IGRA's exceptions for gaming on newly acquired lands, requiring concurrence of the state legislature and governor for the two part determination. Other bills introduced in Congress aimed to give local jurisdictions a veto over class III gaming establishments and ensure gaming on newly acquired lands is in the tribe's best interest. Initially, Indian gaming arose in response to funding cut-backs for tribes in the 1980s. In Cabazon, the Supreme Court supported Indian gaming as a tribal revenue source, leading to the passage of IGRA by Congress. IGRA divides Indian gaming into three classes, with states having a role in regulating class III gaming through tribal-state compacts. Tribes must have a gaming compact to engage in class III gaming. The NIGC regulates tribal gaming by approving ordinances, management contracts, and monitoring operations. IGRA incentivizes states to negotiate gaming compacts with tribes. If no agreement is reached, tribes can engage in class III gaming without state approval. After the Seminole case, tribes cannot sue states for violating IGRA's limitations, leading to tribes accepting potentially prohibited conditions in their compacts. Congress is focused on off-reservation gaming on newly acquired lands, with proposed bills to restrict tribes' gaming abilities on such lands."
