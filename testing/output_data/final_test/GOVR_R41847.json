    "content": "In recent years, state and federal laws have expanded law enforcement's use of DNA for investigating crimes. DNA is collected compulsorily and sent to the FBI for analysis and storage in a national database. Initially, DNA extraction was limited to violent or sex-based felonies, but new laws have broadened the scope to include a wider range of offenses. Opponents of DNA databases criticize the expansion of collection authority, including compulsory collection from individuals arrested but not convicted. Critics argue that DNA databases are \"Orwellian\" and violate the Fourth Amendment by conditioning release on DNA collection and using DNA profiles for purposes other than identifying suspects. Federal courts have debated the constitutionality of these practices, which infringe on individuals' privacy rights against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. Federal courts have generally upheld compulsory DNA collection from convicted felons under supervision as not violating the Fourth Amendment due to diminished privacy expectations. The constitutionality of DNA collection from arrestees, especially without a grand jury indictment or probable cause finding, remains unaddressed. The debate continues on the limits of databanked DNA use and its impact on privacy rights. This report discusses the constitutional limits on databanked DNA profiles, the expansion of statutory authorities for DNA databases, and the emerging consensus and discord among federal courts over Fourth Amendment issues related to compulsory DNA collection. DNA is a complex molecule that contains genetic information, with small variations creating distinguishing characteristics. Forensic scientists use DNA profiling technology to analyze DNA profiles. DNA profiling technology allows forensic scientists to examine different regions of DNA to develop a unique DNA profile of an individual. While the resulting profile may not be entirely unique, advancements in technology have made profiles increasingly discriminating. The probability of two unrelated individuals sharing the same DNA profile is estimated to be one in a billion. DNA profiles are often compared to fingerprints, and law enforcement officers collect DNA samples from specific classes of individuals, such as prisoners, for identification purposes. DNA matching is considered a complement to fingerprint analysis in identifying criminal suspects. The FBI administers DNA storage and analysis for law enforcement agencies. DNA profiles are created by decoding sequences of 'junk DNA,' which is not associated with known physical or medical characteristics. Law enforcement agencies collect blood or saliva samples from subjects for analysis. The DNA profile of a subject can be created from blood or saliva samples collected by law enforcement agencies. The profile is analyzed and converted into a DNA profile by a lab adhering to FBI standards, then entered into CODIS for sharing among law enforcement agencies. CODIS aids criminal investigations and contains over 9.5 million offender profiles as of March 2011. As of March 2011, CODIS had assisted over 135,500 criminal investigations, with 1% to 2% of offender samples aiding in cases. The categories for DNA sample collection have expanded, including samples from convicted individuals for specified offenses, misdemeanors in some jurisdictions, and even from those arrested but not convicted. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act 2000 allows compulsory collection from various individuals. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act 2000 authorizes compulsory DNA collection from individuals in federal custody, including those detained, arrested, or facing charges. Relevant officials can use necessary means to detain and collect DNA samples from non-cooperative individuals. State laws vary, with most states allowing DNA collection from convicted individuals and some states also collecting from arrestees. Federal laws in the 1990s established the framework for DNA collection, storage, and analysis. The DNA Identification Act of 1994 and subsequent laws provided funding and authority for DNA collection and analysis by law enforcement agencies. The framework centers on the FBI's Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), with over 180 agencies participating. Recent laws have expanded the range of offenses for DNA collection and analysis, with the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 limiting compulsory extraction to convicted individuals. The Elimination Act of 2000 restricted compulsory DNA extraction to those convicted of specific federal offenses, which were later expanded to include terrorism-related crimes. The Justice for All Act in 2004 further broadened the scope to cover all violent crimes, sexual abuse crimes, and felonies. States also allow DNA collection from individuals convicted of any felony. Additionally, DNA can be collected from individuals detained or arrested, as authorized by the DNA Fingerprinting Act of 2005. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 expanded DNA collection to include individuals arrested, facing charges, or convicted under U.S. authority. The U.S. Department of Justice regulations implemented this requirement in 2009. Some states have also enacted laws for DNA collection from arrestees. Legislation in Congress aimed to incentivize states to collect DNA from those arrested for specific offenses. Courts assess the intrusiveness of DNA databanking programs by considering the circumstances of DNA collection. The expansion of DNA collection under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 includes individuals arrested, facing charges, or convicted. Policymakers have broadened the circumstances and purposes for DNA profiling, with an increasing number of states allowing familial searching in DNA databases. This method involves partial matches between profiles, unlike routine searches that compare complete samples for direct matches. The FBI distinguishes between routine DNA searches for direct matches and familial searching, which involves generating partial matches from degraded samples. Partial matches may be used in criminal investigations, but the FBI does not consider it familial searching. The FBI defines familial searching as deliberately searching for potential relatives of a suspect, not the suspect himself. Some states allow familial searching, while others prohibit it. Congress supports DNA databanking but also limits the government's authority to retain DNA profiles indefinitely, mandating expungement upon discharge, acquittal, or overturned convictions. Expungement of DNA profiles collected by law enforcement requires a written request and a court order proving the conviction was overturned or charges dismissed. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, raising questions about government actions triggering Fourth Amendment rights. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, questioning if government actions trigger Fourth Amendment rights. Seizures involve interference with property rights, while searches intrude upon personal privacy based on a reasonable expectation of privacy. The Supreme Court evaluates the exposure of physical characteristics to the public to determine privacy expectations. Blood and internal fluids are distinguished from fingerprints, with the former implicating a reasonable expectation of privacy. The type of evidence gathered and the status of the person impact privacy expectations, creating a continuum of privacy. The Supreme Court evaluates privacy expectations based on exposure of physical characteristics to the public. In United States v. Knights, probation conditions diminished privacy expectations but did not negate Fourth Amendment rights. Government actions must be reasonable for constitutionality, with searches requiring warrants supported by probable cause unless justified by reasonable suspicion. Courts analyze DNA databanking programs under a reasonableness test, weighing privacy intrusion against governmental interests. The test is used for suspicionless searches deemed non-intrusive or necessary. It is applied in situations where routine administrative purposes justify searches, for long-recognized warrant exceptions like border searches, and for special needs beyond normal law enforcement requirements. The Supreme Court recently applied a \"totality-of-the-circumstances\" analysis in a case involving a suspicionless search of a parolee's pockets. The Court found that the search was non-intrusive due to the parolee's diminished privacy rights within the penal system. This status is now a valid justification for evaluating Fourth Amendment consistency under a general reasonableness test. The privacy rights of prisoners, parolees, probationers, and supervised releasees vary on a spectrum, with prisoners having the least privacy rights. Compulsory DNA collection is considered a search and must pass the Fourth Amendment reasonableness test. The federal appeals courts have ruled that the privacy rights of all convicted offenders are diminished. Federal appeals courts have ruled that the privacy rights of convicted offenders are diminished, with the majority upholding laws mandating DNA collection from prisoners, parolees, and probationers. The courts differ in their rationale for evaluating these laws, with some using court-ordered supervision as the basis, while others apply a special needs methodology. Courts have upheld compulsory post-conviction DNA collection laws, with only a few cases addressing DNA collection from individuals awaiting trial. Recent federal circuit court decisions have found pre-trial DNA sampling to be consistent with the Fourth Amendment, indicating a potential trend in other circuits. In United States v. Mitchell and United States v. Pool, the Third and Ninth Circuits upheld the government's request for a criminal arrestee's DNA sample after indictment but before trial. Both courts applied the reasonableness test, considering the arrestee's diminished privacy rights due to probable cause for arrest, the intrusion of DNA collection on privacy interests, and the substantial government interest served by DNA profiling. The Ninth Circuit viewed the indictment as a significant event diminishing the arrestee's privacy rights. The Third Circuit's decision in United States v. Mitchell and United States v. Pool considered the diminished privacy rights of arrestees after a \"watershed event\" and the reasonableness of warrantless DNA searches. The court did not determine if a grand jury indictment or judicial probable cause finding was necessary for reduced privacy rights. Future cases may show that individuals detained based on probable cause have greater privacy rights in their DNA profiles. Both courts compared DNA profiling to fingerprinting or photographing suspects, rejecting the idea that DNA collection is significantly more intrusive. The Third and Ninth Circuits found that the government's interests in DNA databanking outweigh any privacy intrusion created by DNA collection. They emphasized the importance of accurate identification of arrestees and the discouragement of violating pre-trial release conditions. The Third Circuit upheld the constitutionality of compulsory DNA collection, citing the government's compelling interest in accurate identification of arrestees. Another emerging Fourth Amendment issue involves the retention and use of DNA samples and profiles, with concerns raised about the indefinite retention of DNA profiles violating the Fourth Amendment. The federal law requires the FBI to expunge DNA profiles for individuals who are acquitted or have their convictions overturned, reducing the intrusiveness of DNA collection from arrestees. However, it is unclear if convicted felons also retain privacy rights over their DNA profiles. The expungement provisions do not address the storage of DNA from individuals who have completed their sentences, allowing law enforcement to access DNA profiles in the CODIS database without consent. Convicted felons who have completed their sentences have challenged the government's indefinite storage of their DNA profiles without consent, suspicion, or warrant. Courts have shown skepticism towards genetic exceptionalism, making it difficult for defendants to argue against the constitutionality of retaining DNA samples. There is a divergence in court opinions regarding the privacy rights of offenders in their DNA samples after completing their sentences. The First Circuit acknowledged the judicial divergence over the privacy rights of offenders in their DNA samples after release. In the case of Boroian v. Mueller, the court upheld the government's retention and matching of a felon's DNA post-sentence, stating that the offender does not lose privacy rights once the DNA profile is lawfully created and entered into CODIS. Boroian suggests that post-sentence retention and use of a DNA profile may violate an offender's privacy rights. Some state courts have a more expansive view, allowing indefinite use and retention of DNA profiles. Judge Easterbrook supported this perspective, stating that lawfully obtained DNA samples can be used for various purposes. Judge Easterbrook supported the view that lawfully obtained DNA samples can be used for various purposes beyond storage and matching, stating that the Fourth Amendment does not control how collected information is deployed. This has significant implications for the potential uses of DNA databases and the privacy concerns surrounding them. The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 criminalized unauthorized disclosure or use of DNA samples. Federal law does not allow individuals to sue for misuse of their profiles. Opponents want federal law to allow private enforcement, especially concerning state DNA database laws permitting non-forensic uses. State laws allow wider non-forensic uses of DNA databases, including for medical and academic research. Critics argue these programs are more intrusive than federal standards. Courts have considered the purposes and penalties of DNA databases in Fourth Amendment analysis, but privacy intrusion can only be measured when a database is used for non-forensic purposes. The use of DNA databases for forensic purposes has raised concerns about privacy intrusion and Fourth Amendment reasonableness. Familial searching, a technique that searches for potential relatives of suspects, has sparked public debate. Federal courts have yet to rule on the constitutionality of familial searching, with arguments about the intrusiveness of obtaining DNA profiles compared to fingerprints. The court did not address Mitchell's argument regarding familial searching and DNA collection, citing lack of evidence. Privacy concerns arise with familial searching, as it may violate the privacy interests of the person whose DNA profile is a partial match and their family members. Law enforcement may violate privacy rights by collecting DNA from family members of a partial match without a warrant. The constitutionality of familial searching remains untested, with commentators arguing for privacy interests in genetic relationships. Despite advancements in DNA analysis technology, the issue of genetic privacy is still a contentious one. Despite rapid technological advancements in DNA analysis, much of DNA's scientific value remains a mystery. FBI analysts rely on junk DNA as it is not believed to reveal sensitive information. Proponents of expansive DNA collection argue that privacy intrusion from DNA storage or analysis is minimal. Senator Kyl emphasized that DNA samples stored are 'junk DNA' and do not intrude upon privacy rights. Courts assume DNA analysis involves minimal privacy intrusion, but some opinions suggest otherwise. Scientific research on junk DNA is still emerging, with some suggesting it contains more genetic information than previously assumed. Courts have hinted that the discovery of new uses for junk DNA could impact the balance of privacy rights. Researchers have found that junk DNA has the potential to evolve into protein-coding genes, leading to concerns about the sensitivity of information derived from it in the future. The use of junk DNA in DNA database programs has expanded, with Congress showing support for its development and integration. Concerns have been raised about the sensitivity of information derived from junk DNA and the potential for revealing detailed medical or biological characteristics. The expansion of DNA database programs has raised concerns about their compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Courts have upheld DNA collection from convicted individuals, but the constitutionality of collecting DNA from arrestees without probable cause remains unresolved. The indefinite storage of DNA profiles post-conviction has generally been upheld, although there is disagreement among courts. The use of DNA databases for non-forensic purposes and familial searching is raising Fourth Amendment concerns, particularly in state database programs. The National DNA Index System (NDIS) and Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) currently do not allow for non-forensic research or intentional familial searching. However, the increasing authorization of familial searching in states may lead to a federal court challenge on its constitutionality. The Fourth Amendment analysis of these issues relies heavily on the current state of scientific knowledge on DNA. Recent scientific research is challenging the traditional view of \"junk\" DNA as empty or meaningless genetic material used in databanked profiles. If \"junk\" DNA is found to reveal sensitive genetic information, the constitutionality of DNA database programs may need to be reevaluated."
