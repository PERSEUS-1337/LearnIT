    "content": "Scientists have documented increases in global temperature, sea levels, and melting ice due to human activities contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts to reduce these emissions are underway at various levels. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include market-based approaches like cap-and-trade or carbon taxes. Congressional focus has been on cap-and-trade, with discussions on potential impacts on U.S. households and options for mitigating effects, especially for lower-income households. The curr_chunk discusses financial assistance for households under a cap-and-trade program to help lower-income households cope with cost increases. It also examines ways policymakers could alleviate costs imposed by a GHG emission control program. Active GHG emission reduction legislation in the 111th Congress is outlined, focusing on the economic consequences of a cap-and-trade system. This system would limit GHG emissions, adding costs to activities that generate emissions, primarily fossil fuel combustion. The curr_chunk discusses how companies may pass on the costs of emission reductions to households under a cap-and-trade program. It explains how emission allowances would become valuable commodities, potentially worth billions of dollars, with lower-income households facing disproportionately high costs. The value of emission allowances under a cap-and-trade program could amount to billions of dollars, with significant economic implications. Policymakers must decide how to distribute these allowances, whether through auctions, free allocation to covered sources, or other methods. The distribution strategy would not impact the emissions cap's environmental integrity but would involve a substantial wealth transfer. Policymakers must decide how to distribute the value of emission allowances, whether through auctions or free allocation, to support various policy objectives such as minimizing program costs, alleviating costs for subgroups, and funding other policy goals. The distribution of emission allowance value can be used to achieve policy objectives like energy efficiency improvements or technological development. Without redistributing auction revenue to offset costs, households may bear a significant portion of cap-and-trade program costs. Covered entities could pass on compliance costs, leading to unequal cost distribution among different groups. Households and businesses would bear 89% of the costs if allowance value is not redistributed by the government in a cap-and-trade program. Covered entities are expected to raise prices for goods and services, even if they receive allowances at no cost, due to the opportunity cost of forgoing unused allowances in the emissions trading market. Covered sources in emissions trading programs are predicted to pass along their opportunity costs or purchase costs, resulting in windfall profits. Without allowance value redistribution, lower-income households may bear a disproportionate share of the costs related to an emissions cap. Lower-income households may bear a disproportionate share of the costs related to an emissions cap, as they spend a higher percentage of their income on energy-related goods and services. This regressive outcome makes them more economically vulnerable to potential price increases from a GHG control program. These households already pay a larger share of their income towards residential energy and gasoline costs, and lack financial resources for energy efficiency improvements. Other policies in the United States aim to alleviate these costs for low-income households. In 2006, low-income households had a median individual energy burden of 9.5%, spending a higher percentage of their income on residential energy compared to non low-income households. Low-income households spent a median of 9.5% of their income on residential energy, with the poorest households receiving LIHEAP benefits facing a higher energy burden of 15.3%. Regional variations showed households in the Northeast had higher energy burdens. Consumer spending on utilities declined from lower to higher income groups, with families earning $5,000 to $10,000 per month spending over 10% of their total expenditures on utilities. Consumer spending on utilities and gasoline varied based on income levels. For households with incomes above $20,000, spending on utilities decreased as income increased, with those earning $150,000 or more allocating less than 5% of their expenditures to utilities. Similarly, spending on gasoline peaked for families earning $30,000 to $40,000, at 5.75%, and gradually declined for higher income groups, dropping below 5% for those earning above $80,000. Lower-income families spent a smaller percentage of their income on gasoline compared to middle-income families. Economic analyses show that a GHG emission control program would have regressive effects on households, with the lowest income group bearing a cost almost five times higher than the highest income group. Some argue that allowance value should be used to help lower-income households cope with the impacts. The distribution of income and assistance to lower-income individuals is based on the concept of marginal utility of income, where the value of a dollar is greater for those with fewer of them. This redistribution aims to maximize societal well-being, driven by both economic theory and societal values. The federal government targets assistance to lower-income individuals and families through various programs such as the federal income tax system, social welfare programs like SNAP and Medicaid, and social insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare. Congress could choose to allow households to realize the full consequences of increased energy. Congress has a history of mitigating adverse distributional consequences from government policies, such as providing Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers and farmers in trade policy. Programs like LIHEAP and WAP have helped low-income families with residential energy costs since the 1970s energy spikes. Existing programs like LIHEAP and WAP assist low-income families with energy costs. States in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative use revenues to help these families. If Congress enacts a cap-and-trade program, policymakers must decide how to distribute allowance value to households. Policymakers must decide how to distribute allowance value to households, considering different costs in various regions. One option is a \"lump-sum distribution\" approach, which is easy to explain and implement without considering income disparities. This method could address regressive impacts and unintended consequences of direct assistance to households. Economic studies suggest that distributing lump sum rebates to all households would have progressive results, but if Congress allocates allowance value for other purposes, the distributional effects may be less clear. Providing more substantial rebates to lower-income households may be necessary for progressivity, and considering different household sizes when allotting allowance value could be a question to address. Equal payments, if not scaled to household size, may benefit some consumers. Targeting assistance based on income levels may be more effective in addressing the disproportionate impacts of increased energy costs on lower-income households under a cap-and-trade program. Policymakers could allocate funds to \"low-income,\" \"moderate-income,\" and/or \"middle-income\" individuals or groups, depending on their priorities. This approach aims to provide more targeted assistance to households economically vulnerable to rising energy costs. Targeting assistance based on income levels may require further debate among policymakers to determine how emission allowance values should be divided among different income groups. The definition of \"low-income\" varies depending on the program, with some using federal poverty guidelines and others using median income thresholds. Unlike the term \"low-income,\" the terms \"moderate-income\" and \"middle-income\" are also used in determining eligibility for various federal programs. Some HUD multifamily housing programs target moderate-income families, defined as those with incomes between 80% and 95% of area median income. Homeownership programs through HUD and the Department of Agriculture use 100% and 115% of area median income respectively. The term \"middle income\" is not defined in federal law and may vary in meaning. Geography is expected to impact household energy use. Household impacts from energy sources vary by region due to differing carbon content levels. Assistance to households in carbon-intensive regions under a cap-and-trade program should reflect these differences by distributing allowance value based on projected cost increases across regions. Implementing a distribution strategy for emission allowances poses challenges and questions the underlying assumptions. Economic studies estimate cost impacts on households by income group and region, without considering offsetting income from allowance distribution. The average household costs of a cap-and-trade program as a percentage of income varied by region, with California at 1.3% and the Ohio Valley at 1.6%. Lower-income households in California would bear costs of 4.0% of income, compared to 5.5% in the Ohio Valley. The disparity in costs between regions may impact perception, with the lowest-income household in the Ohio Valley facing $100 more in annual costs than in California. Policymakers need to consider these regional differences and implementation challenges. In a cap-and-trade program, the electricity sector, responsible for 34% of U.S. GHG emissions, would incur significant costs based on carbon intensity. Policymakers must address regional differences in carbon intensity of electricity generation to mitigate cost disparities. The determination of carbon intensity of electricity becomes more challenging as the geographic area narrows down, due to data availability issues. Distribution utilities often lack complete information on the energy sources used for power generation, making it difficult to tie electricity deliveries to the generating source accurately. This complexity is further compounded by the constantly changing mix of fuels in power market transactions. H.R. 2454 would require a data collection process to determine the carbon content of electricity consumed, but existing regional estimates like EPA's eGRID may not accurately reflect this. Using data based on electricity generation could lead to overcompensation for regions that export high-carbon electricity and disadvantage regions that import it. The customers in net importing regions would bear the emission cap carbon price, potentially overcompensating some LDCs. Regional data may not accurately reflect carbon intensities, leading to varied impacts on households and energy efficiency improvements. Some observers are concerned about how assistance mechanisms impact the carbon price signal in GHG emissions control programs like cap-and-trade. The price on carbon is expected to influence behavior by encouraging less carbon-intensive activities, leading to higher energy prices and motivating businesses and households to reduce CO2 emissions. The price signal is crucial for the success of cap-and-trade programs as it encourages economically motivated changes in investment and consumption. The cost of cap-and-trade programs may increase in sectors with higher marginal abatement costs. For example, efforts to keep electricity prices stable by using emission allowance value could raise overall program costs by reducing incentives for households to reduce electricity consumption. A study showed that distributing allowances to LDCs based on electricity emissions could increase allowance prices by 13%, thus raising program costs. The cost of cap-and-trade programs may increase in sectors with higher marginal abatement costs. Efforts to keep electricity prices stable by using emission allowance value could raise overall program costs. Distributing allowances to LDCs based on electricity emissions could increase allowance prices by 13%, thus increasing the overall cost of the program. Policymakers have options for distributing allowance value to households, such as equal dividends or energy tax credits for low- and/or middle-income households. President Obama's FY2010 budget proposed various measures to assist low- and middle-income households, including energy tax credits, reducing Social Security payroll taxes, distributing allowances to LDCs, allocating auction proceeds to energy assistance programs, and creating rebates. Additionally, a cap-and-trade program was suggested to fund the \"Making Work Pay\" tax credit for low-income workers. The report discusses delivery options for returning allowance value to households, considering factors like reaching large numbers of households, administrative infrastructure, costs, and tailoring benefits. Various considerations for each option are highlighted, aiming to assist policymakers in choosing and implementing a distribution system. The section discusses the ability to reach households and the administrative costs of implementing a delivery system for returning allowance value. It considers existing delivery mechanisms and the potential effectiveness of untried mechanisms like universal rebates. Administrative costs vary depending on the targeted benefits, with more targeted benefits leading to higher costs. The higher the targeted benefits, the higher the administrative costs. For example, programs with complex eligibility rules and multi-tiered benefits are more expensive to administer. Consumer flexibility is important, as cash transfers allow beneficiaries to decide how to use the benefit, potentially making them better off than in-kind benefits. There is a tension in public policy between consumer flexibility and achieving policy priorities. Tailoring benefits for household size and income is important, with allowance value distribution based on eligibility requirements. Benefits may vary based on income and family size, with some systems phasing out benefits at certain income levels. Regional differences should also be taken into account in benefit delivery systems. When distributing allowance value, Congress may need to consider regional differences and energy sources. Tailoring rebates based on regional differences could decrease transparency and lead to overcompensation. Using proceeds to promote energy efficiency is also a desirable option. Consumers may not reduce consumption if there are reimbursement incentives. Policymakers could combine rebates with an educational program to promote energy efficiency. Individual options may not reach all households, but can be used together to assist various income levels. One method of allocating proceeds from a cap-and-trade program is to provide direct payments, or rebates, to consumers to compensate for increased energy costs. This option, known as \"cap-and-dividend,\" proposes equal payments for all consumers and can be delivered to individuals or households. Considerations for setting up a direct rebate system include the ability to reach all households in the United States. Creating a comprehensive database of personal information involving multiple federal agencies like the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could potentially reach a large percentage of Americans. The SSA holds records of names, addresses, and Social Security numbers for millions of Americans, while the IRS has information on taxpayers and their dependents. However, the IRS may not have records for individuals who do not file taxes. A potential source for identifying individuals not captured by federal tax systems could be state public benefit programs like SNAP and TANF. There is currently no unified administrative infrastructure in place to reach all Americans for delivering funds, with costs depending on frequency and delivery method. The Treasury Department highlighted the cost difference between paper and electronic delivery of benefits. For example, it cost $1.03 to send a paper check compared to 10.5 cents for electronic delivery. Recent economic stimulus bills distributed funds efficiently, with the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 costing $215 million to extend rebates to 119 million tax filers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $90 million for the Social Security Administration to distribute $250 payments to 50 million Social Security recipients and 7.5 million SSI recipients. Consumer Flexibility \u2014Households could use direct rebates for various expenses like utility bills or gasoline. Tailoring benefits based on household size and income may increase administrative costs. Regional differences could be considered but may reduce transparency. Direct rebates may not necessarily promote energy efficiency. Promoting Energy Efficiency \u2014A direct rebate may not enhance energy efficiency beyond any conservation resulting from price increases, potentially reducing the effectiveness of a cap-and-trade program. Funds from a GHG emission control program could be distributed to households through the tax system, such as reducing income or FICA taxes withheld from paychecks or providing a refundable tax credit through the federal income tax system. Relevant considerations for using the tax system to distribute benefits include... Considerations for using the tax system to distribute benefits include reaching households through payroll taxes and income tax credits. Payroll tax rebates could benefit 80% of households, with 54% in the lowest income quintile qualifying. A tax credit would reach individuals who file income taxes, encouraging non-filers to do so to receive the credit. Using the tax system to deliver funds would not require creation of a new administrative infrastructure to reach households because existing tax collection systems could be used for this purpose. However, there would likely be increased administrative costs depending on the elements of the program. There could be increased numbers of individuals filing taxes in order to take advantage of a new tax credit or costs involved in adjusting withholding for payroll tax reductions. Households could use funds from the tax system for various expenses like utility bills and gasoline. Tailoring benefits based on household size and income can be done using existing IRS taxpayer information. However, additional data collection may be needed for FICA reductions. Energy price considerations in the tax system would add complexity to fund determination. Promoting energy efficiency through a tax rebate may not be effective in a cap-and-trade program. An alternative is distributing allowance value to local energy distributors, who would then pass along the benefits to consumers. One way to pass along the value of allowances to benefit energy consumers is by requiring local energy distributors to sell the allowances and use the proceeds to support energy efficiency efforts or provide rebates on consumers' energy bills. Considerations include the ability to reach households using natural gas, electricity, heating oil, and propane for heating. If a GHG emission control program directed natural gas and electricity LDCs to sell allowances for customer benefit, nearly all US households could be reached. Renters whose utilities are included in rent may not benefit. Policymakers should provide detailed instructions to ensure consistent application nationwide. LDCs could pass on benefits to households through billing systems without additional administrative infrastructure. Targeting customers based on income or household size is a possibility. If a system were to target household customers based on income or household size, administrative costs could increase. An additional layer of administration may be needed, with state and/or federal governments overseeing a program where LDCs help consumers. States overseeing a program for heating oil and propane users may require an application system. Consumer flexibility in using funds administered by LDCs would depend on cash rebates or credits toward energy bills. Tailoring benefits for household size is important. Reducing utility bills could free up funds for other uses. Tailoring benefits for household size and income would require additional administrative responsibility. Proponents argue that accounting for regional differences in distributing allowance value would lead to a more equitable distribution. The potential ability to account for regional differences in distributing allowance value may not have a particular advantage over other approaches. Local electricity providers do not collect data on the carbon content of the electricity they deliver, but federal agencies have approximations at the regional level. Promoting energy efficiency could be possible through program implementation, tying benefits to reductions in energy use. Policymakers could use allowance value to support energy efficiency programs like LIHEAP, which assists low-income households with heating and cooling bills and weatherization projects. LIHEAP assists low-income households with weatherization projects, energy assistance, and emergency services. Some GHG emission control proposals in Congress suggest using auction proceeds to help mitigate higher energy prices for low-income consumers. LIHEAP targets households at or below 150% of poverty but may not reach all low-income households due to state flexibility in income eligibility guidelines. LIHEAP provides assistance to low-income households with weatherization, energy aid, and emergency services. Eligibility is set at 110% of poverty, but funding limitations prevent all eligible households from receiving benefits. Only 20% of eligible LIHEAP households received benefits in FY2006. The program allows up to 10% of grants for administrative purposes, with 7.7% of funds used for administration in FY2006. Additional funding through a GHG emission control program could help serve more eligible households without the need for new administrative infrastructure. If LIHEAP funding increases or more beneficiaries are served for greenhouse gas reduction, administration costs may also rise. LIHEAP benefits address high residential energy costs, not gasoline or other energy-related expenses. States can tailor benefits based on household size and income, targeting those with the lowest incomes and highest energy needs. The LIHEAP program allocates funds to states based on fuel type and price, but data lag may affect responsiveness to GHG emission control programs. Recent data is crucial for distributing auction proceeds. While LIHEAP allows for weatherization funding, most expenditures go towards direct heating and cooling subsidies. Some states do not prioritize weatherization, despite the availability of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) provides low-cost home weatherization services to low-income families, funded through states and administered by nonprofit organizations. Considerations for using WAP to help low-income consumers with energy costs include reaching households and potential allocation of allowance value from GHG emission control proposals. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) may face limitations in reaching all eligible low-income households due to its focus on single-family homes over multifamily structures. However, efforts to address this issue are being made through collaborations with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide more flexibility in weatherizing multifamily housing. The Department of Energy, HUD, and ARRA collaborated to allow WAP funds for HUD-subsidized multifamily housing with streamlined income verification. HUD spends $4 billion annually on energy costs in subsidized housing. Grantees can use up to 10% of WAP funds for administrative expenses and training. WAP funds aim to reduce home energy costs, freeing up funds for other expenses. The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) targets needy populations for services, prioritizing elderly residents, those with disabilities, families with children, high energy users, and households with high energy burdens. WAP adjusts benefits based on household size and income, using a formula that considers energy consumption and expenditures. Weatherization activities aim to promote energy efficiency and reduce overall household energy costs. After weatherization, households using natural gas for heating saw significant reductions in energy consumption. Congress could use non-energy-related programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit to assist low-income households. The EITC is a refundable tax credit based on income, age, and number of qualifying children. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit based on income, age, and number of qualifying children. For the 2008 tax year, maximum credits ranged from $438 to $4,824. The EITC reaches workers with earnings below a certain level but does not include those without earned income, such as retired individuals. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) may exclude low-income households without earned income and families with incomes too high to qualify. Congress could expand the program by increasing the credit rate or income eligibility. Administration of the EITC incurs administrative costs of 1% to 3% of benefits claimed. Households have flexibility in using funds, with the option to receive payments in a lump sum or spread out over the year. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is responsive to household size and income, growing with earned income and reaching a plateau before phasing out. However, it does not account for regional differences in energy prices. Incorporating regional differences would add complexity to the administrative process. Delivering funds to low-income households through Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) systems, used for SNAP and other benefits, has been proposed as an alternative to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to promote energy efficiency. All states and territories use EBT systems to distribute benefits, reaching millions of households. This option has been considered in Congress. Using EBT transfers to assist low-income consumers with energy costs has been proposed in Congress. The system would target low-income households and utilize existing administrative infrastructure for SNAP benefits. Approximately 39 million individuals from 18.5 million households could benefit from EBT rebates. The federal government shares SNAP administrative costs with states, totaling $5.7 billion in FY2007. Approximately 16-17% of SNAP dollars go towards administrative costs. In FY2007, $162 million was used to issue benefits and $1.5 billion to certify eligibility. EBT rebates could provide consumer flexibility similar to the EITC, benefiting approximately 39 million individuals from 18.5 million households. EBT rebates could offer consumer flexibility similar to the EITC, allowing households to prioritize needs. Benefits could be tailored based on family size and income, with the possibility of accounting for regional differences. This could potentially promote energy efficiency. The report discusses legislation in the 111th Congress proposing options to assist households with increased costs from a cap-and-trade program. The American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R. 2454) aims to reimburse households for these costs by distributing allowances to various entities. H.R. 2454 aims to assist households with increased costs from a cap-and-trade program by distributing emission allowances to local distribution companies and states, which would then use the value of the allowances to benefit residential and commercial consumers. The bill allocates allowances to electricity and natural gas LDCs, as well as states for the benefit of heating oil, propane, and kerosene consumers. A substantial portion of the allowances would support energy consumers in the early years of the program, with electricity LDCs receiving a diminishing portion over time. The allocation of emission allowances under H.R. 2454 would benefit energy consumers through local distribution companies (LDCs) and states. Allowances would decrease over time, with LDCs receiving a decreasing percentage until 2030 when allocations would cease. Electricity LDCs would receive allowances based on carbon content and electricity delivery, with benefits distributed equitably among ratepayer classes. Regulatory authorities would ensure LDCs comply with the bill's requirements. Electricity and natural gas Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) under H.R. 2454 must submit plans approved by state regulators to the EPA Administrator on how they will use emission allowances to benefit consumers. The EPA Administrator will audit a sample of suppliers annually to ensure allowances are used exclusively for retail ratepayers. Natural gas LDCs will initially receive allowances based on annual retail deliveries, later factoring in the number of customers. Both electricity and natural gas LDCs must deliver benefits to ratepayers based on usage, ensuring equitable distribution within each ratepayer class. H.R. 2454 requires electricity and natural gas Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) to submit plans on how they will use emission allowances to benefit consumers. Natural gas LDCs must use one-third of allowances for energy efficiency programs for natural gas consumers. States will receive allowances based on their share of heating oil, propane, and kerosene sales, with at least half used for energy efficiency programs and the rest for consumer rebates. EPA Administrator will audit companies annually to ensure compliance. H.R. 2454 mandates that states use emission allowances to provide rebates or financial assistance to consumers through energy efficiency programs. Small electricity LDCs would receive a percentage of emission allowances for low-income customer assistance. EPA Administrator will oversee the use of allowances and evaluate the effectiveness of energy efficiency measures. H.R. 2454 establishes a Climate Change Consumer Refund Account funded through the sale of allowances, with proceeds distributed as tax refunds on a per capita basis. It also creates an Energy Refund Program to reimburse eligible households for the loss in purchasing power due to energy price increases. Eligibility criteria and guidelines for the program would be set by the EPA Administrator. The proposed Title XXII of the Social Security Act would create the Energy Refund Program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services at the federal level and by state agencies. It would provide benefits to households with gross incomes at or below 150% of poverty, serving an estimated 34.4 million households in 2012. Eligible households already receiving certain need-tested benefits would automatically qualify for the program. The Energy Refund Program would provide benefits to households with gross incomes at or below 150% of poverty. Eligible households include those receiving certain need-tested benefits, citizens or noncitizens in the United States lawfully. The Secretary of HHS would determine if Medicaid or CHIP eligibility information can be used for automatic eligibility for the program. The Energy Refund Program would provide benefits to households with gross incomes at or below 150% of poverty, based on estimated loss in purchasing power caused by the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. Benefit amounts would vary by household size and be adjusted annually. Benefits would be paid monthly. The Energy Refund Program provides benefits to low-income households based on estimated loss in purchasing power from the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Benefits are adjusted annually and paid monthly or quarterly if too small. The annual benefit amount is relatively small, with a household of four receiving less than $400 per year. Compared to SNAP, the benefit is lower due to the early implementation of the cap-and-trade system with lower costs. The Energy Refund Program provides benefits to low-income households based on estimated loss in purchasing power from the American Clean Energy and Security Act. The benefit ends quickly above 150% of poverty, reaching $0 at about 159% of poverty. H.R. 2454 would require that all federal and federal-state income-based assistance programs disregard energy refund benefits for determining eligibility or benefit amounts. The Energy Refund Program benefits low-income households without affecting eligibility for programs like Medicaid, CHIP, SNAP, school lunch, or TANF. States can co-administer the program with SNAP through EBT cards. Direct deposit is also an option for receiving benefits. The Energy Refund Program benefits low-income households and can be delivered through direct deposit or other approved mechanisms. States can opt-in or opt-out of the program, which is administered by them but funded by the federal government. States must meet specific requirements for program administration, including using public employees for eligibility determinations and bilingual personnel in areas with non-English speakers. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is a refundable tax credit that supplements the earnings of low-income workers. It began as a temporary program in 1975, made permanent in 1978, and has been expanded several times since then. In 2006, the total value of the EITC was $44.4 billion, making it the largest low-income program providing cash assistance. It was first restricted to tax filers with children and was later expanded to include filers without children. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was initially limited to tax filers with children but was expanded in 1993 to include childless tax filers. The credit for childless filers is smaller and only available to those aged 25 to 64. In 2012, the credit for childless filers is 7.65% of earnings up to a maximum of $466. H.R. 2454 proposes to expand the EITC for certain childless filers who have experienced a reduction in purchasing power. The American Clean Energy and Security Act would impact tax filers with children by not changing their benefits. The expansion of the EITC proposed in H.R. 2454 would increase the maximum credit for filers without qualifying children to $932 in 2012. The income threshold for the EITC phase-out would be raised to $11,640 under H.R. 2454. The proposed EITC changes in H.R. 2454 would increase the maximum credit rate and income threshold for childless tax filers, expanding eligibility for those with income below $17,700. The bill does not alter the end-of-year refund provision for tax filers without qualifying children. The refundable portion of the EITC is considered a federal government outlay, with the CBO estimating an expansion in the EITC. The Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act (S. 1733) would increase outlays by $4.4 billion over five years and $15.7 billion over ten years. The bill is similar to H.R. 2454 in distributing allowances to electricity and natural gas LDCs to assist consumers, but does not specify the amount of allowances for LDCs. It also allocates allowances to states to assist heating oil and propane users. The bill S. 1733 does not specify the percentage of allowances allocated to states for heating oil and propane consumers. It creates a Consumer Rebate Fund funded through auction proceeds, with the President using the funds to provide relief to consumers. Additionally, an Energy Refund Program funded through auction proceeds aims to offset energy costs for low- and moderate-income households."
