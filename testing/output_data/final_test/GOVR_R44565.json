    "content": "The rapid growth of digital technologies has created new opportunities and challenges in international trade. Consumers access e-commerce, social media, and telemedicine, while businesses use technology for global supply chains and data analysis. The digital economy accounted for 6.9% of U.S. GDP in 2017, supporting 5.1 million jobs. The digital economy accounted for 3.3% of total U.S. employment in 2017, with two-thirds of jobs created since 2010 requiring medium or advanced digital skills. Digital trade, defined broadly by the U.S. International Trade Commission, involves delivering products and services over the Internet, excluding physical goods ordered online. Rules governing digital trade are evolving globally. The global rules governing digital trade are evolving as governments experiment with different approaches and consider diverse policy priorities. Barriers to digital trade, such as infringement of intellectual property rights or protective industrial policies, often overlap and cut across sectors. Policymakers may struggle to balance digital trade objectives with national security and privacy concerns. Recent issues include new trade barriers, data privacy concerns, and cybertheft incidents affecting U.S. consumers and companies. Congress aims to ensure global internet economy rules align with U.S. laws. The internet economy's global rules are evolving to align with U.S. laws. Trade negotiators are addressing digital issues in trade agreements like the USMCA. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping digital trade policy and overseeing agencies regulating cross-border data flows. The internet facilitates international trade and enables technological shifts in businesses. The internet is driving technological shifts in businesses, with global data flows growing faster than trade or financial flows. It is estimated that digital data will add 3.1% to GDP from 2015-2020. The digital economy's real value added outpaced overall growth, accounting for 25% of total real GDP growth in 2017. This growth in the digital economy parallels the increase in digital trade. The digital economy's real value added outpaced overall growth, accounting for 25% of total real GDP growth. Internet usage globally is increasing, with over half of the world's population using the internet. In the United States, 75% of households use wired internet access, but mobile internet access is also on the rise. Approximately 40% of internet traffic in the US comes from mobile devices. Cross-border data and communication flows are part of digital trade, facilitating trade and globalization. The highest levels of flows between the United States and Western Europe, Latin America, and China are key drivers of globalization. Efforts to impede cross-border data flows could decrease efficiency and benefits of digital trade. ICT spending is essential for digital trade and innovation, with world trade in ICT goods growing to $2 trillion in 2017. U.S. firms have a significant market share in semiconductors, a top U.S. ICT export. The global market share for semiconductors is dominated by the United States with 45%, and China accounts for 47.5% of its market. Countries like China are aiming to develop their semiconductor industry to reduce reliance on U.S. exports. ICT services trade has grown significantly, with the United States being the fourth-largest exporter after Ireland, India, and the Netherlands. ICT services encompass telecommunications, computer services, and intellectual property charges. These services can enhance the productivity and competitiveness of goods and services, with exports reaching $71 billion in 2017. The impact of the internet and digital revolution on the competitiveness of goods and services is significant. In 2017, ICT services exports reached $71 billion, with an additional $439 billion from services that could be ICT-enabled. The value added to U.S. GDP from software has increased over the past decade, surpassing that of telecommunications and hardware. Software contributed over $1.14 trillion to the U.S. GDP in 2016, creating 2.9 million jobs. Internet advertising, dependent on ICT, generated 10.4 million U.S. jobs. The rapid development of technology and increasing digitization are transforming finance, data flows, and the movement of goods and people. Digital technologies have a significant impact on global trade flows by enabling the creation of new goods and services, increasing productivity, and lowering costs. Companies utilize technologies like RFID tags, 3-D printing, and the Internet of Things to enhance supply chain tracking and production processes. Digital platforms also facilitate various forms of digital trade, such as e-commerce and cloud computing, across all industry sectors. Global e-commerce has seen significant growth, with business-to-business transactions accounting for 86% of the $27.7 trillion market in 2016. Cross-border business-to-consumer sales are projected to reach $1 trillion by 2020. Digitization brings efficiency benefits like logistics optimization, potentially increasing international trade by 6%. The potential impact of digitization on global trade includes reducing shipping and customs processing times by 16% to 28%, boosting overall trade by 6% to 11% by 2030. However, automation, AI, and 3-D printing could lead to more local production, potentially decreasing global trade by up to 10% by 2030. The global digital economy was estimated at $11.5 trillion in 2016, with a long-term ROI for digital technologies being 6.7 times that of nondigital investments. Blockchain technology is being used by some companies to increase efficiency and transparency in supply chains. Walmart and IBM collaborated to build a blockchain platform for global supply chain transparency and traceability of imported food products. The initiative involves multinational food suppliers, farmers, and retailers, utilizing the Internet of Things and open data flows. Studies suggest that the Internet of Things could have a significant economic impact, benefiting businesses and communities worldwide. Increased internet usage leads to higher productivity gains for companies. The internet, including cloud services, is seen as a great equalizer for businesses, allowing small companies access to the same computing power as large firms. Digital platforms can reduce costs and help small and medium-sized enterprises expand their reach to customers and suppliers. Over 50% of businesses globally rely on data flows for cloud computing, while digitization of customs and border control processes can streamline delivery of goods. Blockchain technology is being considered by regulators to improve efficiency in managing data for border control and customs processing of international shipments. Simplified border and customs processes enable more firms to conduct business in global markets. For example, Netflix saw a significant increase in international revenue from $4 million in 2010 to over $5 billion in 2017. The power of the internet is also seen as a tool for economic development in low- and middle-income countries. Technology has enabled SMEs to expand into new sectors like ride-sharing and online delivery services, offering them a greater opportunity to grow. The internet has been found to create more jobs than it displaces, with companies using it intensively doubling job creation. The U.S. digital economy supported 3.3% of total employment in 2017, with jobs in this sector earning higher compensation than the average. Software contributes to the GDP in all 50 states. The software industry contributes to the GDP in all 50 states, with the value-added GDP growing more than 40% in Idaho and North Carolina. Industries like media and firms in urban centers benefit the most. E-friction, obstacles hindering online economy benefits, can be caused by infrastructure, industry, individual, and information issues. Government policies can influence e-friction levels, with lower e-friction associated with larger digital economies. The digital economy brings both positive and negative impacts, including the displacement of unskilled workers and the potential for internet monopolies. New technologies offer opportunities for efficiency and revenue growth but also disrupt supply chains and labor markets. Skills gaps exist in job markets, such as in Nashville and Michigan, highlighting the need for workers with IT skills. The World Bank identified policy areas to ensure the benefits of digitization, including establishing a competitive business climate, developing human capital, improving infrastructure, and raising digital literacy skills. The United States ranks high in global competitiveness, with key drivers of productivity being human capital, innovation, resilience, and agility. Investment in digital skills is crucial for future productivity. The report highlights concerns about weakening social fabric, security issues, and lack of transparency. Digital skills are crucial for economic growth, with over two-thirds of US jobs created since 2010 requiring them. The OECD found that many workers lack sufficient ICT skills, and few countries have comprehensive strategies to help them adapt to changing jobs. Policies affecting digitization can have global consequences due to the interconnected nature of the internet. Protectionist measures may hinder digital progress. The digital economy's global impact is significant, with protectionist policies potentially fracturing the internet and hindering digital trade. Policymakers have differing views on the necessity of such measures to protect domestic interests. Challenges in designing policies around digital trade include conflicting goals of enabling the internet, promoting competition, and safeguarding privacy. The U.S. government prioritizes a free and open internet. The U.S. government prioritizes a free and open internet, taking a decentralized approach to digital trade policies. The Department of Commerce promotes U.S. digital trade policies domestically and abroad through its Digital Economy Agenda, focusing on promoting a free and open internet worldwide and promoting trust online. The Department of Commerce promotes trust online, ensures access for workers and companies, and promotes innovation through its digital attach\u00e9 program and efforts to challenge foreign trade barriers in digital trade. Removing foreign barriers to digital trade can have significant economic benefits for the U.S., including increasing GDP, wages, and job opportunities in digitally intensive industries. Trade policymakers historically focused on overt trade barriers like tariffs, but nontariff barriers such as discriminatory regulations can also hinder digital trade. Since 1998, WTO countries have agreed not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions, covering goods and services. The United States, a major exporter and importer of ICT goods, benefits from free trade agreements and the WTO Information Technology Agreement, which eliminate tariffs on many products. However, tariffs can still act as trade barriers for countries or products not covered by these agreements. U.S. ICT services, important inputs for final demand products, have shown growth since 2014. Nontariff barriers, like discriminatory regulations, can also hinder digital trade. Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in digital trade, unlike tariffs, are harder to quantify and can hinder companies doing business abroad. These barriers often take the form of discriminatory laws or regulations that impede the free flow of digital trade. Nondiscrimination between local and foreign suppliers is a key principle in global trading rules and U.S. free trade agreements. However, there is no explicit provision for nondiscrimination in digital goods, which could limit market entry for providers. Governance issues like rule of law, transparency, and investor protections can also create barriers to successful digital trade. Market access restrictions on investment and foreign ownership can further hinder engagement in digital trade. Non-tariff barriers in digital trade, such as market access restrictions and localization measures, can limit a company's ability to enter foreign markets. These barriers can be used to protect domestic industries and intellectual property, acting as nontariff barriers to market access. The United States aims to eliminate digital trade barriers in free trade agreements. Data localization measures have doubled globally in the last six years, with over 120 countries having laws related to personal data protection. These regulations restrict cross-border data flows and require local storage, hindering companies that rely on the internet for international transactions. This can limit e-commerce activities and the analysis of big data by multinational firms. Data localization regulations may increase costs and cybersecurity risks for companies by forcing them to build local server infrastructure within a country. This can hinder efficiency and growth, especially for cloud computing services dominated by U.S. companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM. Data localization regulations pose barriers for firms and countries consuming cloud services, impacting U.S. companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM. The Business Software Alliance highlighted obstacles in Indonesia, Russia, and Vietnam. Google is expanding data centers globally to comply with localization requirements. A global consensus on data flows, cybersecurity, and privacy is crucial for trust in the digital environment and international trade. Countries are debating solutions. Countries are debating how to achieve the right balance in plurilateral and multilateral trade negotiations regarding cross-border data flow restrictions and localization policies. These policies include requirements for using local content, infrastructure, or partnering with local companies, which can pose a threat to intellectual property. The Commerce Department announced plans to address forced localization policies impacting U.S. information and communications technology hardware manufacturing. The Commerce Department aims to preserve the competitiveness of the U.S. ICT sector in response to protectionist localization policies globally. Intellectual property rights (IPR) are crucial in the digital age, with patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets being key examples. Digital technologies fuel IPR infringement, presenting ongoing challenges for enforcement. Innovations in digital technologies drive intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement by enabling rapid duplication and distribution of copyrighted content. Copyright- and trademark-based industries face challenges in tackling infringement in physical and online marketplaces. Cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets is a growing concern, particularly in industries like ICT, services, biopharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and environmental technologies. Quantifying IPR infringement in the digital environment is difficult but considered significant. The value of digitally pirated music, movies, and software is estimated to be significant, potentially reaching $384-$856 billion by 2022. The annual cost to the U.S. economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software, and theft of trade secrets could exceed $600 billion. Efforts to address IPR infringement raise concerns about balancing protection of content holders' rights with ensuring valuable uses. IP theft impacts sales, legitimate services, and innovation in the digital environment. Content industries argue that IP theft has various negative impacts, including loss of sales, harm to legitimate services, damage to brand reputation, and negative effects on investors and consumers. Some technology companies and civil society groups believe that overly strict IPR policies could hinder information flow and digital trade, advocating for \"fair use\" exceptions. Additionally, barriers to digital trade related to IPR include government measures promoting domestic innovation that may disadvantage foreign companies, such as forced localization requirements in countries like China. Local or national standards that deviate significantly from recognized international standards may hinder firms from entering a market. Proprietary standards can limit a firm's ability to serve a market if their practices do not align with those standards, leading to difficulties in reaching customers or partners in certain countries. In some countries, strict conformity assessment and registration requirements can hinder companies from entering new markets. For instance, India's Compulsory Registration Order (CRO) mandates product registration with specific laboratories, causing delays for U.S. businesses. Additionally, some nations impose strict control over digital data, potentially deterring companies from entering markets where they may have to disclose proprietary information. Governments imposing nontariff barriers by filtering or blocking websites hinder access to information. China's \"Great Firewall\" restricts VPN access, while Thailand and Russia also block websites for various reasons. In response to concerns about harmful online content, some countries have introduced legislation to regulate internet content, while others face First Amendment freedom of speech issues. This results in varying levels of online access across countries due to national policies and preferences. The complexity of the internet and evolving technologies, along with the lack of global standards in international trade, lead to differences in national-level net neutrality policies. Net neutrality rules govern internet traffic management over broadband services, creating potential nontariff barriers. The growth in digital trade raises cybersecurity concerns, involving the protection of ICT systems from cyberattacks. Cybersecurity is crucial for protecting ICT systems from unauthorized access and cyberattacks, aiming to prevent theft, disruption, and damage. It is essential for safeguarding data and privacy, although they are not the same. Cyberattacks can have significant impacts on financial systems, national security, and digital trade. Malicious cyberactivity cost the U.S. economy up to $109 billion in 2016. All industry sectors relying on digital information are at risk of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity threats across various industries include Iranian hackers targeting HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" episodes and Chinese hackers attacking Marriot's Starwood hotel chain, potentially stealing intellectual property and personal information of millions of customers. These cyberattacks can disrupt business operations and supply chains, with significant financial impacts. Cyberattacks have caused over $8 billion in direct costs globally, affecting various sectors. The United States attributed a major attack to North Korea, emphasizing the risk to lives. Compromised supply chains, like with Supermicro microchips, pose threats to organizations. Enhanced encryption for cloud services can protect data but may hinder law enforcement investigations. Restrictions on encryption use may increase vulnerability to cyberattacks. The need for policies and regulations to balance encryption use in firms to prevent cyberattacks is highlighted. The EU and China pose challenges for U.S. digital trade partners, affecting digital flows and international trade. Varied approaches to digital trade, privacy, and national security between the U.S. and EU have impacted data flows. The transatlantic economy is the largest globally, with U.S.-EU trade nearly doubling from $594 billion to $1.2 trillion between 2003 and 2017, with ICT services playing a significant role. ICT-enabled services accounted for approximately $190 billion of U.S. exports to the EU in 2017, with the UK alone contributing 23% of U.S. digitally deliverable services exports. Almost 40% of data flows between the United States and EU are through business and research networks, causing friction in their economic and security relations. Negotiations for a broad FTA between the United States and EU began in 2013 but were not concluded. Negotiations for a broad FTA between the United States and EU began in 2013 but were not concluded. The Trump Administration notified Congress of its intent to negotiate with the EU on digital trade issues. The negotiations aim to address market access for digital products, IPR protection, cybersecurity, and regulatory cooperation. The EU's negotiating mandates are narrower, focusing on industrial tariffs and nontariff regulatory barriers. The Trump Administration aims to ease regulatory barriers for companies to meet US and EU technical requirements. They also plan to negotiate a trade agreement with the UK post-Brexit, focusing on digital trade issues. The UK cannot negotiate until it exits the EU, which currently handles trade deals for all member states. Uncertainty surrounds the future UK-EU trade relationship and when the UK will regain control of its trade policy. This uncertainty impacts the prospects of a US-UK free trade agreement. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield agreements provide frameworks for data protection when transferring personal data between the EU, United States, and Switzerland. The agreements include requirements for U.S. companies to self-certify compliance with data processing obligations, with oversight and enforcement mechanisms in place. Annual joint reviews are conducted to ensure compliance with the agreements. The Privacy Shield involves an annual joint review by the US and EU, with the second review completed in October 2018. The EU's GDPR, effective May 2018, establishes rules for safeguarding personal data and grants new rights to individuals. The GDPR applies to entities processing personal data of individuals in the EU, regardless of location, and has raised concerns about its extraterritorial implications. While the GDPR is directly applicable at the EU level, individual countries are responsible for establishing national rules and enforcement authorities. Some U.S. stakeholders are concerned about lack of clarity, compliance guidelines, and high costs of data storage. Despite this, many companies, like Amazon, have taken steps to comply with GDPR requirements. Amazon and other companies are striving for GDPR compliance to avoid penalties and remain in the EU market. Some U.S. businesses have exited the market due to challenges in understanding and complying with GDPR requirements. The GDPR may set new global data privacy standards, with some countries outside Europe adopting similar regulations. European Data Protection Authorities have initiated enforcement actions, raising concerns among U.S. companies. EU policymakers are enforcing regulations like the GDPR and Digital Single Market to harmonize the region and drive economic growth. The DSM aims to improve online access, support fair competition, and promote investment in infrastructure and innovation. China poses both opportunities and challenges for the US in digital trade. China's rapid economic modernization and growing population have led to a significant increase in Internet users, making it a major player in global ecommerce. With 829 million internet users as of March 2019 and online retail sales totaling $1.1 trillion in 2018, China's e-commerce market is the world's largest. U.S. firms have opportunities for digital trade in China, but they also face challenges outlined in the USTR's 2019 report on foreign trade barriers. The USTR's report on foreign trade barriers highlighted Chinese digital policies restricting cross-border data flows, web filtering, and cloud computing. The AmCham China 2019 survey showed 73% of technology and R&D-intensive industries faced market barriers in China, citing insufficient IPR protection and restrictive cybersecurity policies. The AmCham China 2019 survey revealed that restrictive cybersecurity policies and other Chinese ICT policies are hindering firms from increasing innovation activities in China. The survey also showed that 72% to 88% of respondents felt that these measures impacted their competitiveness and operations in China. China was found to have the most restrictive digital policies according to a Digital Trade Restrictiveness Index. China's restrictive digital policies, including public procurement, foreign investment, Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), competition policy, intermediary liability, content access, and standards, impose higher costs and can block digital trade. China's data policies are burdensome, with quantitative trade restrictions and restrictions on e-commerce. The Chinese government promotes \"Internet Sovereignty\" to regulate and control the internet, first introduced in a 2010 White Paper titled \"the Internet of China.\" The Chinese government promotes \"Internet Sovereignty\" to regulate and control the internet within Chinese territory. In 2014, the Central Internet Security and \"Informatization\" Leading Group was established to strengthen China's Internet security. President Xi Jinping emphasized respecting individual countries' right to choose their own cyber development path. China's internet sovereignty initiative is seen as a way for the government to assert control over the internet within its borders, potentially limiting freedom of speech and market access for foreign technology firms. Critics also point out China's role in global IP theft and cybertheft of U.S. trade secrets. China is known for being the world's most active perpetrator of economic espionage, with Chinese actors frequently engaging in cyber intrusions targeting U.S. private sector firms. The U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence warns that China's goal is to surpass Western powers by collecting sensitive U.S. economic information through interrelationships with U.S. companies. This includes employing Chinese technical experts at U.S. facilities and offshoring production and research to China, providing more opportunities for Chinese government agencies and businesses to gather valuable data. In May 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted five members of the People's Liberation Army for cyber-espionage against U.S. firms. President Obama issued sanctions in April 2015, leading to a cyber-security agreement between the U.S. and China in September 2015. The U.S. and China agreed not to support cyber theft of IP for competitive advantage, establish a joint dialogue on cybercrime, promote norms of state behavior in cyberspace, and provide timely responses to cyber threats. They also set up a high-level dialogue mechanism to address cybercrime and improve communication. The U.S. and China established a joint dialogue on cybercrime in December 2015, agreeing on guidelines for requesting assistance and responding to cyber threats. The dialogue continued in 2016 and 2017 under the Trump Administration. The effectiveness of the 2015 cyber agreement in reducing Chinese cyber intrusions remains uncertain due to lack of official U.S. statistics. The Section 301 trade dispute may have led to a suspension of the dialogue. The Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center reported ongoing cyber activity from China, with lower volumes post-2015 agreements. CrowdStrike identified China as a major threat actor in 2018, targeting various sectors. U.S. officials linked China to economic espionage and trade secrets cases. China has not fully met WTO market opening commitments according to USTR's 2017 report. China has not fulfilled all of its WTO market opening commitments, maintaining \"mercantilist policies under the guise of cybersecurity.\" The Chinese government pledged not to unfairly burden foreign ICT firms with new cyber and national security laws. Concerns include ambiguous terms like \"secure and controllable\" for critical information infrastructure and proposals that could require foreign ICT firms to hand over proprietary information. The Cybers ecurity Law passed by the Chinese government on November 7, 2016, aims to promote indigenous technologies and impose restrictions on foreign firms. Multinational companies are concerned about the lack of clarity in the law's requirements and its potential impact on their operations. The National Security Law in China, enacted in July 2015, emphasizes the state's role in reviewing foreign commercial investment, technology, and internet services that impact national security. This could significantly affect U.S. ICT firms, with concerns over China's IP and technology policies leading to a Section 301 investigation by the Trump Administration in 2017. President Trump signed a Memorandum on Actions by the United States in March 2018. U.S. exports of ICT services to China totaled $18.7 billion in 2017. President Trump signed a Memorandum in March 2018 identifying China's IPR-related policies justifying U.S. action under Section 301, costing the U.S. economy $50 billion annually. The Administration proposed implementing 25% tariffs on certain Chinese imports. The Trump Administration proposed implementing 25% ad valorem tariffs on certain Chinese imports, initiated a WTO dispute settlement case against China's technology licensing practices, and proposed new investment restrictions on Chinese acquisition of sensitive U.S. technology. Congress passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 to modernize the U.S. review process for foreign investments in terms of national security. Tariff hikes were subsequently imposed on imports from China, while China increased tariffs on imports from the United States. The United States and China engaged in tariff increases on imports in 2018. Digital trade issues lack consistent international rules, leading to uneven treatment in trade agreements. Bilateral and plurilateral deals are starting to address digital trade due to the stalemate in WTO negotiations. The use of digital trade provisions in bilateral and plurilateral trade negotiations may influence future WTO frameworks focusing on digital trade. While no comprehensive agreement on digital trade exists in the WTO, other agreements cover some aspects, and new negotiations may establish new rules. GATS, which predates the current internet reach, includes obligations on nondiscrimination and transparency for all service sectors. Market access obligations under GATS are based on a \"positive list\" approach. Market access obligations under GATS are based on a \"positive list\" approach where each party must opt in for a service sector to be covered. GATS covers trade in services via electronic means but does not specifically address digital trade barriers. The Committee on Specific Commitments is exploring how new online services and regulations could be classified within GATS. The WTO established the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce in 1998, including a temporary customs duties moratorium on electronic transmission. The Information Technology Agreement (ITA) aims to eliminate tariffs on internet-related goods, with an expanded version in effect since 2016. The expanded ITA is a plurilateral agreement among 54 WTO members, but some countries like Vietnam and India did not join. The expanded ITA, a plurilateral agreement among 54 WTO members, extends benefits on a most-favored nation basis. Parties agreed to review the agreement's scope for additional product coverage as technology evolves. While the WTO ITA boosts trade in technology products, it does not address nontariff barriers. The TRIPS Agreement, effective since 1995, sets minimum IPR standards but does not specifically cover the digital environment. The TRIPS Agreement, effective since 1995, covers copyrights, trademarks, patents, and other forms of intellectual property. It aims to balance rights between private rights holders and public benefits, with obligations for WTO members to implement it fully by 1996. The TRIPS Agreement, effective since 1995, covers copyrights, trademarks, patents, and other forms of intellectual property. It includes provisions on computer programs, data compilations, and copyright protection for databases. TRIPS allows for reviews to consider modifications in light of new developments, such as electronic commerce. The WIPO Internet Treaties, established in 1996 and enforced in 2002, address international norms for intellectual property rights protection in the digital environment. These treaties, shaped by the TRIPS Agreement, clarify the application of existing rights in the digital realm. The WIPO Internet Treaties clarify existing rights in the digital environment, create new online rights, and maintain a balance between rights owners and the public. They include provisions for legal protection against circumventing TPMs and altering rights management information. The issue of liability for online service providers was left to national governments to determine. As of March 2019, the WIPO Internet Treaties had 96 contracting parties. The WIPO Internet Treaties had 96 contracting parties as of March 2019. The United States implemented the treaties through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which set new standards for protecting copyrights in the digital environment. India recently joined the treaties in December 2018. The United States is urging trading partners like Turkey and Mexico to fully implement the WIPO Internet Treaties. In December 2017, the United States, along with over 70 WTO members, agreed to explore future negotiations on electronic commerce. The U.S. objectives include market access, data flows, protection of intellectual property, and digital security measures. The e-commerce initiative was formally launched in January 2019, with participation from advanced economies and developing countries. India opted out to maintain flexibility for domestic firms and potential customs duties in the future. After the meeting, the U.S. Trade Representative emphasized the need for a high-standard agreement with enforceable obligations. The EU highlighted potential new rules on e-signatures, customs duties, source code disclosure, and data localization. Concerns were raised about the EU seeking limited commitments on cross-border data flows. China proposed exploratory discussions rather than establishing obligations on data flows and storage. Negotiating parties are discussing the scope of a potential agreement, but challenges may arise due to differing approaches and policies among the U.S., EU, and China in the digital economy. The WTO agreements have limited treatment of digital trade, leading the United States to establish new rules in its trade negotiations. E-commerce chapters in US FTAs focus on removing trade barriers, nondiscrimination of digital products, customs duties prohibition, transparency, and cooperation on topics like SMEs and cross-border information flows. The U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS) has robust digital trade provisions, including measures to promote e-commerce, consumer protection, electronic authentication, and paperless trading. It addresses cross-border information flows and internet access for consumer choice and market competition. The financial services chapter also contains important provisions. The KORUS agreement includes enforceable commitments for cross-border data flows in financial services. In 2018, limited modifications were made to the agreement, with no changes to digital trade provisions. The proposed USMCA with Canada and Mexico aims to update NAFTA and includes provisions from the TPP. The USMCA establishes new rules to remove trade barriers and counter discriminatory actions. The USMCA agreement includes provisions to remove trade barriers and counter discriminatory actions in digital trade. It prohibits customs duties, discrimination against digital products, and technology transfer mandates. The agreement protects electronic authentication, signatures, and consumer access to the Internet. It also requires anti-spam measures, online consumer privacy protection, and cross-border data flow protection. The USMCA agreement promotes open data flows for financial services and prohibits liability of internet intermediaries. It also encourages cooperation on cybersecurity, privacy, and SMEs. Digital trade issues intersect with privacy and national security priorities. The G-20 and OECD provide forums to discuss digital economy principles and norms, with a focus on privacy and data governance. The OECD issued reports on digital trade and gender divide, highlighting challenges and recommendations for national digital strategies and market access barriers. The United States can collaborate with OECD partners on principles like an open Internet and public policy balance. The OECD Global Forum on Digital Security for Prosperity fosters international engagement on governance issues. APEC provides a platform for sharing best practices and setting principles, especially for developing countries. APEC is implementing the Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) system to address privacy issues in developing countries with less advanced digital economies. The system aims to reflect a diversity of national privacy regimes and currently includes countries like the United States, Japan, and Canada. Some view CBPR as a scalable solution for potential multilateral adoption, while others prefer the EU regime for a more comprehensive approach. APEC's voluntary nature has allowed it to incubate plurilateral agreements and promote regulatory cooperation. APEC has been an incubator for potential plurilateral agreements and regulatory cooperation efforts. These forums allow U.S. agencies to collaborate with overseas counterparts on digital trade issues like online privacy and consumer protection. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield exemplifies regulatory authorities working together to address such issues in the evolving internet-driven economy. The complexity of digital trade involves balancing open data flows with privacy, security, and law enforcement concerns. Stakeholders have competing interests, with some focusing on market access and others on limiting foreign competition. Privacy advocates seek to protect personal information, while defense advisors prioritize national security interests. Digital trade raises complex issues for Congress, including economic impact, localization barriers, and balancing market openness with privacy and national security concerns. Key considerations include the need for a digital privacy policy, addressing trade barriers and cybertheft, and ensuring network reliability and security. The text chunk discusses ensuring public trust in network reliability and security for the global digital economy, analyzing evolving U.S. trade policies, assessing tools for measuring digital trade impact, and evaluating the effectiveness of Section 301 actions on Chinese trade practices and cybersecurity. Key issues include discriminatory treatment of digital goods, duties on digital services, and barriers to internet services. The curr_chunk discusses various barriers to digital trade, including taxes on digital goods and services, foreign investment restrictions, intermediary liability, customs duties on imported goods, \"snippet tax\" on search engines, taxes on OTT services, web filtering, data localization requirements, technology barriers, and privacy regulations. Technology Barriers Restrictions on encryption, source code transfer requirements, local testing for imported IT equipment, cybersecurity threats, and weak IPR enforcement are some of the barriers to digital trade."
