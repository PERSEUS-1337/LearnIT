The 10th Amendment to the Constitution limits Federal Government powers to those delegated by the Constitution, protecting States' freedom. It reflects the Founding Fathers' opposition to expansive Federal powers and their intention for States to check Federal power. The 10th Amendment limits Federal Government powers to those delegated by the Constitution, preserving powers for the States as intended by the Founding Fathers. The Supreme Court has affirmed that powers not granted to the United States are reserved for the States or the people. The 10th Amendment prohibits Congress from infringing on states' rights and ensures that both the federal government and states have distinct powers. It is crucial for Congress to uphold and protect the 10th Amendment, recognizing its significance in today's society. SPECIAL STANDING FOR STATE OFFICIALS TO CHALLENGE FEDERAL RULEMAKING AS A 10TH AMENDMENT VIOLATION. State officials have the right to challenge the constitutionality of proposed Federal rules under the 10th Amendment. The Federal agency must post a link to any legal brief challenging the rule on its website. The agency must respond within 15 days unless they decide not to implement the rule. The agency must certify in writing that a rule does not violate the 10th Amendment and post this certification on its website. Within 15 days of a State official submitting a brief challenging a rule, the agency must notify all designated State officials. If a State official decides to take legal action, the venue and jurisdiction for such actions are specified. Designated State officials can challenge Federal rules that violate the 10th Amendment in the United States district court. Expedited review by the relevant United States Court of Appeals is available upon request. The term \"designated State official\" refers to the chief executive, lieutenant governor, chief legal officer, or legislative leader of a State.
