The RECLAIM Act of 2016 requires documentation of the project's role in economic development and future use of the site for various purposes after reclamation activities are completed. The RECLAIM Act of 2016 requires documentation demonstrating that the project will meet specific criteria, including being located in a community affected by recent decline in mining. This can be shown through economic indicators such as employment data or per capita income, or by being a community that traditionally relied on coal mining for its economy.
