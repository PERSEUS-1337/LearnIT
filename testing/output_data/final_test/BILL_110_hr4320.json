They must also respond to inquiries about claims within 3 years of the provision of healthcare services. Entities providing health care items or services must agree not to deny a claim submitted by the State based on submission date, claim form type, or lack of documentation at the point-of-sale. The State must submit the claim within 3 years of service and enforce its rights within 6 years. Entities providing services to individuals receiving medical assistance may inquire with third parties responsible for payment to determine eligibility and coverage. Referrals to the Secretary are required to maintain the integrity of the Medicaid program.
