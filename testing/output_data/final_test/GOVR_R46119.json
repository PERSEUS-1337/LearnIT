    "content": "The federal government has been transitioning to cloud-based services since 2009 to reduce IT costs and improve efficiency, accessibility, collaboration, reliability, and security. However, challenges such as security concerns, complexity of migrating legacy applications, lack of skilled staff, and uncertain funding persist as agencies shift to cloud services. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services from a remote location through a network, usually the internet. It is akin to the networked delivery of utilities like electricity and water. This approach is reminiscent of sharing a central mainframe computer before the personal computer era. The report discusses different cloud deployment models, federal government IT reform planning, agency cloud adoption assessments, recent congressional actions, and mechanisms for monitoring agency cloud implementation. Cloud computing is a powerful and flexible model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access. It differs from local computing by utilizing remote servers to perform tasks and store data. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed standardized language to clarify the ambiguity surrounding cloud computing. Cloud computing enables convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources. It is characterized by five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models. NIST has identified on-demand self-service as a key feature. Cloud computing allows users to access computing capabilities on-demand from anywhere with network access. Resources are shared among users, allowing for rapid scalability based on immediate needs. Analogies include changing TV stations and adjusting electricity usage. Cloud computing offers different models like public, private, community, and hybrid to meet varying user needs. Federal agencies have increased cloud adoption, but better tracking of cost and savings data is needed. Public cloud computing offers services to a large group of customers over the internet on a metered basis. It provides benefits in terms of price and flexibility but may raise security concerns for federal use. Businesses with low privacy concerns predominantly use this deployment model. Private cloud works like public cloud computing but on a private network controlled by a single organization. It may offer similar services with fewer risks but can be costly and challenging to manage hardware and software. Community cloud allows organizations with similar needs to share infrastructure for potential benefits of public cloud with more customization options. A hybrid cloud combines internal (private or community) and external (public) providers for a flexible deployment model that allows users to balance legal compliance, security, and scalability. Cloud computing offers various services, from basic computing tasks to sophisticated applications. The NIST definition categorizes cloud computing services into three basic models. SaaS allows customers to use applications remotely provided by the provider. PaaS enables customers to create applications on the provider's infrastructure using tools supplied by the provider. Examples include Google Apps and Facebook. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides fundamental computing resources for customers to use as they wish, allowing them to install and control operating systems and applications. Examples of IaaS providers are Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. This is similar to purchasing a desktop computer and installing the desired operating system to create custom applications and run necessary software. Cloud providers offer infrastructure, platform, and software services remotely, freeing customers from local infrastructure and support. Federal agencies began planning for cloud adoption in 2010 to reform IT management and shift to a \"Cloud First\" strategy. The federal government shifted to a \"Cloud First\" strategy for more economical, faster, and flexible IT management. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) aimed to increase cloud adoption. The Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) was refocused to include cloud services, superseded by the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) updated the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy to Cloud Smart in 2018. The updated DCOI, issued in June 2019, requires approval from OMB to build or expand agency-owned data centers. Agencies must evaluate consolidation options in line with the Cloud Smart Strategy. The Cloud Smart Strategy focuses on security, procurement, and workforce pillars to maximize cloud technology potential. The Cloud Smart Strategy emphasizes upskilling, retraining, and recruiting key talent for cybersecurity, acquisition, and cloud engineering. By December 2020, 22 \"action items\" are to be completed, with over half already done by November 2019. A Government Accountability Office report in April 2019 showed that 10 out of 16 agencies increased their use of cloud services from FY2016 to FY2019, with progress varying in implementing cloud services. All agencies reported an increase in cloud service spending since 2015. GAO found that 16 agencies increased cloud service spending since 2015. 13 agencies saved $291 million using cloud services. 15 agencies benefited from improved customer service and cost-effective IT options. Challenges included inconsistent spending tracking and confusion over guidance interpretation. The GAO found that agencies faced challenges in tracking cloud spending data, leading to underreported figures. They made recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve reporting on cloud savings and assessments. Agencies were urged to report savings associated with cloud investments quarterly and establish guidance for assessing IT investments for cloud suitability. The 116th Congress has been overseeing IT acquisitions, including cloud computing activities. Legislation such as the FedRAMP Authorization Act aims to establish a risk management process for leveraging cloud services. Hearings have focused on reducing duplicative efforts and cost inefficiencies in IT modernization through cloud adoption. The Committee on Financial Services Task Force on AI discussed AI's role in improving cloud management during a hearing. The House Committee on Oversight and Reform holds FITARA oversight hearings twice a year to assess agency adoption of cloud computing. Congress monitors federal departments' progress in IT modernization, including cloud adoption. Congress can oversee the implementation of cloud computing in federal departments by holding hearings, requesting reviews from agencies or the GAO, and assessing progress against the Cloud Smart Strategy goals. OMB plays a key role in managing the strategy, and congressional review of its practices is crucial to ensure effective implementation. Policymakers may monitor agencies' compliance with federal directives and GAO assessments as they migrate to cloud services. Monitoring can be done internally, externally by GAO, or by congressional committees. GAO provides status reports on cloud adoption but not on individual agencies. Internal assessments could be based on the Cloud Smart Strategy progress. When examining agencies' implementation of the Cloud Smart Strategy, Congress could request follow-up reviews focused on specific challenges identified by GAO."
