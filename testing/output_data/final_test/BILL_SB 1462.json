    "title": "SB 1462",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 23612 of the Vehicle Code is amended to require individuals lawfully arrested for driving offenses related to alcohol or drugs to consent to chemical testing of their blood or breath. If blood or breath tests are unavailable, urine testing may be required. The testing must be done during a lawful arrest and authorized by a peace officer with reasonable cause to believe the person violated certain driving laws. Failure to submit to required chemical testing during a lawful arrest will result in fines, mandatory imprisonment upon conviction of certain violations, and suspension or revocation of driving privileges for up to three years. The refusal to submit to chemical testing during a lawful arrest can lead to a three-year suspension of driving privileges if it occurs within 10 years of multiple violations or convictions related to driving offenses. If lawfully arrested for driving under the influence, the person can choose between a blood or breath test. If unable to complete the chosen test, they must submit to the remaining test. The same choice applies for driving under the influence of drugs or a combination of alcohol and drugs. If a person arrested for driving under the influence chooses to submit to a breath test, they may also be asked to take a blood test if the officer suspects drug involvement. The officer must provide reasons for this request and the person must comply with the additional test, completing a blood test or a urine test if unable to do so. If a person is lawfully arrested for DUI and needs medical treatment before a blood or breath test, they can choose from available tests at the medical facility. The officer must inform them of the available tests and their choice is limited to those options. The officer must inform the person of their rights regarding testing for DUI, including the fact that they do not have the right to have an attorney present. If a person is unconscious or unable to refuse, a test may be administered without their consent. A person with hemophilia or a heart condition using anticoagulants is exempt from blood tests for DUI but must complete a urine test. If lawfully arrested for DUI, a person can request a blood or breath test for alcohol content. If a blood or breath test is unavailable, the person must submit to a urine test to determine alcohol levels. Refusal or failure to complete a chemical test results in suspension of driving privileges. If a peace officer serves a notice of suspension or revocation of a driver's license, they must take possession of all licenses held by the person. A temporary driver's license is valid for 30 days from the date of arrest. The officer must forward a copy of the notice and any licenses taken, along with test results, to the department within 15 days of the arrest. In administrative proceedings, documents from the governmental forensic laboratory database are the best evidence of chemical test results. Official records related to chemical test analysis from the database are admissible as evidence with certification by a department employee. The document described must have a certification from a department employee confirming it was retrieved from a governmental forensic laboratory database and accurately reflects the data received. (h) A preliminary alcohol screening test based on a breath sample can establish reasonable cause for a DUI violation, while a preliminary oral fluid screening test based on a drug sample can also be used for the same purpose. Failure to certify under subparagraph (A) by a department employee is not considered a public offense. When conducting a field sobriety test like 23153, an officer may use a preliminary alcohol or oral fluid screening test to determine if a person is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. However, submitting to this screening test does not fulfill the obligation to take a blood, breath, or urine test for determining alcohol or drug content. The person has the right to refuse the preliminary screening test."
