    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Disease Research Revitalization Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the significant impact of past investments in cancer and Alzheimer's disease research on improving health, quality of life, and reducing healthcare costs. Federal funding has expanded scientific knowledge, revolutionized medicine, and contributed to the growth of biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Many new drugs and procedures are based on research supported by the National Institutes of Health. Unless we make a new commitment to cancer and Alzheimer's disease research, one out of two Americans alive today will fall victim to one or both of these diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's threaten millions of Americans, strain the healthcare system, and impact Medicare and Medicaid. Cancer is the second leading cause of death, with 552,000 Americans expected to die from it this year. Women, who are underrepresented in medical research, are severely affected by diseases like breast cancer, which will kill over 43,900. The curr_chunk discusses various diseases such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. It highlights the number of deaths caused by these diseases each year and the impact of the aging population on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. The mapping and sequencing of the human genome are expected to revolutionize molecular medicine. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for increased investment in research and technology to address diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. Americans support more funding for research in these areas, with the potential to reduce disease incidence. Asthma affects millions of Americans, leading to significant healthcare costs. The leading child disease in America is asthma, affecting almost 5,000,000 children and resulting in over $6 billion in healthcare costs annually. In addition to existing authorizations for cancer, Alzheimer's, and asthma research in fiscal year 2002, an additional $2 billion is authorized for these purposes. The House of Representatives also believes that the budget resolution for fiscal year 2002 should reflect this authorization. Additionally, there is a sense of the House regarding authorizations of appropriations for fiscal years 2003 through 2006. The House of Representatives supports increasing funding for cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and asthma research by $2 billion for fiscal year 2003 and $1 billion for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2006."
