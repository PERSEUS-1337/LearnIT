Federal preemption prohibits states or political subdivisions from enforcing mortgage loan laws on reverse mortgage loans unless the laws specifically mention reverse mortgages. This provision does not affect laws on traditional mortgage loans and does not limit states' authority to regulate reverse mortgages. Definitions for this section include:\n- Mortgage loan: Any loan for the unpaid purchase price of real property secured by a lien on the property.\n- Mortgage loan law: Any law that applies to or regulates mortgage loans.\n- Reverse mortgage: A mortgage loan secured by a borrower's principal residence, designed as a 1-family residence, with payments made to the borrower. A reverse mortgage is a loan where payments are based on the borrower's equity in their residence, with no repayment required until the entire loan becomes due. The borrower is not liable for any remaining debt if the security for the loan does not cover the full amount owed. Proceeds from reverse mortgage loans are not considered as income or receipts for means-tested programs at the federal, state, or local level. Payments made to individuals under a reverse mortgage are not counted as income for determining eligibility for benefits. Unpaid amounts under the mortgage are considered the borrower's equity in the residence, not loan proceeds."
