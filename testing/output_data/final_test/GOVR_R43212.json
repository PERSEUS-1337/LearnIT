    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) requires core subject-matter teachers to be highly qualified, defined as having a bachelor's degree, state certification, and subject-matter knowledge. This credentials-based approach has been criticized for not focusing on teacher performance goals. Research shows weak correlation between credentials and student achievement, leading to a shift in congressional interest towards teacher effectiveness. The focus of education policy has shifted towards teacher effectiveness and output-based evaluation. Congress has expanded the federal role in rewarding effective teachers and reforming evaluation systems. There is ongoing debate over the extent of federal involvement in teacher evaluation, which is primarily the responsibility of local administrators under state laws and collective bargaining agreements. State laws typically require \"just cause\" for dismissing tenured teachers, such as evidence of insubordination, incompetence, or immorality. Historically, state policymakers have had a limited role in K-12 teacher evaluation systems, with only a few states having statewide policies until recently. The National Center on Teacher Quality has been reviewing state laws governing the teaching profession since 2007, finding that many states lacked clear guidance on teacher evaluations. The \"widget effect\" in teacher evaluation refers to the assumption that all teachers are equally effective in the classroom, leading to most teachers receiving a \"satisfactory\" rating. Only 1% of teachers receive an \"unsatisfactory\" rating, regardless of the evaluation system used. Federal policy has been silent on evaluating teacher effectiveness until recently. The federal role in K-12 teacher policy historically focused on workforce qualifications and supply, with initiatives like NCLB's highly qualified teacher requirement and Class Size Reduction program. Additional incentives like Troops for Teachers and Student Loan Forgiveness programs exist. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) in 2006 marked the federal government's first step into teacher effectiveness policy. The Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) was appropriated $99 million to award competitive grants to school districts for pay-for-performance incentives for teachers. The program aims to reward effective teaching and was expanded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). ARRA's Race to the Top (RTT) authority outlines five elements of an approved teacher evaluation system, including annual evaluations, measuring performance based on student achievement growth, classroom observations, and differentiation among teachers. Between 2009 and 2012, there was a significant shift in state teacher evaluation reform, with 36 states making changes to their policies. This included requiring annual evaluations for all teachers, incorporating student achievement into performance evaluations, and increasing the use of classroom observations. The National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) highlighted these changes as a \"sea change\" in teacher evaluation systems. In 2011, 17 states required multiple performance ratings for teacher evaluations, which increased to 25 states in 2012. By 2012, nine states used teacher evaluation results for tenure decisions. The 112th and 113th Congresses considered bills for ESEA reauthorization with teacher evaluation provisions. In the 113th Congress, bills were proposed for ESEA reauthorization with differing views on teacher evaluation reforms. The House bill (H.R. 5) made reforms optional, while the Senate bill (S. 1094) made them mandatory, aligning with current federal policy guidelines. The House passed H.R. 5 on July 19, 2013, but S. 1094 has not been debated. Congressional interest in teacher evaluation reform exists, but there is disagreement on the approach. There is disagreement over whether teacher evaluation reforms should be mandated or supported by the federal government. Some argue against any federal role in this matter. Key areas of dispute include the weight of student learning in evaluations and challenges in measuring student growth in non-tested grades and subjects. Some states have implemented new requirements for teachers to demonstrate positive performance for tenure and performance pay. There is debate over whether evaluation reforms should include school leadership and if high-stakes decisions should be based on teacher performance. Current school-level accountability provisions have set the stage for principal evaluation reform, with potential removal of poorly performing principals in turnaround models for low-achieving schools. Principal performance is closely tied to school performance, making value-added models more suitable for evaluating school-wide or principal performance. Federal funding support for developing evaluation systems and training evaluators could be beneficial, with existing partnerships between educational organizations, states, and school districts. Federal endorsement of such partnerships could efficiently promote reform efforts. Some argue that teacher evaluation systems should play a role in holding teacher preparation programs accountable for their graduates' impact on student academic achievement. However, implementing data linkages between student learning and teacher performance may be complex and costly. Federal requirements for equitable distribution of teacher quality may need to include an effectiveness component to ensure that all students have access to high-quality teachers. If teacher quality measures shift to performance-based, equity provisions may need adjustment to ensure all students have access to high-quality teachers, not just those with credentials."
