    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Education Elimination Act of 2014\". Congress finds that the Department of Education is inconsistent with the principles of federalism, undermines parental decision-making, and weakens community governance of schools. The Department of Education has seen a significant increase in funding, reaching almost $65.7 billion annually, but education performance for 17-year olds has remained stagnant since 1971. The Department is criticized for over-regulation, high overhead costs, and poor test results in mathematics, science, and reading compared to other nations. Initiatives led by parents and local communities are crucial to improving educational performance in the United States. The current top-down education system is harmful to local businesses, communities, and the nation's global competitiveness. The Department of Education is resistant to reform ideas that empower parents, teachers, and local communities, leading to standardized education that neglects the diverse needs of students. The Department of Education is abolished, along with programs under its administrative responsibility. Grants to states for education programs are established. Each State is entitled to receive grants from the Secretary of the Treasury for elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education programs, based on funds appropriated in fiscal year 2012. Each State receives grants from the Treasury for education programs based on funds appropriated in fiscal year 2012. Funds are allocated for fiscal years 2015 through 2024, with requirements for direct transfer to States and expenditure within specified timeframes. The State must use grants for education purposes allowed by State law, either for elementary/secondary education or postsecondary education. The grants should supplement, not replace, funds from non-Federal sources for education programs. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY.

The Secretary of the Treasury notifies the State's chief executive officer of any noncompliance with nondiscrimination provisions, with the Attorney General authorized to take legal action if compliance is not achieved within 60 days.
