It has been used since July 2018 and will continue until Summer 2019 to optimize observation policy design and operations. NASA's ECOSTRESS mission aims to study plant water needs and stress responses. ECOSTRESS measures plant temperature to understand water usage through transpiration and evaporation. Launched to the ISS in 2018, it targets key biomes, cities, and volcanoes for study. The ECOSTRESS instrument on the ISS measures plant temperature to study water usage throughout the day. It uses a thermal infrared radiometer with a rotating scan mirror to capture scenes that last 52 seconds each. CLASP BID4 was used for prelaunch analysis and generating command sequences for the instrument. The command sequences for the ECOSTRESS instrument on the ISS are translated from the observation schedule generated by CLASP. Three specific challenges required adaptations to CLASP: updating the schedule weekly due to orbital ephemeris changes, proposing a ground-based solution for an issue with the Mass Storage Unit, and accounting for uncertainty in the orbital ephemeris predictions. CLASP receives input of ISS ephemeris, instrument constraints, and science campaigns to generate an observation schedule. Science campaigns consist of target regions on Earth's surface and illumination constraints. A gridded approximation of target regions is used for faster computation. CLASP utilizes the CSPICE Toolkit for navigation and ancillary tasks. CLASP uses the CSPICE Toolkit for geometric reasoning on visibility swaths of instruments attached to spacecraft. The planning horizon is divided into fixed duration observations, with a greedy scheduling algorithm used to prioritize target coverage. The problem statement involves a set of regions of interest and a temporal knowledge horizon. The problem statement involves selecting observations to maximize a scoring function U(r i) over regions of interest, subject to instrument constraints like memory usage and keepout zones. New ECOSTRESS-specific components are introduced in subsequent sections. The ECOSTRESS mission requires updating the schedule due to uncertainties like new science campaigns, spacecraft maneuvers, and thruster burns. The goal is to observe science campaigns in daylight to monitor water use changes throughout the day. A new campaign was added to create daytime maps of global landmass using unused data volume effectively. The ECOSTRESS mission aims to create daytime maps of the global landmass by updating the schedule weekly based on ISS ephemeris predictions. The payload uploads two weeks worth of command sequences, with only the first week executed before the next set is uploaded. To ensure all regions are observed, CLASP was adapted to account for previously observed areas and target unobserved regions in the next schedule. The ECOSTRESS mission updates its schedule weekly based on ISS ephemeris predictions. CLASP was adapted to consider previously observed areas and target unobserved regions in the next schedule. Time is divided into past, current, and future regions with varying certainty, all contributing to the schedule's score. The schedule is a living document updated weekly during operations, with a boundary condition that the data recorder is empty at the end of each planning period. The ECOSTRESS mission updates its schedule weekly based on ISS ephemeris predictions. CLASP considers observed areas and targets unobserved regions in the next schedule. Time is divided into past, current, and future regions contributing to the schedule's score. The schedule is updated weekly with the boundary condition that the data recorder is empty at the end of each planning period. A firmware issue causes the read pointer to stay at the end of memory, resulting in data loss when the write pointer wraps around but the read pointer does not. A ground-based solution involves issuing a command to reset the pointers back to the start. The ECOSTRESS mission updates its schedule weekly based on ISS ephemeris predictions. CLASP considers observed areas and targets unobserved regions in the next schedule. Time is divided into past, current, and future regions contributing to the schedule's score. A firmware issue causes data loss when the write pointer wraps around but the read pointer does not reset. To prevent this, a command is issued to reset the pointers back to the start, considering constraints on data acquisition and pointer locations. The scheduling goal is to maximize data acquisition while meeting instrument constraints and buffer capacity. The scheduler for the ECOSTRESS mission updates its schedule weekly based on ISS ephemeris predictions. CLASP enforces constraints on observations and memory usage to optimize data acquisition. The scheduler runs in two passes, determining ring buffer reset times in the first pass and finalizing the schedule in the second pass. Memory profile analysis is used to ensure sufficient memory for high priority data while allowing for lower priority observations.

The scheduler runs in two passes, determining ring buffer reset times in the first pass and finalizing the schedule in the second pass. Memory profile analysis is used to ensure sufficient memory for high priority data while allowing for lower priority observations. The amount of memory onboard is crucial for scheduling observations, with the process of finding suitable reset times repeating until the end of the planning horizon. The memory profile in Figure 8 displays data from high and low priority campaigns, showing empty buffer resets. The ISS drifts in Low Earth Orbit due to atmospheric drag, potentially causing observations to miss their intended regions. Each observation in CLASP has a start time and fixed duration, like ECOSTRESS's 52-second duration. Targets within the observation window are satisfied, but those near the window edges may be missed. The initial solution to the problem of potential missed observations due to ISS drift was to add extra time before and after each set of observations. This extra time, although accounted for in scheduling, was considered wasteful and inefficient in terms of data volume usage. A more efficient solution was needed to ensure no science targets were missed while optimizing data volume allocation. The initial solution to the problem of potential missed observations due to ISS drift was to add extra time before and after each set of observations. However, a more efficient method was needed. The new scheduling algorithm adapted CLASP to predict target observations from the second they were visible, accounting for uncertainty in position and observation size. This algorithm includes parameters for start time, end time, latest start time, and earliest end time to prevent missed observations. Time-dependent functions determine the necessary pad time for each target to avoid missing observations. The algorithm for scheduling ring buffer resets involves determining start and end times by shifting the schedule, running CLASP with high priority campaigns, and finding the last reset point. The observation can be centered to ensure successful addition to the schedule. The algorithm for scheduling ring buffer resets involves centering the observation to ensure successful addition to the schedule. Observations are checked for interference with previously scheduled ones, and if interference occurs, they are merged recursively until resolved. The merging algorithm checks for interference between observations by creating new observations with adjusted start and end times. Observations are recursively merged with neighbors to resolve interference and maintain scheduling constraints. Old observations merged to form new ones can be deleted from the schedule. The merging algorithm resolves interference between observations by creating new observations with adjusted start and end times. Old observations merged to form new ones can be deleted from the schedule. Two experiments validate the scheduling algorithm, one comparing ring buffer resets and the other comparing schedules accounting for uncertainty in the ephemeris. The algorithm aims to avoid violating Constraints 1 and 2 while maximizing high priority data collection. It compares two methods of scheduling observations, one adding scenes to sets and the other building observations from the second each target is observable. The schedules should have similar numbers of observations, but the coverage should increase with the second method. The algorithm for checking if observations can be placed involves merging observations to avoid violating constraints and maximize high priority data collection. By considering the ring buffer constraint, a schedule with a higher level of coverage for high priority data is achieved. By adding an additional constraint to the algorithm, a high level of coverage for high priority data is achieved. Factors such as target locations, data rates, and buffer management minimize the impact on acquiring high priority data. The method of building up observations from smaller time intervals results in increased target coverage and a decrease in scheduled observations. The method of building scenes from smaller time intervals resulted in a 29.9% increase in coverage and a 3.75% decrease in scheduled observations. This approach reduced data volume wastage compared to the original padding method. CLASP was extended to consider prior execution and long-term observational campaigns. The CLASP tool has been used for long-term mission studies for upcoming missions like Europa Clipper, JUICE, and NISAR. It has also been utilized for early stage mission planning of the THEMIS instrument on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. This paper focuses on mission operations, where the schedule is continuously updated to handle changes in observations and ephemeris. The paper discusses the implementation of a sliding window scheduling approach for Earth observational scheduling, focusing on addressing imperfect state knowledge on longer timescales. The decision to require the data recorder to be empty simplifies operations but limits the scheduler from taking new science data near the end of each planning period. This approach aims to optimize scheduling for non-agile spacecraft like ECOSTRESS. ECOSTRESS could generate more data by predicting fill levels in the data recorder. Future missions should integrate telemetry data with scheduler's resource model. Cloud cover and system malfunctions may require rescheduling observations. Previous week's schedule should be carefully managed to remove unexecuted activities. Constant padding function is currently used for determining start and end times. The paper discusses the use of an automated scheduling system for the ECOSTRESS mission, adapting to changing orbital ephemeris and long-term goals. Issues with the instrument ring buffer and uncertainty of ISS orbital position required scheduling adjustments. Computational analysis showed improvements in addressing the ring buffer. Our method for addressing the ring buffer approached the performance of schedules without added constraints. Building observations up outperformed adding a fixed amount of observational time."
