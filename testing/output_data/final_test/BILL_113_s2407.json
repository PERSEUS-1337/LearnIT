The Act titled the \"21st Century Global Health Technology Act\" emphasizes the importance of research and development in global health. It highlights how innovation can provide sustainable solutions, address emerging challenges, and improve access to health services for vulnerable populations. Additionally, it recognizes the significant role of health and medical technologies in improving global health outcomes over the past century. New health technologies, such as a meningitis A vaccine developed in collaboration with USAID, CDC, NIH, and FDA, will save $570 million in costs for emergency vaccination campaigns over the next decade. USAID, CDC, NIH, FDA, and DoD make significant contributions to global health research annually. The United States Government has made significant contributions to global health research and development, supporting the development of 200 out of 365 products in the global pipeline for neglected and poverty-related diseases. This commitment has led to an increase in new global health products, with 45 new health tools registered between 2000 and 2010. The US Government was involved in 24 of these new products in the last decade, including drugs for malaria, vaccines for pneumonia, diagnostics for tuberculosis, and drugs for leishmaniasis. Despite significant progress in introducing new technologies for global health, gaps still exist in developing and scaling up certain technologies. Better coordination is needed between Federal agencies to align research strategies, address development gaps, and efficiently move products along the research-to-introduction continuum. Infectious diseases disproportionately affect populations in low-income nations across Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, as well as poor and vulnerable communities in the United States. The United States collaborates with the World Health Organization to improve global health research and development coordination and financing. USAID plays a key role in this field. USAID plays a crucial role in assessing local health conditions, partnering with stakeholders for culturally acceptable tools, addressing common health issues, and strengthening health systems. In a recent report to Congress, USAID emphasizes the importance of health research for achieving global health and development goals, as well as the role of innovation in developing affordable health products. In a recent report to Congress, USAID outlined a 5-year health research strategy focusing on developing affordable health products and practices for the developing world. The strategy serves as a tool to measure expected results from 2011 through 2015 but lacks details on investments in critical research areas. USAID focuses on developing new tools for neglected tropical diseases, addressing women and children's health issues, and creating new tuberculosis vaccines. They have established various instruments like Grand Challenges for Development and Research and Innovation Fellowships to promote innovation in global health. Research and development at USAID facilitate public-private collaborations in developing global health technologies. The development of global health technologies leverages public and private sector support for early stage research and development to encourage private sector investment in late-stage technology development in developing countries. This benefits the United States economy by investing in the growing global health technology sector, providing skilled jobs for American workers and creating opportunities for US businesses. The United States should invest in affordable health technologies, including medical devices for maternal, newborn, and child care, new vaccines, and vaccine technologies for global health security and economic development. Investing in health technologies such as new vaccines, safe injection devices, diagnostic tests, water and sanitation tools, and innovative disease prevention strategies can reduce disease transmission, improve access to global health interventions, lessen the burden on local health systems, and save costs for development assistance funds. Product development partnerships (PDPs) are successful public-private partnerships that accelerate research for new health technologies in resource-poor settings. PDPs manage resources from various sectors to develop potential life-saving products for the developing world, with USAID playing a significant role in advancing this model. Between 2004 and 2013, USAID supported the successful advancement of new health products through the development pipeline. This included research, testing, and introduction activities in developing countries to strengthen health systems. A Center for Accelerating Innovation and Impact has been established to further this work. The Center at USAID addresses barriers in developing, introducing, and scaling up new health products. It promotes solutions for diseases where market forces are insufficient, catalyzes partnerships, and supports the development of health technologies since 1982. USAID has maximized resources for global health, ensured products reach low-resource settings, developed 85 health technologies, and collaborated with over 100 private-sector organizations. Their research and development activities complement other Federal agencies. The purpose of USAID's efforts in global health is to maximize resources, ensure products reach low-resource settings, develop health technologies, and collaborate with private-sector organizations. The Technologies for Health Program within USAID aims to develop technologies for global health to improve health outcomes, reduce mortality rates, address infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, and overcome barriers to product introduction and scale-up. The Technologies for Health Program within USAID aims to develop technologies for global health to improve health outcomes, reduce mortality rates, address infectious diseases, chronic illnesses, and support research and development consistent with global development strategies. Establishment of Health Technologies Program. The Technologies for Health Program is established within the Global Health Bureau of USAID to develop affordable technologies to improve health and nutrition in developing countries and reduce maternal and child mortality. The Technologies for Health Program under USAID aims to develop affordable technologies to improve health in developing countries, reduce maternal and child mortality, improve diagnosis and prevention of diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis through cooperative agreements with successful institutions. Action plans are to be implemented to incorporate global health research and product development. The Center for Accelerating Innovation and Impact of USAID focuses on global health research and product development, establishing metrics to measure progress and considering public-private partnerships. The program aims to speed up the development, introduction, and scale-up of priority global health interventions. The USAID program focuses on health technologies research and development activities without establishing a new program for such purposes. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT USAID. The Administrator of USAID must submit annual reports to Congress on research and development activities, including updates on the implementation of USAID's strategy and collaborations with other federal departments and agencies. The Administrator of USAID must provide annual reports to Congress on research and development activities, including collaborations with other federal departments and agencies, investments in science, technology, and innovation, and the introduction of technologies and research products into field trials or use. The Administrator of USAID collaborates with other federal departments to align health research strategies for a whole-of-government approach."
