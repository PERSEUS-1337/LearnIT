    "content": "Model pruning aims to induce sparsity in deep neural networks by reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters. Recent studies have shown that pruning deep networks results in a significant decrease in model size with only a slight loss in accuracy. This suggests that baseline models may be overly parameterized, and an alternative approach to model compression could involve reducing the number of hidden units while maintaining dense connections. A new gradual pruning technique is proposed for energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments, offering a simple and versatile method for various models and datasets with minimal tuning. Large-sparse models consistently outperform small-dense models across various neural network architectures, achieving up to a 10x reduction in non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy. Deep neural networks have advanced in performance due to increased data and computational power, leading to bigger and deeper models for better learning. These models are typically used in datacenter back-ends while also focusing on user privacy. The migration of deep neural networks towards edge computing devices is essential for preserving user privacy and reducing query times. Deploying large models to resource-constrained devices like mobile phones poses challenges due to limited memory and power consumption. Research is focused on compressing neural network models to address these issues. A new approach has emerged to compress neural network models without sacrificing quality. Model compression, specifically pruning less important connections, reduces the number of parameters without significant loss in model quality. This trade-off allows for smaller model sizes, potentially improving inference time and energy efficiency. In model compression, pruning less important connections reduces parameters without sacrificing quality, leading to smaller models for improved inference time and energy efficiency. Sparse models require specialized hardware for efficient inference due to sparse connection matrices and increased memory footprint. Two methods compared for model accuracy are training a large model pruned to be sparse and training a small-dense model. In a comparative study, two methods for model accuracy are explored: training a large model pruned to be sparse and training a small-dense model. Various models across different application domains are examined, and a simple gradual pruning approach is developed for neural network architectures. In Optimal Brain Damage BID18 and Optimal Brain Surgeon BID12, weight pruning techniques were used to remove low-saliency weights from the network. Magnitude-based weight pruning methods, such as our automated gradual pruning algorithm, have become popular for network pruning due to their computational efficiency. Our paper focuses on comparing model accuracy and size tradeoff of large-sparse versus small-dense models across different domains. Unlike previous works, we conduct an extensive comparison of sparse vs dense models without the need for manual threshold selection or multiple training phases. Our technique simplifies the process of reducing model size by removing redundant connections without the need for manual threshold selection or multiple training phases. Unlike other methods that rely on structured pruning techniques, our approach does not make assumptions about the network's structure, making it more versatile across different neural network architectures. Our method is versatile and does not assume network structure. Model pruning can be combined with quantization techniques to reduce model size further. Different quantization methods achieve varying compression ratios and accuracies. Low precision networks with parameters quantized to 4 bits or fewer are also being researched. The TensorFlow framework is extended to prune network connections during training by adding binary mask variables to determine weights participating in forward execution. We sort weights by magnitude and mask out smallest ones to achieve desired sparsity level, with back-propagated gradients flowing through binary masks. The automated gradual pruning algorithm introduces a method to increase network sparsity gradually over multiple pruning steps, updating weight masks every few training steps. Varying the pruning frequency had minimal impact on final model quality. Once target sparsity is reached, weight masks are no longer updated, aiming to rapidly prune redundant connections initially and gradually reduce weights. The pruning process gradually reduces the number of weights in the network, starting after a few training epochs or from a pre-trained model. The choice of hyperparameter n depends on the learning rate schedule. Pruning is done with a specific sparsity function and learning rate schedule, as shown in Figure 2a for sparse-InceptionV3 BID26 models. Pruning is done with a specific sparsity function and learning rate schedule, allowing the network to heal from pruning-induced damage. The model may suffer degradation but recovers quickly with continued training, especially in models with higher sparsity. Performance comparison shows gradual degradation with increased sparsity, but a 50% sparse model performs as well as the baseline. Top-5 classification accuracy only decreases by 2% for an 87.5% sparse model, which offers an 8x reduction in model parameters. MobileNets are efficient convolutional neural networks designed for mobile vision applications, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions to reduce model parameters. The pruning method described is not dependent on specific network properties and can be applied to various neural network architectures. The MobileNet architecture reduces parameters by filtering and combining input channels in separate steps. The width multiplier allows for trading off accuracy with the number of parameters and computational cost. The width multiplier in MobileNet scales input and output channels by a factor \u03b1. Sparse MobileNets outperform dense ones for the same number of parameters. For instance, a 75% sparse model with 1.09 million parameters has a top-1 accuracy of 67.7%, outperforming the dense 0.5 MobileNet with 1.32 million parameters and 63.7% accuracy by 4%. Similarly, a 90% sparse model with 0.46 million parameters achieves a top-1 accuracy of 61.8%, outperforming the dense 0.25 MobileNet with the same number of parameters and 50.6% accuracy by 10.2%. Pruning is a promising approach for model compression, even for compact and efficient architectures like MobileNet. Using sparsity parameter effectively balances model accuracy and memory usage, outperforming width multiplier. Training a sparse MobileNet with gradual pruning algorithm is straightforward, with adjustments in learning rate for dense MobileNet pruning. The LSTM language model is trained on the Penn Tree Bank dataset with different model sizes and hyperparameters. The model consists of an embedding layer, 2 LSTM layers, and a softmax layer. The vocabulary size is 10,000, and the LSTM hidden layer size varies based on the model size. The large model has 66M parameters. When pruning different-sized models, the same hyperparameters as the dense models are used. Sparse models pruned to various levels of sparsity outperform dense models with more parameters. For example, a 90% sparse large model with 6.6 million parameters outperforms a dense medium model with 19.8 million parameters. Pruning works well on LSTM weights and softmax layers, especially on larger models like the PTB model. Pruning works effectively on dense LSTM weights, softmax layer, and embedding matrix, suggesting the neural network can find a good sparse embedding for words. Results show that a 85% sparse medium model outperforms a 95% sparse large model, indicating an optimal compression range when pruning. The results suggest that training a dense model 5x-10x larger and then pruning to the desired number of parameters is more effective than pruning a larger dense model by 20x or more. Pruning to 95% sparsity may yield slightly better results with hyperparameter tuning. The Google Neural Machine Translation (NMT) architecture is a seq2seq model with attention. It has an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM layers and a softmax layer. The dense baseline model has 211M parameters, which are pruned in LSTM, embedding, and softmax layers. The study focused on pruning LSTM, embedding, and softmax layers in dense models for NMT. Different models were tested using WMT16 German and English datasets. Various pruning schemes were applied to address high variance in NMT training procedures. The study tested different pruning schemes for NMT models, including gradual pruning, layerwise constant sparsity, and global pruning. Layerwise constant pruning performed the best on average, showing promising results for network recovery during training. The study compared different pruning schemes for NMT models and found that layerwise constant pruning performed the best on average. Results showed that sparse models achieved higher BLEU scores than dense models, even with significant model size reduction. The study compared pruning schemes for NMT models, finding layerwise constant pruning as the best. Sparse models had higher BLEU scores than dense models, even with significant size reduction. Sparse model memory footprint includes storage for nonzero parameters and indexing data structures. Sparse matrix representation incurs constant overhead, with CSR(C) storing nonzero parameters with preceding zero count. The CSR(C) representation enables higher compression ratio for networks with high sparsity, while the bit-mask representation offers lower overhead at smaller sparsity levels. Large-sparse models achieve higher accuracy than small-dense models with comparable memory footprint. The trade-off between model size and accuracy is highlighted for dense and sparse models, with the performance gap widening for larger models like PTB language models and NMT. The results show that training neural networks with 32-bit floating point representation leads to better performance. Sparse matrix storage incurs higher memory overhead for networks using reduced precision arithmetic. Model quantization and pruning can effectively compress models, impacting accuracy. Large-sparse models outperform small-dense models across various architectures, highlighting the trade-off between model size and accuracy. Model pruning is a technique that can compress neural networks for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Results suggest that hardware architecture should be customized to efficiently handle sparse matrix storage and computations for deep learning accelerators."
