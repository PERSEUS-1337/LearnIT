Only a Member of Congress can formally introduce legislation, with common considerations including identifying the problem the bill seeks to address. Expert testimony and information from reports and studies are crucial in the drafting process.\" The House gathers relevant information for policymaking through expert testimony in committee hearings. Committee referral can impact the legislation's reception, and cosponsorship indicates broad support within the chamber, potentially influencing committee actions. The House gathers information for policymaking through expert testimony in committee hearings. Committee referral impacts legislation's reception, and bipartisan support is crucial for final passage. Budgetary implications and restrictions are considered, with measures subject to point of order for violating budget rules. Support may depend on how costs are covered. Timing the introduction of a bill in Congress is crucial, as it can impact the legislative process. Members may agree on a bill's merits but disagree on how to fund it. Companion legislation in the Senate can expedite bicameral consideration. Comprehensive bills may require more time for review, so early introduction allows for thorough examination. Timing the introduction of a bill in Congress is crucial for the legislative process. Being the first to address an issue can attract media attention and show leadership. Strategic delay allows for more time to study the issue and build support. Bills may not always follow a linear process, as some may be taken up due to crises. The House Office of the Legislative Counsel plays an important role in preparing bills and resolutions. The House Office of the Legislative Counsel provides drafts of legislation to Members and staff upon request. Staff attorneys specialize in legislative drafting and policy issues within their expertise. They work closely with committees to ensure bill language aligns with sponsor intent and drafting rules. Confidential assistance can be sought at any stage of drafting. The House Office of the Legislative Counsel provides confidential assistance at any stage of drafting legislation. The Speaker refers legislation to committees based on subject matter jurisdictions, with advice from the Office of the Parliamentarian. Contact the office in Room 337 of the Ford House Office Building or email legcoun@mail.house.gov for assistance. The Office of the Parliamentarian assists with committee referrals for legislation in the House. House rules allow Members to introduce bills without limits, and they can do so on behalf of others. On average, Members introduce about 20 bills and resolutions each per Congress. When a bill or resolution is ready for introduction, it is placed in the hopper at the bill clerk's desk on the chamber floor. The sponsor must sign the measure and attach names of original cosponsors. Sponsors are encouraged to obtain original signatures from cosponsors before submitting a cosponsorship form. The bill is assigned a number based on the date of introduction and referred to committee(s) by the Parliamentarian's office. Since the 112th Congress, House rules require Members to provide a statement of constitutional authority when introducing a bill or joint resolution. The statement must be specific and attached to the bill upon introduction, or the measure will be returned to the sponsor. Once a bill is numbered and referred to committee, it becomes the property of the House and cannot be modified by the sponsor. Bills can still be considered even if the sponsor resigns or dies. Measures are usually numbered sequentially based on the date of introduction. Bill numbers are assigned to legislation to provide shorthand meaning, enhance visibility, or confer symbolic importance. Some bills may keep the same number for multiple Congresses. For example, tax reform proposals may request H.R. 1040 to draw attention to the 1040 tax form, while a bill on ocular health may be assigned H.R. 2020 for normal vision. The House reserves bill numbers H.R. 1 through H.R. 10 for assignment by the majority leader. The House reserves bill numbers H.R. 1 through H.R. 10 for assignment by the majority leader, while numbers H.R. 11 through H.R. 20 are reserved for the minority leader. These bills, known as \"message\" bills, represent top agenda items of each political party and attract significant attention. The number of bills introduced in Congress fluctuates over time due to changes in House rules and practices. For example, from 1968 to 1978, a limit of 25 cosponsors per measure led to the introduction of identical legislation with new bill numbers to allow more cosponsors. The House has introduced measures to reduce duplicative bills and commemorative legislation. The 104th Congress implemented new restrictions on temporal commemorations, leading to a decline in introduced measures. Most measures are introduced by individual Members, but five House committees can also draft original measures on specific subjects. The 116th Congress maintains the ban on temporal commemorations. Committees can draft original legislation independently, with the committee chair often seen as the sponsor. The measure reflects input from other committee members as well."
