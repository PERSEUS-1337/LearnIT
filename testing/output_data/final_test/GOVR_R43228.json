Key concerns include the sustainability of the economic recovery, reducing unemployment, and promoting growth. The strength of consumer spending is crucial for the current economic recovery, as households work to repair their balance sheets after the recession. This process is seen as a key factor affecting consumer spending and overall economic recovery. The report discusses the impact of balance sheet repair on consumer spending and economic recovery. It highlights the slow pace of the recovery due to weak consumer spending caused by a loss of household net worth. The report examines the current status of balance sheet repair, focusing on asset accumulation and debt reduction. It also considers the near-term outlook for stronger consumer spending. The report discusses the slow economic recovery post-2007-2009 recession, with real GDP contracting by 5.1%. The pace of recovery has been lackluster, with annual GDP growth averaging 2% over four years. The output gap remains significant despite some reduction achieved. The economy's output has declined from 8.1% in 2009 to 5.8% in 2013, with unemployment at 7.5%. Fiscal stimulus has decreased since 2010, and monetary policy may not be enough to counteract fiscal drag. Private spending, especially household consumption, may be needed to sustain the recovery in 2013 and 2014. Household consumption spending is crucial for economic recovery in the U.S. Historically, it has accounted for 65-70% of GDP and has driven previous post-war recoveries. However, in the current recovery, household consumption has been weak, growing at only a 2% annual pace. This slow growth can be attributed to various factors. Persistent high rates of unemployment have dampened consumer spending in the current economic recovery. Decreased income and eroded consumer confidence have contributed to historically weak consumer spending. The 2007-2009 recession led to a significant decrease in household net worth, impacting spending more than reduced income. The 2007-2009 recession led to a significant decrease in household net worth, impacting spending more than reduced income. The loss of wealth for the typical household was proportionately greater than the fall of aggregate household wealth, with a 39% decrease in median household real net worth. The bottom 80% of households lost two decades' worth of wealth, driven mainly by a 35% decrease in the value of real estate assets. The decrease in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession was mainly due to a 35% decrease in the value of real estate assets, totaling $8.4 trillion. This decline in housing wealth significantly impacts household spending, with research showing that a 1% decrease in housing wealth leads to a 0.10% decrease in consumer spending annually. The 35% decrease in housing wealth between 2006 and 2011 would reduce household consumption by 3.5%, equivalent to over $350 billion. This loss of wealth, combined with a sharp increase in financial leverage, caused households to save more income to rebuild their net worth. The collapse of asset prices in 2006 led to a rise in household leverage ratio to over 21% by mid-2009, causing a debt overhang that prompted households to divert income to balance sheet repair. This increased financial discomfort, debt service costs, and reduced access to credit markets, resulting in lower household spending during the 2007-2009 recession. Household balance sheet weakness during the 2007-2009 recession led to a significant loss of jobs and a slow economic recovery. Research shows that households needed to rebuild wealth and reduce debt, diverting income from spending to saving. The process of repairing balance sheets has contributed to the below-average pace of economic recovery since 2009. Household net worth relative to disposable income has increased, indicating progress in balance sheet repair. Since the recession, personal saving rates have increased, with a larger share of income directed towards wealth building. Aggregate household net worth has fully recovered from the 2008-2009 recession, reaching $70.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2013. The increase in household wealth was mainly due to rising asset values, outweighing falling liabilities. Since 2009, household net worth has improved significantly, with total assets increasing by $17.8 trillion, accounting for 97% of the increase. Total liabilities decreased by $0.5 trillion, making up the remaining 3%. However, inflation has eroded the purchasing power of wealth by 9.6% from 2007-2013. Household net worth has increased significantly since 2009, with total assets rising by $17.8 trillion, mainly driven by a $10.8 trillion gain in financial assets. Nonfinancial assets increased by $2.2 trillion, primarily due to the rise in real estate value. Inflation has reduced the purchasing power of wealth by 9.6% from 2007-2013, leaving real net worth about $4.0 trillion or 6% below the 2007 level. Household net worth has increased significantly since 2009, driven by a rise in financial assets and real estate value. The shift towards holding more financial assets has led to a decrease in non-financial assets share. Census data shows that the real net worth of the median household has not increased, remaining essentially unchanged at $68,800 in 2011. The median household's net worth remained unchanged at $68,800 in 2011 due to the decline in home equity after the housing market crash. Despite a recovery in home equity since 2012, many households have not seen a significant increase in their net worth. Over 30% of mortgages were underwater during this period, but the percentage decreased to about 27% in the first quarter of 2013. The percentage of underwater mortgages decreased to about 27% by the first quarter of 2013, indicating that net worth has not fully recovered for an estimated 13 million households. Home prices stabilized and increased by about 9% nationwide through the first quarter of 2013, leading to a positive effect on the wealth of the median household. Owner equity in real estate increased by $2.6 trillion through the first quarter of 2013, following a $7.5 trillion decline from 2006 to 2011. Rising home prices are likely to continue positively impacting the net worth of households in 2013. In 2013, rising home prices are expected to continue positively impacting household wealth. Household debt decreased by $1.0 trillion or 7%, mainly due to a $1.3 trillion decrease in mortgage debt. However, data limitations may overstate changes in debt repayment behavior. Between 2007 and 2013, mortgage defaults led to a significant increase in debt. Estimates suggest that several hundred billion dollars were charged off due to these defaults. Household debt service costs have decreased from 14% to 10.5% of disposable income. The aggregate household balance sheet has improved, with financial leverage falling from 21% to 16%. The current level of leverage relative to households' preferred level is uncertain. The leverage ratio of households has decreased from 21% to 16% between 2007 and 2013 due to mortgage defaults. However, it is uncertain how this reduction is perceived by households compared to their preferred level of leverage. The desired leverage ratio may have decreased further post-financial crisis, possibly below the 2006 benchmark. The median household's mortgage debt relative to real estate value has not improved as much as the overall leverage ratio. It rose from 36% in 2006 to 56% in 2009, but only dropped to 45% by early 2013. More deleveraging is needed to reach the 2006 level. Some households are still above their target leverage ratio, despite progress. Despite progress in reducing leverage ratios, further repair of household balance sheets may be necessary for increased spending. The housing market rebound is helping rebuild wealth, but it is unlikely to be completed in 2013, leading to continued cautious consumer spending. Consumer confidence has improved, but indicators show a mixed outlook for stronger spending. The Federal Reserve's loan officer survey showed increased demand for prime residential mortgages, automobile, and credit card loans. The personal saving rate decreased from 4.1% in 2012 to 2.5% in the first quarter of 2013, possibly due to lower disposable income from the payroll tax increase. This could indicate a shift from saving to consumption spending, but may not be sustainable. Real consumer spending in the first half of 2013 rose by 2.0%. Consumer spending in the first half of 2013 increased at a slower rate of 2.0% compared to previous years, indicating a need for continued macroeconomic stimulus. Concerns about fiscal imbalance have hindered fiscal policy stimulus, shifting the focus to monetary policy and the timing of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase tapering. The Federal Reserve's potential tapering of asset purchases under QE3 is dependent on improving economic conditions, especially in the labor market. The incomplete repair of household balance sheets, including high levels of negative equity in homes, may delay clear signs of economic improvement. This could impact the need for federal programs like HAMP, which aim to alleviate household debt burdens through mortgage debt restructuring."
