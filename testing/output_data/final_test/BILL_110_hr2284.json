    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. Congress finds that American Indians and Alaskan Natives have higher poverty and unemployment rates compared to the general population. They also own over 201,000 businesses, with the construction industry being the largest sector. The Small Business Development Center program is cost-effective, generating additional tax revenues of $248,000,000 in 2005, nearly 2.8 times the program's cost to the Federal Government. It provides critical business counseling and technical assistance, especially on Indian lands where similar services are scarce and expensive. Small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians receiving services under the program have a higher survival rate than those not receiving such services. Increased counseling assistance under the Small Business Development Center program reduces default rates for Small Business Administration lending programs. The Act aims to stimulate economies, foster economic development, support new and existing small businesses owned by Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, and provide management and technical assistance. Local Tribal Councils are consulted for guidance on where small business development assistance is most needed. The Act aims to ensure full access to business counseling and technical assistance for Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians through the Small Business Development Center program. The Act aims to provide Small Business Development Center assistance to Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. The Small Business Act is amended to provide an additional grant for Small Business Development Centers in eligible states to assist Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians with business startups and expansions on Indian lands. An eligible State must have a population of Indian tribe members, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians comprising at least 1 percent of the total population. Grant applicants must submit an application detailing their goals and capabilities to provide training and services to these groups. The grant application requirements include details on the proposed Small Business Development Center site, the amount of grant funding needed, and consultation with local Tribal Councils. Applicants must comply with all requirements of the section, excluding matching funds requirements. The Small Business Development Centers can receive grants up to $300,000 per fiscal year. Final regulations will be issued to establish standards for educational and technical services after consultation with the recognized Association. The Small Business Development Centers can receive grants up to $300,000 per fiscal year and must adhere to standards for work plans. Definitions for terms like 'Indian lands' are provided in this section. The term 'Indian tribe' refers to any band, nation, or organized group of Indians in the contiguous United States, including the Metlakatla Indian Community. An 'Indian tribe member' is defined as a member of an Indian tribe. An Indian tribe member is a member of an Indian tribe, excluding Alaska Natives. Alaska Native is defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and Native Hawaiian refers to individuals who are U.S. citizens and descendants of the aboriginal people of Hawaii before 1778. The term 'tribal organization' is defined in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. $7,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2010. Funding under this paragraph is in addition to other program limitations. The Administration can only carry out the paragraph with funds specifically appropriated for it. SEC. 3. STATE CONSULTATION WITH TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS. Amends the Small Business Act to require Small Business Development Centers to seek advice from tribal organizations on providing assistance to Native American groups."
