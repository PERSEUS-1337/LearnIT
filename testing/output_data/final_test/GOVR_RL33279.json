    "content": "Part A provides funds to urban areas and mid-sized cities with high numbers of people living with HIV. The areas are based on Metropolitan Statistical Areas and must have a population of at least 50,000 with over 2,000 reported AIDS cases in the prior five years. More than 80% of Part A clients are people of color, and 30% are women. The 2006 reauthorization (P.L. 109-415) established a grant program for transitional grant areas (TGAs) in metropolitan areas with specific criteria for AIDS cases. P.L. 111-87 allows metropolitan areas with a certain number of living AIDS cases to remain eligible as TGAs. Total amounts reserved for Part A EMAs and TGAs are determined by legislation. In the most recent fiscal year, P.L. 109-415 adjusted total amounts reserved for Part A EMAs and TGAs based on changing eligibility status of metropolitan areas. P.L. 111-87 modified the transfer of Part A grant funds to Part B for metropolitan areas losing TGA eligibility, with decreasing percentages over three years. Part A currently funds 28 TGAs and 4 states, with 75% of grants required to be spent on core medical services. For each Part A grant, 75% of funds must be spent on core medical services, including outpatient and ambulatory health services, ADAP treatments, oral health care, and mental health services. The remaining 25% can be used for support services like outreach, transportation, and respite care. Waivers are possible under certain conditions. The Part A appropriation for individuals with HIV/AIDS is distributed through formula and competitive grants based on need and testing success. CDC collects statistics for grant distribution, transitioning to name-based reporting for accuracy. Grant award amounts are based on EMA and TGA eligibility definitions. Prior to the 2006 reauthorization, formula grants were distributed to EMAs based on living AIDS cases. P.L. 109-415 changed funding distribution to include living HIV cases. States transitioned to name-based HIV reporting due to legislative requirements. P.L. 111-87 allowed for a transition period for states without mature reporting systems, with a 5% reduction in non-AIDS HIV cases reported. Beginning with FY2013, only living name-based cases of HIV/AIDS would be used in making Part A grant determinations. P.L. 111-87 maintained a hold-harmless provision for Part A, protecting grantees from large decreases in funding. Formula grant amounts are subject to a 5% reduction in non-AIDS HIV cases reported for eligible areas prior to FY2012 and a 6% reduction for FY2012. Additionally, an increase of 3% in the number of living HIV/AIDS cases is allowed for FY2010 through FY2012 if the area switched to name-based reporting in 2007 and had a funding decrease of more than 30% in FY2007 compared with FY2006. In FY2013, a hold-harmless provision for Part A grants protects grantees from funding decreases. Funding amounts for FY2010-2012 are based on previous years, with a 92.5% amount for FY2013. If supplemental funds are insufficient, grant amounts may be reduced proportionally for EMAs not eligible for the hold-harmless provision. A 2009 GAO report highlighted the distribution of hold-harmless funding among Part A EMAs. The distribution of hold-harmless funding among Part A EMAs was analyzed by GAO. In FY2009, 71% of EMAs received hold-harmless funding, with a total of $24,836,500 distributed, compared to 41% in FY2004 with $8,033,563 distributed. Funding per HIV/AIDS case ranged from $645 to $854 in FY2009 and from $1,221 to $2,241 in FY2004. San Francisco received the most hold-harmless funding per case in both years, but received less in FY2009 ($208) compared to FY2004 ($1,020). In FY2009, San Francisco received hold-harmless funding equivalent to what an EMA with 22,713 cases would have received without it, due to its 17,173 HIV/AIDS cases. The funding per case difference is partly attributed to San Francisco's unique case count calculation method based on living and deceased AIDS cases. The hold-harmless provision in FY2009 impacted funding for Ryan White grants, with only 7 EMAs receiving more funding due to this provision. Stop-loss provisions in appropriations bills also affected funding for Ryan White grants. The Consolidated Appropriations Act and subsequent appropriations bills impacted funding for Ryan White Part A grants to metropolitan areas by setting aside funds to make up for previous losses. The FY2009 provision allocated $10.853 million to certain areas, with the majority going to the San Francisco EMA. The FY2010 provision set aside $6.021 million to ensure that total funding for FY2009 was not less than 92.4% of the amount for FY2006. The House Labor-HHS Appropriations bill for FY2010 includes a stop-loss provision impacting Ryan White Part A funding for certain EMAs and TGAs. A GAO analysis showed that San Francisco would receive a significant portion of the stop-loss funds. Part A grants are given to the chief elected official of the city or county in the EMA or TGA with the highest number of persons with HIV, who must establish an HIV Health Services Planning Council to prioritize care delivery. Part A Planning Councils are not mandatory for TGAs unless they were EMAs in FY2006. The council must reflect the local HIV epidemic's ethnic and racial makeup. P.L. 111-87 required councils to develop a strategy for identifying individuals with HIV/AIDS who are unaware of their status, connecting them with health care and support services, and reducing disparities in access and services among underserved communities. The 2006 reauthorization introduced restrictions on unexpended funds, requiring areas to return any unobligated funds if not used within one year of receiving the award. Starting in FY2007, eligible areas must return any unobligated funds if not used within one year of receiving the award. A waiver can be requested to explain how the funds will be spent, granting an additional carryover year. If funds remain unspent by the end of the carryover year, they must be returned. The 2006 reauthorization also includes a reduction in formula grant funds for the following year equal to the unobligated balance. The 2006 reauthorization includes a reduction in formula grant funds for the following year equal to the unobligated balance. The reduction does not apply if the unobligated balance is 5% or less. Returned grant funds can be used for supplemental grants, subject to certain provisions. Grant funds can be used for various purposes such as drug treatments, home and community-based health care, and support services or health insurance. The Part B funding under the 2006 reauthorization includes support for drug treatments, home and community-based health care, and health insurance coverage for low-income individuals through programs like ADAPs. These programs provide treatments for HIV patients who cannot afford drugs and lack insurance coverage. Additionally, efforts are made to identify individuals unaware of their HIV status and provide access to medical treatment, including removing legal barriers. The comprehensive plan for Part B funding includes efforts to remove legal barriers to routine testing. 75% of funds must be spent on core medical services, with the remaining 25% for support services. Two-thirds of the appropriation is for base awards, while one-third is for supplemental grants. The base award formula considers the state's proportion of HIV/AIDS cases nationally, outside Part A-funded areas, and in states with no Part A funding. Formula grants were distributed based on estimates before the 2006 reauthorization. The 2006 reauthorization changed funding distribution for formula grants based on the number of living HIV and AIDS cases for states with name-based HIV reporting systems. P.L. 109-415 provided a transition period for states to switch to name-based reporting. 47 out of 59 Part B grantees used name-based HIV case counts for FY2009 formula funding, while 12 grantees still used code-based counts. The 12 grantees may need up to 4 years to establish reliable name-based HIV reporting systems. P.L. 111-87 extended the transition period for states without mature systems, ensuring fair funding distribution based on HIV/AIDS cases. Beginning with FY2013, only living name-based cases of HIV/AIDS would be used in making Part B grant determinations. P.L. 111-87 allows for a 3% increase in living HIV/AIDS cases for FY2010 through FY2012 if an area switched to name-based reporting in 2007 and experienced a funding decrease of more than 30% in FY2007 compared to FY2006. One-third of the Part B appropriation is reserved for a supplemental grant program created by P.L. 109-415, prioritizing states with a decline in funding under Part B due to changes in the distribution formula. Supplemental grant funds must be used for states with demonstrated financial need and no cancelled grant funds or waivers permitting carryover of funds. The hold-harmless provision under P.L. 111-87 for Part B formula grants ensures funding stability by basing grants on previous years' funding levels. If funds are insufficient, a pro rata reduction may occur for states without hold-harmless funds. Starting in FY2007, states must obligate grant funds by the end of the grant year for various grants. If there is an unobligated balance, states must return the amount for certain grants, while for others, they can apply for a waiver to use the funds in the next year. If approved, the funds would be available for one more year, called the carryover year. Failure to use the funds in the carryover year results in returning the unexpended funds. The state must return unobligated grant funds if not used by the end of the grant year. Failure to use funds in the carryover year results in returning the funds for supplemental grants. Grant reductions may apply for states with unobligated balances, with funds used for supplemental grants. Part B grantees receive drug rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for the ADAP program. The federal requirement for drug rebate funds to be spent before federal funds are obligated may lead to states incurring penalties for unobligated balances. Under P.L. 111-87, states with penalties may have their unobligated balance reduced by the amount of the rebate, with the returned amount used for ADAP or Part B supplemental grants. A 2009 GAO report found that some states and territories had reduced grant amounts due to unobligated balances, with penalties ranging from $6,433 to $12,670,248. According to GAO, grantees in Ohio had varying reasons for unobligated balances, with some stating it was beyond their control. Half of the grantees felt the 2% threshold for penalties was too low, suggesting 5% would be more reasonable. Only 2 out of 16 Part B grantees had unobligated balances less than 5%. HRSA's requirement to spend drug rebate funds before federal funds made it challenging to avoid unobligated balances. HRSA's request for an exemption from this regulation was denied. The grant program for emerging communities defines them as metropolitan areas with a cumulative total population of at least. The grant program for emerging communities defines them as metropolitan areas with a cumulative total of at least 500 and fewer than 1,000 reported cases of AIDS during the most recent five calendar years. The grant amount is determined by the proportion of the total number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in emerging communities in the state to the total number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in emerging communities in the United States. In 2010, about 46% of HIV positive people in care in the United States received their medications through State ADAPs. ADAP funds are distributed based on each state's proportion of living HIV and AIDS cases. P.L. 111-87 provides a transition period for states without a mature name-based HIV reporting system, with reductions in non-AIDS HIV cases reported for grant determinations. Beginning in FY2013, only living name-based cases of HIV/AIDS are used for grant determinations. A hold-harmless provision applies to ADAP formula grants, with 5% set aside for supplemental grants for states demonstrating a severe need for HIV/AIDS drugs. The 2006 reauthorization established a formulary for ADAPs to provide HIV/AIDS therapeutics based on HHS guidelines. Federal ADAP funds covered 43% of the national budget in FY2011, with states contributing 16% and drug rebates 33%. Some states faced cost containment measures like waiting lists due to insufficient funds. As of September 13, 2012, 88 people were on waiting lists in Florida, Louisiana, and South Dakota. States have implemented various cost-containment strategies for ADAPs, including lowering income eligibility criteria, capping enrollment, and instituting client cost sharing. The increasing demand for services, coupled with minimal federal funding increases, has strained ADAPs in recent years. The increasing demand for services and fiscal challenges faced by ADAPs are due to factors such as high drug costs, new HIV treatment guidelines, and federal funding fluctuations. The HRSA Ryan White Program has also experienced significant budget challenges, attributed to the economic downturn and recommendations for earlier HIV treatment. Part C grants provide medical services to underserved populations in rural areas. Part C grants provide medical services to underserved populations, including uninsured individuals living with HIV/AIDS in rural and frontier communities. These grants are awarded to various health centers and organizations for core medical services and early intervention services. Services offered include counseling, HIV testing, referrals, clinical and diagnostic services, and drug treatments under ADAP. Part D grants provide family-centered care for individuals with HIV/AIDS, offering outpatient health care, case management, referrals, and services to recruit and retain youth with HIV. Grantees must coordinate with programs to reduce HIV/AIDS risk for youth. The 2006 reauthorization mandated that administrative expenses be no more than 10% of the grant, with GAO evaluating spending in 2008. GAO found that most grantees did not change client services due to the expense cap, but many reported negative impacts on their programs. In FY2009, HRSA required more detailed budget info from Part D grantees. P.L. 111-87 clarified Part D as last resort payer for clients with other health coverage. Memoranda of understanding can ensure client access to primary care. Part E grants for emergency response were never funded. P.L. 109-415 deleted emergency response sections from Part E. P.L. 109-415 deleted emergency response sections from Part E and inserted new sections from Part D, including language on public health emergencies and privacy protections. P.L. 111-87 reinstated language on \"procedures for the notification of occupational infectious diseases exposure\" in a new Part G, allowing the Secretary to suspend requirements in a public health emergency. Part F of the legislation provides support for various programs related to HIV/AIDS, including the AIDS Dental Reimbursement Program, Community-Based Dental Partnership Program, AIDS Education and Training Centers, and Special Projects of National Significance. These programs aim to reimburse dental schools for treating HIV/AIDS patients, provide specialized education for health providers on HIV transmission and prevention, and award grants to address emerging needs and improve client data reporting. The SPNS program focuses on obtaining client-level data to create a Severity of Need Index (SONI) and maintaining a secure health information technology system. Funding for the program comes from appropriations for Parts A, B, C, and D, with $25 million allocated through the \"PHS evaluation tap.\" P.L. 109-415 codified the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) as part of the Ryan White program, providing funding for grants under various parts to evaluate and address HIV/AIDS needs. The Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) was codified as part of the Ryan White program, providing funding for grants under Parts A, B, C, D, and F to address the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on racial and ethnic minorities. P.L. 111-87 directs HRSA to develop a formula for awarding MAI grants based on populations disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS and synchronize the schedule of application submissions and funding with the corresponding Ryan White Parts. GAO is required to provide a report to Congress within one year of enactment describing MAI activities across HHS, including program history, activities conducted, people served, and best practices in community outreach and capacity-building. The ACA includes provisions to increase health insurance access for the U.S. population and those with HIV/AIDS. Private health insurance is challenging to obtain for individuals with HIV/AIDS and other preexisting conditions. A 2011 IOM report found that only 13% of urban HIV patients had private insurance in 2010, with most covered by Medicaid or Medicare. Prior to the ACA in 2014, HIV patients may have obtained health insurance through the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP), a temporary program that served as a bridge for those with pre-existing conditions. Coordination between PCIP and ADAP allowed for the use of ADAP funds to purchase health insurance, covering HIV medications at a lower cost. The ACA in 2014 allowed for Medicaid coverage for individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government will pay 100% of costs for 2014-2016, gradually reducing to 90% by 2020. Some states have already expanded Medicaid coverage before 2014, but it is uncertain how many more will do so due to a recent Supreme Court ruling. The ruling allows states to refuse the expansion without losing current federal matching funds. This could have a significant impact on Ryan White. The Affordable Care Act requires states to establish exchanges for purchasing private health insurance by January 1, 2014. States can choose to expand Medicaid coverage to include new eligible groups, impacting Ryan White ADAP clients. Individuals with incomes below 133% FPL may be eligible for Medicaid coverage. States must decide on setting up exchanges by November 16, 2012, or HHS will do so. States may also choose to implement a basic health program that provides health insurance for low-income individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid. Individuals with income between 133% FPL and 200% FPL may be eligible for enrollment in a basic health program. Health insurance plans sold on the exchange must include essential health benefits (EHBs) such as diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic services. Up to 52% of Ryan White ADAP clients may be eligible for financial assistance through the exchange to purchase coverage. HHS has not issued regulations for Essential Health Benefits (EHBs) yet. States will define EHBs using benchmark plans, including in Medicaid for new enrollees in 2014. Some individuals are exempt from mandatory enrollment in benchmark plans. Patient advocacy groups have concerns about how prescription drug coverage is outlined in the HHS bulletin. The letter urges HHS to require plans to cover a full range of medications for all patients, as not all patients respond to medicines the same way. A robust formulary is necessary to avoid harmful interactions and meet the needs of patients with chronic health conditions. The ACA benefits individuals with HIV/AIDS by expanding insurance coverage, prohibiting coverage cancellation due to preexisting conditions, eliminating lifetime caps on benefits, and supporting changes to physician training and practice to increase the medical workforce and incentivize practice in underserved areas. The law also incentivizes changes to healthcare delivery by promoting patient-centered care with improved coordination. The ACA promotes patient-centered care with improved coordination, including the option for states to establish \"health homes\" for individuals with chronic conditions. It also authorized the federal health center program and created the Community Health Center Fund. The White House released a National HIV/AIDS Strategy following the ACA enactment in 2010. The Office of National AIDS Policy (ONAP) released the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) in July 2010, with goals to reduce HIV incidence, increase access to care, and reduce health disparities. In September 2010, ONAP requested a study by IOM to identify critical data for evaluating HIV care. IOM identified 14 core indicators in March 2012 and released a second report in October 2012 on obtaining national estimates of HIV care within the context of the ACA. P.L. 111-87 provided authority for Ryan White Parts A, B, C, D, and F through FY2013. The reauthorization of the Ryan White program under P.L. 111-87 removed the sunset provision from the 2006 reauthorization. If reauthorization does not occur before October 1, 2013, the program may continue under general authority. The long-term impact of the ACA on the Ryan White program is still uncertain, as it may replace services with access to health coverage. Some states may choose not to participate in Medicaid expansion, leaving a need for Ryan White services. Even if all states cover new Medicaid eligible groups, there may still be gaps filled by the Ryan White program. The Ryan White program fills gaps for individuals with HIV/AIDS, including undocumented immigrants and those under the Medicaid ban. It offers dental care and support services not covered by Medicaid or private insurance. Concerns post-ACA include physician shortages, especially in certain areas or specialties like primary care and HIV/AIDS. HRSA held listening sessions in July 2012 for stakeholder input on program reauthorization. The Obama Administration requested $2.376 billion for the Ryan White program in FY2012, with a focus on increasing funding for ADAP to provide HIV medications for 13,000 additional patients. President Obama committed an additional $35 million for ADAP and $15 million for the Ryan White program on World AIDS Day. The Senate bill proposed $2.327 billion for HRSA for the Ryan White program in FY2012. In FY2012, Congress provided temporary funding for the Ryan White program under several continuing resolutions, with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ultimately allocating $2.327 billion for the program. The FY2013 Ryan White program budget included a 0.189% rescission. The bill passed both the House and Senate in December 2011 and was signed by the President. The Obama Administration requested $2.447 billion for the program, with increases for ADAP and Part C grants, and a decrease for Part D grants. The Senate proposed $2.397 billion for HRSA in the FY2013 Labor/HHS/Education bill. Temporary funding was provided through March 27, 2013, at the FY2012 rate. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (P.L. 112-175) includes funding at the FY2012 rate with a slight increase. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25) may trigger sequestration on January 2, 2013, leading to across-the-board spending cuts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a report on September 14, 2013, estimating an 8.2% cut for HRSA discretionary programs like Ryan White due to sequestration in FY2013."
