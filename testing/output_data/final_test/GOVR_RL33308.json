It was reauthorized in 2005 and changed to a single grant program. The COPS program transitioned from a multi-grant program to a single grant program, allowing state or local law enforcement agencies to apply for a \"COPS grant\" for various purposes. Funding levels averaged $1.4 billion annually from FY1995 to FY1999 to support the hiring of 100,000 new law enforcement officers. Congress later shifted focus away from hiring officers and used COPS grants to provide federal assistance for local law enforcement support. The COPS program initially focused on hiring new law enforcement officers but later shifted towards providing federal assistance to support local law enforcement agencies. Funding for hiring programs decreased over the years, with appropriations for hiring programs nearly non-existent by FY2005. However, funding for hiring programs was revived with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $1 billion for COPS hiring programs to help local law enforcement agencies facing budget cuts during the recession. Congress has continued to allocate funding for hiring programs, with a notable change in funding levels since FY2011. The annual appropriations for COPS have been around $200 million from FY2012 to FY2017, compared to a minimum of $472 million in FY2006. This change in funding can be attributed to the congressional earmark ban and Congress restructuring the COPS account. Congress implemented a ban on earmarks starting with appropriations for FY2011, leading to decreased funding for Law Enforcement Technology and Methamphetamine Clean-up programs. By FY2012, funding for Law Enforcement Technology was eliminated, and Methamphetamine Clean-up funding was transferred to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Congress also moved appropriations for various programs traditionally funded under the COPS account to the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance. Since FY2012, Congress has not significantly changed or restructured the programs funded under the COPS account. Authorized funding for the COPS program expired in FY2009. One potential question facing Congress is whether the federal government should continue to provide grants to state and local law enforcement agencies to hire additional officers at a time of historically low crime rates. The violent crime rate increased in 2015 to 373 per 100,000 people, up from 362 in 2014. Despite the rise, it remained at historic lows comparable to 1970. The rate peaked in 1991 at 758 per 100,000 and has generally decreased since then, with occasional increases in certain years. It is too early to determine if the recent uptick signals a long-term reversal. The recent increase in the violent crime rate is too early to determine if it signals a long-term reversal. Reports of growing crime in some cities raise questions about the effectiveness of grants to hire more police officers. Studies suggest that COPS grants had a negative effect on crime rates, but the impact was not universal, especially in larger cities. Proponents argue that the federal government should support local law enforcement. Opponents of the COPS program argue that state and local governments, not the federal government, should fund police forces. They question the effectiveness of COPS hiring grants on crime rates, especially during times of low crime and federal deficits. Critics also point out duplication with other programs like the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant. The COPS program has evolved into a single-grant program, but Congress continues to appropriate funding for specific grant programs under the COPS account. This limits law enforcement agencies to apply for funding under different programs specified by Congress, rather than having the flexibility to use one grant for multiple programs. Congress may need to reconsider this approach in the future. Congress may need to reconsider whether to fund COPS as a single-grant program, which could reduce administrative burden but limit control over how funds are spent. Awarding COPS grants under a single-grant program may hinder monitoring effectiveness due to the wide variety of programs funded."
