    "content": "The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 amended the Higher Education Act of 1965 to establish a loan forgiveness provision under the William D. Ford Direct Loan program for borrowers in public service jobs. Borrowers making 120 monthly payments while employed full-time in public service jobs can have their remaining loan balance canceled. This provision is available to both new and existing borrowers of the Direct Loan program. Eligible loans for forgiveness under the DL program include Federal Direct Stafford Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, and Federal Direct Consolidation Loans. FFEL program loans are not eligible for forgiveness, but borrowers can consolidate into Direct Consolidation Loans for forgiveness. FFEL Consolidation Loans can be reconsolidated into Direct Consolidation Loans for loan forgiveness for public service employees. The loan forgiveness provision for public service employees under the DL program requires borrowers to make 120 payments on eligible loans through specified repayment plans. Borrowers must make payments equivalent to a standard 10-year repayment period, excluding the extended and graduated plans, to qualify for loan forgiveness. Borrowers must make 120 payments on their loans through specific repayment plans like ICR or IBR to qualify for loan forgiveness. Their monthly payments must be lower than the standard 10-year repayment plan to have an outstanding balance forgiven. Full-time employment in a specified public service job is required at the time of loan forgiveness. To qualify for loan forgiveness, borrowers must be employed full-time in a public service job such as emergency management, government, military service, public safety, law enforcement, public health, public education, social work, public interest law services, public child care, services for individuals with disabilities or the elderly, public library sciences, or at a nonprofit organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The DL program loan forgiveness provision for public service employees is available to borrowers of DL program loans who make 120 payments according to specified repayment plans while employed full-time in public service jobs. Implementation issues are expected to be addressed by the Department of Education through 'Dear Colleague' letters and regulations. The Department of Education is developing regulations for the loan forgiveness provision for public service employees under the DL program. Payments made by borrowers after October 2, 2007, will count towards the 120 payments required for loan forgiveness. However, there are still unresolved issues regarding the application process and verification of full-time employment in public service jobs. The Department of Education is working on regulations for loan forgiveness for public service employees under the DL program. Unclear issues include how breaks in full-time employment will be addressed and ensuring monthly payments count towards the 120 required for forgiveness. It is also uncertain if payments on DL program loans will still count if borrowers consolidate into new DL Consolidation Loans. Borrowers must make 120 monthly payments for loan forgiveness. Consolidation Loan borrowers must make 120 monthly payments on their loans under specific repayment plans. Payments made on Consolidation Loans may only count towards the required 120 payments for loan forgiveness. The maximum repayment period for Consolidation Loans varies based on total student loan indebtedness. Borrowers need to repay at least the monthly amount calculated for a 10-year repayment period to maintain eligibility for loan forgiveness. The maximum standard repayment period for Consolidation Loans varies based on total student loan indebtedness, with options of 12, 15, 20, 25, or 30 years. Prior to July 1, 2006, married borrowers could obtain joint Consolidation Loans. Future guidance may address the eligibility of joint Consolidation Loan borrowers for loan forgiveness under the DL program for public service employees, including requirements for employment and repayment. Additionally, guidance may address the future eligibility of FFEL Consolidation Loan borrowers to reconsolidate into Federal Direct Consolidation Loans for loan forgiveness purposes starting July 1, 2008."
