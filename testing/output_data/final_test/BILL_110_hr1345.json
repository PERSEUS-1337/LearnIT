    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that employees working on Cold War-era nuclear weapons were exposed to radiation and placed in harm's way without their knowledge or consent, leading to serious health consequences. Workers at Cold War-era nuclear weapons sites were exposed to radiation without adequate monitoring or protection. Congress designated certain workers at specific sites as members of the Special Exposure Cohort. New York made a significant contribution to national security during the Cold War and is home to former atomic weapons employers. New York has 36 former atomic weapons employer facilities, with 14 in the western region. Research shows workers were not adequately monitored for radiation exposure in the 1940's to 1960's at certain facilities. At Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna, New York, no personal radiation dosimetry monitoring records are available. If radiation dose estimation is not feasible with sufficient accuracy and there is a reasonable likelihood of worker endangerment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services can designate additional classes of workers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can designate additional classes of workers as members of the Special Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 if radiation dose estimation is not feasible and there is a reasonable likelihood of worker endangerment. Regulations were promulgated in 2004 to establish procedures for individuals to petition for membership in the Special Exposure Cohort. Legislation is required to provide more guidelines for evaluating petitions for the Special Exposure Cohort when there is limited radiation exposure monitoring or no records, potentially endangering the health of affected workers. SEC. 2. Addition of classes of former nuclear weapons program workers to the Special Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. Section 3626(b) of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 is amended to include provisions for employees with potential exposure to occupational ionizing radiation from atomic weapons employer facilities or Department of Energy facilities. Employees working in facilities related to atomic weapons or Department of Energy facilities may be eligible for compensation if fewer than 50% of them were regularly monitored for radiation exposure. Employees at facilities related to atomic weapons or Department of Energy facilities may be eligible for compensation if records of radiation exposure are missing or unreliable for a significant portion of the workforce. The Safety and Health department updated the report and determined eligibility for compensation under the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 for employees at a facility meeting specific criteria. The Safety and Health department updated the report and determined eligibility for compensation under the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 for employees at a facility meeting specific criteria. SEC. 3. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will modify regulations for the Special Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act within 90 days of enactment. A petition will be initiated to include workers from the Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York in the Special Exposure Cohort. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress within 90 days identifying facilities and claimants eligible for the Special Exposure Cohort under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act."
