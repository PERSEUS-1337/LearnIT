    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Value-Based Insurance Design Seniors Copayment Reduction Act of 2015\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that patient-level financial barriers for high-value medical services can reduce their use, leading to increased total medical expenditures. Research shows that reducing out-of-pocket expenses for these services can mitigate adverse health and financial consequences. Value-Based Insurance Design adjusts patient out-of-pocket costs for high-value prescription medications and clinical services based on clinical value, not just cost. This approach recognizes the varying clinical benefits of different services and medications. The current copayment and coinsurance design for prescription medications and clinical services under Medicare does not consider the value differences in health outcomes. Implementing Value-Based Insurance Design methodologies in Medicare will improve patient-centered health outcomes and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently. The Value-Based Insurance Design methodologies will be implemented in Medicare to improve patient-centered health outcomes and use taxpayer dollars more efficiently through a demonstration program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration program within a year to test Value-Based Insurance Design in Medicare Advantage plans for beneficiaries with chronic conditions. At least 2 Medicare Advantage plans will be selected to participate in the program, meeting specific requirements such as offering a coordinated Medicare Part D drug benefit. The Secretary will expand the demonstration program to include components beneficial to Medicare beneficiaries and the program, unless it increases program expenditures or decreases the quality of healthcare services. Additionally, a Value-Based Insurance Design methodology will be implemented. Value-Based Insurance Design is a methodology for reducing copayments or coinsurance for specific prescription medications and clinical services deemed high-value and effective for certain clinical conditions under the demonstration program. Under the demonstration program, Medicare Advantage organizations can lower cost-sharing to encourage the use of specific clinical services identified as high-value for managing specified clinical conditions. This reduction in copayments or coinsurance must be evidence-based and occur annually. Under the demonstration program, Medicare Advantage organizations may lower cost-sharing to encourage the use of high-performing providers based on quality metrics. The organization must consider specific clinical conditions like asthma, atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, and cancer in managing services. Any variation in copayment or coinsurance must occur annually. Under the Medicare Advantage demonstration program, cost-sharing cannot be increased to discourage the use of services for specific clinical conditions like deep venous thrombosis, cancer, and others. The program aims to promote the use of high-performing providers based on quality metrics. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within a year of the enactment of the Act on the implementation of the demonstration program. The report will include details on identified medications, clinical services, copayments, coinsurance amounts, reductions in cost-sharing levels, and high-performing providers based on quality metrics. The Secretary will contract with an independent entity to review and assess the implementation of the Value-Based Insurance Design program, including assessing the utilization of methodologies and analyzing the impact of reducing or eliminating cost-sharing. An analysis of the impact of reducing or eliminating copayments or coinsurance on medication adherence, service utilization, quality metrics, health outcomes, and beneficiary experience, as well as cost-savings and provider performance. The contract or agreement requires the entity to submit a report on the review and assessment conducted, including cost-savings from reducing copayments for high-performing providers. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 3 years of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary shall submit a report to Congress on the review and assessment conducted, including recommendations to reduce copayments for high-value prescription medications and clinical services under the Medicare program. The Secretary may waive provisions of titles XI. The Secretary may waive provisions of titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act as necessary for the demonstration program. Funding for the program will be transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund as determined appropriate by the Secretary."
