    "content": "The \"Enhanced Veteran Healthcare Experience Act of 2011\" aims to improve the current health care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs by providing more accessible treatment for veterans closer to where they live. This Act proposes replacing the fee-based care system with a veterans enhanced care program to offer better healthcare at little-to-no increased cost to taxpayers. The \"Enhanced Veteran Healthcare Experience Act of 2011\" proposes enhanced contract care authority for veterans' health care needs. The Secretary will provide eligible veterans with covered health services from non-Department providers if Department facilities are unable to economically or effectively furnish the services due to geographical inaccessibility or lack of personnel, resources, or ability. Covered health services include hospital care, medical services, rehabilitative services, and preventative health services. The Secretary may contract with non-Department providers to offer health services to eligible veterans if Department facilities are unable to provide services effectively due to various reasons. Non-Department providers must meet specific criteria to ensure quality care for veterans. Non-Department providers must meet specific criteria to ensure quality care for veterans, including having care coordinators, a system for filing complaints, responding to quality indicators, and the ability to process claims and bill third parties. The Secretary ensures consistent eligibility determination for veterans at each medical center, includes care coordinators from non-Department providers in patient-centered care initiatives, exchanges clinical information to improve care, and mandates non-Department facilities to meet specific criteria for quality care. The Secretary mandates non-Department facilities to meet performance metrics for quality care and satisfaction of veterans. Non-Department facilities and Department facilities must meet these metrics. Eligible non-Department facilities or employees exceeding metrics may receive incentive payments. The Secretary must report on care provided under this section annually, including cost, number of veterans receiving care, quality of care, and veteran satisfaction. The Secretary requires non-Department facilities to meet quality care and veteran satisfaction metrics. An annual report on care allocation and resources must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. $5 billion is authorized for fiscal year 2013 to carry out these provisions."
