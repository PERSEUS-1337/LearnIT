    "content": "The U.S. intelligence community has undergone significant changes in the past 40 years, with congressional oversight committees playing a key role in shaping these changes through annual intelligence authorization bills. The IC is transitioning to an \"intelligence enterprise\" model to address its growing challenges, as outlined in the National Intelligence Strategy 2014. The Director of National Intelligence highlights the pervasive and emerging threats from key nation states like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Global power is shifting towards new alignments and informal networks, impacting global affairs. Competition for scarce resources and technological advancements pose challenges. Congress must shape intelligence priorities amidst budget adjustments and oversee agencies in this altered intelligence environment. The annual authorization process is crucial for overseeing the interagency intelligence efforts. The congressional intelligence committees, SSCI and HPSCI, were established in the 1970s to provide vigilant oversight over the IC. They ensure that timely intelligence is provided for sound decision-making by the executive and legislative branches. The congressional intelligence committees, SSCI and HPSCI, oversee the most secret aspects of the U.S. government to ensure sound decision-making by the executive and legislative branches. They produce annual legislation guiding all 17 U.S. intelligence components, providing authorization for critical national security functions. Their authorization bills are important resource documents for money and manpower. The intelligence bills are crucial for providing budget authority to agencies and programs. Authorization committees establish the necessity and intent of agencies, while appropriations committees determine funding levels. Appropriations process allows for influencing policy decisions by cutting or adding funds. The House Intelligence Committee oversees a wide range of activities related to national security, including CIA personnel, tactical intelligence support in Afghanistan, NSA's electronic surveillance, global monitoring of foreign militaries, and real-time analysis of political and economic events. In FY2014, $67.9 billion was appropriated for national and military intelligence programs. The intelligence committees have significant power over national intelligence agencies, as they must authorize funds for intelligence activities. This requirement was established in the National Security Act of 1985, ensuring that funds can only be used if specifically authorized by Congress. The Intelligence Authorization Act is produced annually by the House and Senate intelligence committees, providing detailed guidance and budget numbers for intelligence agencies. The Schedule of Authorizations within the classified Annex is legally binding and cannot be disclosed publicly. If authorization bills fail to pass, appropriation bills are used to authorize and appropriate funds for intelligence activities. The Intelligence Authorization Act is produced annually by the House and Senate intelligence committees, providing detailed guidance and budget numbers for intelligence agencies. The Annex is made available for review by Members of their respective chambers, subject to disclosure restrictions. A conference committee is usually convened to resolve differences between House and Senate versions. Despite the requirement for both authorization and appropriation, the committees have faced challenges reconciling philosophical differences in some years. IAAs have failed to pass or were vetoed in certain instances. Table 1 shows the legislation associated with the annual intelligence authorization bill over the past 15 years. The Intelligence Authorization Act is produced annually by the House and Senate intelligence committees, providing guidance and budget numbers for intelligence agencies. Over the past 15 years, IAAs for nine fiscal years were signed by the President three months into the respective fiscal year, while three bills were never sent for signature and two were vetoed. The reputations of the intelligence committees suffered during the six-year period when no bills were passed. The absence of an authorization bill in a fiscal year does not mean ongoing programs cease to be authorized. During a six-year period with no intelligence legislation, appropriation committees had de facto authority. Efforts were made to pass annual intelligence authorization bills starting in 2009, led by SSCI Chairwoman Feinstein and HPSCI Chairman Rogers. Efforts to pass intelligence authorization bills have been ongoing since 2009, led by SSCI Chairwoman Feinstein and HPSCI Chairman Rogers. Table 1 shows intelligence bills passed each year since FY2010, with some delays in bill passage. IAAs have been successfully passed in both chambers and signed by the President every fiscal year since 2010. The IAA for FY2015 was signed into law on December 19, 2014. Additionally, Table 2 outlines intelligence authorization legislation in the 113th Congress, and Table 3 summarizes selected provisions from the IAA for FY2015. An IAA for FY2015 (P.L. 113-293) was signed into law on December 19, 2014. Understanding the timeline for IAAs for FY2014 and FY2015 is challenging due to sequencing issues and bill titles. Key actions for IAAs in the 113th Congress are outlined in Table 2, including the introduction and reporting of IAAs for FY2014 and FY2015 by the HPSCI. The HPSCI reported an IAA for FY2014 and FY2015 (H.R. 4681) to the House, which was later passed by the House and sent to the Senate for consideration. The Senate passed the IAA for FY2014 (S. 1681) instead of H.R. 4681, which was then passed by the House and became P.L. 113-126. The SSCI reported an IAA for 2015 (S. 2741) to the Senate, and on December 9, 2014, the Senate passed the amended version of H.R. 4681. The Senate passed the amended version of H.R. 4681 as the \"IAA for FY2015\" on December 9, 2014. The House agreed to the Senate's amendments on December 10, 2014, and it was presented to the President for his signature on December 12, 2014, becoming P.L. 113-293. Section 104 authorizes additional appropriations and positions for advanced research and development activities, including the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is supported by the Senate to ensure its mission remains a priority, even during fiscal constraints. The committee encourages robust investment in IARPA and emphasizes the importance of its work in the Intelligence Community's Research and Development strategic plan. The functional managers for intelligence disciplines include the Directors of the NSA, CIA, NGA, and DIA. Their duties involve developing strategic guidance, setting standards, ensuring coordination, and advising on resource management and other related issues. The functional managers for intelligence disciplines, including the Directors of the NSA, CIA, NGA, and DIA, integrate and coordinate intelligence funding sources. The DNI designates functional managers who are responsible for identifying programs, projects, and activities within their intelligence discipline and reporting on resource issues. The functional managers for intelligence disciplines, including Directors of NSA, CIA, NGA, and DIA, integrate and coordinate intelligence funding sources. The DNI designates functional managers responsible for reporting on resource issues and other relevant matters. The functional manager report includes elements such as capabilities, resource allocation, performance assessment, technical interoperability standards, and operational overlap. Section 309 directs the DNI and the Directors of the CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, and NGA to undergo full financial audits starting from FY2014. This provision stems from a history of oversight efforts to ensure compliance within the Intelligence Community. The Senate reports have highlighted the long history of oversight efforts to enforce compliance with financial accounting standards within the Intelligence Community. Despite calls for audits since FY2002, the NRO, NSA, CIA, DIA, and NGA still struggle to produce auditable financial statements, with a current projection of at least four more years to achieve this goal. The Senate report urges the Intelligence Community to make its accounts auditable and establish a business enterprise architecture (BEA) and consolidated financial statement for the National Intelligence Program. The current timeline for achieving auditability by 2012 is now difficult due to the focus on constructing a BEA. The Committee supports this BEA work and believes it will provide a stronger foundation for financial auditability. Section 322 of the bill aims to empower the DNI's BTO to create a business systems architecture. The Committee also sees value in creating a consolidated National Intelligence Program. The Senate report recommends creating a consolidated National Intelligence Program financial statement to provide macro-level data and insights into financial trends within the Intelligence Community. Section 314 directs the DNI to merge the FCIP into the GDIP, with the Director of DIA as program manager. Section 321 of the IAA for FY2014 focuses on OLC opinions in the DOJ regarding intelligence activities to enhance oversight functions. Section 321 of the IAA for FY2014 focuses on OLC opinions in the DOJ regarding intelligence activities to enhance oversight functions, ensuring the Committee is aware of relevant legal analysis for U.S. intelligence activities. Section 321 of the IAA for FY2014 ensures the Senate Intelligence Committee is aware of relevant OLC opinions on intelligence activities. Title IV of the same act changes the appointment process for key individuals in NSA and NRO, allowing the Senate to have a more active role in their selection. The Director of the NSA is now appointed by the President with Senate approval, following recommendations from the Secretary of Defense and the DNI. This change was prompted by the NSA's crucial role in national intelligence, especially regarding privacy concerns. Congressional oversight of the NSA became more urgent in 2013 after Edward Snowden leaked classified documents revealing extensive data collection programs. This raised concerns about privacy protections in intelligence, counterterrorism, and law enforcement activities. Section 411 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to require the President to appoint the Director of the NRO with Senate confirmation, in response to concerns about oversight of complex and expensive programs. This change follows a HPSCI investigation into NRO acquisition processes leading up to the IAA for FY2014. The HPSCI conducted an investigation into NRO acquisition processes before the IAA for FY2014. A report with recommendations was released, including one that the NRO should justify its satellite acquisition pace to the ODNI and Congress. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established a system of IGs to oversee government programs and operations for efficiency and fraud prevention. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established IGs to oversee government programs and prevent fraud. Concerns have been raised about the independence of IGs in the Intelligence Community, with legislation mandating independent IGs at agencies like the CIA. The IAA for FY2010 called for an independent ODNI IG appointed by the President. The IAA for FY2010 mandated an independent ODNI IG appointed by the President, with removal only by the President and reporting directly to the DNI. By 2014, most IGs in the IC were appointed by the President with Senate consent, including those at the CIA, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, State, and Treasury. Sections 402 and 412 of the IAA for FY2014 added the NSA IG and NRO IG to this list for enhanced independence and oversight. The Senate Report highlights the importance of the NRO Inspector General's independence in overseeing activities to address fraud, waste, and abuse. S.Res. 470, passed in 2014, requires Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation for the NRO IG to ensure proper oversight. The Senate resolution outlines procedures for appointments in the intelligence community, emphasizing shared jurisdiction among oversight committees. Nominees for key positions like Assistant Attorney General for National Security and NSA Director are referred to specific committees based on their military or civilian status. The primary committee has the right of refusal, and if the secondary committee fails to report the nomination, it is automatically discharged. The Senate resolution outlines procedures for appointments in the intelligence community, emphasizing shared jurisdiction among oversight committees. Nominees for key positions are referred to specific committees based on their military or civilian status. If the secondary committee fails to report the nomination after a specified time, it is automatically discharged and placed on the Senate's Executive Calendar. The SSCI believes Senate confirmation of these positions will improve oversight and accountability. Title V of P.L. 113-126 addresses the \"insider threat problem\" within the IC, following recommendations made by a presidential group. The problem escalated in 2013 with Edward Snowden's leaks. The Snowden leaks, following Manning's release of classified documents, highlighted the shift to electronic theft of secrets. A presidential group recommended a continuous monitoring program for personnel with classified access. The HPSCI report suggested that Snowden could have been caught sooner with better background evaluations. The HPSCI and SSCI reports discuss the need for continuous evaluation to detect insider threats in the intelligence community. The SSCI expresses concern over the lack of full implementation of the President's National Insider Threat Policy and calls for enhanced efforts to deter insider threats. Additionally, the Senate report mentions the importance of modernizing information technology to protect against insider threats. The Senate report emphasizes the need for modernizing information technology to detect insider threats in the intelligence community. The IC ITE initiative aims to provide a secure IT environment with tools to monitor personnel behavior effectively. This effort will help pool IT resources, cut costs, increase data storage capabilities, and enhance mission agility and efficiency. Additionally, provisions in the report address streamlining the security clearance process. Security clearance reciprocity aims to streamline the process by accepting background investigations and determinations from authorized agencies. However, reports suggest that agencies may be hesitant to recognize clearances from other agencies, leading to issues with \"out-of-scope\" determinations. The Senate report accompanying S. 1681 highlights the challenges associated with this issue. Some IC agencies may not follow the requirements of others, leading to out-of-scope determinations based on factors like background investigation depth, polygraph exams, timing issues, and agency discrepancies. Inconsistencies in applying out-of-scope determinations are noted, with some agencies waiving them for their employees but not for others, potentially causing inefficiencies and unnecessary costs. The Committee highlights inefficiencies and unnecessary costs in the security clearance adjudication process, noting agencies' inconsistent application of out-of-scope determinations. This impedes the movement of cleared personnel between agencies, leading to delays and significant government costs. Section 501 mandates continuous monitoring of IC personnel's eligibility by the DNI, under the President's direction. Section 504 requires continuous monitoring of IC personnel's eligibility for access to classified information and sharing of derogatory security information. The DNI must report annually to Congress on security clearance reciprocity. Intelligence whistleblowers are IC employees or contractors who expose agency wrongdoings. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 allows IC employees to report \"urgent concerns\" to Congress, with protections from retaliation provided by Presidential Policy Directive 19. Whistleblowing is important for oversight, but leaking classified information is a concern for the IC. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 allows employees to report \"urgent concerns\" involving intelligence activities to Congress, with protections from retaliation. This includes serious problems, false statements to Congress, and reprisals against whistleblowers. Edward Snowden cited previous retaliation against whistleblowers as a reason for not going to the government first. Title VI of P.L. 113-126 provides protections for IC whistleblowers, including due process rights such as an independent fact-finder, notice, opportunity to be heard, representation by counsel, decision based on record, and timely decision. Appeals can be made within 60 days, with detailed procedures outlined in the bill. Section 604 of the bill provides no protections for certain terminations of employment if deemed in the interest of the United States, consistent with national security, and reported to Congress within five days. Additional details can be found in the CRS Report R43765 on Intelligence Whistleblower Protections. The SSCI Report includes provisions not mentioned in the bill. The SSCI Report includes provisions for enhancing the procurement process with a \"Contractor Responsibility Watch List\" to ensure the IC deals only with responsible vendors. The SSCI Report includes provisions for enhancing the procurement process with a \"Contractor Responsibility Watch List\" to ensure responsible contractors are used and to prevent misuse of taxpayer money. The legislative process involves resolving differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill, with informal negotiations sometimes eliminating certain provisions, as seen in the IAA for FY2015. The NSA IG counsel is no longer included in the IAA for FY2014. Section 305 on \"functional managers\" was incorporated into the IAA for FY2014. A short \"Joint Explanatory Statement\" was read into the Congressional Record on December 9, 2014. The HPSCI and SSCI committee reports offer fuller descriptions of the provisions in the amended H.R. 4681. Determining what is new or different in the IAA for 2015 can be difficult due to varying section numbers. Table 3 lists selected provisions in the IAA for FY2015. Section 303 of the IAA for FY2015 requires the DNI to develop a National Intelligence Strategy every four years starting in 2017, similar to the Quadrennial Intelligence Strategic Review in S. 2741. Section 310 is a technical correction, and Section 323 mandates an annual report on violations of law or EO, with corresponding provisions in H.R. 4681 and S. 2741. The ODNI has been producing a National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) since 2005, with specific requirements added in 2017. Section 303 mandates the NIS to address national and military intelligence, identify security missions, assess threats, outline roles and missions, and identify sources of risk. The 2005 NIS was a reaction to provisions in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, also known as the IRTPA, required strategic plans for intelligence activities like counterterrorism and foreign partnerships. The National Intelligence Strategy (NIS) has been updated in 2005, 2009, and 2014 under different DNIs. Section 303 mandates the DNI to report on the NIS within 45 days. Section 309 regulates the retention of data on U.S. persons acquired incidentally. Section 309 of the Intelligence Reform Act regulates the retention of data on U.S. persons acquired incidentally during investigations of foreign persons, without a court order or consent. Privacy advocates raised concerns about expanding government authority, while intelligence committees argued it actually protects privacy rights by requiring IC elements to adopt Attorney General-approved procedures to limit retention of nonpublic communications to or from U.S. persons to five years. Section 310 of the Intelligence Reform Act requires certification to Congress for extended retention of data on U.S. persons, with a focus on protecting national security and privacy interests. It also enhances Whistle Blower protections related to security clearance actions. The provision allows employees to challenge suspension or revocation of security clearance while retaining government employment status. It extends protections to individuals alleging reprisal for protected disclosures, allowing them to appeal actions affecting access to classified information. Section 324 mandates the DHS Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis to report on intelligence activities, including funding, full-time employees, and contractors. Section 324 of the Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP) requires a report on funding, full-time employees, and contractors. The report examines consolidating planning, programming, and resourcing within the HSIP. The budget for HSIP was established to fund intelligence activities supporting DHS missions separately from the National Intelligence Program. However, it has only been used to supplement the budget for the office of Intelligence and Analysis, not for non-IC components conducting intelligence-related activities. The DHS has intelligence activities funded by the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP). The HSIP is separate from the NIP and supports DHS missions specifically. This creates shared jurisdiction between the Intelligence and Homeland Security Committees. The Department of Homeland Security's intelligence activities are overseen by the Homeland Security Committees, not the DNI. Shared jurisdiction exists over intelligence-related activities, with provisions addressing issues like cybersecurity and cybercrime cooperation. Congress urges the President to initiate talks with Ukraine on cybersecurity threats and cybercrime, involving other law enforcement partners like Europol and Interpol. The curr_chunk discusses measures to combat cybercrime in Ukraine, including cooperation with the United States, capacity-building programs, and establishing a scorecard to measure responses. It also addresses the supervision of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Russia. The curr_chunk discusses measures to combat cybercrime in Ukraine, cooperation with the United States, capacity-building programs, and establishing a scorecard to measure responses. It also addresses the supervision of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Russia, including background checks and plans to reduce reliance on locally employed staff. Additionally, it includes requirements for restricted access space in diplomatic facilities in certain countries and directs reporting on political prison camps in North Korea and U.S. actions to support human rights recommendations. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a tribunal for holding individuals accountable for abuses and the need for detailed information on prisoner populations and living conditions. It also focuses on improved planning and management of contractors in the Intelligence Community legislation, with a requirement for annual personnel level assessments and reporting on contractor-related issues. This echoes a similar requirement from the IAA for FY2010. The curr_chunk discusses contractor-related issues in the Intelligence Community, including hiring, training, and retention, as well as the conversion of contractors to government employees. The growth in contracting activities post-9/11 was due to the need for surge capacity. Ronald Sanders highlighted the use of contract personnel as reserves to meet mission demands quickly. Hiring more civilians was not feasible due to the time needed for training and development. Contractors in the Intelligence Community provide valuable services, including intelligence collection and analysis. They offer surge capabilities and cost-effective solutions compared to maintaining a permanent in-house capability. However, critics argue that reliance on contractors can compromise the credibility and effectiveness of the IC. The Intelligence Community relies on contractors for various services, raising concerns about cost, accountability, and workforce issues. The SSCI Study highlighted the debate over contractors performing \"inherently governmental\" functions. Section 328 mandates an assessment of memoranda of understanding to enhance intelligence-sharing within the Joint Terrorism Task Force. The Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) is operated by the FBI in 104 cities nationwide, with 71 created since 9/11. Their primary purpose is to enhance coordination and collaboration in counterterrorism efforts. JTTFs consist of highly trained investigators, analysts, linguists, and specialists from various agencies. Their duties include chasing leads, gathering evidence, making arrests, providing security, training, collecting intelligence, and responding to threats. Section 328 was prompted by the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. The 2014 Report by four IGs found that FBI, CIA, DHS, and NCTC shared information appropriately but could make improvements. Recommendations included clarifying JTTF alert procedures and enhancing threat information sharing with state and local partners. Section 328 aims to identify obstacles to intelligence sharing post-Boston Marathon bombing, while Section 330 directs the DNI to submit a report on the U.S. counterterrorism strategy. The committee requires an interagency report on the U.S. counterterrorism strategy against al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups, coordinated by the DNI and including input from various government departments. The report must assess the groups' strength or weakness from January 1, 2010, to the present, complementing a previous global strategy report. The congressional intelligence committees oversee the activities of the 17 components that currently comprise the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). The DNI is directed to provide performance assessments for the \"FIX-ITT\" initiative, an effort to integrate financial intelligence activities to disrupt terrorist organizations, narco-trafficking networks, and other threats. The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) is comprised of 17 components overseen by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Office of the DNI (ODNI). The core mission of ODNI is to lead the IC in intelligence integration, operating as one team despite being spread across different departments. Most intelligence agencies have a dual mission to support national-level and operational-level intelligence activities. The U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) is managed by the parent department and consists of various components including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, CIA, NSA, DIA, NGA, NRO, and other specialized intelligence collection offices within the Department of Defense. The U.S. Intelligence Community includes the Department of Energy, State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Treasury Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Homeland Security's intelligence analysis elements, and other designated agencies. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence with enhanced coordination authorities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) established the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) with expanded authorities for coordinating the nation's intelligence efforts. The 9/11 Commission highlighted the need for better interagency coordination due to separate statutory missions and administrative barriers. The IRTPA focused on enhancing the DNI's authorities over other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders, particularly in personnel, tasking, acquisition, and budget management. The act divided the DCI's responsibilities between the Director of the CIA (DCIA) and the DNI, making the DNI both a community manager and principal advisor to the President. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) with expanded authorities for coordinating the nation's intelligence efforts. The DNI serves as the community manager and principal advisor to the President, overseeing U.S. intelligence agencies, briefing the President, developing the budget for national intelligence, and managing appropriations. The Office of the DNI, with a staff of 1,600 officials, carries out core integration responsibilities with the help of statutory components like the National Counterterrorism Center and the National Intelligence Council. The President appoints the DNI with the advice and consent of the Senate. The ODNI, established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, consists of core activities, enabler, and oversight offices. Enabler offices focus on IC-wide concerns like acquisition, budget, and human capital, while oversight offices ensure compliance with U.S. law and investigate fraud and abuse. The position of Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) was created in 2003 for similar reasons as the DNI. The Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) was established in 2003 to manage intelligence and information systems within the DOD. In 2007, the position was \"dual-hatted\" as both USD(I) in OSD and DDI in ODNI to enhance integration of national and military intelligence. The incumbent reports directly to the DNI when acting as DDI. The DDI position was created to strengthen the relationship between the DNI and the DOD. The terms NIP and MIP refer to national and military intelligence programs. The NIP was previously known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program, and the MIP merged the Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities Program with the Joint Military Intelligence Program. The DNI and USD(I) oversee interagency activities for seamless integration of NIP and MIP intelligence efforts. NIP is associated with national-level intelligence and includes programs that transcend agency bounds or are nondefense in nature. The NIP is overseen by the DNI and includes 14 programs that cover the entire IC. Each program is capabilities based and headed by a Program Manager who controls resources. The DNI acts as an intermediary between Program Managers, the President, and Congress in the budget process. The MIP refers to defense dollars associated with operational and tactical-level military activities, overseen by the Secretary of Defense. It includes intelligence assets organic to military units and supports the Secretary's intelligence responsibilities, excluding capabilities not related to intelligence. The MIP label is a tool for managing funds for military intelligence support to DOD \"warfighters.\" The USD(I) leads all actions involving the MIP, coordinates its development and execution, and monitors the Battle Space Awareness Portfolio for balance and synergies. MIP Component Managers are responsible for managing MIP resources within their respective components. The MIP components, including OSD, Military Departments, USSOCOM, DIA, NGA, NRO, and NSA/CSS, have various defense and nondefense NIP programs. These programs include CCP, GDIP, NGP, NRP, FCIP, CIAP, CIARDS, CMA, and others. Intelligence authorization legislation in July 2014 merged FCIP into GDIP. Table A-1 lists 10 MIP programs, including DIA, NGA, NRO, NSA/CSS, OSD, USSOCOM, Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps MIP. Only USSOCOM has its own budget among the nine Combatant Commands (COCOMs). Table A-2 shows that six IC components receive funding from both MIP and NIP sources. Directors of DIA, NGA, NRO, and NSA manage both NIP and MIP funds. Budget decisions are guided by the NIP MIP \"Rules of the Road.\""
