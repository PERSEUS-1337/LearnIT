    "content": "Emergency responders in cities with tall buildings need accurate floor level locations to find 911 callers quickly. A system has been introduced to estimate a victim's floor level using their mobile device's sensor data in a two-step process. The system utilizes a neural network to detect when a smartphone enters or exits a building via GPS signal changes, and a barometer-equipped smartphone to measure the change in barometric pressure from the building entrance to the victim's indoor location. Unlike previous approaches, this system does not require beacons, prior knowledge of building infrastructure, or user behavior. Real-world feasibility was demonstrated through 63 experiments in five tall buildings in New York City, achieving 100% accuracy in predicting the correct floor level. Indoor caller floor level location is crucial for 911 emergency calls, aiding in locating victims and emergency personnel in tall buildings. Traditional methods like GPS or Wi-Fi are unreliable in these situations. A new system combines deep learning with barometric pressure data from smartphone sensors to estimate floor levels accurately. The study introduces a Bosch bmp280 sensor for \"floor level accuracy\" in smartphones. It presents an LSTM model trained to classify smartphones as indoors or outdoors using GPS, RSSI, and magnetometer data. The model outperforms previous classifiers and is compared against other baseline models. Additionally, an algorithm uses the classifier output to estimate the floor level based on barometric pressure changes within a building, without the need for external sensors or prior building knowledge. The study introduces a smartphone system that estimates floor levels inside buildings using GPS and barometer sensors. It can achieve 65.0% accuracy without prior knowledge of the building, improving to 100% with repeated visit data. The system's code, data, and app are available on Github. The first method classifies user activity like walking, stairs, elevator, and predicts based on movement offset. The second method uses a barometer to calculate altitude or relative changes between multiple barometers. GPS is not accurate in urban settings with tall buildings for vertical location. Methods for predicting user activity require infrastructure support and tailored tuning for each building. BID1 uses classifiers to detect user activity indoors or outdoors, such as walking, climbing stairs, or standing still. They also attempt to measure displacement for elevators through thresholding, but calibration to the user's step size is needed for accuracy. BID17 explores using barometric pressure to predict floor levels, with methods involving pressure difference calculations and Wi-Fi point detection for initial pressure readings. The curr_chunk discusses the development of an iOS app named Sensory 3 to aggregate data from smartphone sensors for predicting floor heights in buildings. The app was installed on an iPhone 6s and set to stream data at a rate of 1 sample per second, including various sensor data such as GPS coordinates, barometric pressure, and environmental context. The Sensory 3 app collects sensor data from an iPhone 6s for predicting floor heights in buildings. Data collection involved continuous sensory streaming with two different motives: training the classifier and making floor level predictions. The system uses six features, including barometric pressure and GPS vertical data, to operate on a time-series of sensor data. The system collects sensor data from an iPhone 6s to predict floor heights in buildings. Data includes barometric pressure, GPS data, RSSI level, and magnetometer readings. The total magnetic field strength is calculated from the magnetometer data. Data for predicting floor levels was collected separately from the IO classifier data. 63 trials were conducted in five different buildings in New York City to test system performance. Our building sampling strategy aims to diversify building locations, sizes, and materials to represent real-world deployment. The procedure generates data for predicting floor changes, counting floor levels from the entrance as 1. The system may not give accurate floor values in buildings with multiple entrances, skip the 13th floor, or have odd floor numbering. GPS lag is less significant indoors compared to outdoors. The study focused on predicting floor levels inside a building using smartphone sensors. 41 trials were conducted in Uris Hall building over two days, with data collected unsupervised to simulate real-world deployment. Both elevator and stairs were used to move between floors. The system aimed to estimate floor levels accurately despite challenges like odd floor numbering and GPS lag. The algorithm uses smartphone sensors to determine indoor/outdoor transitions, measure vertical displacement, and estimate floor levels inside a building. Classifier network classifies device as indoors or outdoors, with a lag of d/2 - 1 second before valid prediction. Experiment uses 3 consecutive sensor readings for classification. The system uses smartphone sensors to classify device as indoors or outdoors, focusing on indoor floor predictions. Neural networks outperformed baselines on test set, with LSTM as the basis for the model. The system utilizes smartphone sensors for indoor/outdoor classification and indoor floor predictions. The 3-layer LSTM is the primary classifier, trained to minimize binary cross-entropy. The final output is a time-series indicating indoor/outdoor status. The IO classifier, crucial for floor predictions, relies on GPS signals and faces challenges in 1-2 story buildings due to the \"lag effect.\" The \"lag effect\" impacts system effectiveness in buildings and ascend methods near glass walls. It causes errors in floor level predictions due to device movement speed. Corrections are made by analyzing a window of data around the transition point, using the minimum barometric pressure as a reference. A delay of 0-60 seconds was observed in location fixes during experiments. The system uses filters to identify indoor/outdoor transitions based on LSTM predictions. Each subset is classified as a transition or not using binary vector masks. Jaccard similarity is used to measure distance between filters and subsets. Beginning index of each subset is added to the transition list. The system uses filters to identify indoor/outdoor transitions based on LSTM predictions. Each subset is classified as a transition using Jaccard similarity. Beginning indexes of subsets are added to the transition list, which determines the vertical offset between the device's in-building location and the last known indoor/outdoor transition. The system uses LSTM predictions to identify indoor transitions into a building without external sensors or beacons. It starts by determining the last known transition using IO data, setting a reference pressure value based on the lowest device pressure within a 15-second window around the transition. The system uses LSTM predictions to identify indoor transitions into a building without external sensors or beacons. It releases the location lock from serving satellites and uses the device's current pressure reading to calculate the relative change in height. The final output is a scalar value representing the relative height displacement in meters. Converting this measurement into an absolute floor level is challenging due to variability in building numbering systems.

It releases the location lock from serving satellites and uses the device's current pressure reading to calculate the relative change in height. Converting this measurement into an absolute floor level is challenging due to variability in building numbering systems. To address this, the authors propose a method to estimate floor levels based on clusters of barometric pressure measurements and tape-measure distances between floors. The system estimates floor levels using clusters of barometric pressure measurements and tape-measure distances between floors. It groups points within 1.5 meters to generate clusters and finds the closest cluster to the device's measurement for floor level prediction. Results are accurate but may differ from labeled numbers in buildings. If data from other users is unavailable, the m \u2206 value is divided by an estimator. The study found a bi-modal distribution of office and residential buildings. For residential buildings, m r = 3.24 and m o = 4.02 for office buildings. The overall algorithm is summarized in the appendix. Evaluation tasks include indoor-outdoor classification and floor level prediction using various models like LSTM, neural networks, logistic regression, SVM, HMM, and Random Forests. The goal is to predict indoor-outdoor status using smartphone sensor data. The study trained indoor-outdoor classifiers using smartphone sensor data, with 5082 data points from 35 trials. The LSTM network architecture had two layers with 50 neurons each, trained for 24 epochs with a batch size of 128. Training logs were collected using the python test-tube library and are available in the GitHub repository. The LSTM and feedforward models outperform all other baselines in the test set, with performance measured in terms of the number of floors traveled. Two tests were conducted with different m values, resulting in 65% accuracy for predicting the correct floor level. In the second experiment, specific m values were used for each building, predicting the correct floor with 100% accuracy. Results show that a proper m value can significantly increase accuracy. Table 2 displays the results of trials where participants walked up or down stairs or took the elevator to the destination floor. The system made predictions solely from the classifier and barometric pressure difference. In the experiment, accurate floor predictions were made using specific m values for each building. Results showed that a proper m value greatly improved accuracy. The system predicted floor levels with 100% accuracy in 63 trials across New York City. Future work will focus on modeling the complete problem within LSTM to generate floor level predictions from raw sensor readings. Our system, BID26, BID20, BID17 BID27, is self-contained and can be deployed in tall buildings with 19 or more stories without infrastructure support. An LSTM model achieved 90.3% accuracy in indoor-outdoor classification, outperforming other methods. Additionally, the system can learn floor height distributions within a building using unsupervised methods. This approach speeds up real-world applications. The system BID26, BID20, BID17, BID27 is self-contained and can be deployed in tall buildings without infrastructure support. An LSTM model achieved 90.3% accuracy in indoor-outdoor classification. Potential pitfalls of the system in a real-world scenario include the unpredictability of barometric pressure as a sensor measurement due to external factors and changing weather conditions. Adjusting device pressure from readings from a nearby station was mostly successful but showed noisy estimates throughout the experiment. The study experimented with a method to correct weather-induced pressure drift, achieving a maximum error of 2.8 meters. By adjusting pressure estimates using temperature measurements from a local weather station, they were able to maintain close estimates over a 7-hour experiment period. The resolution of the weather station data needed to be fine-grained to prevent excessive error drift. Our method works best when predicting an offset m \u2206 within a short window of making a transition within the building. The primary challenge arises when a user does not leave their home for an extended period. Indoor navigation technology can be used to list Wi-Fi access points within the building and tag each cluster location using RSSI fingerprinting techniques. This allows for determining the average floor level tags of the nearest Wi-Fi access points once a substantial delay between the building entrance and the last user location occurs. The limitations of Apple's API prevent direct testing of a theory regarding nearby Wi-Fi access points. Different barometric pressure device models show significant variation in accuracy, with consistent errors and high correlation within each model. The Bosch BMP180 barometer is noted for providing the most accurate measurements among tested models. Other studies also found a high correlation and constant offset between barometer models, with some variation within the same model. The Bosch BMP180 barometer model showed consistent measurement variation, with GPS having a significant impact on battery life across different devices. iOS devices have hardware optimization for motion sensor data, allowing continuous streaming without excessive battery drain. However, GPS data still drains battery rapidly, varying across devices and software implementations. BID19 conducted a study on the impact of running GPS continuously on mobile devices, proposing a method to decrease battery drain by adjusting sampling rates. This approach would still provide fine-grained resolution and may need tuning by device manufacturers for specific models."
