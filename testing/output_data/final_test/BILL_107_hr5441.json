Definitions for the term 'State' and 'first responder' are provided in this section, including the types of personnel covered under the term 'first responder'. The Deputy Director of the Office of National Preparedness establishes a grant program for first responders and States to prepare for and respond to terrorism incidents, including those involving weapons of mass destruction. Eligibility for grants is contingent on maintaining homeland preparedness and security expenditures at or above the average level of the two fiscal years prior to receiving the grant. The Director can withhold grant funds if a first responder or State fails to meet required homeland security expenditures. Grants can be used for purchasing interoperable equipment and training personnel for homeland security responsibilities. The grant funds can be used by first responders to upgrade emergency operating centers, conduct terrorism response exercises, compensate for overtime costs, and carry out other approved activities. States can use the funds to establish coordinated interstate and intrastate antiterrorism programs, mutual aid programs, and plan and execute terrorism response exercises. The Deputy Director can allocate grant funds to states and first responders for various purposes, including upgrading emergency centers, conducting terrorism response exercises, and purchasing materials. States can use the funds for interstate antiterrorism programs and executing response exercises. The Director determines grant amounts for first responders based on terrorism threat assessments, population location, proximity to vital infrastructure like military installations, public buildings, nuclear power plants, chemical plants, national landmarks, and international borders. Grants are also allocated to first responders in rural areas as deemed appropriate. The Deputy Director determines grants for first responders responsible for homeland preparedness or security. Not more than 2 percent of grants can be used for administrative expenses. The Deputy Director is responsible for agency objectives and reports. The Deputy Director sets measurable objectives for regional homeland preparedness and security. Regional points of contact must report improvements and failures to meet objectives annually. States must develop reports to receive grants for homeland security. States receiving grants under this section must develop measurable objectives for improving homeland preparedness and security.

If it is determined that federal funds were improperly used, the first responder or state is required to repay the amount deemed to have been used improperly. The Deputy Director may use up to 5 percent of appropriated funds for administrative expenses and to establish the Office of National Preparedness. The Director must coordinate with other federal agencies to prevent duplication of assistance for homeland preparedness and security."
