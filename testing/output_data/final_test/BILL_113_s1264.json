    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Vehicle Corridors Act\". Congress finds that traditional transportation refueling networks face market uncertainties hindering the use of cleaner alternative domestic energy resources. Investor interest in cleaner refueling options is limited by high capital costs and uncertain consumer demand. While reduced emissions and energy independence are important, they are not enough to drive large-scale changes. Despite the benefits of American-made fuels, a significant amount of imported oil is still used as diesel fuel in on-road vehicles fueled by domestically generated energy. Motor vehicles fueled by cleaner alternative transportation fuels like natural gas, propane, electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels can be cost-effective over time. However, the lack of refueling infrastructure has hindered their sales. Developing infrastructure along designated routes is crucial to expanding the use of these vehicles and ensuring commercial success. Developing infrastructure along Clean Vehicle Corridors will provide cleaner refueling stations, attract more buyers to clean vehicles, and create new market outlets for clean fuel providers, ensuring commercial success. The purpose of developing infrastructure along Clean Vehicle Corridors is to provide cleaner refueling stations, attract more buyers to clean vehicles, and create new market outlets for clean fuel providers, ensuring commercial success. The Act aims to provide market certainty for private and commercial capital investment in clean transportation, promote clean transportation technologies for increased diversity in fuel options, and facilitate incentives to attract clean transportation vehicles and meet ongoing energy demands. The Act aims to provide market certainty for private and commercial capital investment in clean transportation, promote clean transportation technologies for increased diversity in fuel options, and facilitate incentives to attract clean transportation vehicles. It also aims to support the growth of jobs and businesses in the United States, reduce emissions by motor vehicles, decrease the nation's use of foreign oil, and encourage innovation in transportation energy and technology.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"cleaner alternative fuels\" to include compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, propane, plug-in electric, advanced biofuels, hydrogen, and other fuels designated by the Secretary. \"Clean Cities\" refers to a public-private partnership managed by the Department of Energy to meet goals in various clean air and alternative motor fuels acts. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 define the term \"highways\" to include roadways part of the National Highway System, the Interstate Highway System, the National Truck Network, and other critical roadways for trucks determined by the Federal Highway Administration. The term \"supporting infrastructure\" under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act includes fueling stations, rest stops, travel plazas, and other service areas along a Clean Vehicle Corridor. The Clean Vehicle Corridors Program is established under SEC. 5. The Secretary of Transportation must designate at least 5 \"Clean Vehicle Corridors\" along Federal highways within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Before making a designation, consultation with the Secretary of Energy is required for data analysis and approval. The Secretary of Transportation must designate \"Clean Vehicle Corridors\" along Federal highways within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Before designation, approval from the Secretary of Energy is required, along with consultation with other relevant government agencies and stakeholders to gather information and leverage existing programs for the Act's purposes. The Secretary of Transportation will designate Clean Vehicle Corridors connecting Clean Cities and consider air quality nonattainment areas. They will encourage adding cleaner alternative fuel options and infrastructure along these corridors for easy refueling within 1 tank range. The Secretary may provide waivers for cleaner alternative fuel projects and vehicles along Clean Vehicle Corridors, including modifying lane and weight restrictions to accommodate vehicles using cleaner alternative fuels. The Clean Vehicle Corridor projects designated under subsection (a) are eligible for increased Federal funding share under MAP-21. Owners and operators of publicly owned infrastructure can designate parking spaces near major facilities for vehicles using cleaner alternative fuels. Cleaner alternative fueling infrastructure projects can be included in State energy conservation plans. The Clean Vehicle Corridor projects designated under subsection (a) are eligible for increased Federal funding share under MAP-21. The Secretary of Transportation maintains a website with information and resources for Clean Vehicle Corridors, including best practices for promoting cleaner alternative fuel use. The Secretary will identify and promote mechanisms for cleaner alternative fuel infrastructure development, and ensure the website is linked to the Alternative Fuels Data Center. The Department of Energy collaborates with stakeholders to gather data on cleaner alternative fueling station usage patterns for Corridor designation. Interstate compacts can be established by contiguous States to facilitate planning for necessary facilities. The Secretary, in consultation with other agencies, may provide technical assistance to interstate compact partnerships. Federal authority is not limited or diminished by these partnerships. Each compact established under this provision must acknowledge that Congress can withdraw its consent every 3 years after the compact takes effect."
