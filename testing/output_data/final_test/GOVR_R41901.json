    "content": "The Balanced Budget And Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, also known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, established deficit limits and a mechanism to enforce them. It aimed to address limitations of the congressional budget resolution by limiting the effects of enacted revenue and spending laws and enforcing deficit targets through automatic spending cuts ordered by the President. In the early 1980s, the deficit grew significantly, reaching $212 billion or 5.1% of GDP in FY1985. President Reagan's budget proposal for FY1986 included cuts to domestic spending, increased defense spending, and a $180 billion deficit. The proposal faced opposition from both the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate. After seven months of negotiations, a compromise was reached. After seven months of negotiations, the House and Senate agreed to a budget resolution assuming a $171.9 billion deficit, with the goal of enacting legislation for $55.5 billion in deficit reduction. Upon returning from August recess, Congress faced raising the federal debt ceiling to $2.079 trillion. The Senate added an amendment to bind Congress and the President to balancing the budget within six years using budget process mechanisms. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act, also known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, was agreed upon by the House and Senate after months of negotiations in December 1985. This act aimed to use budget process mechanisms to force legislative action on deficit reduction, building on previous efforts during the 97th and 98th Congresses. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 established deficit reduction requirements through annual deficit limits and a process for enforcing these limits, including sequester orders for spending cuts. This act aimed to address budget deficits by leaving policy changes to Congress and the President for negotiation. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 included a sequester mechanism to enforce deficit limits, with equal cuts to defense and non-defense spending. The objective was to use the threat of sequestration to prompt compromise and action, with certain programs exempt from cuts. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985 included a sequester mechanism to enforce deficit limits, with equal cuts to defense and non-defense spending. The act exempted certain programs from cuts, such as Medicare, veterans' medical care, community health centers, and Indian health facilities. Non-exempt programs faced greater reductions if sequestration was implemented. The sequestration design did not differentiate between programs already reduced through legislation and those that were not, leading to potential further reductions for non-exempt programs. Exempting certain programs from sequestration reduced the incentive for advocates to negotiate spending decreases. The deficit reduction procedures allowed for suspension during wartime or a recession. The deficit reduction procedures allowed for suspension during wartime or a recession. If negative real economic growth was projected in two consecutive quarters, deficit level provisions could be suspended by Congress through expedited procedures. The President and Congress had to adhere to deficit limits when developing budget plans. The Budget Enforcement Act set deficit targets for each fiscal year, with Congress prohibited from violating these levels except in times of war. Reconciliation directives were included in the budget resolution to achieve specified deficit levels. OMB and CBO directors were required to issue a joint deficit and sequestration report annually, including revenue estimates, deficit projections, economic growth rates, and potential excesses. The Budget Enforcement Act set deficit targets for each fiscal year, with Congress prohibited from violating these levels except in times of war. OMB and CBO directors were required to issue a joint deficit and sequestration report annually, including revenue estimates, deficit projections, economic growth rates, and potential excesses. The Comptroller General of the General Accounting Office (GAO) was tasked with reviewing and considering the OMB/CBO report, issuing a report to the President and Congress by August 25 with estimates parallel to those required of OMB/CBO, and explaining any differences. This left Congress less than two months to pass deficit reduction legislation to avoid sequestration using expedited procedures for Senate consideration. The Budget Enforcement Act required the President to issue an initial sequestration order after the Comptroller General's report, with amounts withheld from October 1 pending the final order on October 15. OMB and CBO had to issue an updated deficit report by October 5, with GAO issuing a subsequent report. The Budget Enforcement Act mandated an initial sequestration order after the Comptroller General's report, with updated deficit and sequestration reports required by October 10. The deficit was measured by a single \"snapshot\" in August, potentially not reflecting the current deficit. Congress's success in meeting deficit targets could involve one-time actions to reduce the deficit temporarily. The Budget Enforcement Act required a sequestration order based on deficit reports, with a compliance report due after the President's final sequestration order. In case of court invalidation, a Temporary Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction would be formed. In 1986, the sequestration process under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act was invalidated by the Supreme Court. The 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act was invalidated by the Supreme Court in Bowsher v. Synar, as the Comptroller General could not compel presidential action. This led to difficulties in reaching deficit targets, prompting Congress and the President to revise the act in 1987 (H.J.Res. 324). The revised act originated in the House and underwent extensive revisions before being signed by President Reagan on September 29, 1987. The 1987 Reaffirmation Act modified the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, rectifying the invalidated sequestration mechanism. It used a report from the director of OMB as the trigger for the President's sequestration order for FY1988-FY1993. The act extended the timeframe for achieving a balanced budget to FY1993 and revised deficit targets accordingly. The 1987 Reaffirmation Act amended the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act by specifying procedures for sequestration triggers and baseline estimates. It extended the deadline for a balanced budget to FY1993 and adjusted deficit targets accordingly. The 1987 Reaffirmation Act amended the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act by specifying procedures for sequestration triggers and baseline estimates. It extended the deadline for a balanced budget to FY1993 and adjusted deficit targets accordingly. The act required the OMB director to calculate the sequestration amount using the same technical assumptions and methodologies used in the CBO director's report. It also included various specifications for the calculation of a baseline estimate and added elements to the required deficit and sequestration reports. The 1987 act amended the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act by specifying procedures for sequestration triggers and baseline estimates. It added stipulations and exemptions, such as allowing the President to exempt military personnel accounts from outlay reductions with Congressional approval. It also established a method for supplanting the President's final sequestration order. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA; P.L. 101-508) revised the procedures under the 1985 Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to address deficit targets and the sequester mechanism. BEA aimed to preserve deficit reduction achieved in reconciliation legislation by limiting new legislation that would increase the deficit. Enforcement under BEA was not based on the effects of already enacted legislation. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) replaced the deficit targets of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings with a two-pronged procedural approach: pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) procedures for new spending and revenue laws, and discretionary spending limits. These procedures were enforced separately to prevent offsetting savings between categories. BEA also adjusted deficit targets based on economic and technical assumptions to prevent breaches. Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, deficit limits were set with a $10 billion margin. In FY1991, OMB projected a deficit of $147.3 billion, triggering cuts in defense and non-defense programs. To avoid sequestration, President George H.W. Bush and congressional leaders agreed on a five-year, $500 billion deficit reduction plan after bipartisan budget summit negotiations at Andrews Air Force Base. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, implemented through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, established statutory caps on discretionary spending. These limits were categorized into defense, international, and domestic spending for FY1991-FY1993, and a single limit for FY1994 and FY1995. While limiting flexibility for negotiation, Congress still had authority to spend within these categories. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established statutory caps on discretionary spending, categorized into defense, international, and domestic spending for FY1991-FY1993, and a single limit for FY1994 and FY1995. Congress had the authority to spend within these categories, with spending limits enforced by points of order and a sequestration process. Enforcement of discretionary limits could occur at various stages of the legislative process. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established discretionary spending limits for different categories for FY1991-FY1995. Adjustments to these limits could be made three times a year to account for changes in budgetary concepts, inflation, and credit subsidy costs. Additionally, a PAYGO procedure was implemented to ensure that new legislation did not increase the deficit. The PAYGO procedure, established by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, required that any new legislation increasing direct spending or decreasing revenues had to be offset to prevent an increase in the deficit. This was enforced annually through a \"scorecard\" maintained by OMB, with violations triggering sequestration procedures to offset deficit increases. The PAYGO procedure, established by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, required offsetting new legislation affecting direct spending or revenue to prevent deficit increases. Legislation enacted after the final sequestration report was accounted for in the following session. Sequestration would make cuts to non-exempt direct spending programs, with exemptions for certain programs like Social Security and railroad retirement. Medicare spending reductions were limited to 4%, and special rules applied to specific programs. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) implemented procedures to enforce discretionary spending caps, PAYGO rules, and deficit targets through sequestration. The new timetable required CBO and OMB to prepare three sequestration reports, with discrepancies between estimates needing explanation. This revised timetable spanned the entire year, unlike the previous three-month timeline under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (BEA) required OMB to explain any discrepancies in estimates, with OMB providing cost estimates for budgetary measures within seven days of enactment. CBO was responsible for scoring legislation before consideration in the budget process, with procedures for suspension during war or low economic growth continued from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. In 1993, Congress passed the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993; P.L. 103-66) aimed at reducing spending. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993; P.L. 103-66) signed into law by President Clinton on August 10, 1993, extended discretionary spending caps and PAYGO procedures established in BEA 1990. It also established new spending caps for FY1996-FY1998 and extended enforcement procedures through FY1998. Congress completed action on two reconciliation bills in July 1997, including the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 with a separate title on budget enforcement known as the Budget Enforcement Act of 1997. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 (BEA of 1997; P.L. 105-33) was signed into law by President Clinton on August 5, 1997. It extended discretionary spending limits through FY2002 and applied PAYGO procedures to legislation enacted through FY2002. The BEA of 1997 divided discretionary spending limits into categories for FY1998 and FY1999, and for FY2000 there were separate limits for crime reduction and other discretionary spending. Overall, the BEA of 1997 aimed to ensure compliance with multi-year budget policies and preserve deficit reduction achieved in reconciliation bills. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 extended discretionary spending limits through FY2002 and applied PAYGO procedures. The act reset all existing pay-as-you-go balances to zero and excluded certain savings from PAYGO calculations. The PAYGO procedures were terminated in December 2002 by H.R. 5708 to prevent a PAYGO sequester for FY2003 and beyond. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on December 2, 2002."
