    "content": "The \"Responsibility in Drug and Device Advertising Act of 2008\" amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to address direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs or devices. It introduces section 503C regarding the conduct of such advertising. The \"Responsibility in Drug and Device Advertising Act of 2008\" introduces section 503C, prohibiting direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs or devices for the first three years after approval or notification. The \"Responsibility in Drug and Device Advertising Act of 2008\" prohibits direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs or devices for the first three years after approval or notification. The Secretary may waive this prohibition during the third year if the sponsor submits an application and it is determined to have affirmative value to public health. The sponsor of a drug or device must submit an application to the Secretary under specific requirements. The Secretary can extend the prohibition of direct-to-consumer advertising for a drug or device if significant adverse health effects are found through various studies or resources. The Secretary must ensure fair balance in direct-to-consumer advertising of drugs and devices, supported by evidence. Regulations governing advertisements must be revised within a year of enactment. This section does not limit the Secretary's authority to regulate such advertising under other laws. The amendments made by this section apply to drugs and devices approved under specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, one year before the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. PROMINENT DISPLAY OF INFORMATION IN ADVERTISING ON SIDE EFFECTS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND EFFECTIVENESS. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires brief summaries of side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness to be prominently displayed in direct-to-consumer advertisements. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act mandates that direct-to-consumer advertisements must include concise summaries of side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness. Additionally, a study required by a previous act is to be discontinued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Similar rules for devices are also addressed in the amendment. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires direct-to-consumer advertisements to include a statement encouraging reporting of negative side effects to the FDA. Effective 90 days after enactment, this applies to all ads and printed materials. The Secretary must revise regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment to implement the new requirements for direct-to-consumer advertisements. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTY. Subsection (g) of section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to impose civil penalties on manufacturers, packers, or distributors of drugs or devices who violate advertising or promotion regulations. The penalty for the first violation is $1,000,000, with subsequent violations incurring higher penalties. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act imposes civil penalties on manufacturers, packers, or distributors for violations related to drugs or devices. Penalties for violations can be twice the maximum civil penalty for previous violations. The Secretary may also order the distribution of materials in the same markets where the violation occurred. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows for civil penalties to be imposed on manufacturers, packers, or distributors for violations related to drugs or devices. Each violation constitutes a separate offense, and penalties are in addition to any other applicable penalties under the law. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct an education campaign to raise awareness about the risks of certain drugs and devices that may outweigh their benefits. Additional funding is authorized for the FDA to regulate direct-to-consumer drug and device advertisements."
