    "content": "The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for all components and functions of the Department of Homeland Security. The Budget Control Act triggered automatic spending reductions, including sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered automatic spending reductions, including sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps. The American Taxpayer Relief Act delayed the implementation of the sequester until March 1, 2013. The joint committee sequester was delayed until March 1, 2013, with a $24 billion reduction in the dollar amount. Statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2013 and FY2014 were also lowered. President Obama ordered the sequester's implementation, with budget authority canceled at the program level. The reductions, calculated annually, will be spread throughout the fiscal year. The enactment of Sections 3001 and 3004 of P.L. 113-6 aims to reduce budget authority exceeding FY2013 spending limits. DHS faces a 0.1% across-the-board cut in the \"security\" category. Further guidance from OMB is needed to clarify the impact on agency resources. Section 3004 of P.L. 113-6 includes across-the-board cuts to align budget authority with FY2013 spending limits. OMB may require additional rescissions if limits are exceeded, with cuts of 0.032% for security budget authority and 0.2% for nonsecurity budget authority. The DHS bill includes across-the-board cuts to reduce discretionary budget authority, excluding certain funding categories. Breaking down the bill by title does not provide transparency into DHS's resource allocation. DHS's pre-sequester discretionary budget authority for FY2013 varies widely among its components. The DHS bill shows discretionary budget authority scored against the budget allocation, including resources available under adjustments to the Budget Control Act. Some components rely on fee income for funding. Less than 4% of CIS budget is from direct appropriations. Detailed numbers on individual components are provided later in the report. The report compares the Administration's FY2013 budget request with the enacted budget before the sequester, showing discretionary and mandatory appropriations, adjustments under the Budget Control Act, and total budgetary resources for DHS. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up bills early in the process. The data in the report may differ slightly from congressional documents. The Senate marked up the DHS appropriations bill early, with the FY2013 legislation being enacted late. The bill provides funding for management activities, A&O account, and OIG. The Administration requested $1,279 million, the House bill proposed $1,020 million, and the Senate bill suggested $1,102 million. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 was 13.8% below the request and 2.7% below FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provided $1,086 million, a decrease of 15.1% from the requested level and 4.1% below FY2012. Title II includes appropriations for CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS, totaling $30,759 million. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 requested $30,759 million for agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The House-passed bill provided $30,946 million, while the Senate-reported bill provided $30,974 million. P.L. 113-6 allocated $31,267 million before sequestration, with a slight increase from the requested level. Title III of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for NPPD, OHA, and FEMA. The Administration requested $5,911 million for these accounts in FY2013. The House-passed bill proposed $5,930 million, while the Senate-reported bill suggested $5,971 million. Both versions also included $5,481 million for disaster relief, offset by a BCA adjustment. The adjustment was $919 million smaller than the one in the FY2012 Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. The Relief Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-77) provided $5,920 million, a 0.2% increase from the requested level and 4.3% above FY2012. It also included $6,400 million for disaster relief offset by an adjustment under the BCA. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill contains funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, with an Administration request of $1,561 million. The Administration requested $1,561 million for Title IV accounts in FY2013, with the House-passed bill providing $1,510 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $1,535 million. P.L. 113-6 ultimately provided $1,520 million for these accounts, with Title V containing general provisions for the bill. Title V of the DHS appropriations bill includes rescissions of funding from previous years to offset the bill's score. The House-passed bill for FY2013 includes $292 million in rescissions, while the Senate-reported bill includes $192 million in rescissions and other provisions that offset its cost by $68 million. Title V of Division D of P.L. 113-6 includes $307 million in rescissions and $104 million of provisions that require discretionary budget authority, resulting in a net reduction in the cost of the act by $203 million."
