    "content": "The \"International Mental Disability and Mental Trauma Care Improvement Act of 2008\" aims to enhance the capacity of NGOs to provide mental disability and trauma care training globally. Congress acknowledges the global prevalence of mental disorders and trauma, especially among victims of violence and conflict. Resources for mental disability and trauma care are insufficient in both developed and developing countries, leading to outdated and underfunded practices. The World Health Organization reports that 50% of mental disorders start before age 14, 20% of children worldwide have a mental disorder, and regions with a high youth population lack mental disability care resources. There is a global shortage of mental health professionals, hindering treatment in low- and middle-income countries. In low- and middle-income countries, social stigma and discrimination hinder full participation in society for those with mental disabilities or trauma. The inappropriate institutionalization of these individuals under poor conditions violates human rights standards and does not reflect best-practice care methods. SEC. 104D.
