    "content": "A corporation can face civil and criminal liability for misconduct committed by its officers, employees, and agents. Federal authorities can prosecute the corporation, its individuals, or both. Indictment can be detrimental for a corporation, as seen in the case of Arthur Andersen. Despite attorney-client privileges, corporations may face increased prosecution risk if they claim these privileges or pay for litigation costs of their officers and employees. The federal courts found that the implementation of the Thompson Memorandum violated constitutional amendments. The House Judiciary Committee passed the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007. The Department of Justice revised its policy on corporations waiving attorney-client privilege. The 110th Congress did not take further action on the matter. Corporate criminal liability is now a matter of legislative choice, with proposals introduced in the 111th Congress. The courts' view remains consistent with a century-old Supreme Court observation that corporations can be held punishable for the actions of their agents. Corporate criminal liability is a legislative choice, with proposals in the 111th Congress. The Supreme Court recognizes that corporations can be held accountable for the actions of their agents, especially in interstate commerce. Federal law clearly applies criminal proscriptions to corporate entities, ensuring effective control and correction of abuses. In determining the meaning of federal criminal statutes, corporations are included as \"persons\" liable for violations committed by their officers, employees, or agents within their authority, even if the misconduct is prohibited by the corporation. Corporations can be held criminally liable for misconduct by their officers, employees, or agents. Prosecutors decide whether to prosecute the corporation, its agents, or both. Corporations often cover legal costs for defending their employees. If an employee is found guilty, the corporation may be reimbursed. Attorney-client privilege and work product protection are federal evidentiary privileges. The attorney-client privilege is a longstanding common law privilege that encourages open communication between attorneys and clients to promote justice. It protects confidential communications made for legal advice or assistance, applicable to both individuals and corporations. The privilege extends to communications from officers, agents, and employees of a corporation to its attorney for legal advice. Some courts previously limited the privilege to the \"control group\" of the corporation. The Supreme Court in Upjohn expanded the attorney-client privilege beyond the \"control group\" of the corporation. Upjohn conducted an internal investigation into bribery concerns, reported findings to the SEC and IRS, and faced a summons from the IRS to turn over investigation files. The Supreme Court in Upjohn ruled that the attorney-client privilege extends beyond the control group of the corporation. Upjohn refused to comply with the IRS summons, claiming privileges, but the Sixth Circuit Court rejected the claim. The Supreme Court found the control group test insufficiently protective, as it hindered full and frank disclosures necessary for legal advice. In Upjohn, the attorney-client privilege extends to the corporation, allowing communications with the attorney to be protected. The issue of selective waiver, where disclosure may not waive the privilege entirely, has divided circuits. This concept was first raised in Diversified Industries v. Meredith regarding voluntary disclosure to government agencies like the SEC. The attorney-client privilege extends to corporations, protecting communications with attorneys. Circuits differ on whether disclosure to the SEC waives the privilege. The common interest privilege applies when an attorney represents multiple clients with a shared interest. The attorney-client privilege extends to corporations, protecting communications with attorneys. In cases where two or more clients are jointly represented by individual attorneys in a common defense, a 'joint defense privilege' may apply to protect the confidentiality of communications. This privilege typically requires the consent of all parties to waive protected communications or attorney work product. The work-product doctrine protects attorney's work prepared in anticipation of litigation, shielding their mental processes and analysis. It also extends to material prepared by the attorney's agents. The protection can be waived, but there is debate on whether selective waiver, such as disclosure to a government investigator, can still maintain the protection for attorney opinion work product. The Third Circuit has stated that disclosure to a governmental entity constitutes complete waiver of attorney-client privilege. Five Deputy Attorneys General have issued memoranda on prosecutorial discretion, including provisions on waiver of attorney-client and work product protection. The Holder Memorandum, signed in 1999 by Attorney Generals Holder, Thompson, McNulty, and Filip, provided guidelines for prosecutors when charging corporations with criminal activity. Factors included the nature of the offense, pervasiveness of wrongdoing, cooperation, compliance program, remedial actions, collateral consequences, and non-criminal remedies. The Holder Memorandum outlined guidelines for prosecutors when charging corporations with criminal activity, including factors like cooperation and voluntary disclosure. It mentioned that prosecutors may consider a corporation's willingness to waive attorney-client privileges as part of assessing cooperation. Waivers can help the government evaluate the completeness of a corporation's disclosure and obtain statements from witnesses without individual agreements. The Holder Memorandum outlines guidelines for prosecutors when charging corporations with criminal activity, including the consideration of a corporation's willingness to waive attorney-client privileges for cooperation. Waivers can help evaluate disclosure completeness and obtain witness statements without individual agreements. The Holder Memorandum provides guidelines for prosecutors when charging corporations with criminal activity, including considering a corporation's support for culpable employees and agents in a joint defense agreement. This support may impact the extent and value of a corporation's cooperation. The Holder Memorandum outlines guidelines for prosecutors when charging corporations with criminal activity, including the impact of a corporation's support for culpable employees. The Thompson Memorandum, which superseded the Holder Memorandum, appeared to call for a more aggressive stance. The Thompson Memorandum reiterated guidelines for prosecutors when charging corporations with criminal activity, emphasizing the risks of not cooperating fully. It included a new paragraph highlighting the consequences for corporations that impede investigations or support culpable employees. The Thompson Memorandum emphasizes the importance of full cooperation from corporations and their employees during investigations, including not giving inappropriate directions to employees or their counsel. It also highlights the consequences for corporations that impede investigations or fail to disclose illegal conduct promptly. The Thompson Memorandum stresses the need for genuine cooperation from corporations during investigations and warns against obstructing the process. It indicates that hindering investigations should lead to corporate prosecution, contrasting with the Holder Memorandum's more flexible approach. The Thompson Memorandum emphasizes the importance of corporate cooperation during investigations and warns against obstruction. It calls for prosecutors to consider convicting the business entity itself in cases involving business crimes. The policies in the Holder and Thompson Memoranda align with federal regulatory agencies' enforcement policies, which encourage voluntary corporate disclosure of violations. The United States Sentencing Commission also amended guidelines in 2004 to support a more aggressive approach to enforcement. The 2004 amendment by the United States Sentencing Commission supported a more aggressive enforcement approach, including the consideration of convicting corporations for business crimes. However, a subsequent change in the Commentary led to confusion and debate within the legal community. The American Bar Association recommended against considering waiver of attorney-client privilege as a sentencing factor, leading to the removal of certain language from the Commentary in 2005. The McCallum Memorandum issued in October 2005 did not make any revisions to address these concerns. The McCallum Memorandum in 2005 briefly addressed the implementation of the Thompson Memorandum's policy on waiver. United States Attorneys were instructed to prepare guidelines for corporate waiver requests. Efforts to address concerns about inadvertent waiver of attorney-client privilege continued in 2006 with proposed rule amendments. The proposed Rule 502 aimed to provide corporations with relief by allowing disclosure of protected information to government investigators without waiving protections for third parties. However, the selective waiver feature was controversial and ultimately removed from the rule recommended to Congress. In 2006, a court in the Southern District of New York addressed the Thompson Memorandum's policy on attorney fees reimbursement and pressure on employees to incriminate. The court ruled that reimbursing employees' attorneys' fees and pressuring them to make incriminating statements violated their constitutional rights. The case involved a criminal tax investigation of an accounting firm and its employees, with the firm indicating a focus on protecting itself rather than its employees. The firm stopped covering litigation costs for employees who didn't cooperate with the government's investigation or invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege. Prosecutors warned against rewarding misconduct and closely monitored any fees not legally required. Employees were informed that attorneys' fees would be capped at $400,000 and cut off for those charged with criminal wrongdoing. Prosecutors notified the firm's attorney of uncooperative employees during the investigation. The firm's attorney advised uncooperative employees of potential termination and fee cuts. A deferred prosecution agreement was reached, including a $456 million fine and cooperation in investigations. Former officers sought dismissal of indictments citing constitutional violations. The government agreed to accept any fee arrangement with former officers and employees, leading to the dismissal of indictments against some defendants. However, indictments were not dismissed for three individuals who had left the firm earlier. The constitutional provisions involved include the Fifth Amendment's protection against deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process, and the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel in criminal prosecutions. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide protection against oppressive governmental actions that deny fundamental rights. The courts are cautious in recognizing new claims under substantive due process, which does not protect against private deprivations or impose duties on the government. It only safeguards legally recognized entitlements, not expectations or anticipated benefits. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments provide protection against oppressive government actions that deny fundamental rights. Substantive due process requires government actions to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. Courts use the Rochin standard to determine if government action violates substantive due process by shocking the conscience. The Stein court recognized a criminal defendant's right to obtain and use resources for defense free from government interference. The court found that the government's actions impinged upon the right to obtain and use resources for defense free from interference. The Thompson Memorandum and pressure on the accounting firm to cut off payment of attorneys' fees were not sufficiently tailored to serve the government's interests. The court criticized the government's actions regarding legal fees, stating that it impinged on the right to obtain defense resources without interference. The Thompson Memorandum's focus on legal fee payments was deemed problematic and not indicative of cooperation. The Stein district court initially deferred dismissing indictments in hopes of finding an alternative remedy. The court criticized the government's actions regarding legal fees, finding them deliberately indifferent to defendants' rights. The government's behavior was deemed to shock the conscience in a constitutional sense. The court also addressed the self-incrimination issue in a separate decision, finding some violations but not in all instances. Statements obtained under threat of job termination are generally inadmissible in criminal proceedings. During the Stein case investigation, employees were coerced into making statements under threat of job termination. The court found the firm's conduct attributable to the government, leading to the suppression of only two out of nine challenged statements. The Second Circuit did not address the Fifth Amendment issues due to its treatment of the Assistance of Counsel. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to assistance of counsel in criminal prosecutions, attaching once formal charges are initiated. However, limitations exist, such as not being able to use confiscated funds to secure counsel of choice. The government argued that their actions did not violate the Sixth Amendment as they occurred before indictment, but the court disagreed, stating that impeding the employees' criminal defense after indictment was a clear violation. The court also rejected the argument that the employees had no right to use someone else's money for legal expenses, as they had a reasonable expectation that their firm would cover these costs. The district court and court of appeals agreed that the government's actions interfered with the defendants' ability to mount a defense, leading to the dismissal of indictments. The government's influence on KPMG's legal fee policy was deemed unjustifiable and a violation of the Sixth Amendment. Congressional hearings were held on the matter during the 109th Congress. During hearings on the Thompson Memorandum policy in the 109th Congress, witnesses argued that the policy led to a culture of waiver where companies felt pressured to comply with Justice Department requests to waive attorney-client privileges. This pressure hindered employees from seeking legal advice during investigations. The Holder and Thompson Memoranda aimed to hold large companies and their executives accountable for criminal conduct, emphasizing that privilege waivers should not be routinely sought. The Justice Department believed in balancing the legitimate interests of privilege with accountability for potential corporate prosecutions. The McNulty Memorandum, issued in December 2006, superseded previous guidelines on privilege waivers in corporate prosecutions. Senator Specter introduced S. 30 to prohibit federal authorities from requesting privilege waivers or using them to influence prosecutorial decisions. The McNulty Memorandum, issued in December 2006, superseded previous guidelines on privilege waivers in corporate prosecutions. It rewrote principles on attorney-client and work product protection waivers, emphasizing that prosecutors should only request waivers in exceptional circumstances. The McNulty Memorandum, issued in December 2006, emphasized that prosecutors should only request waivers of attorney-client or work product protections in exceptional circumstances. A legitimate need for privileged information is determined by balancing policy considerations and law enforcement needs, considering factors such as the benefit to the investigation, availability of alternative means, completeness of voluntary disclosure, and collateral consequences to a corporation. The McNulty Memorandum categorized attorney-client and work product material into two categories: Category I for factual information and Category II for opinion work product material. Prosecutors were cautioned to only seek waiver of Category II material in rare circumstances. Approval from higher authorities was required for requesting both Category I and Category II information. Refusal by a corporation to waive was not to be taken lightly. The McNulty Memorandum outlined guidelines for prosecutors regarding attorney-client privilege and work product material. It emphasized the need for approval from higher authorities before seeking certain information and stated that a corporation's refusal to waive privilege should not impact prosecutorial discretion. Additionally, it addressed the issue of attorneys' fees, stating that prosecutors generally should not consider whether a corporation is advancing fees to employees under investigation, except in rare cases where it may impede a criminal investigation. Approval from the Deputy Attorney General is required before considering this factor in charging decisions. Senator Specter introduced the Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2007 (S. 186) in the 110th Congress, which reappeared as S. 3217. The bill was similar to previous versions introduced in earlier Congresses and received praise for changes in the McNulty Memorandum. The Thompson Memorandum emphasizes the importance of attorney-client privilege, sets strict procedures for waiver requests, and aims to balance investigation of white-collar crime with fairness to corporations. Experience since the McNulty Memorandum shows no widespread prosecutorial abuse, making legislative action unnecessary. However, proposed bills may lead to an increase in prosecutorial abuse claims that could deter prosecutions. The McNulty Memorandum may deter prosecution of worthy cases by compelling waiver of Fifth Amendment rights or termination, making it difficult to prosecute white-collar crime. Legislative proposals aim to address concerns such as routine waiver of attorney-client privilege and lack of enforcement mechanisms in the Memorandum. The McNulty Memorandum may deter prosecution of white-collar crime by compelling waiver of Fifth Amendment rights or termination. Legislative proposals aim to address concerns such as routine waiver of attorney-client privilege and lack of enforcement mechanisms. The proposals would uphold the finest traditions of the DoJ in combating corporate crime. Senator Specter addressed concerns about the DoJ's ability to combat corporate crime effectively in S. 3217. The bill excluded certain terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and crime-for-profit entities from its protections. Unlike previous legislation, S. 3217 also covered administrative proceedings and removed the ability for organizations to claim privileges in prosecutorial considerations. Additionally, it allowed authorities to seek information beyond privilege considerations, including through federal grand jury subpoenas. S. 3217 aimed to combat corporate crime effectively by allowing authorities to seek information beyond privilege considerations, including through federal grand jury subpoenas. The bill excluded certain terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and crime-for-profit entities from its protections and covered administrative proceedings. Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip issued a superseding memorandum with revisions to the U.S. Attorneys Manual, but the proposals did not progress further in the 110th Congress. The Filip Memorandum revisions address qualifications for the 'cooperation' mitigating factor in prosecutive analysis for business entities. It allows corporations to disclose non-factual attorney-client communications voluntarily. Cooperation can lead to credit in cases that may result in indictment, contingent on timely disclosure of information related to government investigations. The Filip Memorandum revisions allow corporations to disclose attorney-client communications voluntarily for cooperation credit in government investigations. Payment of attorney fees must not obstruct justice to qualify for cooperation credit. This is a significant change from the previous McNulty Memorandum standard. In the 111th Congress, proposals were introduced to protect attorney-client privilege, with similar bills in the Senate and House aimed at setting clear limits to uphold the privilege. The Specter bill (S. 445) in the 111th Congress aimed to set clear limits on attorney-client privilege and work product protections, defining them according to federal law and common law principles. It also included a definition of \"organization.\" The Specter bill (S. 445) includes a definition of \"organization\" that outlines how federal prosecutors and investigators may interact with organizations. It distinguishes organizations as entities other than human beings, including state, local, and municipal governmental entities. The bill excludes federal and tribal governmental entities from this definition, suggesting they would not be considered organizations under the bill. The Specter bill (S. 445) defines \"organization\" for federal prosecutors and investigators, excluding drug cartels, foreign terrorist organizations, and entities charged under RICO provisions. The RICO exemption raises questions as it pertains to conducting criminal activities affecting interstate commerce. The bill's use of \"entity charged\" implies application to offending organizations. The Specter bill (S. 445) defines \"organization\" for federal prosecutors and investigators, excluding drug cartels, foreign terrorist organizations, and entities charged under RICO provisions. The bill's use of \"entity charged\" implies application to offending organizations, barring the Justice Department and other federal agencies from demanding certain actions from organizations to protect their legal rights. The Specter bill (S. 445) prohibits the government from rewarding an organization for waiving its attorney-client privilege or work product protection. This provision addresses criticism of the Filip Memorandum, which compels corporations to cooperate with the government to avoid indictment. Under the Filip revisions, corporations are not penalized for refusing to provide privileged information, but still receive credit for cooperation. The Specter bill (S. 445) and the Filip revisions propose changes in how the government can request information beyond attorney-client privilege. The bills aim to prevent organizations from being rewarded for waiving privilege and work product protection. The government would not view voluntary sharing of internal investigation results positively. The bills clarify that they do not apply when the government is authorized to demand a waiver under federal statutes. The Specter bill (S. 445) and the Filip revisions propose changes in how the government can request information beyond attorney-client privilege. Federal statutes may authorize the examination of corporate records, but few explicitly allow inspection of privileged material. The Scott bill (H.R. 4326) mentions \"any other federal statute that may authorize\" access to privileged material, while the Specter bill may limit access to instances of explicit statutory authority. The Specter bill and the Filip revisions propose changes in how the government can request information beyond attorney-client privilege, limiting access to instances of explicit statutory authority. Federal prosecutors may consider certain activities by a corporation when determining criminal charges, but only if those activities are federal crimes. The proposals aim to address the \"culture of waiver\" created by the Thompson Memorandum, establish consistent policy for federal investigative agencies, and provide stability. Some argue that the proposals may complicate DOJ corporate charging policy without reducing waiver occurrences. Hearings on the proposals had not been held as of February 2010 in the 111th Congress."
