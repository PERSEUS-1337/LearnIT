    "content": "The \"Reciprocal Market Access Act of 2013\" may be cited as such. The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds that the fundamental tenet of the WTO is reciprocal market access, as stated in the Marrakesh Agreement. The American people expect promises made by trade negotiators to be realized for US businesses. A results-oriented approach is necessary for future trade agreements. The United States emphasizes the need for verification procedures in trade negotiations to ensure market access and reciprocal trade benefits. Tariffs have been reduced or eliminated, making nontariff barriers the main challenge for US exports. The US market is known for its openness with low tariff rates and limited nontariff barriers. The US often relies on leverage to address nontariff barriers in trade agreements. The United States aims to negotiate tariff reductions with foreign countries to address nontariff barriers. Current negotiations focus on separate tariff and nontariff barriers, potentially allowing tariffs to decrease without removing actual barriers hindering US businesses' access to foreign markets. The Act's purpose is to ensure trade agreements benefit US businesses by expanding market access for exports, not just eliminating tariffs. The United States aims to negotiate tariff reductions with foreign countries to address nontariff barriers and expand market access for exports, not just eliminate tariffs. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RATES OF DUTY PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS. The President cannot modify existing duties to reduce or eliminate rates on products for trade agreements with foreign countries without certifying to Congress that tariff and nontariff barriers have been addressed. The President can only modify existing duties for products with the same characteristics and uses as the original product, and any violation of the trade agreement is immediately enforceable. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. If the President agrees to a modification in trade agreements, the United States Trade Representative can withdraw the modification if a foreign country does not reduce tariffs or barriers. An investigation will be initiated if a petition is filed by an interested party. An interested party can file a petition with the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center alleging elements for the withdrawal or modification of an existing duty. The term \"interested party\" includes manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, unions, or workers in the United States of a similar domestic product. The Interagency Trade Enforcement Center can make a determination within 45 days of a petition being filed for the withdrawal or modification of an existing duty. Interested parties eligible to file a petition include manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, unions, or workers in the United States of a similar domestic product. The Trade Enforcement Center determines if a petition meets requirements for duty withdrawal or modification and notifies the petitioner. The Interagency Trade Enforcement Center is defined as established under Executive Order 13601. SEC. 5. MARKET ACCESS ASSESSMENT BY UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION. The United States International Trade Commission will investigate and report on market access opportunities for US industries in proposed trade agreements that seek to modify existing duties. The report will identify foreign tariff and nontariff measures affecting similar products and assess opportunities for US exports. Consultation will be conducted during the report preparation. The United States International Trade Commission will gather information from various sources and submit a report to relevant parties and Congress within a specified timeframe when the President notifies Congress of intent to enter into trade negotiations. The report will be in unclassified form but may include a classified annex if needed."
