    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) is focusing on expanding U.S. partnerships and building partnership capacity with foreign military and security forces, which has brought attention to the Leahy amendments. These provisions, sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, include FAA Section 620M that prohibits assistance to foreign security forces involved in human rights violations. The Leahy laws, sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, prohibit the use of DOD funds to support training programs or provide equipment to foreign security or police forces that have committed gross human rights violations. These laws are important tools in U.S. foreign policy to promote human rights and have been the subject of ongoing debate regarding their effectiveness and implementation. The Leahy laws are crucial in U.S. foreign policy to promote human rights and distance the U.S. from corrupt security forces. However, there are concerns about limiting flexibility and hindering national security responses. The effectiveness of these laws in promoting human rights and their impact on other U.S. objectives remain unclear due to a lack of systematic study. The United States is outsourcing military training through third-party nations, raising concerns about controlling down-range effects. The Leahy laws are debated in Congress, with a provision expanding the scope of the DOD Leahy law. Further action may occur during consideration of FY2015 foreign aid appropriations. This report provides background on the Leahy laws, including their legislative development, vetting standards for foreign security forces, and issues related to the laws' provisions and implementation. Debates focus on expanding the scope of the DOD provision, aligning FAA and DOD remediation standards, ensuring adequate vetting resources, and improving implementation practices. Since the late 1990s, the Leahy laws have been crucial to U.S. human rights policy, with Congress passing conditions on assistance to foreign governments to promote human rights. A key precursor was the 1974 provision known as \"Section 502B.\" The report discusses vetting standards for security forces, issues with provisions and implementation, and the need for standardized practices. Text boxes cover security assistance under the Leahy laws, gross violations of human rights, differences between FAA and DOD Leahy laws, and a case study on Colombia. Congress is provided with further observations. The Leahy laws, crucial to U.S. human rights policy since the late 1990s, include provisions on security assistance to countries with gross human rights violations. In 1974, \"Section 502B\" set the standard definition of human rights for U.S. government purposes. Congress later expanded these laws to cover all foreign assistance, with a focus on counternarcotics aid in 1997. These laws aim to prevent aid to security forces implicated in human rights abuses. The Leahy laws, crucial to U.S. human rights policy since the late 1990s, include provisions on security assistance to countries with gross human rights violations. In 1998, Congress placed a condition in the DOD appropriations bill prohibiting the use of DOD funds to train units of foreign military and security forces if there was credible information of human rights violations. DOD defines military training of foreign personnel as the \"instruction of foreign security force personnel that may result in the improvement of their capabilities.\" This condition has been retained in subsequent DOD appropriations legislation with some changes, including the addition of the words \"or police\" in 2013. Congress amended the FAA provision in 2011 to align it more closely with DOD language, changing the requirement for \"gross violations\" of human rights to \"a gross violation\" and modifying the standard for resuming aid to require the government to take \"effective steps\" to bring responsible members of the foreign security unit to justice. In January 2014, Congress expanded the scope of the DOD provision, aligning it with the FAA provision. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, extended the prohibition on support for training where a gross violation of human rights occurred to any assistance for foreign security force units with credible information of human rights violations, except for disaster and humanitarian aid. The DOD provision prohibits support for foreign security force units with credible information of human rights violations, except for disaster and humanitarian aid. This provision applies to various DOD programs and activities with foreign military and security forces, including counternarcotics, coalition support, logistics assistance, grants, loans, and military-to-military contacts. The expanded provision does not apply to DOD-funded foreign disaster assistance and humanitarian aid. The FAA and DOD appropriations Leahy laws prohibit assistance to foreign military units involved in human rights violations, with provisions for remediation to become eligible for aid. The FAA requires a determination by the Secretary of State, while the DOD requires all necessary corrective steps to be taken. The DOD version allows for remediation of units to be eligible for assistance, with a waiver provision by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with the Secretary of State. The FAA includes a \"duty to inform\" provision for withholding assistance and helping foreign governments bring responsible members of security forces to justice. The State Department and U.S. embassies have a system to ensure no aid is given to units or individuals involved in human rights violations. The Leahy vetting process, in compliance with the Leahy laws, involves vetting foreign security forces for human rights violations. It is a multi-step process primarily managed by the State Department, with input from other agencies. The process includes training and equipment assistance, evolving from a cable-based system to a computerized process. The International Vetting and Security Tracking (INVEST) system was implemented between April 2010 and February 2011 for Leahy vetting of foreign security forces. INVEST is the official system for training vetting, and in some cases, it is also used for equipment provided with training. The State Department generally approves recipients for equipment and non-training assistance through a memorandum and clearance process. The GAO recommended vetting individuals and units receiving equipment through INVEST, but the State Department has not implemented this policy yet. The State Department uses the INVEST system for vetting individuals and units for training, with approximately 130,000 new vettings annually. The 2011 amendments to the FAA Leahy law have increased the workload for vetters, who interpret the vetting requirements to cover both individuals and their units. Leahy vetting is a multi-stage process that begins in U.S. embassies abroad and concludes at State Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. Vetting procedures utilize an online tracking system for vetting candidates for training and other forms of assistance. U.S. embassy staff initiates each vetting request, with relevant U.S. departments and agencies submitting requests to staff conducting the vetting. The subjects of these requests are typically members of the country's military or civilian police. The Leahy vetting process involves vetting candidates for training and assistance, including military, police, prison guards, game wardens, coast guards, and enforcement personnel. Civilian government officials are usually exempt, but exceptions exist. Candidates are grouped in batches for vetting at U.S. embassies, where their names and units are checked for derogatory information. The vetting process for candidates for U.S. assistance involves checking for derogatory information using various sources. At the embassy stage, candidates are either approved, rejected, suspended, or further guidance is requested. Suspended or rejected cases are removed from the batch, and approved candidates undergo further vetting by DRL and State Department regional bureaus in Washington. If no derogatory information is found, candidates proceed in the vetting process. The vetting process for candidates for U.S. assistance involves checking for derogatory information. If no derogatory information is found, candidates are approved and the embassy is notified. Fast Track countries are vetted only at the embassy. If further review is needed, a broader team of State Department representatives may request more information. Leahy vetting is complete when the final determination is recorded in INVEST, with most cases ending in approval. Most vettings through the INVEST system end in approval, with denials occurring less than 1% of the time and suspensions around 9%. Training may be withheld for various reasons, including credible human rights violations or administrative issues. Vetting results determine who receives U.S. assistance or training and are used for reporting to foreign governments. The Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) includes a \"duty-to-inform\" provision for reporting to foreign governments when security forces fail vetting. This requirement aims to promote cooperation with the law, improve compliance with human rights standards, and ensure that U.S. assistance is not provided to human rights violators. The State Department is also tasked with offering assistance to foreign governments in investigating and prosecuting suspected human rights violators identified through the vetting process. The number of embassy staff involved in Leahy vetting may vary based on different factors. Some embassy operations are limited, with underfunded vetting operations resulting in minimal efforts. Congress has allocated funds for Leahy vetting, including $2.65 million in FY2008 for the INVEST system. Subsequently, approximately $2 million was directed for Leahy vetting by Congress. The State Department regularly allocates around $2 million for Leahy vetting, with funding supporting regional bureau vetting positions and contract positions for the INVEST system. Completed vettings are a performance indicator for the DRL bureau, with targets set for the future. Vetting-related activities in the field are typically funded from embassy administrative budgets, with embassies having flexibility in staffing. The State Department provides funding for Leahy vetting operations at embassies, with each embassy having flexibility in how they allocate resources. Some embassies receive assistance from the INL bureau or other programs like the M\u00e9rida Initiative. Embassies with high vetting volumes may have dedicated full-time positions for the vetting process. Some embassies struggle with understaffing for Leahy vetting due to increased workloads from 2011 amendments. Discussions are ongoing to improve the process by increasing DOD participation and enhancing communication between State Department and DOD. To improve the Leahy vetting process, steps include enhancing communication within DOD, extending the timeline for vetting requests, and providing better training. DOD is also considering updating its guidance on Leahy vetting. DRL has increased outreach to human rights organizations for dialogue and collaboration. DRL is increasing dialogue with NGOs through meetings and an Internet-based portal for reporting human rights abuses. The portal, set to launch in early 2014, aims to encourage NGOs to share credible information without endangering victims. The Leahy laws raise policy questions regarding the promotion of human rights abroad and U.S. national security objectives. Some in Congress question if the laws should be modified and how implementation can be improved. The text discusses questions of law regarding the alignment of FAA and DOD remediation standards, implementation practices, and challenges posed by recent expansions of the DOD law by Congress. Three key differences remain between the laws, including remediation standards, waiver provisions, and reporting requirements. Policymakers and experts debate whether these differences should be maintained, modified, or eliminated. The debate surrounds whether the differences in FAA and DOD language on remediation standards should be maintained, modified, or eliminated. Questions have been raised about the appropriateness of these standards, as few units have been cleared for aid after being denied assistance. The \"taint\" remains even years later, despite potential changes in unit membership. The debate revolves around the differences in FAA and DOD language on remediation standards. Questions are raised about the effectiveness of these standards, as few units have been cleared for aid after being denied assistance. The \"taint\" persists even after changes in unit membership. Congressional intent emphasizes the need for credible investigations and appropriate disciplinary actions for responsible members of security forces units before assistance can be provided. The DOD remediation provision requires credible investigations and disciplinary actions for human rights violations before aid can resume. Senator Leahy and Secretary Cohen disagreed on the standards in 1999. Necessary corrective steps may involve removing violators from training units and providing human rights training. The DOD remediation provision requires credible investigations and disciplinary actions for human rights violations before aid can resume. Standardization of remediation steps is necessary to promote human rights and protect against supporting violators. Members suggest incorporating this practice into law for consistency in U.S. human rights policy. The SAC version of the FY2014 DOD appropriations bill aimed to align DOD's remediation language with that of the FAA, but this provision was not included in the final DOD appropriations measure. Some argue that the State Department's standard for remediation may be too high, while others criticize the FAA's approach of punishing all members of a unit for the actions of a few as inequitable. Critics also question DOD's focus on removing individuals from units rather than holding the entire unit accountable for abuses. Some argue for holding individuals accountable for abuses rather than punishing entire units, citing an internal contradiction in the Leahy laws. Others believe that sanctioning the entire unit may be necessary when individual actions are difficult to ascertain. The legislative intent behind the Leahy human rights provision is debated, with some suggesting that assistance should not be permanently barred to \"tainted\" units after offending individuals are removed. Sanctioning the entire unit may be necessary to ensure U.S. assistance is not provided to human rights violators. Holding units responsible can promote a \"self-cleansing\" mechanism. Differences between FAA and DOD Leahy provisions include the DOD waiver, which has never been used. The DOD waiver, never used, provides flexibility for urgent actions in U.S. security interests. The FAA duty to inform aids in holding security forces accountable. Congress and State Department determine funding for Leahy vetting, impacting the process. Financial and personnel resources can directly impact the Leahy vetting process, including funding, technological support, training, and oversight. The recent expansion of the DOD Leahy law to cover all DOD assistance may strain the current vetting system. Some advocates believe the Leahy vetting process is underfunded and consider it an \"unfunded mandate\" on the State Department. While the DRL bureau has improved headquarters vetting operations, the quality and capacity of U.S. embassies to carry out vetting requirements vary. Advocates suggest the lack of consistent funding for vetting operations at post is a contributing factor. Proposals have been made to establish dedicated funding proportional to the size of U.S. security assistance for vetting operations. In the 113th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee proposed allocating not less than 0.1% of funds from the FMF account for DRL to carry out Leahy vetting, amounting to over $5 million in FY2014. This would be a significant increase from the $2 million DRL has received for vetting in recent appropriations. The House version of the FY2014 Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2014 do not mention funding for Leahy vetting. Challenges include developing databases and using technology for vetting, with limited information on embassy websites. Local NGOs may be unaware of U.S. requirements for vetting. Embassy databases are often inadequate and lack technological tools for gathering data on human rights abuses. The State Department provides training for human rights vetting personnel through various means, including web-based courses and modules in Foreign Service Institute courses. Training is also offered by the Defense Institute for Security Assistance Management. The State Department and DOD provide training for human rights vetting personnel through various means, including web-based courses and modules in Foreign Service Institute courses. DOD personnel at U.S. embassies receive human rights training at DISAM, but some military personnel do not take the training course. Studies on the implementation of Leahy laws worldwide are limited. Limited studies show inconsistent implementation of Leahy laws worldwide. Reports highlight varying rigor in application by U.S. embassies, with some having well-developed systems while others lack. GAO found inconsistencies in SOP guides across countries in addressing duty-to-inform requirements. The GAO recommended that the State Department provide clarifying guidance for implementing the duty-to-inform requirement of the State Leahy law, ensure all U.S. embassies have human rights vetting standard operating procedures, and update web-based training for personnel conducting human rights vetting. State agreed with the recommendations but needs to take further steps to implement SOP guides. Standardizing practices and procedures is seen as essential by many analysts. The recent expansion of the scope of the DOD Leahy law in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 to include not only training but also DOD \"equipment and other assistance\" is a step toward institutionalizing human rights promotion in U.S. law, according to some analysts. The lack of consistency in scope between the DOD and FAA Leahy laws is a concern for some. The expansion of the DOD Leahy law in 2014 includes training, equipment, and other assistance, aiming to promote human rights. However, the lack of consistency in scope between DOD and FAA Leahy laws complicates the message on U.S. human rights policy. Defining DOD \"assistance\" and determining resource needs for Leahy vetting are key challenges. Implementing the broadened scope of DOD Leahy vetting may require additional resources and could pose diplomatic challenges. The lack of resources may hinder the vetting process, and determining the vetting system compatibility between DOD and the State Department is crucial. Proactively collecting information on potential recipients of DOD assistance may expedite the vetting process. Diplomatic challenges may arise in explaining why U.S. assistance is being withheld. Implementing the expanded DOD Leahy vetting may require more resources and could create diplomatic challenges. Some analysts worry that the new provision could jeopardize bilateral relations and national security priorities. Congress is debating how to strengthen the application of the Leahy laws, including through the omnibus FY2014 appropriations bill. Many may judge that expanding the scope of the DOD law could require substantial new resources. Foreign aid appropriations have declined, raising concerns about whether existing Leahy vetting requirements receive sufficient funds for effective implementation. Congress may question the quality and effectiveness of Leahy law vetting and request information on efforts to improve procedures. New technologies and methodologies may also be of interest. The Leahy law provisions may need additional resources to improve data collection and monitoring of foreign activities. Establishing metrics or standardized narratives could provide greater insight into the law's utility in advancing foreign policy goals and national security interests. Outsourcing U.S. military training and competition in the international security arena raise questions about the effectiveness of the Leahy provisions. Ongoing consideration is needed for when and how the provisions should be applied in evolving global conditions. Congress may want to monitor if the Leahy laws influence foreign militaries' choice of military training providers. They should question the Obama Administration on the laws' effectiveness and inquire about indicators of success, such as instances of withholding assistance from units with human rights violations. Additionally, they may want to assess if the laws have improved human rights practices in partner nation security forces and if they have enhanced the perception of the United States by foreign governments and populations. The Leahy laws may have positive effects on foreign militaries' choice of military training providers. Congress should question the State Department and DOD on the laws' impact and consider if different standards could allow for important U.S. engagements. This should be examined in the context of the Obama Administration's review on U.S. Security Assistance Policy."
