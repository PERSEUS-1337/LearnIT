    "content": "The \"Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 2008\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Additionally, there is an Affordable Housing Preservation Pilot Program outlined in the Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will establish a pilot program to transfer funds from the residual receipts account of eligible multifamily housing properties to preservation entities during a qualified sale or exchange. The purpose is to aid in the acquisition and rehabilitation of multifamily housing projects with expiring section 8 contracts, ensuring affordability and preservation. The residual receipts account of multifamily housing properties can be used to pay for rehabilitation costs, deposit funds into the replacement reserve account, provide social services to tenants, cover acquisition costs (up to 50% of the account balance at the time of acquisition), and other approved expenses benefiting tenants. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for determining if the plan for rehabilitating and operating a preservation entity maintains the property's condition and viability for at least 30 years. They also monitor affordability and use restrictions, with penalties for noncompliance. The preservation entity must reimburse the Secretary for non-compliance with requirements by returning the transferred amount from the residual receipts account, minus a penalty. The Secretary will designate at least 3 States for the program within 6 months of the Act's enactment, considering States with a high number of units receiving housing assistance payments. The United States Housing Act of 1937 allows for the preservation of multifamily housing projects with expiring section 8 contracts. States with residual receipt account balances are considered for preservation efforts, aiming for regional diversity. A report to Congress is required within 3 years of initiating the pilot program. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must submit a report to Congress analyzing the effectiveness of expanding the use of residual receipts accounts for multifamily housing preservation activities and identifying which States or regions could benefit the most. This section applies to qualified sales or exchanges between December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2013. The section defines key terms related to exchanges of multifamily housing properties between December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2013, including affordability and use restrictions, extended use period, and eligible multifamily housing property. The term \"eligible multifamily housing property\" refers to a project receiving project-based housing assistance under section 8 of the US Housing Act of 1937 and financed after February 29, 1980. The \"housing agency\" administers housing assistance for such properties, while a \"preservation entity\" is an approved organization with the capacity to preserve these properties. The term \"qualified sale or exchange\" refers to the transfer of an eligible multifamily housing property to a preservation entity that agrees to maintain affordability and use restrictions for a specified period, which are legally enforceable. The term \"qualified sale or exchange\" requires certification by the housing agency that the transferee is a preservation entity, will maintain affordability and use restrictions, and will invest in maintaining or restoring the property. The term \"residual receipts\" refers to funds generated by a property in excess of operating expenses, reserves, and allowable distributions. Residual receipts used in the pilot program under section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are not considered Federal funds."
