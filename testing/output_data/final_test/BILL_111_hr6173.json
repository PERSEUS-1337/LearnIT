    "content": "The \"Regenerative Medicine Promotion Act of 2010\" establishes a Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council and provides grants for research and development in regenerative medicine. It also supports innovation in this field through the Cures Acceleration Network and allocates funding for FDA research. Regenerative medicine has the potential to treat chronic diseases, provide cures for various conditions, and address battlefield injuries without scarring. The Multi-Agency Tissue Engineering Science Interagency Working Group supports a national initiative for regenerative medicine research and product development. The Department of Health and Human Services highlights the significant benefits of regenerative medicine, including improved healthcare and economic growth. States investing in regenerative medicine have seen economic growth, increased biotech employment, higher payrolls, and enhanced tax revenues. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit a report to Congress within 90 days identifying all ongoing Federal programs related to regenerative medicine. Additionally, a Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council will be established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council composed of various government officials. The Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council, chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, includes members appointed by the Secretary with expertise in various areas such as drug discovery, development, and clinical research. The Council's functions include consulting with the Secretary and providing information for reports. The Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council, chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is responsible for preparing a national strategy and priorities for research into regenerative medicine, establishing grant priorities, identifying funding sources, and areas with inadequate funding. The Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council, chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is responsible for preparing a national strategy and priorities for research into regenerative medicine, establishing grant priorities, identifying funding sources, and areas with inadequate funding. The Council also aims to make recommendations on Federal regulatory, reimbursement, and other policies to support the development and marketing of regenerative medicine products, develop consensus standards critical to regulatory approval, and assess the need for establishing centers of excellence or consortia. Additionally, the Council will ensure transparency through public input procedures and submit annual reports on its activities to Congress and the Director of the organization. The Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council, chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, prepares a national strategy for regenerative medicine research. It reports progress to Congress, NIH Director, and FDA Commissioner, detailing goals, products on the market, research advancements, and economic impact. The Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council, chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, prepares a national strategy for regenerative medicine research, detailing goals, products on the market, research advancements, and economic impact. This includes the increasing number of companies pursuing regenerative medicine products and the resulting increases in tax revenues. SEC. 5. GRANTS FOR BASIC OR PRECLINICAL RESEARCH INTO REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. The Secretary may grant funding for basic or preclinical research in regenerative medicine, with conditions including direct research by the recipient, partial funding from private entities, and grant amount not exceeding total private funding. Grants will be subject to terms determined by the Secretary and awarded based on priorities set by the Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council. The Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council defines eligible entities as nonprofit entities or institutions of higher education. Nonprofit entities must meet specific criteria outlined in the Internal Revenue Code. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health. Authorization of $100,000,000 for fiscal years 2011-2016 is provided for the Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council through the National Institutes of Health. SEC. 6. Grants for development of drugs, biological products, medical devices, and biomaterials for use in regenerative medicine. The Secretary may grant funds for projects focusing on research and development of drugs, biological products, medical devices, and biomaterials for regenerative medicine. Grants must lead to an investigational new drug application or device exemption application within 4 years. Terms and conditions are determined by the Secretary, with priority given to established priorities. The Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council priorities guide funding for research on drugs, biological products, and medical devices. Definitions for terms like \"biological product\" and \"eligible entity\" are provided. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms such as \"investigational new drug application\" and \"qualified nonprofit entity\" as outlined in the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The curr_chunk defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and authorizes $100,000,000 for fiscal years 2011 through 2016. SEC. 7. SUPPORTING INNOVATION IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE THROUGH CURES ACCELERATION NETWORK. Section 402C of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include collaboration with the Regenerative Medicine Coordinating Council for activities related to medical products and behavioral therapies in regenerative medicine. The Director of NIH may provide assistance for products and therapies in regenerative medicine without certain restrictions. The Director of NIH may provide assistance for clinical trials, studies, basic research, and preclinical studies in regenerative medicine. The Director of NIH may provide assistance for regenerative medicine, including medical products and behavioral therapies, with an additional $100,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015. SEC. 8. FUNDING FOR FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH. The Secretary may conduct, support, or collaborate in regulatory research for regenerative medicine purposes, make grants for regulatory research, and define regulatory research as research on product safety, quality, and effectiveness. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of appropriations is provided to carry out this section. Authorization of appropriations totaling $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2011 and $125,000,000 for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 is provided for drug-related activities."
