The Federal Power Act Amendments of 1999 clarify jurisdiction by amending Section 201(a) and Section 201(b) of the Act. This includes changes related to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, including unbundled transmission of electric energy sold at retail. The amendments specify that federal regulation does not extend to bundled retail sale of electric energy or unbundled local distribution service, as these are regulated by the States. The Federal Power Act Amendments of 1999 clarify jurisdiction by amending Section 201(a) and Section 201(b) of the Act, specifying the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce. The Commission will determine which facilities are used for interstate transmission and local distribution. Definitions of interstate commerce and types of sales are also updated. The Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824(d)) is amended to define terms related to the sale and transmission of electric energy, including bundled retail sale, unbundled local distribution service, and unbundled transmission of electric energy sold at retail. The Federal Power Act is amended to define the term 'public utility' as any person owning or operating facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any electric utility not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction. The Federal Power Act defines 'public utility' as any person owning or operating facilities under the jurisdiction of the Commission, including entities such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, Federal power marketing agencies, State agencies, and corporations receiving loans for electric service purposes. The Federal Power Act is amended to regulate rates for electric energy transmission. The definition of a transmitting utility is expanded to include various entities. The Federal Power Act is amended to regulate rates for electric energy transmission, expanding the definition of a transmitting utility to include entities owning or operating electric power transmission facilities for the sale of electric energy. The Federal Power Act is amended to regulate rates for electric energy transmission, expanding the definition of a transmitting utility to include entities owning or operating electric power transmission facilities for the sale of electric energy.

The Federal Power Act is amended to allow the Commission to order retail wheeling by removing restrictions on resale and wholesale transmission services. A limitation is placed on the Commission's authority to order retail wheeling directly to ultimate consumers, unless permitted by applicable State law. Additionally, a conforming amendment defines transmission services as the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce. SEC. 215. STATE AUTHORITY TO ORDER RETAIL ACCESS under Part II of the Federal Power Act allows states to mandate retail access. The State Authority under the Federal Power Act allows states to require electric utilities to provide unbundled local distribution service to consumers within the state on a nondiscriminatory basis. Any state law or regulation resulting in unjust or discriminatory service is preempted. The Federal Power Act allows states to require electric utilities to provide unbundled local distribution service on a nondiscriminatory basis. States can bar utilities from selling energy using local distribution facilities if they don't provide unbundled service. States can also assess charges on local distribution service, retail energy sales, and generation within the state. SEC. 216 of the Federal Power Act ensures universal and affordable service for all. The Congress emphasizes the importance of providing electric energy at reasonable rates to all consumers and preventing service loss to rural, residential, or low-income consumers. States requiring unbundled local distribution service must consider measures to ensure affordable rates and service continuity. To ensure affordable rates and service continuity, states must adopt measures to prevent service loss to rural, residential, or low-income consumers and report to the Commission on these actions. SEC. 217 of the Federal Power Act introduces National Electric Reliability Standards. The Commission is mandated to establish and enforce national electric reliability standards for the transmission system. Regional and national electric reliability councils, composed of utilities, are designated to promote system reliability. Membership in regional councils must allow open access. The Commission may incorporate standards of operation from regional and national electric reliability councils into national electric reliability standards. Enforcement can be required by the Commission through rules or orders. The Commission can enforce compliance with standards adopted under this section by any public utility or transmitting utility. SEC. 218 of the Federal Power Act addresses the siting of new interstate transmission facilities. SEC. 218 of the Federal Power Act allows the Commission to order a transmitting utility to expand its facilities for interstate transmission of electric energy. The Commission can initiate this process upon application or its own motion, subject to compliance with relevant laws. The matter must be referred to a joint board for advice before issuing an order. The Commission can order a transmitting utility to expand its facilities for interstate transmission of electric energy, subject to advice from a joint board. The Commission cannot force a utility to extend or improve its facilities if it would unreasonably impair service to customers. SEC. 8. REGIONAL INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATORS. Part II of the Federal Power Act is amended by adding SEC. 219 for regional independent system operators. The Commission may order the formation of a regional transmission system to ensure fair access. A regional oversight board will oversee the system's operation, composed of transmitting utilities, electric utilities, consumers, and State regulatory authorities. The regional oversight board appoints an independent system operator to manage the transmission system without owning generating facilities or having financial ties to utilities in the region. The Commission will establish rules for implementation. SEC. 9. ENFORCEMENT. Amends penalties under the Federal Power Act. SEC. 10. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY REGULATORY POLICIES ACT. Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to protect existing wholesale power purchase contracts from being barred by any State or State regulatory authority. This amendment ensures that State regulated electric utilities can recover the cost of electric energy purchased from qualifying cogeneration or small power production facilities."
