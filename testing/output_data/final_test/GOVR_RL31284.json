    "content": "The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) extended and amended the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Major highlights include implementing standards-based assessments in reading, mathematics, and science, providing grants for assessment development, and requiring states to participate in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires states to participate in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests in 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics every second year. It also mandates annual application of adequate yearly progress (AYP) standards, consequences for schools that fail to meet AYP, modified ESEA Title I-A allocation formulas, and educational requirements for paraprofessionals paid with Title I-A funds. Several new programs have been initiated to improve reading instruction, teacher programs have been consolidated into a state grant for various activities, states and LEAs must ensure teachers are \"highly qualified,\" funds can be transferred among programs, federal support for public school choice has expanded, and technology integration in K-12 education is supported through a state grant. The Bilingual and Emergency Immigrant Education Acts have been combined into a single formula grant. The 21st Century Community Learning Center program has been converted into a formula grant with a focus on after-school activities. Provisions from the House or Senate versions of H.R. 1 (107th Congress) not included in the final legislation include mandatory funding levels for Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grants, discipline provisions for children with disabilities, and performance bonuses or sanctions. The NCLB compares major features with previous laws, focusing on aggregate performance bonuses or sanctions for states."
