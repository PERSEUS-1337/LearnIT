    "content": "The Act titled \"Down Payment to Protect National Security Act of 2012\" aims to reduce the number of federal employees. The Act \"Down Payment to Protect National Security Act of 2012\" defines an agency as an Executive agency under title 5, USC. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will determine the number of employees in each agency within 60 days of the Act's enactment. Each agency head must cooperate in this determination. The head of each agency can hire 2 employees for every 3 who leave during a specified period starting 60 days after the Act's enactment. The Act allows agencies to reduce full-time employees by 5% until the Director of the Office of Management and Budget determines the new employee count. The President can waive this requirement in cases of war, national security concerns, or emergencies. SEC. 3 extends the pay freeze for federal employees until June 30, 2014, and clarifies that the freeze also applies to Members of Congress. SEC. 4 reduces discretionary spending limits to achieve savings from federal employee provisions. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to revise discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2013 through 2021. For fiscal year 2013, the revised security category has $546 billion in budget authority, and the revised nonsecurity category has $501 billion. For fiscal year 2014, the revised security category has $551 billion, and the revised nonsecurity category has $500 billion in budget authority. For fiscal years 2015 to 2017, the revised security category has increasing budget authority from $560 billion to $584 billion, while the revised nonsecurity category ranges from $510 billion to $520 billion. For fiscal years 2018 to 2020, the budget authority for the revised security category increases from $598 billion to $624 billion, while the revised nonsecurity category sees an increase from $531 billion to $556 billion. In fiscal year 2021, the budget authority for the revised security category is $638 billion, and for the revised nonsecurity category, it is $579 billion. SEC. 5. CALCULATION OF TOTAL DEFICIT REDUCTION. Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to adjust figures and dates for fiscal years 2014-2021. Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended by redesignating clauses and adjusting the margin accordingly."
