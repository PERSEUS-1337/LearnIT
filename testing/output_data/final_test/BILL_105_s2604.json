    "content": "SECTION 1. DEMONSTRATION GRANTS. Congress finds that the academic year in most U.S. schools is shorter than in other industrialized countries, leading to lower math scores for eighth-grade students. Extending the academic year has shown to increase student learning time, even with additional teacher training and parent-teacher interaction. In the final 4 years of schooling, American students spend less time on core academic subjects compared to Germany, France, and Japan. American students also have less homework than European students. Extending the academic year can reduce the need for reviewing previous material. The Commission on Time and Learning recommended in 1994 that school districts keep schools open longer to meet the needs of children and communities. The Secretary of Education is authorized to award demonstration grants to extend the school year to 210 days and study effective methods for extending learning time. The Commission on Time and Learning recommended extending school hours in 1994. The current section focuses on outreach to develop plans for extending learning time and implementing strategies to maximize common core learning time in core academic subjects. Common core learning time is defined as high-quality instruction in various subjects. The current section focuses on local education agencies applying for grants to extend learning time and maximize common core learning time through various strategies like block scheduling, team teaching, and distance-learning technologies. The applicant must outline strategies to engage students, maximize learning time, and provide financial support for extended school days. They should also demonstrate the sustainability of a longer school year and describe teacher involvement in implementing activities. The applicant must outline strategies for involving parents and stakeholders, collaboration with various organizations for extended learning time, training for teachers, and goals of the activities under this section. The grant under this section will assist students in reaching State standards, assess progress, and coordinate funds with other Federal laws. The grant duration is 3 years, with an authorization of $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2003. At least 50% of the funds will be used to award grants for extending the school year to 210 days."
