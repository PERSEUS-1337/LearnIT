The Medicare IME Pool Act of 2015 amends Section 1886 of the Social Security Act to change additional payments for teaching hospitals with indirect costs of medical education. The Medicare IME Pool Act of 2015 amends Section 1886 of the Social Security Act to change additional payments for teaching hospitals with indirect costs of medical education. The act specifies the payment calculation for indirect medical education for hospitals. The Medicare IME Pool Act of 2015 amends Section 1886 of the Social Security Act to change additional payments for teaching hospitals with indirect costs of medical education. Payments under this subsection are made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund based on the IME pool amount for each fiscal year. The Medicare IME Pool Act of 2015 amends Section 1886 of the Social Security Act to change additional payments for teaching hospitals with indirect costs of medical education. The base amount computed under subparagraph (B) for a subsequent fiscal year is equal to the sum of the IME pool amount for the previous fiscal year increased by the market basket percentage increase applicable to discharges in the subsequent fiscal year, and the new teaching program amount computed under subparagraph (C) for the fiscal year. The base amount computed under subparagraph (B) is $9,500,000,000, increased by the weighted average number of full-time-equivalent resident positions in approved medical residency training programs for fiscal years 2015 through 2019, multiplied by the national average expenditures per resident position attributable to additional payments for discharges in the fiscal year. The new teaching program amount is calculated based on the weighted average number of full-time-equivalent resident positions in approved medical residency training programs for which payment is first made in the fiscal year, multiplied by the IME pool amount for the fiscal year divided by the average number of all full-time positions. The allotment factor for hospitals eligible for payment under this subsection is based on the weighted average number of full-time-equivalent residents in approved medical residency training programs for the cost reporting period. The Secretary adjusts the allotment factor for hospitals based on the weighted average number of full-time-equivalent residents in approved medical residency training programs for cost reporting periods."
