    "content": "Long-standing U.S. policy treats the U.S.-flag international fleet as a naval auxiliary for times of war or national emergency. During extended military conflicts overseas, 90% or more of military cargoes are typically carried by ship. Congress requires government-impelled cargo, including military supplies and foreign aid, to be carried on U.S.-flag ships. Regulations suggested by MARAD may also require some U.S.-bound cargo financed by the government to be carried on U.S.-flag ships. Cargo preference requirements, also known as \"preference cargo,\" mandate that some U.S.-bound cargo financed by the government must be transported on U.S.-flag ships. While controversial due to increased costs and potential delays, this policy is crucial for certain U.S.-flag ship lines that struggle to compete with foreign-flag ships in the private sector. Various bills reflect disagreements on the future of cargo preference policy. The United States has three U.S.-flag fleets for carrying commercial cargo, including the Jones Act fleet which operates under U.S. ownership, built in the U.S., and crewed by U.S. citizens. These ships benefit from exclusive access to certain cargoes but do not receive direct subsidies. The U.S.-flag international fleet consists of vessels registered under U.S. law for transporting cargo and passengers between the U.S. and other countries. The U.S.-flag international fleet consists of roughly 80 privately owned ships, including containerships and roll-on/roll-off ramps for vehicles. These ships are owned by 19 ocean carriers and crewed by 3,200 merchant mariners. The Military Sealift Command operates a fleet of about 120 ships, supporting Navy combatant ships at sea and performing missions like ocean surveillance and submarine tendering. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) operates a fleet of approximately 50 vessels that carry military cargoes in port-to-port voyages. The MSC fleet includes oil tankers, containerships, and roll-on/roll-off ships crewed by about 6,000 licensed mariners. The MSC bills the Department of Defense for ocean transportation services and does not receive direct appropriations from Congress. Additionally, there is a reserve fleet of 46 inactive vessels available for military deployment. The Ready Reserve Force (RRF) consists of 46 ships with a skeleton crew of 460 mariners, requiring an additional 1,200 mariners when activated. The average age of RRF ships is 40 years, mostly roll-on/roll-off ships. The RRF is part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) managed by MARAD in peacetime and the MSC during military deployment. The reserve fleet is relevant to cargo preference as it provides employment for mariners when activated. Cargo preference laws were established to ensure that U.S. military supplies are transported on U.S. vessels, whether government-owned or privately owned. In 1949, the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) was formed by consolidating the Army's Transport Service and the Navy's cargo fleet, creating a fleet of 335 ships. The MSTS fleet not only transported military personnel and cargo but also carried military-related cargo such as dependents and personal property of military personnel and employees of military contractors. The Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) fleet transported military personnel, cargo, and related items for military personnel and employees of military contractors. It also carried foreigners with government grants, civilian employees of federal agencies, refugees, and displaced persons. MSTS ships operated at a lower cost compared to private U.S.-flag carriers, which lobbied against MSTS expansion to protect their business interests. In 1950, the MSTS commander revealed the policy to prioritize the use of its own ships before offering cargo to commercial carriers. In 1951, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Department of Commerce and DOD, outlining the priority for obtaining additional shipping capacity. This included purchasing space on U.S.-flag liner services, chartering U.S.-flag vessels, and activating government-owned vessels from the military reserve fleet before considering foreign-flag ships. The Wilson-Weeks agreement in 1954 restricted the size of the MSTS fleet to 151 ships, aiming to allocate more military cargo to privately owned U.S.-flag vessels. This led to the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, which initially proposed that all government-impelled cargoes be carried by U.S.-flag vessels, but was later amended due to opposition from the Eisenhower Administration. The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 reduced the 100% requirement to 50% for U.S.-flag operators, shifted responsibility from the Commerce Department, and mandated fair rates. Congress aimed to promote private U.S.-flag carriers over MSTS. Amendments favored private carriers, especially for U.S. foreign-aid cargo, with requirements for U.S.-built ships or U.S.-flagged vessels. In 1970, Congress empowered MARAD to regulate federal agencies' compliance with the Cargo Preference Act of 1954. The Military Sealift Command was renamed to the Military Sealift Command (MSC). In 1985, Congress increased the requirement for food-aid tonnage shipped on U.S.-flag vessels to 75% and mandated a portion to be shipped through Great Lakes ports. The Maritime Security Program (MSP) was established in 1996 to replace a similar program from 1936. The Maritime Security Program (MSP) was established in 1996 to replace the Operating Differential Subsidy program (ODS). MSP provides a flat per-ship operating subsidy to offset the higher cost of registering under the U.S. flag. MSP carriers are also required to provide overland transport to the military in addition to port-to-port ocean transport. The Maritime Security Program (MSP) provides an operating subsidy to U.S.-flag international operators for registering their ships under the U.S. flag. Congress granted MARAD the authority to require \"make up\" cargoes and impose civil penalties if federal agencies do not meet the percentage of cargo required to be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. In 2012, Congress lowered the required share of food aid to be carried in U.S.-flag vessels from 75% to 50%. At a recent hearing, a representative of the U.S.-flag shipping industry emphasized the importance of DOD's \"commercial first\" policy to prioritize military cargo for privately owned U.S. flag vessels. The witness highlighted that U.S. flag vessels carried over 90% of war material to forward-operating bases during recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, urging Congress to ensure DOD's continued adherence to this policy despite tensions with the Military Sealift Command. In the 1980s and 1990s, disputes arose between the Military Sealift Command (MSC) and private U.S.-flag vessel owners over the use of MSC's own ships for resupply missions. Commercial operators sued MSC for allegedly inflating costs to favor their own ships over private bids. Despite opposition, MSC's fleet grew from 120 to nearly 200 vessels. U.S.-flag container carriers threatened to reflag their ships under foreign registry, prompting calls for more military-related shipping to be given to commercial operators. The Navy attempted to amend the Wilson-Weeks agreement to nullify it, leading to tensions with the commercial industry. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) faced challenges in using its own vessels for shipments and acquiring roll-on/roll-off ships, causing disputes with MARAD. U.S.-flag carriers shifted focus to funding the MSP program and enforcing cargo preferences. MSC's fleet stabilized at around 120 ships, with U.S.-flag operators wary of MSC's attempts to allow foreign carriers to bid on contracts for lower rates. In recent years, military cargo has accounted for the majority of government-sponsored cargo, with about 86% of cargo preference tonnage in FY2011. Historically, cargo preference requirements have focused on U.S. exports, but imports with federal financial assistance were not always subject to these requirements. The FY2009 Defense Act specifies that cargo preference must be enforced on all imported goods. The FY2009 Defense Act mandates that cargo preference requirements apply to imported goods financed with federal funds, with at least 50% needing to be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. Disputes have arisen over the application of these requirements, such as in the case of imported wind turbines financed with Department of Energy Loan Guarantees. MARAD's attempt to enforce cargo preference on vessel components for ships constructed with federal loan guarantees has faced objections. MARAD has faced objections regarding its authority to enforce cargo preference requirements for ships constructed with federal loan guarantees. A draft notice of proposed rulemaking for this issue has been submitted for approval but is still under interagency review. The U.S.-flag international fleet has significantly decreased from 850 ships to 80 since 1955, with their market share now at around 1%. The U.S.-flag international fleet has shrunk from 850 ships to 80, with 60 receiving annual subsidies for military use. The privately owned fleet size fluctuates, reaching a peak of 107 ships in 2011. Vessels joining the fleet require approval from MARAD and the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S.-flag international fleet seeks a \"registry endorsement\" from the U.S. Coast Guard, with over 30 ships built before 2000. If preference cargoes are unavailable, older ships may be scrapped. About 60% of the fleet is controlled by U.S. entities owned by foreign shipping lines. Maersk Line, the largest operator, owns 27 U.S.-flag vessels. The U.S.-flag international fleet consists of small fleets with a few ships each, while leading foreign-flag operators have hundreds of ships. U.S.-flag carriers heavily rely on preference cargos for profitability, facing higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag carriers. The cost difference between U.S.-flag and foreign-flag containerships is mainly due to higher wage costs. Changes in U.S. food-aid policy and military shipments may impact preference cargo volume. The authorization of the Export-Import Bank expired in 2015, potentially affecting U.S.-flag freight revenue. Increased U.S. military presence in Asia could boost demand for U.S.-flag shipping. The trend towards specialized and larger commercial ships may not align with military shipping needs, which require versatility in cargo capabilities. Smaller mixed-cargo vessels are preferred for military use, especially roll-on/roll-off ships. Cargo preference eligibility favors these types of vessels. The military's shipping needs for versatile cargo capabilities may not align with the trend towards specialized and larger commercial ships. Commercial vessels are now designed for fuel efficiency and slower speeds, which may not meet the military's need for fast ships with the ability to accommodate a wide variety of equipment and supplies. As a result, the military utility of the U.S. merchant marine may now rely more on the crews than the ships themselves. The military's shipping needs may not align with the trend towards specialized commercial ships designed for fuel efficiency. The U.S. merchant marine's utility now relies more on the crews than the ships themselves. It may cost more to ship military cargo aboard U.S.-flag commercial vessels due to a cost differential between federal civilian and commercial mariners. CivMar compensation lags behind that of commercial crews in terms of leave earnings and time at sea. Filling a billet in the commercial fleet requires 2 to 2.5 mariners, while in the MSC fleet it requires 1.25 mariners. Civil service mariners are represented by the same unions as commercial mariners but cannot strike or are obligated to join a union. U.S.-flag shipping lines have exclusive contracts with maritime unions for commercial mariners' ship assignments. MSC civil service mariner wages are based on the federal government's General Schedule. Crew costs are significant in shipping costs, but other factors like vessel-related costs and administrative overhead also play a role. The comparison of overhead costs between MSC and private vessel owners is challenging due to differences in accounting practices. The debate over whether MSC or private U.S.-flag ships offer the most cost-effective military cargo transport is crucial. Maintaining a U.S.-flag commercial fleet can be achieved through government-owned or privately owned vessels, but a shift to a government-owned fleet would require utilizing MSC-owned vessels or acquiring more. This change could impact the availability of mariners for the RRF. Supporting privately owned U.S.-flag vessels in international trade is justified by various reasons. One rationale for supporting privately owned U.S.-flag vessels in international trade is that the government gains access to shipping space through the MSP program by paying only a portion of operating costs. MARAD stopped tracking the amount of U.S. waterborne foreign trade carried by U.S.-flag ships in 2003. Maintaining a reserve of idle government-owned ships is to limit disturbance to U.S. foreign commerce during a surge in military sealift. The reserve fleet can be activated to provide additional crew for military sealift without disrupting U.S. foreign commerce. Concerns about using commercial vessels for military sealift are unwarranted if they are not heavily involved in private-sector commerce. The capacity of the U.S.-flag international fleet and competition for preference cargoes may impact the need for reserve fleets. The 1954 act mandates that 50% of government-impelled cargoes must be transported by U.S.-flag ships. The U.S.-flag ships transporting cargoes are categorized into dry bulk, dry cargo liner, and tanker vessels. Only seven privately owned U.S.-flag vessels can move bulk food aid, with four being over 30 years old. Lack of competition in the U.S.-flag dry bulk sector is a concern, with a past proposal to waive the wait requirement for foreign-built vessels. The ODS program was modified in 1970 to include dry bulk vessels to increase U.S.-flag operators. Dry bulk vessels do not receive MSP subsidies as the military does not ship this type of cargo. Limited competition exists among U.S.-flag carriers in the container sector, with one operator dominating two-thirds of the fleet. Rates for U.S.-flag shipping impact cost, and Congress specifies rate reasonableness for different types of preference cargo. Military cargo rates must not be excessive or unreasonable according to the Military Transportation Act of 1904. The Military Transportation Act of 1904 specifies that U.S.-flag operators cannot charge excessive or unreasonable rates for shipping military cargo. The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 requires the use of U.S.-flag vessels at fair and reasonable rates for foreign-aid bulk cargo. MARAD determines reasonable rates based on the cost to U.S.-flag operators for delivering the shipment. MARAD determines rates for U.S.-flag operators based on delivery costs and a reasonable profit. Carriers may lack incentive to be efficient under this method. Liner carriers receive subsidies and must earn revenues comparable to foreign-flag operators for preference cargo. The U.S.-flag liner operator's rates are considered fair and reasonable when filed with the Federal Maritime Commission. Former U.S.-owned container shipping lines, like Sea-Land and American President Lines, have been sold to foreign lines but still participate in programs like the MSP and cargo preference through U.S. entities. Under U.S. shipping law, companies in the United States operated by U.S. citizens but with a foreign parent can participate in the MSP and cargo preference. Concerns about foreign control have been raised, with a lawsuit in 2013 alleging some participants were not truly U.S.-owned. The government supports a private U.S.-flag fleet to maintain a domestic presence in shipping. The government supports a private U.S.-flag fleet to ensure reliable shipping into war zones, as foreign ships and crews have shown resistance in the past. U.S.-flag operators may transfer cargo to foreign-flag vessels at hub ports, but priority is given to carriers that provide full U.S.-flag service to the final destination port. Large U.S.-flag carriers with foreign parent companies have an advantage in arranging ground transport for U.S. military shipments overseas due to their established networks and experience in moving freight. This was evident when Pakistan closed its border during the war in Afghanistan, and the MSP carriers were able to set up an alternative route for U.S. military. The boom in U.S. shale oil and natural gas production has sparked discussions about requiring the use of U.S.-flag tankers for oil and LNG exports. U.S.-flag shipping interests, including labor unions, have pushed for a legal requirement to ship a portion of U.S. oil trade on U.S.-flag tankers. Cargo preference has historically not applied to private transactions, except for Alaska oil. In the 1970s, there were debates about applying cargo preference requirements to oil imports. The Energy Transportation Security Act (ETSA) proposed that 30% of imported oil be carried in U.S.-flag tankers, but it was vetoed. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve required half of the oil shipped by vessel to be transported by U.S.-flag tankers. In the 95th Congress, a version of ETSA requiring 9.5% of U.S. oil imports to be carried in U.S.-flag tankers was defeated. In 1983, a bill (H.R. 1242, 98th Congress) was introduced to mandate U.S.-flag and U.S.-built ships for liquid and dry bulk import/export cargo, starting at 5% and increasing annually to 20%. The bill had 45 House cosponsors but did not progress further. In 1995, Congress lifted the export ban on Alaska North Slope oil (P.L. 104-58). In 1995, Congress lifted the export ban on Alaska North Slope oil (P.L. 104-58), requiring oil to be exported on U.S.-crewed and -flagged tankers, but not necessarily U.S.-built. U.S. shipyards and mariners feared job loss. Roughly 5% to 7% of Alaskan oil was exported to South Korea, Japan, and China before exports ceased in 2000. In 2006, Congress prioritized licenses for offshore LNG import terminals supplied by U.S.-flag tankers. LNG shippers argued that U.S.-flag vessels on certain routes would hinder their supply ability. The 113th Congress directed MARAD to submit a national maritime strategy to make U.S.-flag vessels more competitive in international shipping. Crewing costs are a significant factor in the lack of price competitiveness for U.S.-flag ships compared to foreign-flag ships. From 2000 to 2013, U.S. ship crew wages doubled in real terms, increasing three times faster than all transportation workers. Crew size requirements mandated by a statute from 1915 may contribute to higher costs for U.S.-flag vessels. MARAD's study found that U.S.-flag ships have slightly smaller crews than foreign-flag ships calling at U.S. ports. Congress is considering bills that could impact preference cargo volume. H.R. 1987 would increase MARAD's enforcement of food-aid cargo preference requirements, raising the share of food aid carried in U.S.-flag ships from 50% to 75%. In contrast, S. 525 would reduce the U.S.-flag shipping requirement for food aid from 50% to 0% and increase locally supplied food aid. The Administration supports reducing U.S.-flag shipments and sought $25 million in its FY2016 MARAD budget for U.S. merchant mariners. Congress is reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, with concerns about declining military and food-aid cargoes. H.R. 1735 expressed concern for the decline and proposed increasing operating subsidies for MSP carriers. The House passed H.R. 702 to increase MSP operating subsidies to $5 million per ship, up from $3.5 million."
