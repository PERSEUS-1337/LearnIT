Concern has been expressed about the future ability of the U.S. science and engineering base to generate technological advances for economic growth. Discussions have focused on the quality of science and mathematics education, as well as the importance of scientific knowledge for students in all disciplines. Precollege science and mathematics education is crucial for the future supply of U.S. scientific and technical personnel. However, indicators show a mixed performance of U.S. students in these subjects, with an unfocused curriculum and many teachers lacking subject expertise. Reform efforts have included the development of national standards to improve education quality. The development of national standards in science and mathematics education emphasizes inquiry-based learning to retain student interest. However, adoption and implementation at the local level face challenges due to limited resources and unprepared teachers. The shift to a knowledge-based economy requires a workforce skilled in science and engineering for continued economic growth. The importance of STEM education for economic growth is highlighted in a report by the Department of Education. The report emphasizes the need for citizens literate in STEM concepts to maintain U.S. preeminence in science and technology. Other countries are also striving to improve their education systems, making it crucial for the U.S. to work harder to stay competitive. Various science and education issues are discussed in the report, including concerns about precollege science and mathematics education, improving undergraduate and graduate education, and demographic factors. Precollege (K-12) science and mathematics education is crucial for the future supply of U.S. scientific and technological personnel. A basic science and mathematics education is necessary for all citizens to understand scientific and technical issues. Congressional activity and foreign science and engineering students are also key concerns in improving STEM education. Science education at the precollege level is essential not only for students majoring in science but for all citizens to grasp scientific and technical issues affecting their lives. Scientific literacy is increasingly important across various occupations. Discussions on reforming science education cover curriculum quality, teacher shortages, student interest, teacher training, student achievement, and diversity in STEM fields. The U.S. educational system has a history of attempted reforms in this area. In 1983, the Department of Education released a report called A Nation At Risk, criticizing the U.S. school system for its mediocrity and lack of qualified teachers in essential subjects. Over 25 years later, debates continue on whether the educational system is still at risk. Reforms in science and mathematics education have focused on what and how to teach, with goals for literacy presented in a 1998 publication by the AAAS. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) released revised Principles and Standards for School Mathematics in 2000, promoting student learning through induction, inquiry-based instruction, and open-ended assessments. A 2005 report by the Fordham Institute highlighted the nation's stagnant progress in setting expectations for student learning. The National Research Council released a report in 2002 examining the influence of nationally developed science, mathematics, and technology standards on student learning. The report emphasized the importance of inquiry-based instruction in helping students think critically and solve problems in different situations. The National Research Council's 2002 report examined the impact of science, mathematics, and technology standards on student learning. It emphasized the importance of inquiry-based instruction. A 2007 publication by The National Academies outlined four goals of science education, including understanding scientific explanations and participating in scientific practices. Many science instructors do not focus on all recommended goals, which are deemed critical for a good education in the modern world. Many elementary teachers feel uncomfortable teaching science due to lack of confidence in their knowledge. A significant percentage of core academic subjects are led by out-of-field teachers. Supplemental training can help teachers without science or math backgrounds. Effective professional development requires proper materials and resources. The National Academies report emphasizes the need for enhanced education of teachers at the precollege level, focusing on providing proper materials, training in inquiry-based learning, and class release time. High-quality professional development for K-12 science and math teachers is crucial for student performance, especially when combined with classroom practice, mentoring, and quality curricular materials. The National Assessment Governing Board released the results of the NAEP 2007 mathematics assessment for grades 4 and 8, showing an increase in students performing at basic and proficient levels. The score gap between white students and black/Hispanic students has narrowed, especially in grade 4. In May 2005, the NAEP released the 2005 science assessments to provide a baseline for science achievement in the U.S. school system. 4th graders showed an increase in average scores compared to 1996 and 2000, while 8th graders had no significant change in scores. 12th graders had lower average scores in 2005 compared to 1996, with a decline in students performing at basic, proficient, and advanced levels since 1996. The performance of U.S. students in mathematics and science has been a concern since 1996, with a decline in proficiency levels and an increase in students scoring below basic. International comparisons, such as the TIMSS study in 2007, showed that U.S. students scored higher than some countries but lower than others, with Hong Kong SAR being the top performer in mathematics at the 4th grade level. At the 4th grade level, Hong Kong SAR was the top performer in mathematics, followed by Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, England, Latvia, Netherlands, and Lithuania. U.S. 8th grade students were outperformed by students in eight jurisdictions. Chinese Taipei had the highest average mathematics score, followed by Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Hungary, England, and Russia. U.S. students outperformed 25 of 35 countries in science at the 4th grade level, but performed less well than several countries including Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, Latvia, and England. At the 8th grade level, U.S. students scored above the international average and ranked 11th among participating countries. Some argue that international comparisons are invalid due to cultural differences, but others believe the data collection methods make the comparisons valid. The U.S. spends approximately $455.0 billion annually on elementary and secondary education. The U.S. education system receives significant funding for elementary and secondary education, yet some students perform poorly on international assessments like TIMSS. Despite having top graduate schools, there are concerns about the performance of students in primary and secondary schools. The U.S. higher education system is urged to continue producing qualified scientific and technical personnel to maintain leadership. Colleges and universities are facing the challenge of better educating their undergraduate students. Colleges and universities are restructuring curricula to increase graduates' versatility and employability, with a focus on natural sciences, engineering, health sciences, computer sciences, and quantitatively-based fields. Research institutions struggle to balance teaching and research priorities, with an emphasis on research productivity leading to a neglect of teaching. Efforts are being made at research institutions to change the reward system and evaluation of faculty members to address complaints about undergraduate teaching, particularly regarding the use of graduate students as teaching assistants in science and engineering courses. Many undergraduate courses are taught by foreign graduate students with limited English proficiency. The National Research Council's 2003 report highlighted the need for colleges and universities to focus on evaluating faculty teaching in science, mathematics, and engineering. Efforts are being made to address issues with undergraduate teaching, especially regarding the use of graduate students with limited English proficiency as teaching assistants. Recognition and rewards for faculty excelling in the classroom are recommended to improve undergraduate education. The report recommended strategies for evaluating undergraduate teaching in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, with a focus on faculty professional advancement. Recommendations were made for faculty, presidents, boards, academic officers, deans, department chairs, peer evaluators, and research sponsors. Effective teaching in STEM fields should be available to all students, and curriculum design and evaluation should be collective responsibilities of faculty. Scholarly activities focused on improving teaching and learning should be recognized as equivalent to other scholarly pursuits. Efforts to enhance teaching effectiveness and learning should receive the same support as research and service endeavors. The House Science Committee held a hearing on colleges and universities' efforts to improve scientific and engineering programs, exploring the role of the federal government in encouraging students to enter STEM disciplines. Witnesses discussed factors influencing the quality of undergraduate reforms in STEM fields. Elaine Seymour from the University of Colorado highlights a decline in the perceived value of teaching in scientific and engineering disciplines. Many undergraduates view teaching as a low-status career with faculty more focused on research than teaching. Academic success is often tied to grant writing and publications, leading to less interactive teaching and more reliance on teaching assistants. Poor teaching and unsatisfactory learning experiences are cited as reasons for students switching majors. The pressure to obtain grants has consequences for both undergraduate and K-12 education. John Burris, President of Beloit College, recommended ways for the federal government to identify and support successful undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering programs. He proposed doubling funding for strengthening these programs in colleges and universities, emphasizing the importance of attention to student learning, a research-rich institutional culture, and engaged faculty with resources for research. John Burris, President of Beloit College, suggested increasing funding for networks, collaborations, and partnerships in undergraduate science, mathematics, and engineering programs. He also called for the establishment of a task force to oversee the proposed doubling of undergraduate funds, focusing on NSF priorities and the need for improvements in higher education to address globalization, technology advancements, and diverse population needs. The report emphasizes the need for increased federal investment in key strategic areas like science, engineering, and medicine to maintain global leadership. It also calls for attracting top talent from around the world to drive American innovation. Graduate education in science and mathematics has been a focus, with a comprehensive study proposed in 1993 by COSEPUP to assess the status of education and research training in U.S. colleges and universities. The 1995 report, Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers, highlighted the changing landscape of employment for PhD scientists and engineers in universities, industry, and government. It raised concerns about the lack of a clear human-resources policy for advanced scientists and engineers, emphasizing the need for graduate schools to meet the country's needs in these fields. The 1995 report emphasized the need for graduate programs to adapt to changing national policies and industrial needs. COSEPUP recommended providing a wider variety of career options for graduate students to emphasize versatility and information. Graduate programs should offer a broader range of career options by combining fundamental knowledge with related fields, providing off-campus experiences, and adjusting financial support mechanisms. The National Science Board's 1998 policy paper addressed issues such as fellowships and education grants. The National Science Board (NSB) examined various issues in graduate science and engineering programs, including the role of graduate students as teachers, mentoring, access to faculty, time to degree, and underrepresentation of minorities and women. They identified areas in the federal/university partnership that may need adjustments to better serve the national interest. Changes in higher education demands, technology advancements, rising tuitions, and stresses on universities and faculty require improvements in the partnership. The report discusses the stresses faced by university partnerships due to federal policies, emphasizing increased oversight and accountability in research and education funding. The growing focus on accountability may de-emphasize benefits to graduate education and favor postdoctoral researchers over graduate students on research grants. The NSB recommends expanding partnerships to include more colleges and universities, integrating research and education, and providing greater job flexibility. The report recommends closer collaboration between research and non-research institutions, providing additional training options for graduate students, and rewarding institutions with model programs for integrating research and education. The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation's 2005 report, The Responsive Ph.D., analyzed innovations in U.S. doctoral education. The report on U.S. doctoral education highlights the importance of combining traditional research with adventurous scholarship across disciplines. It emphasizes the need for graduate schools to have stronger central administration and promote intellectual cohesiveness among disciplines for more inclusive and relevant training. Efforts to increase the participation of underrepresented groups are also crucial for equity and efficacy. The report emphasizes the need to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the sciences through various recommendations, including transparent information about doctoral education and expanding mentoring approaches. The Council of Graduate Schools also highlighted the importance of graduate education for American competitiveness and innovation. The report emphasizes the importance of a highly trained scientific and technical workforce for America's economic competitiveness and national security. It highlights the need to strengthen graduate education as part of a national strategy on innovation and competitiveness, pointing out that the U.S. lags behind other countries in support and investments in this area. The report also mentions the stagnant number of scientific papers published by U.S. citizens compared to the increase seen in other countries. Graduate students play a crucial role in driving economic growth and innovation through their research in various sectors. The Council of Graduate Schools recommends increased investments in graduate education to meet the demands of a rapidly advancing global economy. Science and engineering occupations are projected to grow significantly, with a focus on computer-related fields. In testimony before the House Science Committee, Daniel L. Goroff emphasized the need for the United States to invest more in STEM resources and encourage innovation to ensure future prosperity and progress for all. In the 21st century, a larger proportion of the U.S. population will be composed of minorities\u2014blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, with Hispanics being the fastest growing minority group. These minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering fields compared to their population fraction, taking fewer high-level courses and earning fewer degrees in these disciplines. Data from 2006 show that while minorities make up over 29.5% of the population, they only earn 16.0% of the degrees in science and engineering. Natives make up over 29.5% of the population but only earn 16.0% of bachelor degrees in science and engineering. Between 2000 and 2006, all racial/ethnic groups, except for whites, increased their share of earned degrees in these fields. Blacks earned 8.3% of bachelor degrees in both years, Hispanics increased from 7.0% to 7.7%, and Asian/Pacific Islanders increased from 8.9% to 9.3%. Whites saw a decrease from 67.8% to 64.7% in earned bachelor degrees. The proportion of master's degrees in science and engineering awarded to different racial/ethnic groups changed between 2000 and 2006. Blacks increased from 5.7% to 6.6%, Hispanics increased from 3.9% to 4.7%, Asian/Pacific Islanders remained around 7.2%, and whites decreased from 52.1% to 47.9%. Foreign students on temporary visas slightly decreased from 25.9% to 25.6%. Native Americans remained below 1.0%. At the doctoral level, blacks decreased from 2.7% to 2.5%, Hispanics remained around 2.8%, and whites decreased from 67.8% to 64.7%. In 2000 and 2006, the proportion of degrees earned by different racial/ethnic groups remained relatively stable. Asian/Pacific Islanders and Whites saw a decrease in earned degrees, while Doctoral degrees awarded to foreign students increased. Minorities have increased their share of degrees in sciences, but lack of access to college preparatory courses limits their opportunities. Despite gains in the past 10 years, average scores for blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans on the SAT and ACT continue to lag behind whites and Asians. Retention of minorities in science and engineering programs is a concern due to higher attrition rates. Underrepresented minority groups are seeing increased enrollments in colleges and universities, but programs to attract minorities to the sciences are facing challenges. Efforts to attract minorities to the sciences are facing challenges due to limitations on affirmative action in higher education. Many institutions have shifted away from race-based eligibility criteria and now focus on promoting campus diversity. Programs once exclusive to minorities are now open to all students under the goal of promoting diversity. Women are also underrepresented in certain science and engineering disciplines, despite increased enrollment in rigorous coursework. There is a need to strengthen course taking and persistence among women in these fields. Despite efforts to promote diversity in science and engineering disciplines, women still face challenges in course taking and persistence. In 2005, women received around 50.5% of undergraduate degrees in science and engineering, with a slight decrease from 2002. However, the number of women pursuing graduate degrees in these fields has declined. In 2005, women earned 39.5% of doctorate degrees in science and engineering, with concentrations in specific disciplines such as engineering, physical sciences, and computer sciences. Women also earned 55.0% of doctorates in social and behavioral sciences in 2005, showing an increase from 2002. In 2005, women earned 55.0% of doctorates, with significant participation in psychology at 68.0%. Shirley Ann Jackson highlights the need to address changing demographics in science and engineering. Blacks, Hispanics, and women, underrepresented groups, are expected to replace the retiring white and male workforce. The recent Supreme Court decisions uphold diversity but require a new approach to developing science and engineering talent to address the changing demographics. Concerns exist about the increasing presence of foreign students in graduate programs compared to U.S. citizens. NSF data shows a 16.0% increase in first-time, full-time science and engineering graduate enrollment of foreign students from 2005 to 2006. The number of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs increased by approximately 16.0% from 2005 to 2006. Foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering, with higher rates for temporary resident visa holders compared to permanent residents. In 2005, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in sciences and engineering, with higher rates for temporary resident visa holders compared to permanent residents. There are differing views on the impact of a large foreign presence in graduate programs, with some arguing it benefits U.S. universities and the economy. Foreign students contribute to the skilled workforce and generate measurable costs and benefits. Foreign students in schools are part of the workforce, helping with teaching and research. They also contribute tuition revenue to educational institutions. Some argue that immigrant scientists and engineers have led to job losses and lower wages for U.S. workers. The federal government issues H-1B visas to foreign workers, which some believe has weakened job opportunities for high-tech positions. The debate over the impact of H-1B visa workers on the U.S. workforce has intensified, with critics arguing that foreign workers displace American employees in high-tech positions. Supporters of the program maintain that hiring foreign workers is necessary to fill needed positions, especially during slow economic growth. The presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs has also been a point of contention since the 9/11 attacks. Foreign students in the United States are facing a more unwelcoming environment, with concerns about their access to sensitive education and training. There is increased scrutiny on foreign scientists and engineers in research related to chemical and biological weapons, as well as added scrutiny on students from terrorism-sponsoring countries. The academic community is worried about stricter requirements impacting enrollments, while some argue that reducing immigration of foreign scientists could harm U.S. industry competitiveness. President Bush signed The America COMPETES Act into law on August 9, 2007. The America COMPETES Act, signed into law by President Bush on August 9, 2007, aimed to increase research investment, improve economic competitiveness, develop innovation infrastructure, and strengthen science and mathematics programs. It authorized $33.6 billion for science, mathematics, engineering, and technology programs across the federal government, including expanding NSF programs and promoting underrepresented groups in the sciences. The COMPETES Act supported mentoring programs for women in science, math, and engineering, and required the NSF to establish teacher institutes focused on STEM subjects. Legislation in the 111th Congress included the STEM Education Coordination Act of 2009, which aimed to coordinate STEM activities and programs across federal agencies. H.R. 461 and H.R. 1144 aim to improve health care information programs and address gender bias in academic science and engineering through funding for grants and research. The bill aims to develop a uniform policy for federal science agencies to educate about reducing gender biases in research grant evaluations. The STAPLE Act would exempt foreign science and tech PhD holders from H-1B visa limits and grant them permanent residence. Congressional oversight may question if the education system can lead in science. The education system's ability to excel in science and mathematics, encourage underrepresented minorities in scientific careers, and produce future generations of scientists, engineers, and technicians is being questioned."
