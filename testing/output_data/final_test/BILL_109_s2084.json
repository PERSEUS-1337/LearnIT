    "content": "The \"Portable Generator Safety Act\" is the short title of this Act. The Act includes findings related to portable generator safety. The Congress finds that portable generators emit carbon monoxide gas, leading to numerous preventable injuries and deaths. Consumer awareness of the hazards posed by carbon monoxide is crucial in preventing such incidents. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has prioritized reducing injuries and deaths related to portable generators since 1997. The Consumer Product Safety Commission aims to reduce injuries and deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning by implementing mandatory safety standards and labeling requirements for portable generators. This would help warn consumers of the dangers associated with carbon monoxide emissions, reducing the risk of harm. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will require all portable generators to have an interlock safety device that detects carbon monoxide levels and shuts off power to prevent serious harm. Additionally, labeling and instruction requirements will be implemented. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will mandate warning labels on portable generators to alert users about the carbon monoxide hazard. The labels must prominently display the word \"DANGER\" and emphasize the risk of indoor generator use. Portable generators should only be used outdoors to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, as it is a poisonous gas that cannot be seen or smelled. Each generator must have a pictogram stating \"POISONOUS GAS\" and showing the harmful effects of carbon monoxide. Instruction manuals accompanying generators must include clear warnings about the dangers of carbon monoxide. Portable generators emit carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas that is odorless and deadly. It is crucial to operate generators outdoors, away from enclosed spaces, and to seek fresh air if feeling unwell. If feeling unwell after using a portable generator, seek fresh air immediately and consult a doctor."
