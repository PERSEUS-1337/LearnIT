    "title": "AB 1105",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 17204 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow actions for relief to be prosecuted exclusively by the Attorney General, district attorney, county counsel, city attorneys, or city prosecutors in cases of unfair competition. Section 17206 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to increase the civil penalty for violations of unfair competition to a maximum of $2,500 per violation. The penalty will be enforced through civil actions brought by various legal authorities in California. The court will impose a civil penalty for violations of the chapter, considering factors like nature of misconduct, number of violations, and defendant's financial situation. If the action is brought by the Attorney General, one-half of the penalty collected goes to the county treasurer and one-half to the General Fund. If brought by a district attorney or county counsel, the penalty goes to the county treasurer. If brought by a city attorney or city prosecutor, one-half goes to the city treasurer and one-half to the county treasurer. These funds are exclusively for enforcing consumer protection laws. The Unfair Competition Law Fund is created as a special account within the State Treasury to receive penalties recovered by the Attorney General. These funds are used to support investigations and prosecutions of California's consumer protection laws. Funds from the National Mortgage Settlement are appropriated to the Department of Justice to offset General Fund costs. The court determines reasonable expenses incurred by the board or local agency in investigating and prosecuting the action. Expenses are paid to the Treasurer for deposit in the board's special fund or the general fund of the municipality or county that funds the local agency. If a city attorney of a city and county brings an action, the penalty collected will be used for enforcing consumer protection laws. In certain cases, the penalty may be used for restoring or enhancing the premises under court supervision. The penalty collected from the action brought by the city attorney will be used for enforcing consumer protection laws, with the balance paid to the treasurer of the city and county. The security provided by the subdivider will be released either in whole or in part according to Section 66499.7 of the Government Code. The security provided for faithful performance of any act or agreement shall be released upon completion or acceptance of the required work. The legislative body may allow partial release of the security as work progresses. Acceptable forms of security include surety bonds, cash deposits, letters of credit, or other performance guarantees. If the security is in the form of a surety bond or letter of credit, the legislative body must return the original document to the issuer upon completion of the work. The security for faithful performance is released upon completion or acceptance of the required work. If the legislative body cannot return the original documentary evidence to the issuer, the security can be released by written notice within 30 days of work acceptance. The notice must state that the work has been completed and accepted, describe the project, and include the notarized signature of the legislative body's authorized representative. Upon completion of the required work, the subdivider may notify the local agency in writing. The agency has 45 days to review and approve the work. If there are discrepancies, the agency will provide a list of remaining work to be completed. The subdivider can provide cost estimates for remaining work to the local agency within 45 days of receiving a list of remaining work. The local agency then has 45 days to review, comment, and approve the cost estimates. The local agency is not required to go through this process more than once, but can allow for a partial release as it deems appropriate. If the local agency approves the cost estimate, they shall release all performance security except for security up to 200 percent of the cost estimate of the remaining work. Substitute bonds or other security may be used as a replacement, subject to approval. A reduction in performance security is not an acceptance of the completed work. The local agency's approval of the cost estimate does not constitute acceptance of completed improvements. The subdivider remains responsible for the risk and maintenance of the improvements until all required public improvements are accepted and fully completed. The subdivider must complete all remaining works of improvement until accepted by the local agency. Upon completion, the subdivider will be notified in writing within 45 days. The release of any remaining performance security will be approved by the local agency's legislative body within 45 days of notification. If authority is delegated, performance security will be released within 60 days of completion confirmation. After completion of all works of improvement and acceptance by the local agency, security for payment to the contractor and others will be reduced to the total claimed by lien holders. The release does not apply to guarantee/warranty periods or necessary security amounts deemed by the local agency. Costs and fees, including attorney's fees, are not included in the release. The legislative body may authorize public officers or employees to release or reduce security as prescribed, and reimbursement for costs mandated by the state shall be made to local agencies and school districts."
