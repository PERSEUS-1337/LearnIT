    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Savings Enhancement for Education in College Act\" and includes a provision for a credit for contributions to 529 plans. The \"Savings Enhancement for Education in College Act\" includes a provision for contributions to 529 plans, allowing qualified savings contributions to include purchases or contributions to a qualified tuition program if the taxpayer has control over the account and the beneficiary is the taxpayer. The taxpayer, spouse, or eligible individual can make qualified savings contributions to a 529 plan, limited by the taxpayer's gross income and excluded combat pay. Adjusted gross income is used to determine eligibility. Adjusted gross income is increased by the excess of social security benefits received over the amount included in gross income for the year, for the purpose of determining the applicable percentage for qualified savings contributions. The text amends various sections of the Code related to qualified retirement savings, including changing the term to \"qualified savings\" and making adjustments to subsection headings and paragraph references. Additionally, it expands the heading for section 25B to include qualified tuition program contributions. The table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended by replacing the item for section 25B with a new item. SEC. 25B allows for elective deferrals, IRA contributions, and qualified tuition program contributions by certain individuals. The effective date for contributions made after December 31, 2012, in taxable years ending after that date. SEC. 127A introduces the exclusion from gross income for employer contributions to qualified tuition programs. The exclusion from gross income for employer contributions to a qualified tuition program is limited to $600 per employee. The program must be a written plan by the employer for the benefit of their employees, including matching contributions for employees, their spouses, or other individuals related to the employee or spouse. The qualified tuition program allows for deductions under section 151 and grants the power to authorize distributions. It must meet requirements similar to those of section 127(b), with definitions provided for \"qualified tuition program,\" \"employee,\" and \"employer.\" Inflation Adjustment: The $600 amount in subsection (b)(1) will increase for taxable years after 2013 based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The increase will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. The text discusses amendments to various sections of the tax code, including the rounding of amounts to the nearest multiple of $50 and the insertion of \"127A\" in relevant sections. Reporting and recordkeeping requirements are also addressed, along with other conforming amendments. Amendments to the tax code include inserting \"127A\" in relevant sections and updating the Social Security Act to include references to \"127A.\" A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. Employer contributions to qualified tuition programs under Sec. 127A will apply to taxable years after the enactment of this Act."
