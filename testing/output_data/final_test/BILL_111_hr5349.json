    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cambodian Trade Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the Act. The United States recognizes human rights abuses of the Uighur people by China, including cultural and religious oppression. Ethnic unrest in Xinjiang in 2009 highlighted these issues. In 2009, ethnic unrest in Xinjiang, China led to the deaths of both Han Chinese and Uighurs. Authorities detained hundreds of Uighurs, with 43 men disappearing. 21 individuals were charged with various crimes, but their trials did not meet international standards. Despite this, the Chinese government handed down death sentences, and 9 individuals were executed in November 2009. In late 2009, 22 Uighurs fled China to Cambodia seeking refugee status with UNHCR. Despite assurances from Cambodia, 20 Uighur refugees were sent back to China before a refugee determination could be made, with fears of imprisonment, torture, and death expressed by the refugees. Since arriving in China, the 20 Uighurs may have been put on trial, with no further information available about their situation, including the children. The United States policy supports countries complying with international agreements, respecting human rights, assisting refugees seeking asylum, and protecting minority populations from oppressive regimes. Loan forgiveness is also addressed. SEC. 4. Loan forgiveness for Cambodia's debt to the United States is prohibited. SEC. 5. Treatment of textile and apparel articles of Cambodia. SEC. 5 prohibits duty-free treatment for textile and apparel articles from Cambodia entering the US customs territory. The term \"textile or apparel article\" includes apparel, textiles, and footwear. SEC. 6 states that this Act is effective upon enactment."
