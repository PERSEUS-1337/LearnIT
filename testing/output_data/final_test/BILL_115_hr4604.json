Section 404 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include a safe harbor for annuity selection. Fiduciaries must conduct a thorough search to identify insurers for guaranteed retirement income contracts and consider their financial capability to meet obligations. The safe harbor for annuity selection under Section 404 of ERISA requires fiduciaries to consider the cost and financial capability of insurers offering guaranteed retirement income contracts. They must ensure that the selected contract is financially sound and offers competitive costs relative to its benefits and features. The safe harbor for annuity selection under Section 404 of ERISA requires fiduciaries to consider the financial capability of insurers offering guaranteed retirement income contracts. Fiduciaries can satisfy requirements by obtaining written representations from insurers regarding their licensing and operating under a certificate of authority. The safe harbor for annuity selection under Section 404 of ERISA requires fiduciaries to consider insurers' financial capability. Insurers must have a valid certificate of authority, audited financial statements, adequate reserves, and not be under supervision, rehabilitation, or liquidation orders. The safe harbor for annuity selection under ERISA requires insurers to undergo financial examinations every 5 years by the insurance commissioner of their domiciliary state and notify fiduciaries of any changes that would affect their ability to provide guaranteed retirement income contracts. The safe harbor for annuity selection under ERISA allows fiduciaries to consider the value of a contract, including features and benefits, insurer's financial strength, and not necessarily select the lowest cost option. The time of selection for distributing benefits to participants or beneficiaries under ERISA is determined when the insurer and contract are chosen, or when they are selected for future benefit distribution after periodic reviews by the fiduciary. The fiduciary is not required to review the appropriateness of a selection after purchasing a contract for a participant or beneficiary. A fiduciary will be deemed to have conducted a periodic review if they obtain written representations from the insurer annually, unless they receive notice or become aware of facts that would question such representations. Limited liability for fiduciaries who meet requirements, not liable for losses due to insurer's financial inability under guaranteed retirement income contract. Definitions include insurer and guaranteed retirement income contract. The term 'guaranteed retirement income contract' refers to an annuity contract that provides guaranteed benefits for the life of the participant or their beneficiary in an individual account plan."
