    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act.\" It includes findings related to mercury in manufacturing. Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. Additionally, 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological problems due to mercury exposure in utero. The main source of mercury exposure in the United States is through ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish. As of 2004, 44 states have fish advisories covering over 13,000,000 lake acres and 750,000 river miles due to mercury contamination. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is to minimize global mercury use and releases to reduce contamination levels in the environment. Mercury pollution is a transboundary pollutant that is deposited locally, regionally, and globally. Additionally, an estimated 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide. Mercury pollution is deposited locally, regionally, and globally. Only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants in the US use the mercury cell chlor-alkali process, releasing a significant amount of mercury. Only 10% of chlorine and caustic soda production comes from these plants. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States possesses approximately 2,500 tons of mercury at facilities using the mercury cell process. Mercury contamination can occur in products manufactured at these facilities, leading to direct and indirect release of mercury. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States has failed to account for the disposition of mercury used at facilities and accurately estimate current mercury emissions. It is crucial for the US to aggressively monitor and mitigate domestically-used mercury. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, including reducing exposures to mercury for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, there is a focus on monitoring and mitigating domestically-used mercury in the chlor-alkali industry. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must submit annual reports to the Administrator and the State identifying certain information. The report identifies the type and quantity of mercury-containing hazardous waste and nonhazardous solid waste generated by the chlor-alkali facility, the mercury content of the wastes, how each waste was managed, the volume of mercury released into the air or water, and the volume of mercury estimated to have accumulated in pipes and plant equipment. The report for chlor-alkali facilities includes details on the volume and methods of mercury accumulation in pipes and equipment, as well as the quantity and forms of mercury in products for sale. The Administrator may allow combining this report with others required under the Solid Waste Disposal Act to avoid duplication. Additionally, an inventory is required for each chlor-alkali facility. The Administrator, in consultation with the State, conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008. This inventory covers mercury purchased, remaining in equipment at closure, and in waste generated at the facility. The Administrator conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, including mercury purchases, remaining in equipment at closure, and in waste generated. The Administrator obtains mercury purchase records and other necessary information to determine mercury releases into the environment. Regulations for transfer and storage terms are to be established by July 1, 2008. The text discusses the transfer and storage of mercury from closed or closing chlor-alkali facilities, including cost allocation and liabilities. It also mentions a deadline for transferring elemental mercury and a health assessment for employees at operating facilities. The text discusses regulations for the assessment of employees at chlor-alkali facilities under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The text addresses the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
