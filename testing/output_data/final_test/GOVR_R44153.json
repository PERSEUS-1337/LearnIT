    "content": "Reduced barriers to international trade offer benefits to consumers with increased choices and lower prices. Expanded trade provides growth opportunities for firms through increased exports. However, it can negatively impact domestic industries and workers. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) helps workers affected by foreign competition or offshoring by providing benefits and services. TAA was established in 1962 to assist workers impacted by reduced trade barriers. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) was created in 1962 to aid workers affected by international trade. In June 2015, TAA was reauthorized by TAARA, alongside other trade-related policies like Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). TPA grants the President authority to negotiate trade agreements subject to an \"up or down\" vote in Congress. Since 2015, no presidentially negotiated trade agreements have been voted on. This report focuses on the eligibility and benefit provisions of TAA under TAARA, authorized to continue through June 30, 2021. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, established in 1962 to assist workers impacted by international trade, was reauthorized in June 2015 by TAARA. The provisions of TAARA apply to workers certified for TAA after its enactment, with retroactivity provisions for some cases. Workers certified under pre-2015 provisions may continue to receive benefits under prior provisions. States may operate multiple TAA programs to serve workers under different provisions. TAA is jointly administered by the federal government and states, funded by the federal government. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program is jointly administered by the federal government and states, funded by the federal government. The roles of federal and state governments in administering and financing the program remain unchanged. DOL and state agencies oversee eligibility determinations, fund allocation, and benefit provision through state workforce and unemployment systems. Health Coverage Tax Credit for qualified TAA-certified workers is administered by the Internal Revenue Service. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, funded by mandatory appropriations, provides various benefits and services to TAA-certified workers. Under TAARA, training and reemployment services are capped at $450 million per year, allocated to states based on program usage. States must allocate funds for training subsidies, case management, and administrative costs according to TAARA guidelines. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program allocates funds for various benefits and services to TAA-certified workers. Funding for training and reemployment services is capped at $450 million per year, with allocations based on program usage. Funds for income support and wage insurance are not capped and are based on congressional estimates. Any unspent funds are returned to the Treasury. TAA is a mandatory program subject to sequestration, with a 6.6% reduction in FY2018. Congress appropriated $790 million for TAA in FY2018, with $450 million for training and reemployment services and $340 million for income support and wage insurance. The $790 million appropriation for Trade Adjustment Assistance in FY2018 was subject to 6.6% sequestration, resulting in a reduction of funding for training and reemployment services from $450 million to $397.86 million. The remaining $340 million for income support and wage insurance was left unchanged. TAA benefits are obtained through a two-stage process involving certification by the Department of Labor and application for benefits at American Job Centers. TAA is available to workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. To be eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) group certification, workers must have been separated from their employment due to foreign trade. This can be shown through a decrease in sales or production and an increase in competitive imports, or a shift in production to a foreign country. TAA is available to workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The TAA eligibility criteria target workers who lose their jobs due to increased international trade and imports. This includes workers affected by a decrease in sales or production, competitive imports, or a shift in production to a foreign country. Additionally, workers separated from firms identified by the USITC as injured by market disruptions are also eligible for TAA. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program eligibility criteria focus on workers impacted by international trade and imports. To qualify, a group of workers must submit a petition to the Department of Labor (DOL) and the state governor. DOL investigates the petition and publishes determinations in the Federal Register. If certified, DOL establishes an impact date for trade-related layoffs. Layoffs can occur up to one year before a petition is filed for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). A certified petition covers workers laid off between the impact date and two years after certification. If a petition is denied, the group can request reconsideration within 30 days. Workers denied certification can seek judicial review within 60 days. To be eligible for Trade Readjustment Allowance payments, a worker must meet specific conditions including separation from the firm within two years of DOL certification, employment with the affected firm for at least 26 weeks prior to layoff, entitlement to state unemployment compensation benefits, and enrollment in an approved training program. Group-certified workers denied individual benefits can appeal the decision. TAA benefits for individual workers include training, reemployment services, income support for those in training, and tax credits for health insurance. Workers over 50 can participate in the RTAA wage insurance program. Certified workers may receive various benefits to aid in obtaining new employment, with training assistance being the most significant. Workers may receive case management services, reimbursements for job search and relocation expenses, and training assistance through their local AJCs. TAARA caps annual funding for training and reemployment services at $450 million per year, granted to state workforce agencies. Training approval is based on specific conditions, including the availability of suitable employment, benefit from training, expectation of post-training employment, availability of approved training sources, worker qualification, and reasonable training cost. Training under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program is available at a reasonable cost and can be paid directly to the service provider or through a voucher system. There is no federal limit on training funding, but some states have a cap. The training programs include occupational skills training and other customized options. Data from the Department of Labor show that in FY2015, 88% of participants received occupational skills training. In FY2015, 70% of TAA program participants completed their training, with an average duration of 512 days and cost of $13,062. 89% of workers who completed training earned a credential. TAA funding may be the sole source for training costs, with considerations for other funding sources. The state agency may consider public and private non-TAA funding for workers, but cannot require TAA-certified workers to contribute personal funds. Certain federal student aid, like Pell Grants, cannot affect a TAA-certified worker's training benefit. TAARA specifies that DOL shall provide case management and employment services to TAA-certified workers, including skills assessment, developing employment objectives, and guidance on training eligibility. States must allocate 5% of reemployment services funding for these services. States can use reemployment services funding to provide job search and relocation allowances for certified workers. The allowance covers 90% of job search and relocation expenses, up to $1,250 each. Job Search Allowance subsidizes transportation and subsistence costs for job search activities outside the local commuting area. Relocation Allowance covers 90% of moving expenses for workers who secure permanent employment outside their local commuting area. Workers who are certified for Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) may receive up to three times their weekly wage as a lump sum payment for relocation expenses, with a maximum benefit of $1,250. TRA is a weekly income support payment for workers who have completed their Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits and are enrolled in training. It is funded by the federal government and administered by states through their unemployment insurance systems. Unused funds are returned to the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year. The Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) provides income support for workers who have completed their Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits. TRA benefit levels are based on a worker's final UC benefit and can be up to three times their weekly wage. States administer their own UC programs, leading to variation in benefit levels. The highest maximum weekly UC benefit in July 2015 was $698 in Massachusetts, while the lowest was $240 in Arizona. Workers must be enrolled in TAA-approved training to receive the basic TRA payment, which begins after UC eligibility expires. The Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) provides income support for workers who have completed their Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits. The total amount of basic TRA benefits available to a worker is equal to 52 times the weekly TRA benefit minus the total amount of UC benefits. After basic TRA has been exhausted, workers enrolled in a TAA-approved training program are eligible for an additional 65 weeks of income support, for a total of 117 weeks of benefits. Additional TRA is limited to workers in a training program, and they can only collect it while enrolled in a qualified training program. The Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) provides income support for workers who have completed their Unemployment Compensation (UC) benefits. Workers may collect TRA for up to 117 weeks, with an additional 13 weeks available for those completing a training program. The Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) offers wage supplements for workers over 50 who are reemployed at a lower wage, with a maximum benefit of $10,000 over two years. TRA and RTAA benefits cannot be received simultaneously. Eligibility for RTAA requires full-time reemployment. The Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) provides wage supplements for workers over 50 who are reemployed at a lower wage, with a maximum benefit of $10,000 over two years. To qualify for RTAA, a worker must be reemployed either full-time or at least 20 hours a week while enrolled in a TAA-sponsored training program. Workers receiving RTAA payments may also be eligible for a tax credit covering a portion of health insurance premiums through the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC), which is authorized through December 31, 2019. The Trade Act requires DOL to collect and publish specified data on TAA participation, benefits, outcomes, and spending. Data includes petitions filed, certified, and denied, benefits received, training participation, and outcomes such as employment status and earnings after exit. Data on rapid response activities, state and national payments for TRA benefits, training, administration, job search, and relocation allowances are collected by state agencies administering the TAA program. DOL publishes this data in annual reports and quarterly on its website since 2014. Additionally, DOL maintains a database of individual firms' TAA petitions for user access. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program was first enacted in 1962 but saw increased use after the Trade Act of 1974. Program costs rose rapidly in the 1970s, leading to spending cuts in 1981. Participation levels fluctuated in the 1980s, with the program being reauthorized in 1988 to expand eligibility for Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA). The Trade Adjustment Assistance program underwent several reauthorizations and changes in the late 1980s and 1990s. The 1988 reauthorization expanded eligibility for TRA and emphasized training. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 reauthorized TAA with reduced training funding, while the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 introduced benefits for workers affected by trade with Mexico and Canada. The Trade Act of 2002 merged various trade-related issues into a single legislation, reauthorizing TAA through FY2007 and creating the Health Coverage Tax Credit for TAA workers. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program was reauthorized in 2009 and expanded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This reauthorization increased funding for training, extended eligibility to service sector and public sector workers affected by trade, and was aligned with efforts to boost economic activity during a period of high unemployment. The provisions were set to expire in 2010 but were extended temporarily. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program was expanded in 2009 by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, with increased funding for training and extended eligibility to service sector and public sector workers affected by trade. A short-term extension continued the program through February 2011, after which it reverted to previous provisions. In October 2011, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act reinstated some expansions from ARRA, including eligibility for service sector workers and increased training funding. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program was expanded in 2009 to include service sector and public sector workers affected by trade. In 2014, eligibility for service workers was ended, and training funding was reduced. The program was supposed to expire in 2014 but was funded through FY2015 under the Reversion 2014 provisions. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program was expanded in 2009 to include service sector and public sector workers affected by trade. In 2014, eligibility for service workers was ended, and training funding was reduced. The program was funded through FY2015 under the Reversion 2014 provisions. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015 reinstated eligibility for service workers and increased training funding. TAARA contains sunset provisions that will revert the program to a more limited set in 2021. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is set to revert to more limited eligibility and benefit provisions similar to the 2014 provisions starting July 1, 2021. These changes will be in place for one year until the program begins to be phased out after June 30, 2022."
