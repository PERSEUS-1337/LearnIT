    "content": "The Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008, S. 2191, introduced by Senator Lieberman in 2007, aims to establish a mandatory cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The bill sets an emissions cap requiring a 71% reduction by 2050 from covered entities, accounting for 87% of total U.S. emissions. It is estimated to reduce total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 66% by 2050 through trading of emissions permits among covered and non-covered entities. The bill, S. 2191, mandates emissions reductions from petroleum, natural gas, coal consumers, and fluorinated gas producers/importers. It establishes a Carbon Market Efficiency Board to adjust allowances but does not include a \"safety valve\" option. Allowances borrowed must be repaid, maintaining a zero-sum game. The bill, S. 2191, mandates emissions reductions and establishes a Carbon Market Efficiency Board to adjust allowances. It limits domestic offsets and international allowances to 15%, with potential increases by the Board. Allowances can be banked, with a specified total number available from 2012 to 2050. Auction proceeds are allocated for various purposes. The bill, S. 2191, mandates emissions reductions and establishes a Carbon Market Efficiency Board to adjust allowances. A percentage of allowances would be auctioned off for deficit reduction. The bill also includes provisions for international reserve allowance requirements on certain imported goods. Title VI of the bill would impact certain imported goods that generate greenhouse gases during manufacturing processes. The EPA would determine the amount and allocation of international reserve allowances, with a separate trading system possible. Title VIII focuses on carbon sequestration, allowing commercial-scale underground injection of carbon dioxide for sequestration while monitoring adverse impacts. Title IX of the bill allows the President to adjust regulations in case of a national security emergency. Title X requires EPA to limit U.S. consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. Title XI amends the Clean Air Act to limit emissions of greenhouse gases not covered under the program and restrict the sale and use of certain motor vehicles. The bill aims to cap greenhouse gas emissions from various sectors and establish a low carbon fuel standard. It includes an allowance trading program to reduce emissions and allows for credits from carbon sequestration and foreign sources. The bill establishes a Carbon Market Efficiency Board to oversee the allowance market and implement cost-relief measures if needed. A revised version of S. 2191 aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 19% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 63% below by 2050, including all natural gas uses under the emissions cap. Amendments also modify eligibility requirements for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program. The revised bill for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing incentive program and the advanced coal generation technology demonstration program includes modifications to the allocation of allowances, with a portion reserved for tribal communities and international forest carbon activities. Additionally, 1% of allowances are designated for rural cooperatives, and auction revenues will go to emergency firefighting funds. The bill expands the greenhouse gas reduction program coverage by updating the definition of covered facilities. The full committee agreed to amendments including a new Low Carbon Fuel Standard, increased incentives for energy efficiency, and allowance allocations to mitigate economic impacts. A proposed amendment was submitted to allocate auction revenues for certain purposes. The amendment to the bill would allocate auction revenues for deficit reduction. In 1990, during the Clean Air Act debate, it was challenging to project costs beyond the first 10 years, with state-by-state breakdowns deemed not useful. Cost projections beyond 2000 were considered speculative due to changing regulatory standards and unforeseen events like electric utility deregulation. Projections for future legislation are more based on philosophy than analysis. The history of SO2 cap-and-trade program costs shows that 2010 cost estimates made in 1990 were substantially higher than actual costs. The EPA-ICF low estimate was 50% higher than the actual cost, and none of the analyses speculated lower costs. The 2000 estimate was also off by almost 50%. The 2010 cost estimates for the SO2 cap-and-trade program were significantly higher than the actual costs, with the 2000 estimate also off by almost 50%. The overestimates were due to a failure to fully incorporate the flexibility of the program and anticipate technological advancements, leading to lower costs than originally predicted. Factors such as lower transportation costs for low-sulfur coal and productivity increases in coal production contributed to the cost savings. Productivity increases in coal production led to favorable prices for low-sulfur and mid-sulfur coal, along with cheaper installation and operation costs for smokestack scrubbers. Title IV incentivized producers to find low-cost compliance options, with banking opportunities prompting early emissions reductions. Harrington et al (2000) found that predicted costs for regulatory programs often overstated actual implementation costs, attributing lower costs to technological innovation and efficiency gains. The text discusses factors leading to lower than predicted costs for emission reductions, highlighting that unit costs are often more accurately predicted than total costs. Cost estimates for greenhouse gas reductions are expected to be unreliable, with potential for being too low. The analysis focuses on the drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and their costs in relation to S. 2191. The relationship between a country's annual greenhouse gas emissions is determined by three drivers: Population, Per Capita GDP, and Intensity ghg. These drivers impact emissions over time, with efforts to change emissions altering the exponential rates of change. Table 4 provides essential assumptions from three analyses of S. 2191 for the year 2050, showing varying baseline GHG emissions based on different assumptions. The 2050 baseline GHG emissions vary significantly between different models: 10.3 billion metric tons for EPA/ADAGE-REF, 11.1 billion metric tons for EPA/IGEM-REF, and 13.3 billion metric tons for MIT/EPPA. The main sources of disagreement include per capita GDP and population projections. Moving to the S. 2191 scenario, the variability in results widens, with projected emissions estimates ranging from 3.8 to 5.3 billion metric tons. Assumptions about the U.S. economy's flexibility and responsiveness led to interesting reversals in the models. The U.S. economy's flexibility and responsiveness resulted in interesting reversals in different models' projections under S. 2191. The MIT/EPPA model shows the greatest reduction in GHG intensity, while the EPA/ADAGE-REF model has the highest GHG intensity result. These differences stem from varying assumptions about economic growth, GHG efficiency, and population growth. Despite these differences, the economic impact is less than the variations in the models' baseline assumptions. The MIT/EPPA model projects a higher 2050 GDP per capita under S. 2191 compared to other models. The reduction in GDP per capita under S. 2191 is minimal according to the MIT/EPPA model, while the other models show larger reductions. The variability in projections is more pronounced for 2030 than for 2050, with different models using varying baselines. The introduction of the EIA 2008 baseline has a significant impact on the analysis. The EIA 2008 baseline significantly increases GDP per capita variability and greenhouse gas intensity driver variability. The impact of S. 2191 on GDP per capita is minimal in various models, with uncertainties in future greenhouse gas emissions and economic responsiveness. The inability of models to predict the macroeconomic costs of reducing greenhouse gases is highlighted, along with the importance of policy relevant analysis in understanding compliance costs and potential consequences on the economy. Models can indicate the sensitivity of a program's provisions to economic, technological, and behavioral assumptions, aiding policymakers in designing a greenhouse gas reduction strategy. Noise in estimating the costs of a GHG program is greater than a simple three driver illustration, as shown in EPA's analysis of S. 2191. The EPA's modeling exercise for S. 2191 highlights the complexity of estimating the impact of a greenhouse gas reduction bill. The limitations in modeling reflect the inherent complexity of such strategies, which cannot be easily quantified or predicted. While a CO2 tradeable permit program could work similarly to the SO2 program, significant differences exist between acid rain and global warming that affect modeling abilities. The acid rain program's concentration of sources makes allowance trading administratively manageable. The acid rain program focuses on the electric utility industry, with a straightforward allowance requirement imposed at the point of SO2 emissions. Unlike the concentrated sources in the acid rain program, a comprehensive greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program would face challenges due to dispersed emissions sources from various sectors like transportation, residential/commercial, agriculture, and direct industrial use. A comprehensive greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program would face challenges due to dispersed emissions sources from various sectors like transportation, residential/commercial, agriculture, and direct industrial use, which greatly increases the economic sectors and individual entities that may be required to reduce emissions. This diversity of sources creates significant administrative and enforcement problems for a tradeable permit program if it is meant to be comprehensive. One alternative is to move the imposition point more \"upstream\" in those sectors, as is done by S. 2191, complicating the economics of the program. A cap-and-trade program aims to put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, but its impact is complex and may have unintended consequences. Analyzing the program's interaction with the economy can be challenging due to various assumptions and opaqueness. The flexibility of most cap-and-trade programs exceeds that of the SO 2 program for acid rain, which had independent responses from the United States and Canada. The United States and Canada had independent responses to the cap-and-trade program for acid rain. Canada chose various approaches, while the US implemented a system with flexibility mechanisms like banking. Offsets are not a major component of the program, and uncovered industrial entities must become covered entities to participate. The program includes a small reserve of allowances for conservation and renewable energy efforts, but international trading is limited to the US. The availability of offsets from various sources can impact compliance costs in cap-and-trade programs. The importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is highlighted, with population and economic growth not typically targeted for reduction. Technology development is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under federal programs like S. 2191. Funding, incentives, and price signals are provided to accelerate deployment and develop new technologies, impacting the cost of any reduction strategy in the long term. The effectiveness of these initiatives is key to meeting stabilization levels at a lower cost. Technology research and development is a significant policy instrument for meeting stabilization levels. Current studies assume EPA would take no action on greenhouse gas reduction without new legislation until 2050, but the potential for future emission reduction requirements is already influencing industry and consumer decisions. Public and industry awareness of climate change can impact energy investment decisions even without specific policy changes. The enactment of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) has already shown that policy changes can significantly shift the baseline for greenhouse gas emissions. EISA includes provisions for stricter fuel economy standards, higher efficiency requirements for appliances and buildings, and research on renewable energy. These initiatives could lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, impacting energy investment decisions even without specific policy changes. The 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) focuses on renewable energy and aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It includes tighter CAFE standards and expands the renewable fuel standard, requiring an increasing share to be met with advanced biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the law emphasizes research and development in Title VII. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 focuses on renewable energy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Title VII of the law emphasizes research, development, and demonstration of technologies for carbon capture and storage. It expands DOE's carbon storage R&D and requires the Department of the Interior to assess national potential for carbon storage. EISA also mandates the establishment of an Office of Climate Change and Environment at the Department of Transportation to address transportation-related energy use and climate change impacts. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 focuses on renewable energy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It requires re-working of EIA's AEO 2008 baseline to reflect new laws and potential future EPA initiatives. The Clean Air Act could be used to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from various sources, with the EPA Administrator issuing findings on their impact on public health or welfare. The Clean Air Act could regulate greenhouse gas emissions by defining emission limits and setting standards for different source categories, such as power plants. The Administrator has discretion in determining the approach, which could include criteria air pollutants, control in mobile sources, and compliance with various standards like NSPS, PSD, or MACT requirements. The key question lies in how source categories are defined and whether the act's authority could mandate the use of cleaner fuels or set emission standards based on emissions. The Clean Air Act could regulate greenhouse gas emissions by setting emission limits and standards for different source categories like power plants. The Administrator has discretion in determining the approach, which could include criteria air pollutants, control in mobile sources, and compliance with standards like NSPS, PSD, or MACT requirements. The best technology for coal-fired plants could be carbon capture and storage (CCS), with the Administrator making technical judgments on technology availability and achievability. Analysts focus on estimating macro-economic impacts of proposals, including direct abatement costs and general equilibrium effects of greenhouse gas reduction programs. The most common measure presented in analyzing the macro-economic impacts of greenhouse gas reduction programs is Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which measures the total value of goods and services produced within a nation's borders. However, GDP is not a perfect measure of quality of life as it only includes items with a market value and does not account for activities like leisure time or environmental quality. Another measure sometimes used is consumption effects, but these are not consistently measured across models. The MIT/EPPA analysis measures welfare effects in terms of changes in aggregate market consumption plus leisure, represented as \"equivalent variation.\" In contrast, the EIA/NEMS model presents \"real consumption impacts\" in terms of consumer expenditures, making comparisons difficult. None of the definitions of consumption or welfare currently employed quantify environmental effects. Allowance prices are also presented as a measure, reflecting some degree of impact. Allowance prices reflect the aggregate marginal cost of greenhouse gas reduction programs. Marginal costs help entities choose cost-effective reduction strategies. Allowance prices may differ from marginal costs due to program provisions like banking. The activity of affected entities in response to increasing allowance prices reflects their foresight. Early banking of allowances leads to higher prices initially and lower prices later in the program. This ability to time-shift reduction requirements and compliance costs is a key factor in allowance price projections. In presenting cost measures, analyses often focus on aggregate welfare indicators like GDP, which can obscure important insights for policymakers. A 1997 scatter-plot by the World Resources Institute showed that most estimates of the impacts of a CO2 abatement program fell within a range of 0%-4% of GDP, regardless of the reduction requirement. Over-emphasizing GDP or other aggregate cost measures can make compliance strategies less transparent and easier to dismiss. The analysis of cost measures often focuses on aggregate welfare indicators like GDP, which can obscure important insights for policymakers. MIT notes that general equilibrium effects can limit the explanatory value of the analysis, as interactions with pre-existing distortions and other factors are not easily separable in the economy. The two components of macro-economic cost measures are the direct abatement cost of a greenhouse gas reduction program and the general equilibrium effects. Compliance cost estimates would provide transparency and help policymakers compare greenhouse gas reduction proposals with other environmental initiatives. Aggregate macroeconomic cost measures offer a more complete view of the economic impact of legislation and help identify unintended economic effects of compliance. Cost estimates to reduce CO2 emissions vary greatly and focus on an estimator's beliefs about the problem and the future, in addition to technical economic assumptions. CRS identified three perspectives on global climate change issues that influence cost analysis. These perspectives are summarized in Table 6, showing that none is inherently more \"right\" or \"correct\" than another. Cost estimates for reducing CO2 emissions vary based on different perspectives that overlap and conflict with each other. The Clean Air Task Force and the American Council for Capital Formation/National Association of Manufacturers had contrasting results using the same model for analyzing S. 2191. The CATF expressed confidence in the bill's provisions, while the ACCF/NAM was skeptical about the technology and market mechanisms. ACCF/NAM's analysis differs from CATF's by excluding banking, capping technology availability, and assuming higher costs. Cost assumptions varied, but all analyses remained within the 0-4% GDP range for greenhouse gas reduction. Allowance price estimates differed, but this measure should not be confused with actual costs or program expenses. ACCF/NAM did not provide environmental results in terms of greenhouse gas reduction, making it difficult to compare allowance prices with actual reductions. The analyses do not provide enough information to determine the factors influencing the difference in allowance prices for greenhouse gas reduction proposals. Various attempts have been made to analyze the costs of these proposals, with different assumptions being considered. Dr. Repetto has created a website where individuals can answer key questions about cost and benefit assumptions. Through meta-analysis of multiple independent studies, key assumptions affecting GDP results were identified, including economic response efficiency, availability of non-carbon technology, Kyoto mechanisms, revenue recycling method, technological advancements incorporation, and environmental benefits inclusion. None of the reviewed models quantify environmental benefits, making all results worst-case scenarios. Greenhouse gas emissions under S. 2191 were estimated by ten cases, showing a range relative to baseline assumptions. The estimated greenhouse gas emissions under S. 2191 show a range due to factors such as emissions growth in sectors not covered by the bill and the use of international credits. The most stringent interpretation of the bill's emissions cap is by NMA/CRA, which does not allow international credits and uses a baseline that may project lower emissions growth. The highest emissions permitted under the bill are estimated by the two EPA/ADAGE cases, likely due to the use of international credits and uncovered entities. The ACCF/NAM/NEMS cases do not provide estimates of their total greenhouse gas emissions baseline or reductions. Only EPA/IPM offers projections for non-greenhouse gas emission reductions in the electric power sector under S. 2191, assuming implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and only going up to 2025. The EPA/IPM projections for non-greenhouse gas emission reductions in the electric power sector under S. 2191 only go up to 2025. The projections reflect the interaction of CO2 reductions with the banking provisions of the Acid Rain and CAIR rules, resulting in overstated short-term changes in emissions. EPA/IPM also projected mercury emissions reductions, but they were done in the context of the now-vacated mercury rule, eliminating their utility for analysis. Figures 4 and 5 show estimated GDP per capita in baseline and S. 2191 scenarios, indicating uncertainty about basecase assumptions absorbing the impact of S. 2191. The figures in the models indicate expectations of economic growth under S. 2191, albeit at a slower rate. Projections show GDP per capita reductions from S. 2191, with EPA/IGEM cases producing higher estimates due to different assumptions in the model. The relationship between leisure and consumption in IGEM differs from other models. IGEM assumes a highly responsive relationship where people work less and buy less as prices increase, leading to a larger impact on GDP. Factors influencing IGEM's results include a higher emissions baseline, lack of carbon-emitting technological alternatives, a U.S.-only context affecting export estimates, and calibrated elasticities based on historical data. GDP per capita estimates were presented for all cases only in 2030. The GDP per capita estimates for all cases in 2030 show that the IGEM model predicts higher values compared to other cases. The majority of cases estimate a GDP effect of 1% or less, while the ACCF/NAM/NEMS cases predict a 2.6% to 2.7% effect. Despite their restrictive assumptions, the ACCF/NAM/NEMS cases fall within the common 0-4% range of GDP effects. Figure 8 and Figure 9 display the estimated allowance prices for each case, highlighting the influence of banking assumptions. The banking assumption in different cases significantly impacts projected prices. Some models do not include banking, leading to lower allowance prices over time. Other models assume discount rates that encourage banking, resulting in higher prices initially and lower prices later on. In 2030, cases with banking provisions project allowance prices ranging from $45-$61. The range of allowance prices varies between $45-$86 in different cases, with some projecting prices in the $45-$61 range and others in the $73-$86 range. The spread of estimates widens after 2030. CRS estimates auction revenue based on two cases: a \"high\" revenue case from the MIT/EPPA study and a \"low\" revenue case from the EPA/ADAGE-TECH case. The auction revenue is calculated by multiplying the allowance price by the number of allowances auctioned for deficit reduction and remainder allowances allocated for auction. The total auction revenue for a given year is determined by the number of allowances set by the bill and the allowance price. Higher allowance prices result in higher auction revenue. In the EPA/ADAGE-TECH case, auction revenues start in the tens of billions and exceed $100 billion before 2030 with lower prices. In the MIT/EPPA case, revenues surpass $100 billion before 2020. Currently, the federal government spends about $5 billion annually on climate change programs. After expenses, a significant amount of auction revenue would still be available for technology deployment. The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program would provide grants for automakers and parts manufacturers to develop capacity for advanced vehicles. Using lower allowance prices, the program could provide over $1 billion annually in 2012, increasing to more than $7 billion by 2040. This is compared to DOE's current spending of $200-400 million for advanced vehicle and hydrogen fuel R&D. The estimated costs of S. 2191 and the success of the program depend on agencies' and firms' capacity to absorb funding increases. CRS estimates firefighting fund requirements based on historic data, while administration costs are estimated at 1% of total allowance value by EPA. Technological advancements play a key role in cost-effective alternatives, with policy levers like prices, subsidies, and mandates also influencing technological change. The importance of technological advancements in cost-effective alternatives is highlighted, with policy levers such as prices, subsidies, and mandates influencing technological change. Induced technological change (ITC) is a critical part of S. 2191, with a need for more comprehensive treatments of technological change in models to avoid distortions in policy conclusions. The models used to project GHG reductions costs are deficient in treating technology change, which could lead to errors in policy conclusions. S. 2191 includes incentives for technology development that are not accounted for in current models. There is uncertainty about the availability and timing of technological alternatives in the electric power sector, such as nuclear, wind power, and carbon capture and storage. The lack of detailed technology descriptions in CGE models is a significant issue. The lack of detailed technology descriptions in CGE models hinders analysis of technology development under S. 2191. Currently available technologies emitting fewer greenhouse gases include wind, biomass, landfill gas, nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas for electric generation. Some sources like biomass and natural gas have repowering potential compared to coal-fired generation. Models do not provide insight on the likely technology mix under S. 2191. The CATF-NEMS and EIA/NEMS cases show different technology availability limits and resulting capacity built to meet electricity demand from 2010 to 2030. The ACCF/NAM/NEMS cases heavily constrain alternatives to natural gas generation, leading to a significant amount of natural gas capacity being built. Sensitivity analysis by EIA indicates a shift to natural gas if nuclear power, renewable power, and coal with CCS are constrained. In contrast, the EPA/IPM, CATF/NEMS, and two EPA/ADAGE cases show little to no new construction of natural gas, instead favoring a mix of renewable power, nuclear power, and coal-fired capacity with CCS. The models analyzed include power sources like wind, biomass, nuclear, and coal with CCS to meet future demand and replace coal without CCS. Natural gas plays a moderate role in some cases. The need for low-carbon electricity generation is highlighted, with a significant amount required to meet reduction targets under S. 2191. The capacity built depends on supply and demand assumptions, consumer response to incentives, and the need for capacity replacement/retirement. From 1963 to 1985, significant capacity additions were made in the United States, including nuclear, coal, hydropower, natural gas, and oil-fired capacity. Coal-fired units were converted to oil between 1965 and 1972 for environmental reasons, but after the 1973 oil embargo, some capacity was converted back to coal by 1983. In more recent years, from 2001 to 2005, about 180 GW of new capacity was added, mostly natural gas-fired. Conservation efforts are also expected to play a role in the future. Conservation and emerging technologies, particularly carbon capture and storage (CCS), are projected to reduce electricity demand by 10%-30% by 2030 under S. 2191. The long-term viability of coal-fired electric generation hinges on the development of CCS, with the CCS bonus allowance provision in S. 2191 receiving significant attention from models. Table 12 shows assumptions and limits on CCS deployment under S. 2191. Models with CCS subsidies predict earlier and increased technology availability. EPA/IPM and MIT/EPPA foresee commercialization by 2015, while EPA/ADAGE delays until 2020. EIA/NEMS states the subsidy makes the technology economical. Models agree on effectiveness but differ on sufficiency of CCS bonus allowance provisions. The effectiveness of allowance provisions for CCS subsidies is debated among different models. EIA/NEMS sees the subsidy improving CCS economics, while EPA/IPM believes coal with CCS will be economic by 2025 even without the subsidy. MIT/EPPA predicts over-subscription of bonus allowances, and NMA/CRA is the only model that sees CCS available before 2025. Future technologies focus on new facilities for nuclear power, biomass power, and coal-fired IGCC with CCS. The need to phase out coal without CCS technology highlights the potential value of retrofitable post-combustion technologies, such as an ammonia-based process for CO2 capture being developed by Powerspan. However, the capital intensity of these technologies raises concerns as it may crowd out investment in other areas of the economy. Powerspan is developing ECO2 for CO2 capture from coal-fired facilities, with two commercial demonstrations announced. Alstom is developing a chilled-ammonia-based capture process in collaboration with AEP and RWE AG. Other solvent-based post-combustion processes are in the pilot stage for future retrofittable technologies. The availability of emerging and future technology depends on research, development, and funding. S. 2191 includes provisions for technology development and deployment subsidies, particularly for CCS. However, only bonus allowance incentives for CCS are explicitly modeled in the cases, with some innovative efforts to illustrate potential funding. Deployment subsidies under S. 2191 would be fully utilized according to NMA/CRA. The NMA/CRA states that S. 2191 deployment subsidies would be fully utilized by projected technology investments. It is unclear if these subsidies affect deployment schedules or amounts. The bill provides significant funding for technology development, surpassing current efforts. Two proposed research strategies are outlined for meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets by 2030. The strategy outlined includes efficiency improvements, non-hydro renewables, new nuclear power, clean coal technologies, and carbon capture and storage projects funded over 18 years. Public funding needs are detailed, with Technology Deployment funds exceeding estimated amounts for the strategies. Organizations like EPRI and the Pew Center for Global Climate Change support these initiatives. EPRI and the Pew Center for Global Climate Change support a doubling of DOE's funding for advanced coal options. S. 2191 includes funding for various energy technologies, such as CCS, advanced coal, cellulosic biomass, and advanced vehicles. It also calls for new appliance and building efficiency standards. The CATF/NEMS case used proxies to model incentives for low and no carbon power technologies, resulting in low overall cost estimates and significant development of coal-fired CCS, nuclear power, and renewables. EIA/NEMS also employed innovative approaches to simulate energy efficiency incentives by reducing the cost of energy-efficient appliances and tightening residential building codes in the model. The proxies used in the model include tightening residential building codes by 30% in 2015 and 50% in 2025, contributing to low cost estimates. The transportation sector poses challenges for a cap-and-trade system due to the large number of vehicles, requiring upstream regulation of transportation fuels. Regulation of transportation fuels is challenging due to the large number of vehicles in the United States. Placing emissions monitors on each vehicle or requiring motorists to submit allowances would be impractical and costly. Therefore, any regulation would likely occur upstream of the emitting source. Emissions reductions in transportation can be achieved by reducing fuel consumption through efficient vehicles or mass transit, blending lower-carbon fuels, or switching to alternatives with lower emissions. Current federal policy addresses increasing fuel economy for new passenger cars and light trucks through the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and requires an increasing amount of renewable transportation fuel with lower greenhouse gas emissions through the renewable fuel standard (RFS). These programs aim to reduce the need for allowances by the petroleum industry by decreasing fuel consumption and carbon content. Cap-and-trade restrictions on petroleum may lead to higher prices for transportation users, prompting them to consider investing in new vehicles, using less fuel, or changing fuels. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) in Section 11003 of S. 2191 requires a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels by 2015 and a 10% reduction by 2020. Stakeholders debate whether aviation fuel and bunker fuel should be included in the standard, as more fuels included make the standard more stringent. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels by 5% by 2015 and 10% by 2020. Including aviation fuel in the program would require a significant increase in zero-carbon fuel production to meet the reduction targets, as many low-carbon fuels have lower energy content than petroleum fuels. For example, cellulosic ethanol with a 90% reduction in emissions would require roughly 40 billion gallons to meet the standard, exceeding the existing mandate for renewable fuels. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels by 5% by 2015 and 10% by 2020. The total volume of motor gasoline and diesel fuel is 13.47 million barrels per day, or 206 billion gallons annually. The LCFS program is separate from the cap-and-trade program, with no option to purchase credits or offsets from other sectors. If the necessary low-carbon fuel is unavailable, fuel providers must reduce sales or pay penalties. NMA/CRA analysis states that in 2015, the LCFS \"can only be met by\" roughly 35 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol. The NMA/CRA analysis of S. 2191 suggests that meeting the LCFS in 2015 may require a decrease in gasoline consumption to allow for limited low carbon biofuel supplies. This could lead to a 140% increase in motor fuel prices. Depending on the program design and fuels included, the impact on fuel supply and prices could be significant. However, if plug-in hybrid vehicles or cellulosic biofuels become available earlier than expected, costs could be lower. Excluding certain fuels like aviation fuel could also reduce costs. The estimates of fuel price impacts of S. 2191 vary widely due to divergent projections on future electric generating capacity. The cases selectively highlighted results, with confusing outcomes for natural gas prices. The impact of energy costs on households and industries will be discussed later. The CGE models and NEMS cases present different scenarios for natural gas prices under S. 2191. The impact on prices depends on the use of natural gas-fired generation to replace coal-fired capacity. Three categories are identified: little to no increased generation, modest increased generation, and substantial increased generation. Some cases project declining natural gas prices without including allowance costs. The EPA/ADAGE-TECH cases project declining natural gas prices without allowance costs, while the CATF/NEMS case predicts a modest 3% increase in 2030 with allowance costs. The MIT/EPPA case forecasts a significant decline in natural gas prices through 2050, while NMA/CRA projects an initial 20% increase by 2020, followed by a decline to 25% below baseline projections by 2050. Gas prices with allowance costs are projected to increase around 20% above basecase levels by 2025 and accelerate rapidly after 2040. Different scenarios show varying price increases for natural gas delivered to electric generators and residential consumers, with estimates ranging from 14% to 40% by 2030. The ACCF/NAM/NEMS cases project even higher increases, with prices potentially rising by 108% to 146% by 2030 for both residential and industrial consumers. Transportation sector modeling is limited in the cases examined. The cases examined do not model the transportation sector in detail. The most significant impact on petroleum prices under S. 2191 may come from the Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS). Some models project modest increases or declines in petroleum prices compared to basecase projections. The focus is on gasoline prices and price increases from the allowance requirement, with estimates reaching about $0.25 per gallon by 2030. The curr_chunk discusses various estimates for gasoline price increases by 2030, ranging from $0.22 to $3.25 per gallon. It also mentions projections for other transportation fuels and highlights the confusion in electricity price calculations due to different baselines and indices values used by different cases. The curr_chunk compares different estimates for electricity price increases by 2030 under different basecase assumptions. MIT/EPPA predicts a 39% increase, while EPA/ADAGE-REF forecasts an 11% decline. The incremental difference between the basecase and S. 2191 estimates varies significantly across the cases. The curr_chunk discusses various estimates for electricity price increases by 2030 under different scenarios, ranging from a 0.5% decline to a 129% increase. The availability and price of offsets play a crucial role in determining the costs of S. 2191. The impact of offsets and international credits on allowance prices is significant, with disagreements on availability and cost-effectiveness. The purchase of offsets can constrain allowance prices until the early 2020s, but there is uncertainty on the effectiveness of domestic and international offsets. The availability and cost-effectiveness of domestic and international offsets are crucial factors in the uncertain situation. EPA analysis shows that unlimited availability of credits could reduce 2050 allowance prices by 71%. However, current legislation like S. 2191 does not allow U.S. companies to obtain credits directly through mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism. Instead, participation would be indirect through substitutions of CDM-style credits from other controlled countries. The EU-ETS credits are assumed to be sold to U.S. companies under S. 2191, but the availability and prices of international credits are uncertain. The European Commission has not decided on the status of credits from the Clean Development Mechanism for the post-Kyoto period, leading to unresolved uncertainty. NMA/CRA argues that substantial international credits may not be available at reasonable prices due to the requirement of \"comparable stringency\" programs. EPA, EIA, and MIT suggest restrictions on international credits based on sensitivity analysis. Restrictions on international credits substantially increase the cost of S. 2191 according to sensitivity analysis by EPA, EIA, and MIT. EIA estimates a 39% increase in allowance prices in 2030 without international credits, while MIT and EPA project increases of 15% and 34% for 2050, respectively. Unlimited domestic offsets could reduce allowance prices by 26%, but the impact is less dramatic than for international credits. Participants in the acid rain program are likely to bank allowances in the face of price uncertainty, and the availability of offsets and international credits interacts with banking provisions for greenhouse gas reductions. The ACCF/NAM/NEMS cases do not include banking, leading to increasing allowance prices. Banking in other cases flattens allowance prices and allows for more control over reduction efforts. Entities in EPA/ADAGE and EPA/IGEM cases bank allowances until around 2030, enabled by offsets and international credits. The EIA/NEMS model ensures a 5 billion allowance bank by 2030, not projecting beyond that year. The Carbon Market Efficiency Board could increase domestic offsets and international credits availability, impacting costs significantly. Loosening limitations on offsets and credits could lead to substantial cost reductions, as seen in EPA cases. The Carbon Market Efficiency Board may not be able to coordinate a longer-term strategy due to its short-term powers. S. 2191 could redirect billions of dollars annually through the economy, with potential effects on international leakage of GHG emissions. The international leakage of GHG emissions is a concern when industries move from regulated to unregulated countries. EPA's analysis shows that if countries without commitments to reduce emissions maintain their levels, no leakage occurs. Imports of energy-intensive goods may decrease, while exports from developing countries may increase under emission limits. In a worst-case scenario, no international actions until 2050 could lead to significant leakage. EPA's sensitivity analysis considered a scenario with no international actions until 2050. Emissions from countries without commitments are projected to increase slightly, with minimal impact on leakage but significant impact on imports. Without Title VI, emissions and imports are expected to rise more compared to if Title VI is implemented. The EPA projects a 5.4% increase in emissions by 2030, rising to 7% by 2050. Under Title VI, imports are expected to increase by about 1% in 2030 and decline by 5% in 2050. U.S. exports decrease in both scenarios as countries rely more on domestic manufacturing. The differential effect of Title VI on trade and emissions leakage could pose challenges if brought before the WTO. The benefits of reducing greenhouse gases are not quantified in the analysis of S. 2191, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding cost and benefit estimates. More research and resources are needed to fully understand the benefits of reducing emissions. Monetizing benefits from reducing air pollutants has been attempted for decades. EPA conducted an illustrative analysis in the 1980s on the health benefits of controlling sulfur dioxide, estimating potential health benefits at up to $385 billion annually. Climate change complicates monetizing benefits from reducing greenhouse gases. Monetizing benefits from reducing greenhouse gases is challenging due to the global nature of the problem and the long-term accumulation of benefits over 100 years or more. The use of discount rates in valuing long-term damage from climate change varies from 0 to 4-5%. Estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon range widely, from zero to over $500 per ton of CO2. Monetizing environmental benefits is challenging, with estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon varying widely. Most studies focus on market impacts of climate changes, neglecting non-market impacts, extreme events, and catastrophes. Assigning monetary values to the global response to climate risks remains incomplete. Monetizing environmental benefits is challenging, with estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon varying widely. The global response to climate risks cannot be fully assigned monetary values, as important unpriced risks are often omitted. Efforts to monetize benefits present a moral dilemma, especially regarding intergenerational discounting. The significance of potential impacts in future generations is a contentious issue for some. The UK government's attempt to price climate change was criticized by the UK House of Commons Select Committee on Environmental Audit. They emphasized the importance of prioritizing policies based on their impact on UK carbon budgets rather than solely focusing on the monetary value of resulting carbon emissions. Valuing the social cost of carbon is influenced by assumptions about the world's emissions path and the relationship between greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, climate change, and economic impacts. The relationship between climate change and economic impacts, as well as the declining Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) as emissions result in less severe damages, are highlighted in The Stern Review. The UK Government has implemented a shadow price for carbon in official cost-benefit analyses, different from the SCC value, to address climate change implications. The UK shadow price of carbon is based on the Social Cost of Carbon of a 550 ppm stabilization goal as determined in The Stern Review, plus consideration of abatement costs and the value of UK leadership in encouraging global participation and developing new technology. The shadow price is about $43 a ton in 2012 (2005$), rising 2% annually in real terms. The net present value (NPV) of estimated reductions under S. 2191 would range from $4.2 trillion to $5.5 trillion in 2005 dollars. The net present value of the total cost of S. 2191 ranges from $4.2 trillion to $5.5 trillion in 2005 dollars. Estimates have been criticized for being too low or inflated, with the UK shadow price of carbon at $43 a ton in 2012. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration values carbon reductions at $7 a ton with a 7% discount rate. The illustration in the curr_chunk discusses the range of climate-related benefits from reducing greenhouse gases under S. 2191, estimated at between zero and $200-$260 billion annually. It highlights the challenges in monetizing climate-related benefits and emphasizes the importance of underlying assumptions in such estimates. The curr_chunk also mentions the difficulty in contextualizing one country's emissions reduction plan within a global effort to address climate change. MIT used the Integrated Global System Model to simulate climate effects of different policy scenarios related to cap and trade bills, including a reference scenario with no global climate policy and a global participation scenario. The study explored the uncertainty in translating emission trends into climate change estimates using three major atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The study by MIT simulated climate effects of different policy scenarios related to cap and trade bills, including scenarios with global participation, delayed abatement efforts in developing countries, and partial participation with no abatement efforts in developing countries. Developed countries are assumed to have reduced emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. Developing countries have varying emissions reduction timelines in the scenarios. The impact of different policy scenarios on global mean temperatures was simulated by MIT, showing that emissions reductions by developed countries, including the US, could reduce the projected increase in global temperatures. If the US does not reduce emissions, the temperature increase would be closer to the reference case line. In 2000, US emissions accounted for about 40% of the developed world's total emissions. In isolation, it is difficult to connect specific U.S. policy targets with global temperature reductions. MIT notes that any climate gains depend on efforts from the rest of the world. Therefore, setting U.S. policy targets should consider their value in leading other major countries to take similar actions. The environmental benefits of S. 2191 should be viewed in a global context, aiming to engage the developing world in emission reduction efforts. Developed countries, including the United States, agreed to reduce emissions to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations and lead in reduction efforts. The global context of S. 2191 raises issues regarding the credibility of its greenhouse gas reduction program for developing countries and whether its reductions meet U.S. commitments under the UNFCCC. The EPA/IPM study included estimates of emission reductions from non-greenhouse gas pollutants, reflecting short-term interactions with existing cap and trade programs. The Department of Transportation assigned emission damage costs for various pollutants in the notice of proposed rulemaking for the new average fuel economy standard. Reductions of pollutants such as mercury and carbon monoxide may also occur from S. 2191. The impact of price increases on households, industries, and businesses would depend on their responsiveness to the price signal and other provisions of the bill. The bill includes provisions to encourage conservation and new technology development. Sector-level baseline forecasts are less accurate than national forecasts, with significant errors in industrial and transportation sectors over the past two decades. The industrial sector was overestimated by 5.9% on average, while the transportation sector was underestimated by 4.5%. Forecasts within each sector have not shown improvement over the two decades studied. The impact of S. 2191 will vary by industry, with added energy costs affecting competitiveness due to price sensitivity and elastic demand for products. The competitiveness of firms is impacted by increased manufacturing costs, especially for energy-intensive industries like aluminum plants. The effects of S. 2191 on individual facilities within the same industry vary depending on their energy needs and power arrangements. This differential effect could affect the competitive balance and investment decisions within the industry. New technology emerging in industries could be influenced by current price signals from energy markets and potential ones from S. 2191, which aims to provide subsidies for industries facing international competitiveness issues. The impact of these subsidies on industrial technology development was not explored in the cases presented. The approach to exposed industries has parallels to recommendations for carbon-intensive industries in Europe facing reduction requirements and increased fuel costs from the EU's Kyoto Protocol. The UK Carbon Trust recommended establishing a compensating rate of free allocation for carbon-intensive activities like steel and cement production. Additionally, electricity-intensive activities in the EU-ETS should consider electricity consumption, and manufacturing of fertilizers and basic chemicals could benefit from inclusion in the EU-ETS. The inclusion of fertilizers and basic chemicals in the EU-ETS, along with aluminum smelting, could benefit trade-exposed electricity-intensive activities. Additional measures linked to redistribution of auction revenues or direct investment in low carbon electricity generation may offer long-term solutions. Models like ADAGE, IGEM, and EPPA struggle to separate price signals, conservation, and regulations for households, while NEMS breaks down residential energy consumption and prices by fuel. Estimates from such breakdowns are only illustrative at best. CATF/NEMS analysis shows that households can offset moderate price increases in electricity and natural gas by conserving energy and improving efficiency. Higher allowance prices make this more challenging. Keohane and Goldmark estimate a 6% increase in residential electric bills in 2030 with higher allowance prices, while natural gas bills could see a 14% increase. Aggressive demand response by consumers can almost eliminate the projected natural gas price increase. The MIT/EPPA analysis predicts a 14% increase in monthly natural gas bills in 2030. S. 2191 aims to mitigate energy price increases for low- and middle-income households by providing funds for electricity and natural gas impact assistance. EIA/NEMS estimates a 5% reduction in electricity rates with the allocated allowances, and a potential $3 to $6 increase in monthly household energy bills under S. 2191 by 2020. The estimated increase in monthly energy bills under S. 2191 would be about $3 in 2020, rising to about $6 in 2030. EIA/NEMS projects a 18% higher Consumer Price Index for energy in 2030 for residential consumers and a 29% increase for industrial consumers compared to basecase levels. Comparing the cost projections to the past 5 years, it would take 22 years in the S. 2191 Core Case to reach the same percentage change as current energy prices have increased from 2003 to 2008. Long-term cost projections for S. 2191 are speculative due to uncertainties like technological breakthroughs. Models can't predict the future but can show how the program's provisions respond to economic and technological changes. The ultimate cost of S. 2191 depends on the economy's reaction to technological challenges. The cost of S. 2191 is uncertain due to the economy's response to technological challenges. The bill offers incentives for technology innovation, but the potential cost reduction from new technology is not fully analyzed. The interplay between different energy sources in the bill reflects the need for low-carbon electric generating capacity in the long term. The cases analyzed in relation to S. 2191 show varying opinions on the amount of new low-carbon generation needed, the effectiveness of CCS bonus allowance allocation, and the potential value of offsets for covered entities. Offsets could be a valuable tool for covered entities to reduce costs and buy time to develop new technologies. The bill's provisions allow for banking, giving companies more time to plan and pursue technology development. Lowering costs could be achieved by increasing availability of offsets and international credits. Permitting international credits from mechanisms like the CDM would reduce uncertainties and costs. The Carbon Market Efficiency Board could also impact program costs. The Carbon Market Efficiency Board could have a significant impact on program costs by increasing the availability of offsets and international credits. It is designed to address short-term market volatility but its long-term strategy coordination abilities are unknown. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard could raise fuel prices and limit supply depending on the fuels included, emissions reductions achieved, and suppliers' ability to produce alternatives. S. 2191's climate-related environmental benefit is best considered in a global context to engage the developing world in reducing greenhouse gases. S. 2191 aims to reduce greenhouse gases to meet U.S. commitments under the UNFCCC and contribute to global stabilization efforts. The program's credibility with developing countries and its timely implementation are key factors for international agreements."
