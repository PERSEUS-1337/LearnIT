    "content": "Obesity is a widespread issue in the United States, with a significant percentage of adults being overweight or obese. The American Obesity Association estimates millions of adults fall into these categories. Obese individuals have faced discrimination, and some argue that their weight should be considered a disability under the ADA or Rehabilitation Act for legal protection against discrimination. Courts have reviewed cases of obesity discrimination under these laws. The ADA, enacted in 1990, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in various areas. To succeed in a discrimination case, the plaintiff must prove they have a disability as defined by the ADA, which includes physical or mental impairments that limit major life activities. The EEOC has regulations that clarify what constitutes a disability under the ADA. The EEOC has ADA regulations defining disability and major life activity limitations. Courts use these regulations for obesity discrimination cases under the Rehabilitation Act. The Act prohibits discrimination based on disability in programs receiving federal assistance. Courts apply similar standards for ADA and Rehabilitation Act cases. Employment discrimination standards are the same under both laws. The ADA regulations address obesity discrimination. The ADA regulations address whether obesity can be considered a disability, stating that temporary impairments with little long-term impact are usually not disabilities. Severe obesity, defined as body weight over 100% of the norm, is considered an impairment. Being overweight alone is generally not considered an impairment under the ADA. Based on ADA regulations and EEOC guidance, obese individuals may face challenges in bringing discrimination claims. Courts have varied in their rulings on whether obesity qualifies as a disability under the ADA, with disagreements on the requirement of a physiological disorder and the impact on major life activities. In Cook, a landmark case, an obese plaintiff was found to be disabled under Section 504 protection. The plaintiff, who weighed 320 pounds, was denied rehire due to concerns about her weight affecting her job performance. This case highlights the complexities of weight discrimination as a disability issue. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Cook, a morbidly obese plaintiff who was denied rehire based on perceived disability. The court recognized obesity as a physiological disorder and rejected the institution's argument that weight was a mutable and voluntary condition not covered under the Rehabilitation Act. The court found that Cook's weight substantially limited her major life activities, leading to her denial of rehire based on perceived disability. The institution believed her morbid obesity interfered with physical activities, such as walking, lifting, or bending, which could constitute discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. The court stated that denying a job solely based on the perception of physical limitations could be considered treating an applicant as if her condition substantially limited a major life activity. The First Circuit found that Cook's weight limited her major life activities, leading to her denial of rehire. The Second Circuit examined obesity discrimination claims under disability law in the case of Francis, a firefighter disciplined for not meeting weight guidelines. The court ruled that the discipline was not based on a perceived disability, as Francis did not show he suffered from an impairment under disability statutes. The court discussed the applicability of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to obesity. The Second Circuit ruled that obesity is not considered an impairment under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, except in cases where it relates to a physiological disorder. The court mentioned the possibility of a cause of action against an employer for discriminating based on the perception of morbid obesity but concluded that failing to meet weight guidelines alone is not enough for ADA protection. In a separate case in 2006, the Sixth Circuit addressed obesity discrimination in EEOC v. Watkins, where a morbidly obese employee was discharged after sustaining an injury on the job. The employee, weighing over 400 pounds, was terminated after a company doctor deemed him unable to safely perform his job duties despite meeting DOT standards for truck drivers. The EEOC argued that the employee was wrongly perceived as unable to work due to his weight, but the Sixth Circuit focused on the company's actions rather than their perception. The Sixth Circuit focused on whether morbid obesity qualified as an ADA impairment, requiring evidence of a physiological cause for an impairment to exist under the ADA. The court affirmed summary judgment for Watkins due to lack of evidence of a physiological condition in the employee. Courts will likely continue to examine obesity discrimination under the ADA, with outcomes remaining uncertain based on varying interpretations of the act and its regulations."
