    "content": "Treatment of charitable trusts for members of the armed forces and governmental organizations. Congress acknowledges the sacrifices made by members of the Armed Forces, CIA, and FBI in defending the nation against terrorism, often putting their lives at risk in the line of duty. United States military personnel, CIA, FBI, and other Federal agents risk their lives daily for the nation's freedom and security. CIA officer Johnny Micheal Spann was the first American to die in the War on Terrorism after 9/11. His family is proud of his heroic actions. Surviving dependents of military members killed in terrorist attacks or military operations abroad receive a $6,000 death benefit and a small monthly benefit. The current system of compensating spouses and children of American patriots is inequitable and needs improvement. Any charitable entity meeting requirements can be designated as a \"Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust\" with specific criteria to qualify. At least 85 percent of funds or donations must be used for the trust's purpose. Funds received by a Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust must be distributed to surviving family members of Armed Forces, intelligence community personnel, FBI employees, and government officers who die in the line of duty. The Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust distributes funds to surviving family members of individuals who die in the line of duty due to terrorist attacks, military operations, intelligence operations, law enforcement operations, or accidents related to efforts to combat international terrorism post-9/11. Up to 15% of funds can be used for administrative purposes, and earnings cannot benefit individuals solely based on their position as shareholders. No Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust can engage in political campaigns for or against any candidate for public office. Trusts must comply with directives from key government officials regarding the protection of sensitive national security information. Each Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust receiving over $1,000,000 in annual contributions must undergo an annual audit by an independent accounting firm. The audit reports must be submitted to the IRS and made available for public inspection while safeguarding sensitive national security information. Trusts are required to distribute funds to beneficiaries at least once a year within 12 months of formation. The Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust must distribute all funds and donations within 36 months of receiving them. When determining distributions to beneficiaries, the Trust should consider any collateral source compensation they have received. Collateral source compensation includes payments from life insurance, pension funds, and other sources. The Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust must refrain from certain activities under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to allow for general solicitation of funds. The Secretary of Defense and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation must notify trust beneficiaries in a manner that protects sensitive information. The Secretary of Defense, FBI Director, or CIA Director may share information from a decedent's estate representative with the Johnny Micheal Spann Patriot Trust to assist in contacting eligible individuals for distributions. No legal action can be taken against federal entities for forwarding or not forwarding information. Regulations must be established within 90 days of the Act's enactment by the Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, FBI Director, and CIA Director. The Director of Central Intelligence will establish regulations for investigations."
