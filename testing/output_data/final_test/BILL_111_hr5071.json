The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act aims to address inequitable distribution of funds in local educational agencies, reinforce the purpose of title I funds, strengthen comparability requirements, include teacher salaries in expenditure calculations, and enhance transparency and accountability. The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act aims to ensure transparency and accountability in providing resources for students to achieve high levels. SEC. 3. COMPARABILITY OF EXPENDITURES. Section 1120A(c) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to ensure that local educational agencies must have comparable funding per pupil across all schools served under this part. Local educational agencies must ensure that the average expenditure per pupil of State and local funds in higher poverty schools is at least 97 percent of the average expenditure per pupil across all lower poverty schools to be eligible for funds under this part. To meet this requirement, agencies must provide an up-to-date school-by-school listing of per-pupil expenditures and demonstrate comparability across schools. The local educational agency must demonstrate comparability across schools by comparing schools within no more than three grade spans to meet the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1). The Secretary will issue regulations concerning agencies' responsibilities for meeting these requirements within 4 months of the ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act enactment. States must issue regulations within 6 months. Each State educational agency must create regulations on local educational agencies' responsibilities for meeting requirements within 6 months of federal regulations issuance. Local educational agencies must develop and submit a plan to the State agency within 14 months, ensuring comparability with annual benchmarks. The plan for comparability must be completed within 3 years of regulations issuance and made public. The Inspector General will audit 5 States and 10 local educational agencies in the fourth and fifth years to assess compliance. This subsection does not apply to local educational agencies with only one building per grade span. Compliance with requirements will be determined for local educational agencies. Compliance with paragraph (1) requires local educational agencies to exclude state and local funds for excess costs of English language instruction for Limited English Proficient students and services for children with disabilities. They may also exclude supplemental state or local funds for programs meeting the intent of this part. Forced transfers of school personnel are not required to comply. Comparability as minimum standard ensures that state or local funds can exceed 100% of average per-pupil expenditure for schools under this part. Public reporting includes school report cards for transparency. Beginning with the enactment of the ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act, local educational agencies must include average per-pupil expenditures of State and local funds on school report cards. This includes data for schools not served under this part or lower poverty schools within the agency. The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act requires local educational agencies to provide up-to-date school-by-school listings of per-pupil expenditures of State and local funds. Definitions for \"expenditures\" are also included in this subsection. The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act mandates local educational agencies to disclose per-pupil expenditures of State and local funds by school. The term 'expenditures' includes salary expenses for classroom teachers, instructional staff, and other support personnel, encompassing base salaries, incentives, bonuses, and stipends for additional roles. The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act requires schools to disclose per-pupil expenditures, including salary expenses for teachers and staff, incentives, bonuses, stipends for additional roles, noninstructional staff salaries, student support staff, and nonpersonnel expenditures like professional development, instructional materials, computers, and technology. The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act mandates schools to report per-pupil expenses, including teacher salaries, bonuses, noninstructional staff pay, student support staff, and nonpersonnel costs like professional development, instructional materials, and technology services. Salary differentials for years of employment must be included in determining salary expenditures. The ESEA Fiscal Fairness Act defines \"higher poverty school\" as a school in the top four quartiles of low-income student percentage and \"lower poverty school\" as a school in the lowest quartile."
