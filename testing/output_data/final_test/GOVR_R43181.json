    "content": "The ACA includes provisions to promote employer-sponsored health coverage for small businesses, such as employer penalties, tax credits, and health insurance exchanges. The employer penalty aims to encourage offering health insurance, but concerns exist about its costs for small businesses. The ACA's employer penalty may impact small businesses' hiring decisions and administrative costs. Recent events have affected the ACA's implementation, such as the Supreme Court ruling on Medicaid expansion in 2012. The Department of Health and Human Services delayed enforcement of the ACA's requirement for SHOP exchanges to offer more than one plan until 2015. The Obama Administration also postponed the employer penalty implementation for applicable firms until 2015 to simplify administrative complexities and give businesses more time to comply. The ACA's employer penalty and small business health exchanges were originally set to start in 2014, but the Treasury Department issued a final regulation to delay the penalty for certain firms. The final regulation delayed the employer penalty for small businesses with fewer than 100 employees from 2015 to 2016. The report analyzes key ACA provisions relevant to small businesses, such as employer-sponsored health insurance, small business health care tax credits, and SHOP exchanges, discussing potential economic effects. The report analyzes key ACA provisions relevant to small businesses, such as employer-sponsored health insurance, small business health care tax credits, and SHOP exchanges, discussing potential economic effects and market failures that may justify government intervention. The health insurance market may lead to undesirable levels of insurance due to externalities like decreased risk of contagious diseases and use of publicly funded resources by uninsured individuals. This market failure is called. Adverse selection in the health insurance market occurs when individuals who desire more healthcare coverage tend to be the least healthy, leading to rising costs and fewer people being able to afford insurance. This market failure results in many individuals not having health insurance, as costs exceed benefits for some. Individuals with conditions like old age may not afford health insurance, limiting their access to healthcare. Lack of coverage can have negative effects on society. Health insurance can be seen as social insurance, spreading the risk of illness across more individuals. Risk-pooling mechanisms help reduce negative externalities. Risk-pooling mechanisms like Medicare and employer-sponsored health insurance have reduced adverse selection and excessive premium costs in the private health care market. Employer-sponsored insurance addresses both adverse selection and pricing issues for those with ill health, while also reducing administrative costs. However, these advantages are lessened for businesses with few employees. According to economic theory, the cost of employer-sponsored health benefits should offset wages to ensure that employees as a group still bear the cost of insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance helps reduce adverse selection and pricing issues for those with health problems. Small businesses may face higher administrative costs and difficulties insuring a group with serious health issues. Large firms are more likely to offer health care plans. Community pooling and cost-sharing are crucial to address affordability and adverse selection issues, especially for individuals with preexisting conditions. The ACA provisions aim to ensure individuals with health problems do not face higher insurance prices and require most individuals to have health insurance. Employer-sponsored insurance can encourage more low-risk workers to purchase insurance, reducing overall risk pools. The ACA defines small businesses differently and sets out calculations to determine which employers are affected by each provision. The ACA sets criteria for employer penalties based on affordability and adequacy of health insurance. Large employers with 50 or more FTE employees may face penalties if insurance standards are not met. Small businesses with fewer than 50 FTE employees are exempt. Total FTE employees are calculated by adding full-time workers and part-time employees. Seasonal workers are typically not included in determining employer size. The penalty under the ACA applies to large employers with at least one full-time worker receiving a health insurance premium credit in the individual insurance exchange markets. The penalty amount depends on whether the employer offers insurance coverage that meets the ACA's standards for affordability and adequacy. The penalty under the ACA applies to large employers with at least one full-time worker receiving a health insurance premium credit in the individual insurance exchange markets. The required contribution to the plan should not exceed 9.5% of the employee's household income for the taxable year. A health plan is considered adequate if it has a 60% or greater actuarial value. If a large employer offers unaffordable and inadequate coverage, the penalty is calculated based on the number of employees receiving credits. The penalty under the ACA applies to large employers with at least one full-time worker receiving a health insurance premium credit in the individual insurance exchange markets. The penalty amount is calculated based on the number of employees and is indexed by a premium adjustment percentage for each subsequent calendar year. For a firm with 50 employees, the average monthly penalty per employee would be $800, increasing as the employee size rises. Small businesses with fewer than 25 FTE employees and average wages less than $50,000 may be eligible for a tax credit of up to 50% of the employer's payment for two consecutive years, starting in 2014. The employer must pay at least 50% of the health plan premium to qualify for the credit. Tax-exempt entities can receive a 35% credit (25% during the transition) against payroll taxes. The credit is phased out based on both size and average income. The tax credit for small businesses is phased out based on both size and average income. The credit is reduced by the number of FTE employees over 10 and average wage over $25,000. Changes in firm size or payroll can affect the maximum tax credit in three ways. Since 2014, small employers can use the ACA's SHOP exchange for health insurance coverage. The SHOP exchange helps small employers and their employees purchase health plans in the small-group market. Only qualified small employers and employees can get coverage through a SHOP exchange plan. Enrollment started in October 2013 for the 2014 calendar year. States had the option to define small employers as those with 100 or fewer employees before 2016. Starting in 2016, small employers are those with 100 or fewer employees. The tax credit for small businesses is phased out based on size and average income, reducing the credit by the number of FTE employees over 10 and average wage over $25,000. Changes in firm size or payroll can affect the maximum tax credit in three ways. Small employers can use the ACA's SHOP exchange for health insurance coverage since 2014. The SHOP exchange allows employers to offer a variety of coverage options to employees. A SHOP was not required to offer more than one plan until 2015. The effects of ACA provisions on small businesses are analyzed, including compliance, hiring, and profits. Penalties aim to induce larger firms subject to penalties to comply. The penalty for firms not providing health insurance should be passed through to lower wages, limiting the burden on small business owners. Individuals with lower incomes can receive insurance premium credits in community-rated pools, increasing their welfare. Some firms may find it more feasible to pay a penalty than provide insurance that meets ACA standards, especially for lower-income employees. The ACA imposes penalties on employers for not providing health insurance, which could create disincentives for adding workers. Phasing in the penalty as employee size rises would help mitigate the impact on small businesses. There is a misunderstanding among small employers about how they could be affected by the employer penalty. Approximately 56% of respondents misunderstood aspects of the ACA's employer penalty, with 32% thinking they must offer group health insurance in 2014 regardless of employee count, and 24% believing they will face a penalty for not providing group coverage. Data from the Census Bureau's 2011 Statistics of U.S. Business can help estimate the number of firms exempt from the penalty due to insufficient employees. However, using this data to analyze ACA penalties has limitations, as full-time and part-time employees are treated equally in the dataset, unlike in FTE calculations. This affects estimates of firms affected by the ACA penalties. The ACA employer penalties may be overstated as most firms with fewer than 50 employees are exempt. In 2011, 96.2% of employer firms had fewer than 50 employees and are not likely to be affected by the penalty. These exempt businesses employed 27.6% of all workers, while the 3.8% of businesses with 50 or more employees employed 72.4% of all workers and could potentially be subject to the penalty. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation's 2014 Annual Employer Survey, firms with fewer than 50 employees were less likely to offer health insurance coverage compared to larger firms. In 2013, 83% of firms with fewer than 50 workers offered health benefits, while 91% of firms with 50-199 workers and 98% of firms with 200 or more workers provided health benefits. Less than 0.2% of all employer firms could potentially be subject to the full employer penalty, with the majority of these firms having between 50 and 199 employees. The majority of firms have between 50 and 199 employees, accounting for 72.4% of all employees. Only 2.4% of employees work in larger firms without health insurance. The ACA may impact small business health care coverage rates, with the employer penalty affecting labor demand in the short run. In the long run, workers may reduce their labor supply due to lower wages. The CBO projects penalties of about $8 billion for 2016, which would result in a negligible change in the labor force due to the small percentage change in wages. The report discusses the effects of the penalty on part-time work but finds little evidence of an impact on total labor. One study suggests that the employer penalty may benefit wages and increase labor supply by providing cheaper insurance for small businesses. The credit aims to encourage coverage for very small firms. The IRS reported that only 228,000 taxpayers claimed the health care credit out of 4.4 million potentially eligible, totaling $278 million in 2010. A 2012 GAO report found that 170,300 small businesses claimed $468 million in credits, with an average of $2,748 claimed per business. The amount of small businesses applying for the health care credit was limited by three factors: the credit was seen as too small of an incentive, employees couldn't afford their share of the premium, and claiming the credit was too complex. The ACA's health exchanges aim to address these issues for small businesses. The Family Foundation annual employer survey found that 32% of small firms not offering health benefits cited high costs as the main reason. ACA programs, including SHOP exchanges, may help lower health insurance premiums for smaller firms. This could make it easier for very small firms with costly healthcare needs to purchase insurance through SHOP exchanges. Additionally, small businesses with higher risk profiles may find lower-cost health coverage options through SHOP exchanges compared to the private small-group market. The costs of plans in SHOP exchanges are lower as risks are spread across firms, reducing adverse selection. Healthier firms may see cost increases. SHOP exchanges also lower premiums by pooling businesses. Critics worry about employer penalties leading to undesirable actions like avoiding hiring or reducing hours. Despite concerns, some argue against revisions due to the small share of affected firms. The argument against making revisions to employer penalties is based on the small share of firms that would be affected, estimated to be less than 1%. The penalty is projected to raise $139 billion over 10 years, and liberalizing exemptions would increase federal budgetary costs. If firms forego offering health insurance, government outlays for premium credits would likely increase. Some critics argue for revisions to the employer penalty due to concerns about hiring disincentives, labor market distortions, and compliance costs. Opposition to the penalty is centered on these issues, with calls for its repeal to have little impact on health insurance coverage. Legislation proposed in the 113th Congress includes options to eliminate the penalty without replacement. In the 113th Congress, some bills aimed to eliminate the employer penalty without a replacement provision, which encourages firms to offer health insurance. The Save American Workers Act of 2015 in the 114th Congress proposed changing the ACA's definition of \"full-time\" from 30 to 40 hours per week to reduce compliance costs for employers. The 30-hour definition of full-time under the ACA increases compliance costs for employers and may lead to reduced hours for workers. Data shows that most workers typically work 40 hours or more per week, exceeding the ACA's definition. Some proposals aim to change the definition to 40 hours to alleviate compliance costs. Several employer surveys indicate that most respondents are not reducing employees' hours in response to the ACA's definition of a full-time worker. A 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefits Plans found that 16% of employers adjusted or plan to adjust hours. A 2012 Mercer survey showed 68% will offer health coverage to employees working 30 or more hours per week. Other surveys and empirical analysis support these findings. The U.C. Berkeley Labor Center's 2013 study estimated that 2.3 million workers in firms with 100+ employees were at risk of having their hours reduced below 30 hours per week, mainly in the restaurant industry. In contrast, a study by Jorgensen and Baker found that less than 1% of workers fell below the ACA's full-time threshold in 2013. Jorgensen and Baker's study, using more recent data, is considered more reliable for forecasting future conditions. Changing the full-time worker definition from 30 to 40 hours per week may not eliminate the incentive for employers to shift workers to part-time status. It could even increase the incentive for firms to not offer health insurance. This shift could lead to more workers being shifted to part-time status under the ACA, potentially causing disruption to the workforce. Changing the full-time worker definition from 30 to 40 hours per week may not eliminate the incentive for employers to shift workers to part-time status. This could lead to more workers being shifted to part-time status under the ACA, potentially causing disruption to the workforce. H.R. 30 is estimated to cost $53.2 billion over 10 years, with a reduction in the number of people receiving employer-sponsored health insurance and an increase in those seeking coverage through government-subsidized programs. The potential effects of the employer penalty under the ACA could lead to an increase in the number of uninsured individuals by less than 500,000. Concerns exist that smaller firms in certain industries may be disproportionately impacted, especially those employing low-income workers who may prefer wages over benefits. Lower-income workers, facing reduced take-home pay for health insurance, may opt for government subsidies and individual exchanges for coverage. The employer penalty under the ACA may lead to more uninsured individuals, particularly affecting smaller firms in industries with low-income workers. Concerns have been raised by industry groups about the impact on businesses, especially in the restaurant industry. The age of workers in these industries could influence the likelihood of employers paying the penalty. Many workers in these industries may not be eligible for dependent coverage extension, but some younger workers in food service or retail could be covered as dependents in a family. The ACA employer penalty may result in more uninsured individuals, particularly affecting smaller firms in industries with low-income workers. Concerns have been raised by industry groups, such as the restaurant industry, about the impact on businesses. Younger workers in industries like food service or retail could be covered as dependents in a family plan or through Medicaid expansion in some states. Recent analysis has revised cost estimates for compliance with the employer penalty downward. The ACA offers states the option to expand Medicaid to households with incomes up to 133% of the Federal Poverty Line to increase insurance coverage among lower-income workers. Some states may not expand Medicaid under the ACA, leading to workers with household incomes between 100% and 133% of the Federal Poverty Line being eligible for premium credits in the exchange. Employers in states not expanding Medicaid have options to minimize compliance costs, such as reducing labor costs by limiting new hires or shifting to capital-intensive production methods. Some businesses may reduce labor costs by limiting new hires, shifting to capital-intensive production methods, reducing worker hours, and wages to minimize ACA penalties. Employers may also offer low-cost health plans that do not meet ACA standards to lessen penalties, but passing costs to low-income workers is limited by minimum wage laws and the need to attract skilled workers. The ACA limits businesses from requiring workers to pay a large share of health benefits, with affordability criteria capping premiums at 9.5% of household income. To address concerns about insurance coverage for low-income workers, employer penalties could be modified with options like a payroll size exemption or higher exemptions for certain industries. A dollar-level exemption could be established based on total firm payroll to target smaller firms, especially in industries like food service with low-income employees. For example, a $2 million payroll cap could exempt certain firms with lower average wages from ACA employer penalties. Table 5 shows data on firms in specific industries with average payrolls under $2 million but large enough to potentially face penalties. This exemption aims to help firms with low-wage workers who may struggle to afford health benefits. A dollar-level exemption for firms with total payrolls less than $2 million could apply to firms with lower average wages, potentially exempting them from ACA employer penalties. This policy variation may be challenging to implement in practice, as some workers in these industries may not seek premium credits in insurance exchanges. More information is needed to analyze the ACA's employer penalty effectively. The option of setting limits by industry for ACA's employer penalty could be more administratively complicated for firms falling into multiple industry categories. For example, determining if businesses like doughnut shops or microbreweries with attached restaurants should be included in beneficial treatment. Similar challenges have been seen with the production activities business tax deduction, which only applies to certain industries. An expanded exemption could be based on industry classifications. An expanded exemption for the ACA employer penalty could be based on industry classifications, such as the North American Industry Classification System. Currently, the penalty is triggered by hiring the 50th full-time equivalent worker, with the first 30 workers exempt. Increasing this exemption could reduce the cliff firms face at the hiring of their 50th worker, but it may also reduce the incentive for employers to offer health care benefits. If fewer firms offer employer-sponsored health plans, more workers may rely on government subsidies for coverage in individual insurance exchanges, potentially reducing revenue from the employer penalty. Changing the penalty calculation to include uninsured part-time workers could offset revenue losses and discourage firms from hiring part-time workers to avoid the penalty. This rule could also be applied based on payroll size to eliminate potential loopholes. The employer penalty exemption could be revised based on FTE employees to reduce incentives for firms to hire part-time workers. This could be combined with increasing the exemption to offset revenue loss. Expanding the small business health care tax credit could encourage more small businesses to offer health care coverage. President Obama's FY2014 budget proposed expanding and simplifying the small business tax credit by increasing the eligibility cutoff to 50 workers, changing the phaseout formula, and simplifying the calculation. The Department of the Treasury estimated a revenue reduction of $10.5 billion between FY2014 and FY2023. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to change the credit structure. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the small business tax credit by increasing the maximum number of FTE employees to 50, raising the maximum wages cap to $37,500, and adjusting the phaseout formula. These bills aimed to expand eligibility for the credit and simplify the calculation process. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to amend the small business tax credit by increasing the maximum number of FTE employees to 50 and raising the maximum wages cap to $37,500, among other provisions. None of these bills were reported out of committee."
