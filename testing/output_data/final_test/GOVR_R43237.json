    "content": "Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) are higher education institutions that cater to minority students who have historically been underrepresented. These institutions face challenges in obtaining financial support, impacting their academic offerings and ability to serve students. Federal higher education policy recognizes the importance of MSIs in improving access for underrepresented minorities and provides funding through various federal agencies and grant programs authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act of 1965 supports Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) with approximately $817 million in FY2016. MSIs include various underrepresented groups such as TCCUs, ANNHs, PBIs, NASNTIs, ANNAPISIs, HBCUs, and HSIs. The report outlines programs that financially assist MSIs under the HEA. The report focuses on HEA programs specifically for Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), detailing funding, program descriptions, eligibility criteria, authorized uses of financial awards, and administrative procedures. Appendices list acronyms and appropriations for selected MSIs. In recent years, mandatory appropriations have been provided to many MSI programs authorized under the HEA, in addition to discretionary appropriations. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act established new MSI programs and provided mandatory appropriations for both newly authorized and preexisting programs. In FY2009, mandatory appropriations were provided for various programs aimed at strengthening minority-serving institutions, including TCCUs, ANNHs, PBIs, NASNTIs, ANNAPISIs, HBCUs, and HSI STEM. The Higher Education Opportunity Act redesignated and authorized additional funding for programs at HBCUs and PBIs, as well as for Hispanic American programs. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act extended mandatory appropriations for certain programs through FY2019. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) provides grants to institutions of higher education serving low-income students. Since 1965, Congress has authorized grant programs to support postsecondary institutions facing financial challenges. Original HEA Title III-A program was not specifically for MSIs, leading to the 1986 reauthorization to address the specific needs of historically Black colleges and universities. Mandatory appropriations for Title III-A, III-B, and HSI STEM programs are detailed in Appendix B from FY2013 to FY2017. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) provides grants to institutions serving low-income students, including historically Black colleges and universities. Congress amended the program to include institutions with high minority and low-income student concentrations. Separate Title III-A programs target institutions serving specific types of minority students. SIP grants are available to institutions serving low-income students, while separate grants target institutions serving specific minority groups. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) aims to enhance academic quality, institutional management, and self-sufficiency of institutions with needy students. It offers competitive grants to eligible higher education institutions, funded through discretionary appropriations. SIP is the largest program under Title III-A, with detailed eligibility criteria and authorized uses of grant funds. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) aims to enhance academic quality and institutional management for eligible higher education institutions with needy students. Eligibility criteria include low educational and general expenditures, requisite enrollment of needy students, legal authorization to award bachelor's degrees, accreditation by a recognized agency, and location within specified areas. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) aims to improve academic quality and institutional management for eligible higher education institutions with needy students. Eligibility criteria include low educational and general expenditures and requisite enrollment of needy students receiving need-based assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) provides grants to eligible higher education institutions with needy students to improve academic quality and institutional management. Branch campuses can qualify if the institution as a whole meets eligibility requirements, even if the branch campus does not meet state authorization or accreditation requirements. SIP grants aim to enhance self-sufficiency and capacity to contribute to higher education resources. Authorized activities for grants include purchasing scientific equipment. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) provides grants to eligible higher education institutions for various activities such as purchasing scientific equipment, improving instructional facilities, supporting faculty development, enhancing academic programs, and providing student services programs. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) grants can be used for activities like improving facilities, establishing development offices, enhancing distance education technologies, and creating endowment funds. Institutions can use up to 20% of the grant for endowment funds, with a requirement for matching funds from nonfederal sources. Special consideration is given to institutions proposing faculty development and administrative management. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) grants support activities such as faculty development, administrative management, academic program improvement, equipment acquisition, joint facility use, and student services. Institutions must go through a two-step application process to be eligible for SIP grants, which are awarded competitively. Grant recipients must ensure funds supplement, not supplant, existing resources and provide annual reports to the Department of Education. The Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) grants require institutions to make annual progress reports to the Department of Education, maintain fiscal control, and follow fund accounting procedures. Applications are scored by a review panel, with the highest-scoring ones receiving funding. There are two types of grants: development grants for implementing growth strategies over five years, and one-year planning grants for preparing SIP grant applications. Recipients of development grants must wait two years before applying for another SIP grant. In awarding SIP grants, priority is given to applicants not receiving grants from other Title III-A programs. SIP grantees cannot receive funds from other Title III-A programs, Title III-B, or Title V-A in the same fiscal year. However, they can receive grants from one type of Title III-F program in the same fiscal year. Section 316 establishes the TCCUs program for American Indian Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities. The Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) program, authorized under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, provides grants to TCCUs to improve capacity in serving American Indian students. Grants are funded through discretionary appropriations under Title III-A and mandatory appropriations under Title III-F. To qualify for a grant, institutions must meet HEA Section 312(b) requirements. To qualify for a grant under the Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) program, an institution of higher education must meet specific requirements outlined in various acts, such as the TCCUAA or the Navajo Community College Act. These institutions must be formally controlled or sanctioned by an Indian tribe, have a majority of Indian students, and operate to meet the needs of Indians. Indian students are defined as members of an Indian tribe or their biological children. Strengthening TCCU grants are specifically designated for activities that enhance an institution's ability to serve Indian students. Grant funds can be used for acquiring real property, establishing programs to train teachers for Indian youth, and promoting academic skills in Indian students. Grant recipients can also allocate funds for endowments, with a limit of 20%. The Strengthening TCCU program, post the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, changed from a competitive to a formula-based grant program. The Secretary can reserve up to 30% of funds for competitive grants for construction needs, with a minimum of $1 million each. Remaining funds are distributed among eligible TCCUs based on Indian student counts, with a minimum grant amount of $500,000. The Strengthening TCCU program awards shares to eligible TCCUs with a minimum grant amount of $500,000. The application process involves two steps, with institutions submitting project plans that align with program purposes and regulations. Approved institutions receive formula-funded grants with a five-year performance period and are not subject to a two-year wait-out period. TCCUs receiving grants under Title III-A, Section 316 are not eligible for funds from other Title III-A programs. The Title III-A, Section 316 program prohibits institutions from receiving funds from other Title III-A programs, Title III-B programs, or Title V-A during the same fiscal year. However, they may receive grants under Title III-F programs. The Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions program provides grants to improve services for Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiians. The Strengthening ANNH grants are funded through discretionary appropriations under Title III-A and additional mandatory appropriations under Title III-F. To qualify for a grant, an institution of higher education must meet HEA Section 312(b) requirements and have a certain percentage of Alaska Native or Native Hawaiian students. The Strengthening ANNH grants are available to institutions of higher education that serve Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiians. These grants aim to improve the capacity of institutions to support these populations. The use of grant funds for endowment investment is not specifically prohibited, and up to 20% of grant awards can be used for this purpose. The Strengthening ANNH program allows up to 20% of grants awards for endowment investment. Institutions apply for Section 312(b) designation first, then for a Strengthening ANNH grant through a competitive process. Grants are awarded based on review panel scores, with the highest scoring applications funded. Grants are generally five years for development and two years for facility renovation. Recipients are exempt from the two-year wait-out period and cannot receive funds from other Title III-A, III-B, or V-A programs. The Strengthening Native American-Serving, Nontribal Institutions (NASNTIs) program, established in 2007, provides SIP-type grants to NASNTIs to improve their ability to serve Native American and low-income students. Grants are funded through discretionary appropriations under Title III-A since 2010. Institutions receiving a Title III-F ANNH grant may also receive grants under other Title III-F programs in the same fiscal year. The Strengthening NASNTIs program, funded through discretionary appropriations under Title III-A, provides grants to institutions of higher education to assist Native American students. Eligibility criteria include meeting HEA Section 312(b) requirements and having at least 10% Native American student enrollment. Grants cannot be used by Tribal Colleges and must support NASNTIs in planning and improving services. Title III-A and III-F NASNTI grants are used to assist NASNTIs in improving their capacity to serve Native American and low-income individuals. Grant monies cannot be used to start or improve an endowment. Institutions must go through a two-step award process to receive grants under these programs, with applications selected through a competitive process. Title III-A and III-F NASNTI grants are awarded through a competitive process based on review panel scores. Grants are five years in length, with a minimum award of $200,000 for Title III-A grants. Recipients are not subject to a two-year wait-out period and have restrictions on receiving funds from other Title III programs in the same fiscal year. The Strengthening AANAPISI program, established in 2007, provides grants to Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-serving institutions to improve services for these communities. Grants have been funded through discretionary appropriations since FY2009 under Title III-A and additional mandatory appropriations under Title III-F until FY2019. Eligibility is based on competitive review panel scores, with grants lasting five years and a minimum award of $200,000 for Title III-A grants. Recipients can receive grants under different Title III-F programs in the same fiscal year. The Strengthening AANAPISI program provides grants to institutions serving Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander students. Grants are funded through appropriations under Title III-A and III-F until FY2019. Eligibility requires institutions to meet HEA Section 312(b) requirements and have at least 10% Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander undergraduate enrollment. The Strengthening AANAPISI grants aim to improve institutions' capacity to serve Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander (AANAPI) students and low-income individuals. Grant funds can be used for academic instruction, research, data collection, and establishing partnerships with community-based organizations. Title III-F grants to AANAPISIs can be used for authorized activities, with a two-step award process for institutions to receive grants. Grants are awarded competitively based on review panel scores, with the highest scoring applications selected for funding. Strengthening AANAPISI grants are typically five years long and exempt institutions from the Section 313(d) wait-out period. Institutions receiving Title III-A grants cannot receive funds from other Title III-A programs in the same fiscal year but can receive grants from Title III-F programs. Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) were established between 1867 and 1900 to serve a specific purpose. Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) were established between 1867 and 1900 to serve the educational needs of Black Americans. HBCUs became a primary means of providing postsecondary education to Black Americans who were denied admission to traditionally white institutions. As of 2015, there were 97 HBCUs located in 19 states, funded under Title III-B of the HEA. The Title III-B HBCU program was created to address financial struggles of HBCUs due to discriminatory actions. It authorizes programs for undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs at eligible HBCUs. The Strengthening HBCUs program provides formula-based grants for activities to enhance academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities. The Historically Black Graduate Institutions program offers funds for specific graduate and professional programs at HBCUs. The Title III-B HBCU program addresses financial struggles of HBCUs due to discrimination, authorizing programs for undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. The Strengthening HBCUs program provides grants for activities to enhance academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities. Title III-F authorizes additional appropriations for eligible institutions. Title VII, Part A, Subpart 4 of the HEA authorizes Masters Degree Programs at HBCUs. The HBCU Cap Fin program assists in obtaining low-cost capital financing for campus projects. The Strengthening HBCUs program provides institutional grants to HBCUs to enhance their academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities. Unlike competitive Title III-A programs, the Title III-B program is formula-funded and does not have strict eligibility requirements. Typically funded through discretionary appropriations, the program aims to support HBCUs in various activities. The Strengthening HBCUs program, funded through discretionary appropriations under Title III-B and additional mandatory appropriations in Title III-F through FY2019, provides grants to eligible HBCUs known as Part B institutions. These institutions, established before 1964 with a primary mission of educating Black Americans, are accredited by an ED-recognized agency. The program aims to enhance academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities of HBCUs. Eligible Part B institutions must be accredited by an ED-recognized agency and authorized by the state to operate as a junior or community college or award bachelor's degrees. Institutions established after 1964 may also qualify if they meet specific criteria. Part B institutions authorized under Section 323 can use grants for various purposes such as purchasing equipment, renovating facilities, teacher education programs, community outreach, and acquiring real property for campus facilities. Part B institutions can use grants for campus facilities renovation, additions, or improvements, and up to 20% can be used for endowments. Strengthening HBCU grants are formula-based, with each eligible institution receiving a grant based on Pell Grant recipients and graduates. The formula for awarding grants to Part B institutions is based on the number of graduates admitted to graduate or professional school within five years of receiving a bachelor's degree. Grants range from $250,000 to $500,000, with adjustments made if funding is insufficient. The award process for Strengthening HBCU grants involves institutions being designated as Part B institutions by ED, submitting data for formula allotments, and then submitting a project plan to ED. If an institution's allotment is not needed, funds may be redistributed to other HBCUs. Howard University and the University of the District of Columbia may not receive allotments if their amounts are less than their permanent annual appropriations. The institution submits a project plan to ED for approval, detailing proposed activities and meeting statutory provisions. Approved grants are five years long, with unused funds carried over for another five years. Institutions receiving a Title III-B grant cannot receive funds from other specified programs in the same fiscal year. Section 326 of the HEA authorizes the Historically Black Graduate Institutions program. The HBGI program aims to strengthen academic, administrative, and fiscal capabilities of Black graduate institutions. Unlike other programs, HBGI grants do not have additional mandatory funding and are specifically listed in the HEA for postgraduate institutions offering qualified graduate programs in various fields. The HBGI program aims to support education opportunities in mathematics, engineering, or the physical/natural sciences for Black Americans through qualified graduate programs. Initially, five institutions were eligible, but Congress has since added more schools and programs. Morehouse School of Medicine, Meharry Medical School, Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School, Clark-Atlanta University, Tuskegee University School of Veterinary Medicine, Xavier University School of Pharmacy, Southern University School of Law, Texas Southern University School of Law and School of Pharmacy, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Morgan State University, Hampton University, Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Jackson State University, Norfolk State University. In 2008, the HEOA expanded eligibility for HBGI grants to include six additional postgraduate schools: Alabama State University, Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University, Delaware State University, Langston University, Bowie State University, and University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law. These schools are now eligible for HBGI grants, with similar authorized uses as pre-HEOA schools. HBGI program grants have authorized uses similar to the Strengthening Institutions Program. Uses include purchasing equipment, constructing facilities, tutoring students, scholarships for needy graduate students, acquiring real property, and developing new graduate programs. Up to 10% of the grant can be used for new program development. The HBGI grant recipients can establish endowment funds with the grant money, but they must comply with provisions for Endowment Challenge Grants. Recipients must provide nonfederal matching funds for endowment funds and the program specifies how funds are allotted based on Congress appropriations. The first $56.9 million is available to pre-HEOA eligible institutions, with grant amounts at least as much as in FY2008. Any amount appropriated above $56.9 million goes to other institutions. Any amount appropriated over $56.9 million is available to institutions or programs added by the HEOA. Amounts over $62.9 million are distributed based on a formula developed by ED, considering factors like matching federal funds, student enrollment, cost of education, and degree recipients. In FY2016, program appropriations exceeded $62.9 million, with Congress appropriating approximately $63.2 million. Grants in excess of $1 million under the HBGI program require assurances that 50% of the grant's cost will be paid from nonfederal sources. Award recipients do not need to match the first $1 million awarded. The HBGI program award process involves a single-step application to ED for funds. Schools and programs can apply to the Department of Education for funds under the HBGI program by submitting an application detailing project plans. Grants are five years long and must be spent within 10 years. Recipients cannot receive more than one grant per fiscal year. Institutions eligible for other specified programs are not eligible for HBGI grants. The Higher Education Opportunity Act established Masters Degree Programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities under Title VII, Part A, Subpart 4 in 2008. This program aims to improve graduate education opportunities at the master's level for Black students in various fields of study. Institutions receiving HBGI grants cannot simultaneously receive funds under certain other programs not specifically for HBCUs. The Masters Degree Programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities aim to improve graduate education opportunities at the master's level for Black students in various fields of study. The program received discretionary appropriations in FY2017 totaling $7,500,000 after a lapse in funding for two years. HEA Section 723 specifically authorizes these programs for HBCUs. The Masters Degrees at HBCUs program grants are available to institutions listed in the HEA that contribute to graduate education opportunities for Black Americans in scientific disciplines. Currently, 18 HBCUs are eligible for this program. The Masters Degrees at HBCUs program provides funding to eligible institutions to support graduate school or qualified master's degree programs in various scientific disciplines where African Americans are underrepresented. Students must be enrolled in the program at the time of application for a grant. The Masters Degrees at HBCUs program grants are intended to enhance graduate education opportunities for Black Americans and low-income students. The grants can be used for purchasing lab equipment, improving instructional facilities, and providing financial assistance for needy graduate students. The Masters Degrees at HBCUs program grants can be used for various purposes such as enhancing graduate education opportunities for underrepresented groups, acquiring real property for campus expansion, developing new graduate programs, and establishing endowment funds with matching requirements. The Masters Degrees at HBCUs program grants are formula-based, with a minimum grant amount of $500,000 specified in Section 723. Institutions receiving grants over $1 million must provide 50% of project costs with nonfederal funds. The first $9 million appropriated is for the 18 listed institutions, with awards reduced if insufficient funds. Newly eligible institutions receive minimum grants unless funds are not available, in which case priority goes to the 18 listed institutions. The formula for distributing appropriations greater than $9 million to institutions in the Masters Degrees at HBCUs program is based on various factors such as matching federal funds, student enrollment, cost of attendance, and degree completion rates. The appropriation has not exceeded $9 million as of FY2017. The Masters Degrees at HBCUs program allocates funds based on factors like student enrollment and degree completion rates. Eligible institutions can apply for funds by submitting project plans that align with the program's goals. The Masters Degrees at HBCUs program grants are allotted based on approved project plans that align with program goals. Grants are up to six years in length and can be renewed periodically. Institutions can only receive one grant per fiscal year and are ineligible if they receive awards from other specified programs in the same year. The HBCU Cap Fin program provides low-cost capital financing for maintenance, renovation, and construction projects at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Established in 1992, it aims to support HBCUs in educating African Americans and low-income individuals. Congress found that many HBCU campuses lacked proper facilities due to financial constraints. HBCU Cap Fin was enacted by Congress to provide Historically Black Colleges and Universities with low-cost capital financing for maintenance, renovation, and construction projects. The program issues federal guarantees on qualified bonds for capital financing loans, excluding Howard University but including Lincoln University of Pennsylvania. HBCU applicants undergo a credit review to determine eligibility for low-cost financing for capital projects. Cap Fin loans provide low-cost financing for capital projects to HBCUs, including repair, renovation, construction of various facilities, instructional equipment, maintenance facilities, real property, outpatient healthcare facilities, and essential physical infrastructure. The Education Department contracts with a private corporation to issue taxable bonds on behalf of HBCUs for capital projects. The bonds are guaranteed by the ED, sold to third parties, and used to provide loans to eligible HBCUs at slightly above government borrowing rates. The program is limited to $1.1 billion in outstanding bonds and unpaid interest, with restrictions on the balance held for private and public HBCUs. The Higher Education Act authorizes the Education Department to provide loans to support public and private HBCUs for capital projects. HBCUs must use 95% of the loan for authorized projects and deposit the remaining 5% into an escrow account for potential defaults. The HBCU Capital Financing Advisory Board oversees loan terms and repayment procedures for HBCU Cap Fin loans. If an HBCU defaults, the DBA may assist with payments and draw from a pooled escrow account. If necessary, ED steps in to collect payments or collateral from the delinquent HBCU. The HBCU Capital Financing Advisory Board advises on construction financing for HBCU campuses. It is composed of 11 members appointed by the Secretary, including presidents of private and public HBCUs, UNCF and NAFEO presidents, and other designated officials. Each HBCU president serves a three-year term on the Advisory Board. The Advisory Board for HBCU Capital Financing includes presidents of HBCUs serving three-year terms. Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) enroll high numbers of Black American and low-income/first-generation students. Two HEA programs support PBIs: Strengthening PBIs and Masters Degree Programs at PBIs. Title III-A, Section 318 of the HEA establishes the Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions program. Title III-A, Section 318 of the HEA establishes the Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) program, providing SIP-type grants to PBIs to expand educational opportunities. Grants are funded through annual discretionary appropriations under Title III-A and additional mandatory appropriations under Title III-F. Grants under Title III-A are formula-based, while Title III-F grants are competitive, collectively known as the Strengthening PBI programs. Eligibility requirements and authorized uses are typically the same for both programs. The Strengthening PBI programs have specific eligibility requirements different from other Title III-A programs. Institutions must meet HEA Section 318(b)(1) requirements, have low E&G expenditures, be accredited, and enroll at least 40% Black American students. Undergraduate student enrollment must be at least 40% Black American students and meet the Section 318(b)(1) criterion for \"enrollment of needy students,\" which includes criteria such as being Federal Pell Grant recipients, coming from families receiving means-tested federal benefits, and attending schools with high poverty rates. The eligibility criteria for a Predominantly Black Institution (PBI) include having over 30% of children in poverty or being first-generation college students. A PBI must have at least 1,000 undergraduates, with over 50% being low-income or first-generation college students, and over 50% enrolled in degree programs. The Title III-A formula PBI program has specific funding requirements, while the Title III-F competitive PBI program allows for additional uses of grants. The Title III-F competitive PBI grants authorize additional uses for funding activities, different from Title III-A formula PBI grants. Title III-A grants are used to enhance capacity to serve low- and middle-income Black American students, expand higher education opportunities, and strengthen financial ability. Additional grant activities authorized under Section 318 include those from the Title III-A Strengthening Institutions Program. The Title III-A Strengthening Institutions Program (SIP) authorizes activities such as academic instruction in disciplines where Black Americans are underrepresented, teacher education programs for public schools, and community outreach programs to promote postsecondary education. PBIs can also use grants for construction and maintenance projects, with a limit of 50% of the grant, and up to 20% for endowments with matching funds. Title III-F competitive PBI grants have different authorized uses compared to Title III-A grants. Title III-F competitive PBI grants have specific authorized uses for programs in STEM, health education, internationalization, teacher preparation, and improving educational outcomes for African American males. Unlike Title III-A formula grants, Title III-F grants are competitive and institutions must meet eligibility requirements to receive funding. The Secretary reviews data submitted by eligible institutions and allocates funds accordingly. The formula for determining eligibility for Title III-F competitive PBI grants includes ratios based on the number of Federal Pell Grant recipients, an institution's graduates, and the percentage of graduates admitted to further education in underrepresented disciplines. The Title III-A formula PBI program provides grants to eligible PBIs, with a minimum grant of $250,000. If funds are insufficient, the minimum amount is reduced proportionally. Unused funds may be redistributed to other PBIs as determined by ED. The award process involves institution designation and project plan submission to ED. The Title III-F competitive PBI grant program requires PBIs to meet specific criteria, submit a project plan to ED, and adhere to statutory provisions and regulations. Grants are awarded based on a formula, with a two-year wait-out period for recipients. Unused grant funds must be returned within 10 years. The program awards 25 competitive grants of $600,000 each annually, with applicants needing to go through a two-step award process. Applicants for Title III-F competitive PBI grants must submit a project plan to ED and meet specific criteria. Project plans are selected based on a review panel's score, with the highest-scoring plans receiving funding. Institutions receiving Title III-A formula PBI grants may not receive grants from other Title III-A programs in the same fiscal year, but can generally receive grants from Title III-F programs. Institutions receiving a Title III-F competitive PBI grant are prohibited from receiving Title III-B grants. The Higher Education Opportunity Act established Masters Degree Programs at Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) to improve graduate education opportunities in various disciplines for Black Americans. The program has authorization for discretionary appropriations but has never received funds under this authority. Mandatory appropriations were provided for the program from FY2009 to FY2014, but authorization for mandatory appropriations lapsed in FY2014. The Masters Degrees at PBIs program, like the Masters Degrees at HBCUs program, grants funds to institutions contributing to graduate education opportunities in various disciplines for Black Americans. Eligible institutions are listed specifically for this program. The Masters Degrees at PBIs program provides grants to eligible institutions for graduate education opportunities for Black Americans. Currently, five institutions are eligible for this program: Chicago State University, Washington Adventist University, Long Island University - Brooklyn campus, Robert Morris University - Illinois, and York College - The City University of New York. Grants awarded must support a qualified master's degree program and are formula-based, with a minimum grant amount of $500,000. The Masters Degrees at PBIs program awards grants to eligible institutions for graduate education opportunities for Black Americans. Grants are formula-based with a minimum amount of $500,000. If a grant exceeds $1 million, 50% must be paid with nonfederal funds. The first $2.5 million is reserved for the five current eligible institutions. If funds are insufficient, awards are reduced proportionally. Additional eligible institutions receive the minimum grant amount if funds are available, otherwise, priority goes to the current five institutions. Appropriations over $2.5 million are distributed among all eligible institutions. The Masters Degrees at PBIs program allocates grants to eligible institutions for graduate education opportunities for Black Americans. Appropriations exceeding $2.5 million are distributed among all eligible institutions based on a formula determined by the Department of Education. The program follows a hold harmless rule to ensure that institutions do not receive less funding than they did in FY2009, unless there are insufficient funds or matching fund requirements are not met. The administration of the program mirrors that of the Masters Degrees at HBCUs program. The Masters Degrees at PBIs program provides grants for graduate education opportunities for Black Americans. Institutions receiving grants under other programs are ineligible for grants under this program in the same fiscal year. The Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program was created under the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 and later moved to its own title under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. The HSI program was moved to its own title, HEA Title V, to support Hispanic-Serving Institutions. The program aims to expand educational opportunities and improve academic attainment for Hispanic students. Title V is divided into two parts: Part A provides grants to HSIs, and Part B focuses on postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans. The Opportunities for Hispanic Americans program supports postbaccalaureate education for Hispanic students. Title III-F includes the HSI STEM program to increase Hispanic and low-income students in STEM fields. Grants under HSI STEM have similar requirements as Title V-A HSI program. This report will discuss eligibility criteria, authorized uses, and program administration for each HSI program. Section 501 of the HEA establishes Hispanic Serving Institutions. The Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) program, established by Section 501 of the HEA, aims to expand educational opportunities for Hispanic students. Institutions must meet specific criteria, including having at least 25% Hispanic student enrollment to qualify for grants. Branch campuses are eligible if the main institution meets requirements. The HSI program grants aim to improve institutions' ability to serve Hispanic and low-income students. Branch campuses must meet needy student enrollment and low E&G requirements. Authorized uses of HSI program grants include articulation agreements, student support programs, teacher education programs, and community outreach programs. The HSI program grants aim to improve institutions' ability to serve Hispanic and low-income students by establishing community outreach programs, expanding resources, and increasing graduate and professional student enrollment. Grants can also be used to establish or improve endowments, with a two-step award process for institutions to receive funding. The HSI program grants are awarded through a competitive process based on review panel scores. Grants are five years in length and institutions can receive multiple grants simultaneously. Institutions receiving HSI program grants are ineligible for Title III-A or III-B grants but can apply for Title III-F grants. The HSI STEM program, funded through HEA Title III-F, prioritizes increasing Hispanic and low-income students in STEM fields and developing transfer agreements between two-year and four-year institutions. The program mirrors the administration of the Title V-A HSI program. Additionally, the PPOHA program, established under HEA Section 511, aims to promote postbaccalaureate opportunities for Hispanic Americans. The PPOHA program, established under HEA Section 511, aims to expand postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for Hispanic students through grants funded by discretionary appropriations. Institutions must meet HSI program criteria and offer postbaccalaureate programs to qualify for a grant. The program aims to improve academic attainment for Hispanic and low-income students. The PPOHA program aims to expand postbaccalaureate educational opportunities for Hispanic and low-income students through grants. Authorized uses of PPOHA grants include purchasing educational equipment, renovating facilities, supporting faculty development, curriculum development, and collaboration with other institutions. The PPOHA program provides financial assistance to Hispanic and low-income postbaccalaureate students, including scholarships, assistantships, and research funds. Institutions can use up to 20% of their grant for student financial aid. The award process involves applying for designation as an eligible institution and then for program assistance through a competitive selection process based on review panel scores. The PPOHA program provides financial assistance to Hispanic and low-income postbaccalaureate students through scholarships, assistantships, and research funds. Grant awards are limited to five years, and institutions can only receive one grant per fiscal year. Institutions receiving a PPOHA grant cannot also receive certain other program grants in the same fiscal year. Additional programs are available to Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) under the Higher Education Act, such as the Endowment Challenge Grant and the Minority Science and Engineering programs. The Endowment Challenge Grant program provides matching grants to eligible institutions to establish or increase endowments. Recipients must provide nonfederal matching funds equal to the federal funds provided. The Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program aims to improve opportunities for minority and economically disadvantaged students in science and engineering. The Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) was established to provide grant-based assistance to predominantly minority institutions to improve science and engineering education and increase underrepresented minorities, especially women, in these fields. The Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) provides grant-based assistance to predominantly minority institutions to enhance science and engineering education for underrepresented minorities, including women. MSEIP grants are available to various entities, not just higher education institutions, and are divided into four categories to address specific issues in science and engineering education for minority students. Eligibility criteria for MSEIP grants are determined by the Department of Education (ED) through regulations. The Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program (MSEIP) provides grant-based assistance to predominantly minority institutions for enhancing science and engineering education. This includes partnerships with public or private nonprofit institutions that offer bachelor's degrees in science and engineering, as well as in-service training for project directors, scientists, and engineers from minority-serving institutions. Consortia of organizations providing services to minority-serving institutions are also eligible for grants. The MSEIP program provides grant-based assistance to predominantly minority institutions in science and engineering education. Minority-serving institutions are defined as those with over 50% enrollment of minority students. The MSEIP program offers grant-based assistance to minority-serving institutions in science and engineering education. Eligible entities include those of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American origin, Pacific Islander, or other underrepresented ethnic groups. There are four types of MSEIP grants: institutional, cooperative, design project, and special project grants. Institutional grants support science improvement plans, including faculty development and curriculum materials. The MSEIP program offers grant-based assistance to minority-serving institutions in science and engineering education. Institutional grants support science improvement plans, including faculty development and curriculum materials. Cooperative grants are awarded for projects that assist groups of public and private nonprofit accredited IHEs to work together on science improvement projects. Eligibility for institutional grants is limited to public and private nonprofit minority-serving institutions of higher education and consortia of such institutions. Cooperative grant eligibility is limited to groups of nonprofit accredited colleges and universities. Design project grants are awarded to minority-serving institutions to assist in developing long-range science improvement programs. These grants can be used for developing planning, management, and evaluation systems, as well as initiating scientific research and improving an institution's capacity for scientific research. Funds can be used to pay faculty salaries, with a limit of 50% of the funds per academic year. Eligibility for design project grants is not limited beyond statute. Special project grants are available to all MSEIP-eligible entities listed under HEA Section 361. There are two types of grants, one for minority-serving institutions to improve training and research capabilities, and another for any MSEIP-eligible entity to provide services or training. Authorized uses include advanced science seminars, faculty workshops, and science education research. The MSEIP grant programs aim to enhance science research and education skills, develop learning experiences in science, and address barriers to minority entry into science. Funding is competitively awarded through a single-step application process based on review panel scores, with priority given to certain applicants. The MSEIP grant programs prioritize funding for applicants who have not previously received funding and for previous grantees with a successful track record. Additionally, priority may be given to projects that contribute to geographic balance, academic disciplines, and project types. The list of acronyms used in the report and appropriations for selected HEA-authorized MSI programs are also provided in the appendix."
