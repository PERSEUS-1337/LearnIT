    "content": "The \"Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2017\" allows federal expungement for victims of trafficking. The \"Trafficking Survivors Relief Act of 2017\" allows federal expungement for victims of trafficking by amending Chapter 237 of title 18, United States Code to include a new section on motion to vacate, expungement, and mitigating factors for individuals convicted of noncovered offenses before the enactment of this section. The section defines terms such as \"crime of violence\" and \"eligible entity\" including legal aid societies, nonprofit organizations, and public defender's offices. It also clarifies the meanings of \"employee\" and \"officer\" and specifies that a \"noncovered offense\" refers to offenses against victims of trafficking. The section defines terms related to offenses against the United States or the District of Columbia, excluding offenses where a child was a victim. It also clarifies the definition of \"victim of trafficking\" as per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. Additionally, it allows individuals convicted of covered offenses to motion for vacating their convictions. The section allows individuals convicted of covered offenses to motion for vacating their convictions if the offense was a direct result of being a victim of trafficking. Arrest records can also be expunged if the arrest was related to being a victim of trafficking. A person can request the district court to expunge arrest records if the arrest was related to being a victim of trafficking and certain conditions are met, such as being acquitted of the offense or having charges dismissed. A person can request the district court to expunge arrest records if the arrest was related to being a victim of trafficking and certain conditions are met, such as being acquitted of the offense or having charges dismissed. The motion for expungement must be in writing, describe supporting evidence, state the offense, and include relevant documents. A mandatory hearing is required. The Government has 30 days to file a motion in opposition to a request for expungement of arrest records related to trafficking. If a motion is filed, a mandatory hearing must be held within 15 days. If no motion is filed, a discretionary hearing may still be held. The court may hold a hearing on the motion within 45 days after filing. Factors for granting the motion include being convicted of a covered offense due to being a victim of trafficking. The court may grant a motion to expunge arrests for covered offenses if the arrest was directly related to the individual being a victim of trafficking. The court may also grant a motion to expunge arrests for noncovered offenses under certain conditions. The court may grant a motion to expunge arrests for noncovered offenses if the arrest was directly related to the individual being a victim of trafficking, and certain conditions are met such as acquittal or dismissal of charges. The Government does not pursue criminal charges or dismisses charges for the covered offense, or if a subsequent conviction is vacated, there is a rebuttable presumption that the movant is a victim of trafficking if supporting evidence is provided. The movant can provide evidence such as a certification from a Federal immigration proceeding or an affidavit from a professional to prove they are a victim of trafficking. The court may consider additional evidence, such as an affidavit or sworn testimony, to determine if the movant is a victim of trafficking. If the court finds the affidavit or testimony credible, it can vacate a conviction or expunge an arrest under this section. The court may vacate a conviction or expunge an arrest if the movant's testimony is credible and no other evidence is readily available. It is not required for any other person to be convicted or arrested for a covered offense before the movant can file a motion. If a motion is denied, the denial shall be without prejudice, and the court must state the reasons for the denial in writing. If the denial was due to curable deficiencies in the motion, the movant must be given a reasonable time to cure them. If a motion to vacate a conviction is granted, the court will immediately vacate the conviction, set aside the verdict, enter a judgment of acquittal, and issue an expungement order to remove all references to the arrest from official records. An order granting or denying the motion can be appealed according to specific sections of the law. If a conviction is vacated, it will not be considered a conviction under Federal law, and the individual will revert to their status before the arrest or criminal proceedings. This will prevent any adverse immigration consequences. If a conviction is vacated, it will not be considered a conviction under Federal law, and the individual will revert to their status before the arrest or criminal proceedings. Expungement of arrests removes all references to the arrest, criminal proceedings, and results from official records to prevent adverse immigration consequences. If a conviction is vacated, it will not be considered a conviction under Federal law, and the individual will revert to their status before the arrest or criminal proceedings. Expungement of arrests prevents adverse immigration consequences, and no alien may be removed or lose immigration benefits due to an arrest or criminal proceedings. The court may reduce the term of imprisonment for a noncovered offense for a covered prisoner upon motion by the prisoner, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or the court itself. The court may reduce the term of imprisonment for a noncovered offense for a covered prisoner if it is found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the covered prisoner committed the noncovered offense as a direct result of being a victim of trafficking. There is a rebuttable presumption that a covered prisoner is a victim of trafficking in such cases. A covered prisoner can prove they are a victim of trafficking by providing official records or sworn testimony from a professional. The prisoner seeks help for trauma related to trafficking victimization. Any proceeding must adhere to section 3771. The Government must investigate the original sentencing to determine if a sentence reduction is appropriate. The court can take additional actions if a motion is granted. Movant's information is kept confidential. The motion documents, pleadings, or orders must be filed under seal. No information identifying the movant can be made available for public inspection. This section applies to convictions or arrests before, on, or after the enactment date. Technical amendments are made to the table of sections in the United States Code. 3772. Motion to vacate; expungement; mitigating factors."
