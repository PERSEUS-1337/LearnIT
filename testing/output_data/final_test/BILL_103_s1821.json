    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Comprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act\" and includes findings related to fetal alcohol syndrome. Congress finds that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading cause of mental retardation, affecting thousands of infants annually in the US. The syndrome is preventable, but poses a significant threat to American Indian and Alaska Native communities with high alcohol dependency rates. The effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects are 30 times greater than national averages. Researchers have found that the risk of these conditions increases with the amount and frequency of alcohol consumed during pregnancy. Stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy can reduce the risks and consequences for the baby. Additionally, these conditions result in significant financial costs to the nation for healthcare, education, foster care, job training, and support services. The Federal Government should actively encourage women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy due to the significant financial costs associated with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects. Delivery and care costs for infants exposed to illicit substances are four times higher, with estimated lifetime healthcare costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome child at least $1,400,000. There is no safe dose of alcohol during pregnancy, making it crucial for the nation to take action in preventing alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The purpose of this Act is to establish a program within the Department of Health and Human Services to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects nationwide through research, awareness, and coordination among Federal agencies. The Act establishes a Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Program under the Public Health Service Act to address Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects. The Secretary will establish a comprehensive program to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects, coordinating federal efforts through various agencies. The program includes public awareness, prevention, education programs, epidemiologic research, and basic research on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects. The program aims to improve prevention and treatment of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects through basic research, disseminating diagnostic criteria, and establishing an Inter-Agency Task Force chaired by the Associate Administrator for Alcohol Prevention and Treatment. The program involves various federal agencies such as the Department of Defense, Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Federal Trade Commission, and other relevant agencies. \"SEC. 520F. EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS.\" The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall direct agencies to support training programs for healthcare providers, educators, and others on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome prevention, conduct prevention and education programs for school-age children, and raise public awareness on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide technical assistance, grants, and contracts to support programs addressing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects, focusing on prevention effectiveness and cultural sensitivity. The prevention, education, and community-based public awareness programs aim to provide training to various healthcare providers, educators, and social workers on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects. Additionally, children and youth, especially pregnant and high-risk individuals, are educated about these conditions, with priority given to comprehensive school health education programs. Increasing public awareness about Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects through culturally sensitive projects, programs, and campaigns to prevent fetal exposure to alcohol. \"SEC. 520G. APPLIED EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH AND PREVENTION PROGRAM.\" The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct research, provide assistance, training, and award grants for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects prevention and intervention programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants and contracts to various entities to conduct innovative projects for preventing fetal exposure to alcohol and improve surveillance methods for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants and contracts to various entities for preventing fetal exposure to alcohol, improving surveillance methods for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Effects, tracking progress towards Year 2000 Prevention Objectives, identifying successful prevention efforts, and providing support services for children with symptoms. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can award grants for culturally-sensitive prevention programs targeting individuals at risk of alcohol dependency and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. These programs aim to coordinate efforts among Federal, State, Tribal, and local prevention programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services directs agencies to conduct research on prevention treatments for pregnant alcohol dependent women and individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects are also established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services directs agencies to develop and disseminate diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects within 16 months. An inter-agency task force is established to focus on these issues. The Secretary of Health and Human Services establishes an Inter-Agency Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects to coordinate federal agencies conducting research and programs for impacted populations. The Task Force is chaired by the Associate Administrator for Alcohol Prevention and Treatment and includes representatives from relevant agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. The Task Force established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services coordinates federal programs and research on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Effects, and maternal substance abuse across various government agencies. The Task Force coordinates federal programs and research on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Effects, and maternal substance abuse. It provides health, education, treatment, and social services to individuals with these conditions and their families. The Task Force also collaborates with existing Department of Health and Human Services task forces on substance abuse prevention and maternal and child health, and reports annually to relevant Committees of Congress on its activities. The administrative provisions regarding grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts are outlined in SEC. 520K. To be eligible for a grant, an entity must be a State, Indian tribal government, local government, school-based health clinic funder, academic institution, or non-profit organization. The entity must submit an application to the Secretary detailing planned activities and assure proper use of grant funds. Maintenance of effort is required for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts. Maintenance of Effort: Entities must maintain their expenditures for activities at a level equal to or greater than the previous fiscal year when applying for a grant, cooperative agreement, or contract. The Secretary may reduce the grant amount by the fair market value of supplies or equipment provided to the recipient, as well as pay and allowances upon request. The recipient must reimburse the Federal Government for the pay, allowances, and travel expenses of any officer or employee detailed to them, along with any other costs incurred in connection with the detail.
