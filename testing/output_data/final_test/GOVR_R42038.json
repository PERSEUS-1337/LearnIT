Premiums in 2011 totaled $581.4 billion for life/health companies and $436.0 billion for property/casualty companies. The industry holds assets worth around $7.5 trillion. Life insurance involves long-term contracts with defined risks, while property/casualty insurance covers various lines like homeowners and automobile insurance. Insurance companies in the U.S. are divided into life/health and property/casualty sectors. Life insurance involves long-term contracts with defined risks, while property/casualty insurance has shorter-term contracts and greater exposure to catastrophic risks. Health insurance has evolved differently, with companies heavily involved in healthcare delivery and regulated by the federal government. Insurance companies have been regulated by states for the past 150 years due to a 1868 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Paul v. Virginia. In Paul v. Virginia, the Court ruled that insurance policies were not part of interstate commerce and not subject to federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. However, in U.S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association in 1944, the Court found that federal antitrust laws applied to interstate insurance activities. This decision raised concerns about state insurance regulation and taxation. Efforts to overturn the South-Eastern Underwriters decision led to legislative action by state regulators and industry leaders. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 was passed to preserve states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the industry. Despite some exceptions like the LRRA, proposals to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government have been opposed by states and the insurance industry. Efforts to increase federal involvement in the insurance industry led to regulatory reform at the state level by groups like the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and NCOIL. There were concerns about state regulation's ability to oversee the industry, prompting discussions about transferring regulatory authority to the federal government in the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s, despite reforms at the state level and NAIC, a breach in the state regulatory system occurred with Martin Frankel's involvement. In the late 1990s, Martin Frankel exploited loopholes in state insurance regulation, diverting over $200 million from small life insurance companies. State reforms in the late 1980s and early 1990s introduced insurance guaranty funds to protect consumers in case of insurer insolvency. The guaranty fund steps in to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer's assets and pays claims up to certain limits. Existing insurers in the state may be assessed to cover any shortfall in funds. Insurers assessed by guaranty funds can write off the assessments on future state taxes. The 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act significantly changed the financial regulatory system in the United States. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) revamped the financial regulatory system in the US by addressing market convergence, which blurred distinctions between financial products and providers. This was driven by globalization, technology, deregulation, and increased competition. GLBA removed barriers for banks and securities firms to compete with insurance companies, creating a new competitive landscape. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) created a new competitive paradigm by allowing insurance companies to compete directly with brokerages, mutual funds, and commercial banks. It reaffirmed state insurance regulators as the primary regulators of insurance products. Some insurance companies feel that state regulation puts them at a disadvantage compared to federally regulated non-insurer competitors. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) changed the competitive landscape for insurance companies, allowing them to compete with banks and brokerages. Some insurers face challenges in getting products to market quickly due to state regulations, while banks can launch similar products nationwide in weeks. The industry has shifted towards supporting regulatory changes, such as an optional federal charter for insurance. GLBA also addressed modernizing state laws for insurance agents and brokers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) aimed to enhance competition among financial services providers by allowing insurance companies to compete with banks and brokerages. It also addressed the issue of insurance producer licensing reciprocity or uniformity, leading to the creation of the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB), which never came into effect due to state legislation. Some states still face challenges in implementing reciprocity, despite efforts to modernize state laws for insurance agents and brokers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) aimed to promote competition among financial institutions by allowing banks, securities firms, and insurers to converge. However, the major merger between Citibank and Travelers, which led to the passage of GLBA, has been reversed. Instead of cross-sector mergers, banks began distributing insurance and insurers created financing-like products. Consolidation continued within each sector, with banks merging with banks and insurers with insurers. Despite GLBA's \"functional regulation,\" regulation still follows institutional lines. During the 107th to 110th Congresses, congressional interest in insurance regulatory issues persisted, especially in the House of Representatives. The House Financial Services Committee conducted numerous hearings on insurance matters. Various proposals for federal intervention in insurance regulation were suggested but not advanced. Additionally, narrower bills addressing specific aspects of insurance regulation were introduced, such as surplus lines, reinsurance, and insurance producer licensing. The 110th Congress saw continued focus on insurance regulation. The financial crisis during the 110th Congress led to calls for regulatory changes due to failures in the financial regulatory structure and lack of oversight for the largest actors in the system. This crisis highlighted the need for increased systemic risk implementation. The financial crisis during the 110th Congress led to calls for regulatory changes, including increased systemic risk regulation and federal oversight of insurance, particularly larger firms. Insurers generally performed well during the crisis, supporting arguments for retaining the state-based insurance system. However, the industry saw two notable failures, one involving financial guarantee insurers and their exposure to mortgage-backed securities. In late 2007 and early 2008, strains appeared in the insurance industry due to exposure to mortgage-backed securities. Bond insurers failed, leading to downgrades that affected municipal bond markets. American International Group (AIG) failed in mid-September 2008, seeking over $100 billion in assistance from the Federal Reserve to prevent bankruptcy. Multiple restructurings of the assistance followed, with the Federal Reserve receiving warrants for 79.9% of AIG's equity in return. The U.S. government provided nearly $70 billion in assistance to AIG through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, resulting in the government owning 92% of the company. Federal Reserve assistance has been repaid, and the U.S. Treasury has sold most of its equity stake. The near collapse of AIG and bond insurers highlights potential regulatory failures, leading to discussions about increased federal involvement in insurance regulation. AIG's complex structure, with state-chartered insurance subsidiaries and federally regulated holding company, adds to the complexity of the situation. The federally regulated thrift holding company AIG faced immediate losses from derivatives and securities lending operations overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). The Federal Reserve argued for a single body to oversee systemic risk and large financial holding companies, leading to the absorption of OTS into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred holding company oversight authority to the Federal Reserve in response to the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed the financial crisis by enacting broad financial regulatory reform, leaving states as the primary regulators of insurance. Key provisions included the creation of a Federal Insurance Office (FIO), systemic-risk measures like the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and harmonization of surplus lines insurance and reinsurance. Holding company oversight under Dodd-Frank may impact insurers with banking subsidiaries. Insurance issues before the 112th Congress include oversight and implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, legislation reforming the regulatory system, and response to international developments like Solvency II. Recent legislation not introduced in the 112th Congress includes creating a federal charter for insurance and limiting the McCarran-Ferguson Act's antitrust exclusion. The House Committee on Financial Services' Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing, and Community Opportunity has held hearings on various insurance oversight topics. The full House Committee marked up the Insurance Data Protection Act. In the Senate, hearings were held on the nomination of S. Roy Woodall Jr. and on emerging issues in insurance regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes the FIO within the Department of the Treasury to oversee the insurance industry and develop international policy. FIO can preempt state laws that treat non-U.S. insurers unfavorably compared to U.S. insurers, but only if it conflicts with an international agreement on consumer protection. Preemption does not apply to state regulations on rates, premiums, underwriting, sales practices, or coverage requirements. The FIO, established under the Dodd-Frank Act, oversees the insurance industry and can preempt state laws that discriminate against non-U.S. insurers. Preemption does not apply to state regulations on rates, premiums, underwriting, or sales practices. The FIO's monitoring function includes gathering information from public and private sources, with subpoena power if necessary. Director McRaith leads international discussions and a bill limiting subpoena power is under review by the House Financial Services Committee. Director McRaith, head of the FIO, is leading international discussions and was elected to head a technical committee of the IAIS. The establishment of FIO under Dodd-Frank has been delayed, with reports on regulatory modernization and reinsurance still pending. The Dodd-Frank Act includes systemic-risk provisions affecting the insurance industry through Federal Reserve oversight, prudential standards for large banks, and designation of SIFIs by the FSOC. The FSOC is responsible for designating SIFIs and setting higher prudential standards, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management requirements, and exposure limits. The Federal Reserve may set additional prudential standards based on risk factors. Firms must submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports. The Federal Reserve requires firms to submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports. Regulated subsidiaries are overseen by their primary regulator, but the Federal Reserve can intervene if necessary. Annual stress tests are conducted on systemically significant firms, with regulations established to prevent insolvency and its impact on the financial system. Proposed rules for higher prudential standards are pending, with uncertainty on whether separate rules for non-bank institutions will be issued. The Dodd-Frank Act's special resolution regime applies to financial companies that could cause systemic disruption upon failure. Insurance subsidiaries are exempt, with state insurance resolution systems handling their resolution. The FDIC can step in if the state system doesn't act within 60 days. Funding for resolving systemically important firms involves assessments on financial companies with over $50 billion in assets, overseen by the Federal Reserve. The FDIC imposes assessments on financial firms to fund resolution of systemically important firms. Insurers' contributions to state insurance resolution regimes are considered. FSOC has issued rules for the new resolution regime, with a bill introduced to remove insurers from this authority. Insurers argue against additional oversight by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is considering additional oversight of insurers, who argue against being designated as systemically important. The Dodd-Frank Act consolidated oversight of holding companies under the Federal Reserve and strengthened capital standards. No insurers have been deemed systemically important by the FSOC yet. The Federal Reserve is implementing higher capital standards for banks under the Basel III agreement. 27 bank or thrift holding companies overseen by the Federal Reserve are largely engaged in the business of insurance, including AIG, Nationwide, and State Farm. The combined banking/thrift assets of these companies total $124.3 billion, while their insurance operations have combined assets of $23 trillion. USAA is an exception with nearly equal thrift and insurance assets. USAA stands out with almost equal thrift and insurance assets, unlike other companies overseen by the Federal Reserve. The Volcker Rule could impact insurers with banking subsidiaries by restricting proprietary trading, but there are exemptions for regulated insurance companies. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of banking entities. The FSOC study on the Volcker Rule under Dodd-Frank highlights concerns about fund flows between banking entities and insurance companies. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke acknowledges the need for tailored regulation for insurance companies due to their unique assets and liabilities. Insurers are worried that proposed capital rules are too focused on banks and do not consider industry-specific characteristics. Some insurers are selling banking subsidiaries to avoid Federal Reserve oversight under Dodd-Frank and Basel III rules. Title V, Subtitle B of Dodd-Frank addresses insurance regulatory issues. The act harmonizes regulation of nonadmitted insurance, giving sole authority to the \"home state\" of the insured. The curr_chunk discusses the distribution of taxes on surplus lines transactions and reinsurance transactions. It mentions the authority of the home state in the absence of an interstate compact, preemption of state laws conflicting with NAIC model law, and the regulation of reinsurer solvency by the home state of the reinsurer. NAIC and NCOIL developed interstate agreements to supersede federal provisions on tax distribution. The curr_chunk discusses two models developed by NCOIL and NAIC to address surplus lines regulatory issues and tax allocation. The lack of uniformity in state ratifications was addressed in congressional hearings, with a pledge to blend the two approaches for uniformity. Progress towards this goal remains unclear. H.R. 1112 was introduced by Representative Randy. H.R. 1112, introduced by Representative Randy Neugebauer, aims to establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a private, nonprofit corporation. NARAB members, once licensed in one state, would be able to operate in any other state by paying the licensing fee. State laws treating out-of-state insurance producers differently would be preempted, with NARAB overseen by a board of five appointees. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) would be overseen by a board with appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners. The President would have the authority to appoint and dissolve the board. NARAB, also known as \"NARAB 2,\" was established under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 to streamline insurance producer licensing. Despite meeting requirements, some states like California, Florida, and Washington have not implemented uniformity and reciprocity in their licensing laws. H.R. 2126, introduced by Representatives John Campbell and Peter Welch, aims to expand the Liability Risk Retention Act (LRRA) federal preemption of state insurance laws. It would allow risk retention groups (RRGs) to cover commercial property risks and risk purchasing groups (RPGs) to purchase coverage for commercial property risks. The bill also includes additional federal corporate governance, disclosure, and fiduciary duty requirements for RRGs under the act. H.R. 2126 would create a process for the Federal Insurance Office director to determine if state regulations of RRGs or RPGs are preempted by the LRRA. It includes corporate governance standards such as independent directors, audit committees, written governance standards, and limited service provider contracts. Amendments to the LRRA would expand consumer disclosure and impose a fiduciary duty on RRG directors. H.R. 3559, introduced by Representative Steve Stivers, aims to impose a fiduciary duty on the board of directors of a risk retention group. It also includes provisions to limit the Federal Insurance Office's subpoena authority and extend confidentiality requirements for insurance information. H.R. 6423, introduced by Representative Bill Posey, aims to amend Dodd-Frank to exempt insurance companies from the resolution regime created by the law. It would remove the FDIC's authority to resolve insurance subsidiaries and exclude insurance companies from FDIC assessments. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. The United States has a surplus in trade in financial services, except for insurance where there is a deficit. Consolidations in the insurance industry are creating larger international entities. The need for federal involvement in insurance regulation is highlighted, with the FIO tasked with developing federal policy in international insurance matters. The EU is the US's biggest trading partner in insurance services. The EU is implementing Solvency II to create a single market for financial services, aiming to match capital requirements with insurer risks. This ambitious proposal will overhaul insurer financial soundness, with a focus on risk management efficiency. Delays have put the 2014 implementation in doubt, but the EU is setting a world-leading standard for insurers. The EU established the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) as part of the Solvency II project to develop binding regulations at a European level. Concerns exist about potential discrimination against U.S. insurers if their supervision is not deemed equivalent to EU standards. EIOPA has recommended equivalence for Switzerland, Bermuda, and Japan but not for the United States. The EU sees the need for improved access for European reinsurers to foreign markets, such as the United States, due to the complexity of the regulatory system. Access to the U.S. market for insurance is a significant issue for EU insurers, with concerns about state regulatory requirements for non-U.S. reinsurers to back reinsurance with 100% collateral in the U.S. Non-U.S. reinsurers are requesting a reduction to as low as 50% to align with U.S. reinsurers' treatment in foreign countries. The NAIC has recommended reducing collateral requirements for reinsurers based on their financial strength, but changes must be made at the state level for them to take effect. In 2009, draft federal legislation was proposed to enforce national standards for reinsurance collateral, including reducing collateral for highly rated reinsurers. This proposal was adopted as a model law and regulation by the NAIC in November 2011, with 11 states representing 40% of the market needing to implement the changes. Following the passage of GLBA, state insurance regulators through the NAIC began a regulatory modernization program in response to criticisms and the convergence of financial services. Only Florida and New York have approved reinsurers for collateral reduction out of 11 states representing 40% of primary insurance premiums in the US. New NAIC working groups were formed to address issues such as state privacy protections and reciprocity. NAIC working groups were formed to address issues such as state privacy protections, reciprocity of state producer licensing laws, and promotion of \"speed to market\" of new insurance products. Highlights of post-GLBA NAIC efforts include certification of 47 states as reciprocal jurisdictions for producer licensing laws, adoption of heightened standards for reciprocity with 37 states, and continued growth of the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) with over 558,000 filings made in 2011. The System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) saw a significant increase in filings, with over 558,000 made in 2011. Forty-nine states participate in the system, with an average turnaround time of 47 days for life/health filings and 28 days for property/casualty filings. The Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact, in effect since May 2006, aims to provide regulatory uniformity and a single point of product filing for certain insurance lines. Currently, 41 states have joined the compact, representing two-thirds of insurance premium volume. Three additional states have pending legislation to endorse the compact. The NAIC believes that states are better suited than the federal government to protect the interests of U.S. insurance consumers. In 2010, state insurance departments had a total budget of nearly $1.3 billion and handled over 304,000 consumer complaints and 2.1 million inquiries. They employed more than 11,600 staff members for these tasks. The NAIC supported federal efforts to address systemic risk while maintaining state-based insurance regulation. The NAIC made changes to strengthen oversight of insurance holding companies and securities lending, reduce reliance on credit rating agencies, and launched a \"Solvency Modernization Initiative\" to consider international developments in insurance supervision. In 2008, the Treasury released a Blueprint for Modernized Financial Regulatory. In 2008, the Treasury released a Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, aiming to create a more flexible and efficient regulatory framework. The blueprint proposed a prudential regulator for solvency, a business conduct regulator for consumer protection, and a market stability regulator for systemic risks. It also recommended the creation of a federal insurance regulator for an optional federal charter and federal licensing for agents and brokers. The Treasury Department proposed the creation of an \"Office of Insurance Oversight\" in the Department of the Treasury to address international regulatory issues and collect information on the insurance industry. President Obama's Financial Regulatory Reform Plan aimed to reform financial regulation in the United States, including changes to the financial regulatory system. The financial regulatory system underwent significant changes, including the introduction of systemic risk oversight by the Federal Reserve and the consolidation of banking regulators. The creation of a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency was also proposed. Insurance regulation was mostly left to the states, with limited involvement from the federal government. Large financial companies posing systemic risk would be subject to specific regulations under the President's plan. The President's plan includes regulating large financial companies presenting systemic risk and creating a new Office of National Insurance within the Treasury. The Federal Reserve would oversee systemic risk regulation with a Financial Services Oversight Council. Companies engaging in financial activities in the U.S. could be designated Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies subject to stringent standards. Insurers may also fall under federal jurisdiction for systemic risk regulation. The draft legislation proposed subjecting large financial companies to enhanced resolution authority and stringent solvency standards. It was unclear how the Federal Reserve would interact with state regulators of insurance subsidiaries. The creation of an Office of National Insurance could have a significant impact, although the specifics were not fully resolved. The Office of National Insurance would not have direct regulatory power over insurers but would oversee federal insurance matters, set policy, and represent the US internationally. Unenacted legislation in the 111th Congress included the Insurance Industry Competition Act of 2009 (H.R. 1583). H.R. 1583, introduced in the House in 2009, aimed to abolish the exemption from federal antitrust laws for the insurance industry and allow investigations by the Federal Trade Commission. It would not have affected state insurance regulators. H.R. 1880, introduced in April 2009, proposed creating a federal charter for the insurance industry but did not progress further in Congress. The bill, H.R. 1880, aimed to establish a federal charter for the insurance industry, creating a national regulatory body under the Department of the Treasury. It would have allowed nationally licensed insurers, agencies, and producers to operate nationwide without adhering to individual state laws. Additionally, the bill addressed systemic risk by designating a regulator to oversee systemically significant insurers. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 2554) introduced by Representative David Scott aimed to establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a private, nonprofit corporation allowing licensed insurance producers to operate nationwide with only one state license. The bill passed the House in 2011 but was not acted upon by the Senate. The NARAB member would operate in any state with a licensing fee, subject to consumer protection and market conduct regulations. NARAB would be overseen by a board with appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to modernize risk retention but was not further acted upon. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups covering commercial property risks. It proposed changes to enforcement mechanisms, added federal corporate governance requirements, and allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to issue determinations on state regulations. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups covering commercial property risks. The act proposed changes to enforcement mechanisms, added federal corporate governance requirements, and allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to issue determinations on state regulations. Additionally, the Federal License for Reinsurers Act of 2010 (H.R. 6529) introduced by Representative Dennis Moore included amendments to the LRRA such as expanding consumer disclosure requirements and imposing a specific fiduciary duty on the board of directors of a risk retention group. H.R. 6529, introduced by Dennis Moore on December 16, 2010, aimed to create a federal license for reinsurers under the authority of the FIO, established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The bill did not progress beyond being referred to the House Committee on Financial Services."
