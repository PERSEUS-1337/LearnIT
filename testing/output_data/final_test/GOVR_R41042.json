The tax is assessed on imported and domestic cargo at a rate of 0.125% and generates over $1 billion annually. U.S. waterborne exporters are exempt from the tax, and importers contribute about 95% of the revenue. The funds collected are deposited into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) for Congress to appropriate for harbor maintenance. Despite a surplus in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) due to rising import volume, many busy U.S. harbors are not fully maintained, increasing the risk of ship accidents and raising shipping costs. Industry stakeholders are considering a \"spending guarantee\" to address this issue, but little or no shipping activity is taking place at some harbors that shippers are paying to maintain. The report focuses on economic and equity issues related to Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) expenditures. It highlights inefficiencies in current spending, with less than half of HMT dollars collected being used to maintain frequently used harbors. The report also discusses the legislative history of the tax and legal challenges, as well as alternative funding options. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established in 1986 to fund harbor maintenance, with revenue initially assessed at 0.04% of cargo value. In 1990, the HMT was increased to 0.125% to cover 100% of the Army Corps of Engineers' port O&M costs. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established in 1986 to fund harbor maintenance, with revenue initially assessed at 0.04% of cargo value. The tax is assessed on imported and domestic waterborne cargo at ports, as well as on cruise ship passengers. Export waterborne cargo is not taxed due to a Supreme Court decision. HMT is constitutional for domestic shipments and cruise line passengers. Coastal and Great Lakes ports are subject to the tax.

HMT is constitutional for domestic shipments and cruise line passengers. Coastal and Great Lakes ports are subject to the tax. The list of ports subject to the tax does not include inland rivers or cargo moving to Alaska, Hawaii, and other U.S. possessions. Importers of waterborne cargo generate most of the tax revenue, with domestic cargo shippers contributing only 5% and cruise ship passengers less than 1%. Approximately $500 million per year in tax revenue remains uncollected from domestic shippers, representing 44% of the total amount collected in FY2009. The Corps is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to improve tax collection from these shippers. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that a user fee based on the value of service provided to a marine carrier would not violate the Constitution. The Clinton Administration proposed a Harbor Services User Fee (HSUF) in August 1998, to be paid by carriers based on vessel capacity and frequency of port use. Revenues from the fee would fund routine maintenance and harbor-deepening projects. The 106th Congress did not pursue the Clinton Administration's proposal for a Harbor Services User Fee (HSUF) or other funding proposals for maintenance and dredging. The HSUF proposal aimed to make ship owners internalize the costs of deploying larger ships, which save money on the ocean leg but increase costs at port due to deeper channels and berths. Ship operators do not fully consider these costs in their decision-making process because dredging costs are currently borne by others, such as customers and federal taxpayers. The Clinton Administration proposed a Harbor Services User Fee (HSUF) to make ship owners internalize dredging costs for deploying larger ships. The European Union challenged the application of the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) to imports as a discriminatory import tariff violating WTO obligations. Consultations and negotiations were held in 1998, with a deadline set for satisfactory legislation by January 1, 2000. The European Union has not requested a WTO dispute resolution panel regarding the Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) as of 2009. Maintenance dredging is funded by the HMTF for maintaining channel dimensions authorized by Congress, while new construction requires an act of Congress and is funded from the General Treasury. Maintenance dredging accounts for the majority of federal dredging dollars and material dredged. Construction dredging is more expensive than maintenance dredging, with private contractors handling 80% of maintenance dredging under USACE's direction. Maintenance dredging costs have increased from $1.53 to $3.19 per cubic yard from 1963 to 2008. The Corps dredges federally designated channels in harbors, while port authorities are responsible for dredging berths. Larger containerships and dry bulk vessels are driving current dredging activity. At present, there is no trend towards larger vessels in the oil tanker category. Supertankers stay at sea for extended periods, loading or unloading at offshore platforms or designated zones. Container ships require deeper access channels due to different service patterns compared to bulk tankers. Bulk tankers are chartered per voyage between single origin and destination ports, allowing more flexibility in waiting for tidal action. Container ships operate on a scheduled basis, calling at multiple ports without the luxury of waiting for high tide. The development of double-stack container rail service in the 1980s reduced shipping costs across the United States, decreasing reliance on the Panama Canal for transcontinental shipments. This allowed for the deployment of larger \"post-Panamax\" ships on trans-Pacific routes, increasing the competitiveness of U.S. West Coast ports for containerized trade. The Panama Canal is undergoing a widening and deepening project, expected to be completed around 2015, which will impact U.S. Gulf and East Coast ports. The expansion of the Panama Canal, expected to be completed around 2015, will enhance the competitiveness of U.S. Gulf and East Coast ports in capturing Asian cargo. These ports require more dredging than West Coast ports, leading to intensified interest in accommodating larger ships. Domestic shipping on the Great Lakes and along the coasts accounts for only a fraction of U.S. foreign waterborne trade. The relationship between most U.S. ports is more competitive than complementary, with Duluth, Minnesota shipping iron ore to Indiana and Ohio Great Lakes ports, and Gulf Coast ports handling petroleum and chemical products. Harbor maintenance funding redistributes tax revenues from busy ports to less busy ones, with the HMTF balance expected to exceed $5 billion by the end of FY2010. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) balance increased in FY1999 due to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of FY1999. Despite a decrease in international trade in FY2009, the current HMTF balance, along with remaining collections and interest payments, is sufficient to cover expenditures for the foreseeable future. Congress appropriates funds for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for navigation operation and maintenance at harbors, with reimbursements from the HMTF for qualified expenditures.

Despite a decrease in international trade in FY2009, the HMTF balance, along with remaining collections and interest payments, is sufficient to cover expenditures for the foreseeable future. The HMT generates a national pool of funds distributed without regard to specific port usage, although it is meant to be a port user charge. Importers generate almost all tax revenues, leading to ports handling a large amount of imported containerized cargo to generate exceptional HMT revenues. Containerized cargo, particularly international, is of higher value compared to other cargo types. The top 25 ports by imported cargo value in 2005 are listed to give an indication of HMT revenue generation concentration. The top 15 ports contribute to 75% of the total imported cargo value, with Los Angeles, Long Beach, Tacoma, and Seattle standing out as major revenue generators. HMT revenues are mainly used for harbor maintenance. Based on HMTF expenditures and revenues generated on imported cargo, major ports like Los Angeles, Long Beach, Seattle, and Tacoma receive minimal returns. New York, Boston, and Houston also receive a small fraction of tax revenues collected. The top 15 commodities imported into the US in 2008 account for 82% of total cargo value, with imported oil being the highest revenue generator for harbor maintenance. Consumer goods, including motor vehicles, clothing, toys, furniture, footwear, beverages, and appliances, account for a significant portion of import value and harbor maintenance tax revenues. The tax based on cargo value ensures that those who can afford to pay more, do so. However, cargo value does not directly correlate with dredging needs, making it less effective as a user fee. Shippers of high-value, low volume commodities may prefer a tax based on cargo tonnage. Since establishment in 1986, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) has funded maintenance dredging, SLSDC operations, and CBP administrative costs. The fund ranges from $525 million to close to $700 million annually, with minor expenditures for SLSDC and CBP compared to USACE's harbor maintenance costs. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) annually appropriates $15-20 million to the SLSDC and $3 million to CBP for maintenance activities related to keeping waterways unobstructed. HMTF funds are also used for construction of dredged material disposal facilities, channel surveying, emergency dredging, removal of navigation hindrances like drift material or aquatic weeds, and maintenance of harbor breakwaters and jetties. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is used for the operation and maintenance of various locks, including the Soo Locks in Michigan, Chittenden Locks in Seattle, Bonneville Lock and Dam in Oregon, Black Rock Lock in Buffalo, Troy Lock in New York, locks on the Okeechobee Waterway in Florida, and locks along the Louisiana coast. The US Army Corps of Engineers distinguishes HMTF expenditures for deep draft and shallow draft harbors and channels. Since 1987, 81-90% of HMTF expenditures have been on deep draft harbors, with 10-19% on shallow draft waterways. Over the last decade, 16% of total HMTF expenditures were on shallow draft channels, mainly recreational and low revenue-generating. Louisiana received nearly one-fifth of HMTF funds, over 2.5 times more than Texas. Michigan ranks fifth in expenditures, the only state without a saltwater port in the top 15. In North Carolina, despite being relatively expensive in terms of HMTF withdrawals, commercial cargo shipping on waterways is minimal. The state ranks 28th in waterborne tonnage among coastal and Great Lakes states where the HMT is collected. In 2007, North Carolina ports handled slightly more cargo than Rhode Island but had significantly higher harbor maintenance costs. The top 20 states account for 92% of HMTF expenditures, with O&M costs influenced by factors like sand and silt movement, channel length, and number of locks. The most expensive shipping channel is the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to the Gulf of Mexico, accounting for 43% of Louisiana's HMTF expenditures. Hurricane Katrina increased the need for maintenance dredging. Louisiana received more HMTF funds than other leading states even before the hurricane. Mobile Harbor in Alabama and the St. Marys River channel in Michigan are also costly. Locks on the St. Marys River allow navigation between Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Other channels with locks funded from the HMTF are among the top 25 projects, totaling 49% of total HMTF expenditures. The Oregon Inlet on the Outer Banks of North Carolina has received over $60 million in the last decade for dredging to maintain its channel. Despite the challenge of sand accumulation, constant dredging is required to keep the channel passable, even though no cargo is transported through it. The Oregon Inlet on the Outer Banks of North Carolina requires constant dredging to maintain its passability for commercial fisherman, charter boat operators, and recreational craft. Despite no cargo being shipped through this channel, it has received over $60 million in the last decade for dredging. Other harbors like Yaquina Bay and Harbor in Oregon and Grays Harbor in Washington State also require significant maintenance costs, even though no goods are shipped through them. In 2007, Grays Harbor ranked 133 among U.S. ports for cargo handling. $115 million has been spent over the last decade to maintain the harbor channel. Despite minimal cargo traffic, it is important for commercial fishermen and recreational boaters. Grays Harbor ranked 13th in commercial fish landings in 2007. In 2007, Humboldt Harbor in California ranked 33rd in maintenance costs despite handling less cargo than Grays Harbor. A deepening project was undertaken in 1998, but ship traffic has since declined with only one ocean-going ship visiting per month. Barge traffic is more frequent due to lower draft requirements. The Cape Cod Canal, built in 1914, was sold to the federal government in 1928 due to lack of commercial viability. Shippers pay $7.7 million annually for maintenance, mainly for fuel oil barges. The Lake Washington Ship Canal in Seattle is costly but unused by shippers. The Lake Washington Ship Canal in Seattle is costly to maintain at $63 million over the last ten years, but unused by shippers as all cargo terminals are located on the Sound. Pleasure boats account for 82% of the canal's traffic, with an average of 100 boats transiting daily. If maintenance costs were to be recovered from users, each vessel would have to pay $117 per transit. The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (C&D Canal) is expensive to maintain, costing over $128 million in the last decade. It connects the Delaware Bay with the Chesapeake Bay and carries about 15 million short tons of cargo per year. Some suggest charging recreational boaters based on boat size to correlate with lock usage and ability to pay. The C&D Canal carries 15 million short tons of cargo annually, while ports along the Delaware Bay handle over 125 million short tons. The canal's maintenance costs are almost six times higher per ton than the entire Delaware Bay. Great Lakes carriers face a crisis due to inadequate dredging, leading to ships light loading. The Great Lakes Maritime Task Force advocates for $200 million yearly for maintenance but only receives $90 million. Despite accounting for 14% of total HMTF withdrawals, Great Lakes shipping represents less than 10% of total tonnage. Great Lakes shipping represents less than 10% of total tonnage subject to the HMT, with maintenance costs at about 60 cents per ton. The system is considered less efficient due to the low dollar value raw materials it carries, resulting in minimal HMT revenue. The region heavily relies on coastal port use for harbor maintenance, with disparities in maintenance costs per ton among different ports. Some U.S. harbors require extensive maintenance, while others handle little cargo but benefit nearby communities through recreational activities. However, funds are being spent on maintaining harbors with little ship traffic, while the busiest shipping channels are not being maintained to their authorized dimensions. According to the Corps analysis, full channel dimensions are available less than 35% of the time at the 59 highest use U.S. harbors. The top ten busiest U.S. ports generate sufficient revenue to cover maintenance costs, but only receive a small portion of total expenditures. Despite handling 80% of oceangoing ship traffic, the twenty busiest ports account for less than 40% of maintenance expenditures. A significant portion of revenue is used to dredge channels used by recreational boaters and fishermen who do not pay the Harbor Maintenance Tax. Only 30 to 45 cents of every Harbor Maintenance Tax dollar paid is spent on harbors used by shippers. There is debate over targeting one group for fees and distributing funds for the benefit of other users, such as recreational boaters and fishermen. The original plan was to assess the tax on commercial fishermen, but an amendment exempted them. The Harbor Maintenance Tax Fund (HMTF) generates revenue for dredging activities, with commercial fishing exempt from paying the tax. Recreational boaters already contribute to federal fuel taxes for boat safety programs. The HMTF provides a national pool of funds for dredging, leveling the playing field among ports with different requirements. Some argue it may draw traffic to less efficient ports, increasing the nation's overall transportation costs. A port-specific funding system could eliminate cross-subsidies among ports but may favor busy ports over underutilized ones. Smaller ports may struggle to cover dredging costs and could become economically unviable without a national pool of funds. However, smaller ports can reduce overland transport costs for nearby importers or exporters, promoting economic development. Smaller ports can reduce transport costs for importers and exporters, promoting economic development in the region. They can also serve as a harbor of refuge for vessels in distress and support maritime industry activities. Several bills in the 111th Congress aimed to repeal the tax on domestic waterborne non-bulk cargo and cargo imported from Canada through the Great Lakes to divert shipments from truck to water modes. Supporters argue that the tax and administrative burden discourage waterborne shippers, but critics question this claim. Truck shippers not located on waterways would still need truck transport to access waterborne transportation. H.R. 3447 and H.R. 4844 / S. 3213 propose changes to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) to increase funding for harbor maintenance. H.R. 2355 suggests increasing the tax rate to fund landside port improvements. Critics argue that these proposals could limit Congress' ability to adjust funding priorities annually. The Obama Administration requested funding for a pilot project to examine local user financing for maintenance dredging of channels with little commercial traffic. Congress reduced funding for the program from $1.5 million to $1.4 million, but an additional $1.5 million was requested for FY2011. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $4.6 billion for the USACE Civil Works Program, with $2.3 billion appropriated for operation. The USACE Civil Works Program received $4.6 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, with $2.3 billion allocated for operation and maintenance. A Corps Recovery Act spending plan indicates that $670 million in O&M work will be funded from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund."
