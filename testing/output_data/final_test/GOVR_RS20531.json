    "content": "According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, exposure to loud sounds is responsible for hearing impairment in 10 million of the nearly 30 million people with hearing loss in the United States. Another 30 million people are daily exposed to dangerous noise levels. Federal laws require the government to maintain noise standards, but these vary in stringency among sources. All standards aim to prevent human hearing loss. Responsibility for noise control standards is divided among federal agencies, with the EPA coordinating activities in the past. The EPA coordinated federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control, but funding was phased out in FY1983. Responsibility for regulating noise was shifted to state and local governments. Despite EPA's reduced role, past standards remain in effect, and other federal agencies enforce noise standards. Public interest in federal noise regulation remains strong, especially in communities with increasing noise sources due to residential development. The primary concern is whether existing standards are protective against hearing loss. The public's primary concern is whether noise standards should be tightened to protect quality of life in communities where sound levels may be perceived as annoying but not necessarily harmful to hearing. Sound is measured in decibels (dbA), with an increase of 10 dbA representing sounds perceived as twice as loud. Regulators agree that constant exposure to sound levels around 90 dbA and higher can lead to hearing loss. Unwanted sound above 65 dbA is generally considered intrusive and can impact quality of life. The Noise Control Act of 1972 and other federal laws require setting and enforcing noise standards for various activities and projects. Persistent exposure to intrusive sound above 65 dbA can have physiological effects, even if hearing ability is not impaired. Vibration-induced effects of low frequency sound are also a concern. Various federal laws and regulations govern noise requirements for park and recreational lands owned by the federal government. Standards focus on preventing hearing loss by limiting exposure to sounds of 90 dbA and higher, with some stricter standards aiming to protect quality of life at lower levels. Communities near transportation sources like airports and highways have raised concerns about noise exposure. Low frequency sound effects have also been questioned, but current US noise standards do not regulate it below a certain level. The United States does not regulate low frequency sound below the threshold of human hearing. The Aircraft Noise Abatement Act of 1968 requires the FAA to enforce noise standards for aircraft, following recommendations from ICAO. Aircraft are classified into four noise classes: Stage 1 being the loudest and Stage 4 the quietest. Stage 1 aircraft have been phased out, and Stage 2 aircraft over 75,000 pounds were phased out by 1999 as per the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 requires aircraft to meet specific noise standards for takeoffs, landings, and sidelines. Stage 4 standards, based on ICAO regulations, are stricter than Stage 3, with a 10 dbA reduction. These standards apply to newly manufactured jet airplanes and large transport category airplanes designed after January 1, 2006. The FAA finalized separate noise standards for propeller-driven, small airplanes in January 2006, applying to newly manufactured aircraft for airworthiness certification after February 3, 2006. Airports receiving federal funds must also meet noise control standards, ranging from 65 dbA to over 85 dbA depending on their location. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) was established in 1982 to provide federal assistance for airport improvements. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) was established to provide federal assistance for airport construction projects and noise mitigation grants. Airport operators must create noise exposure maps and mitigation programs to ensure noise levels are compatible with surrounding land uses. The Noise Control Act mandated EPA to develop noise standards for motor carriers in interstate commerce, enforced by the Federal Highway Administration. Commercial vehicles over 10,000 pounds must adhere to standards for highway travel and stationary operation, with exceptions for safety warning devices. Highway travel standards range from 81 to 93 dbA depending on speed and distance, similar to stationary operation standards. The Noise Control Act mandated EPA to establish noise standards for trains and railway stations engaged in interstate commerce. The standards vary depending on the type of locomotive and railway car, with limits on noise levels for stationary operation, idle speeds, and cruising speeds. Noise from railway cars must not exceed 88 dbA at speeds of 45 miles per hour. The Noise Control Act mandated EPA to establish noise standards for trains and railway stations engaged in interstate commerce. Noise limits for railway cars are set at 88 dbA at speeds of 45 mph or less and 93 dbA at speeds greater than 45 mph. Noise from car coupling activities at railway stations is limited to 92 dbA. Communities near railways can designate \"quiet zones\" to restrict locomotive horn sounds under certain conditions. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforces safety standards for workplace noise exposure. Workers should not be exposed to noise levels exceeding 90 dbA over 8 hours, with a maximum of 115 dbA for 15 minutes. Instantaneous exposure should not exceed 140 dbA. Employers must provide hearing protection if noise levels exceed these standards. The EPA proposed regulations requiring minors to wear hearing protection devices when working with wood processing machinery. Standards were established for motorcycles, mopeds, trucks over 10,000 pounds, and portable air compressors, with noise limits ranging from 70 to 86 dbA depending on the vehicle type and model year. These standards are separate from those for interstate motor carriers. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed standards for highway noise levels ranging from 52 to 75 dbA, required for federal funding approval. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) established noise limits of 65 dbA for housing projects in noise-exposed areas. Mitigation methods include noise walls and soundproof doors/windows. Methods to mitigate noise in housing include installing doors and windows designed to reduce sound transmission, using noise-blocking insulation in walls, and constructing thicker walls and floors in new buildings. Federal laws and regulations also allow agencies to regulate noise in park and recreational lands owned by the government, with specific standards set by the National Park Service for activities within National Parks. Restrictions on noise from aircraft operations near Grand Canyon National Park are enforced by the FAA. The federal government regulates noise in park and recreational lands, including Grand Canyon National Park. Restrictions are in place to balance the desires of recreational users for a quieter environment with the need to limit noise from certain activities. The EPA requires labels on noise reduction products, such as head gear and ear plugs, to indicate the reduction in sound levels in decibels. The federal government primarily regulates noise in transportation, workplace activities, certain equipment, and public lands. State and local governments control other sources of noise, such as commercial, industrial, and residential activities, with varying regulations. Some states delegate noise regulation to local governments. Regulations typically limit noise exposure by restricting activities to specific times, like construction noise only during business hours. There are concerns about differing state and local noise control, prompting suggestions to expand the federal role in regulating a wider range of sources. Some suggest expanding the federal role to regulate a wider range of noise sources uniformly across the country."
