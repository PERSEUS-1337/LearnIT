    "content": "The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an organization composed of 35 member countries and territories, aiming to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through anti-money laundering/combatting the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures. FATF conducts annual self-assessments and periodic mutual evaluations to assess member compliance with its guidelines. While it lacks enforcement capability, FATF can suspend non-compliant members, as seen with Turkey in 2013. The organization is based in Paris at the headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an independent organization with 35 member countries and territories, separate from the OECD. The presidency is a one-year appointment, currently held by Mr. Juan Manuel Vega-Serrano from Spain. The FATF's mandate was renewed through December 31, 2020, focusing on six key areas to combat financial crimes. The Forty Recommendations serve as global standards to protect the international financial system. The FATF identifies jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and issues public statements three times a year. They also identify jurisdictions with deficiencies but a commitment to address them. The FATF, through a plan developed with the FATF, focuses on financing of proliferation, mutual evaluations, and monitoring methods and trends of money laundering and terrorist financing. They updated standards to include targeted financial sanctions related to weapons of mass destruction and conduct peer reviews to assess member implementation of recommendations. Recent surveys have highlighted vulnerabilities in Hawalas, diamond trade, and nonbank settlement methods. The FATF focuses on the risks of the diamond trade to money laundering, corruption, and terrorist financing. Established in 1989, the FATF issued a set of 40 recommendations in 1990 to combat money laundering. After 9/11, they shifted focus to terrorist financing and issued eight special recommendations. The FATF expanded its mission to combat terrorist financing and issued a new set of guidelines and nine special recommendations. In 2005, the UN Security Council urged all member states to implement the FATF recommendations. Changes to the FATF mandate were adopted in 2004 and 2008, including the establishment of the International Cooperation Review Group to address jurisdictions with ineffective AML-CFT systems. The FATF revised its mandate in 2008 to intensify surveillance of criminal and terrorist financing risks, support national threat assessments, and enhance information sharing on risks and vulnerabilities. At the G-20 Summit in 2009, national leaders affirmed their commitment to combat tax havens, money laundering, corruption, terrorist financing, and improve transparency and exchange of information. The G-20 members urged the FATF to improve transparency and exchange of information for enforcing laws, issue a public list of high-risk jurisdictions, and update standards on wire transfers, beneficial ownership, and politically exposed persons. In 2010, the FATF published guidelines on insurance companies, cash transportation, tax amnesty laws, and vulnerabilities of free trade zones. At the Cannes 2011 Summit, G-20 leaders emphasized that corruption hinders economic growth and development. The G-20 leaders emphasized the importance of combating corruption for economic growth and development. They pledged to use countermeasures against jurisdictions that do not meet international standards in tax, prudential, and AML/CFT areas. Additionally, they supported the work of the FATF in identifying and engaging jurisdictions with AML/CFT deficiencies and updating standards for transparency in cross-border wires, beneficial ownership, and customer due diligence. The G-20 leaders support the FATF in identifying and monitoring high-risk jurisdictions with AML/CFT deficiencies, encouraging all countries to address risks related to legal opacity. The G-20 leaders have consistently supported the FATF in promoting financial transparency to safeguard the international financial system from corruption, tax evasion, terrorist financing, and money laundering. They directed the FATF to develop proposals to enhance the implementation of transparency standards, including beneficial ownership information exchange. In 2012, the FATF updated its Forty Recommendations to include addressing the financing of weapons of mass destruction. The FATF has expanded its surveillance to include financing of weapons of mass destruction. The new mandate aims to enhance global monitoring of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and improve standards in low-capacity countries. The revised recommendations address new threats, clarify existing obligations, and strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations. Additionally, the standards emphasize transparency in beneficial ownership information to combat tax evasion and promote corporate transparency. The FATF has adopted a risk-based approach to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, encouraging countries to assess and address these risks effectively. The new standards integrate measures to combat terrorist financing throughout the Recommendations, eliminating the need for supplementary Special Recommendations. Recommendations include criminalizing terrorist financing, implementing targeted financial sanctions, and addressing issues of tax transparency and corporate governance. The FATF has recommended targeted financial sanctions for terrorism and terrorist financing (Recommendation 6), proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (Recommendation 7), and preventing nonprofit organizations from financing terrorism (Recommendation 8). Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is also a concern, involving the exploitation of international trade to obscure the origins of illicit wealth by misrepresenting trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves misrepresenting the price, quantity, or quality of imports or exports to obscure illicit wealth origins. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploit the international financial system and cash movement to disguise their activities. They take advantage of the complexity of trade and finance systems to hide transactions through various means, including foreign exchange transactions, trade financing arrangements, and comingling of funds. Limited resources in customs agencies make it difficult to detect suspicious trade transactions. Money launderers also exploit vulnerabilities in letters of credit and financial arrangements for cross-border trade. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves obscuring illicit wealth origins through misrepresenting trade transactions. Despite the rapid growth and complexity of international trade, FATF's current recommendations do not specifically address TBML. Limited data on the extent of TBML exists due to jurisdictions not identifying it as a separate activity under money laundering. The FATF does not collect data on money laundering and TBML activities. They recommend developing specific training programs for detecting TBML, focusing on financial and trade data analysis. The FATF members adopted a new mandate in 2012, specifying functions such as identifying and analyzing money laundering and terrorist financing threats. The FATF focuses on combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and threats to the financial system by developing international standards, assessing members through peer reviews, and engaging with high-risk jurisdictions. The FATF aims to combat money laundering and terrorist financing by working with high-risk jurisdictions and addressing strategic deficiencies in national regimes. It promotes the full implementation of FATF recommendations globally and responds to new threats to the financial system as identified by international bodies like the United Nations Security Council and the G-20. The FATF assists jurisdictions in implementing financial provisions of UN Security Council resolutions on nonproliferation, engages with the private sector and civil society, and undertakes new tasks agreed by its Members within its mandate. The FATF released an updated strategy in February 2016 to increase efforts in addressing global terrorist threats. This strategy includes the framework, mechanisms, and actions in place, current threats faced, and key policy objectives. The FATF assesses member compliance through annual assessments and mutual evaluations. The FATF conducts mutual evaluations of its members to assess compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations. In February 2016, Iran and North Korea were identified as noncooperative countries with significant deficiencies. Iran's countermeasures were suspended for 12 months to monitor progress in implementing an Action Plan. The FATF remains concerned about terrorist financing issues. Iran urged FATF members to advise financial institutions to apply enhanced due diligence to business relationships with Iranian individuals or institutions. FATF identified nine countries with remaining deficiencies in addressing AML/CFT issues. Other countries improving their AML/CFT regimes but have strategic deficiencies include Albania, Angola, Argentina, Cuba, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, Tajikistan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. The FATF has taken steps to protect the international financial system from abuse, including identifying risky jurisdictions and updating reports on topics like asset recovery and trade-based money laundering. In February 2013, FATF announced its intention to suspend Turkey's membership due to failure to address terrorist financing adequately. The FATF encouraged Turkey to fully criminalize terrorist financing and establish a legal framework for identifying and freezing terrorist assets in line with FATF Recommendations. Despite improvements in Turkey's CFT regime, concerns remain over the framework for freezing terrorist assets. The FATF faces challenges in assessing member countries' compliance with special recommendations. The FATF issues recommendations that are periodically revised and require changes to laws for member countries to implement. Interpretative notes are provided to clarify the recommendations. In 2004, a revised version of the 40 recommendations was adopted, broadening the scope and detail. A new methodology was also adopted to track money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF adopted a new methodology to track money laundering and terrorist financing, applying to the 40 recommendations and eight special recommendations. Self-assessment exercises based on the previous method were discontinued in favor of follow-up reports to mutual evaluations. In 2005, revised standards for wire transfers were issued, requiring financial institutions to include originator details on all transfers and lowering the reporting threshold to $1,000. Two regional bodies, the Eurasian Group and the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force, were created. The FATF adopted new measures in 2007 to protect the international financial system from abuse, including urging Iran to strengthen its money-laundering controls. They also committed to producing a global threat assessment on criminal and terrorist financing. Since the global financial crisis, the FATF has taken steps to help governments prevent abuse of their financial systems by terrorist financing or money laundering. This includes issuing warnings to protect financial systems from risks associated with Iran's deficiencies in anti-money laundering and combating financial terrorism. The FATF completed an analysis on the impact of global financial crises on international cooperation in money laundering and terrorist financing. They issued best practices for member countries to freeze terrorist assets, arguing it denies funds to terrorists and deters financing of terrorism. They also reported on money laundering risks in the football sector. The FATF issued reports on money laundering risks under new payment methods, misuse of Trusts and Company Service Providers, organized piracy on the high seas, money laundering methods for corruption, trade-based money laundering, and barriers for recovering corrupt proceeds. The FATF published reports on illegal money flows related to money laundering, financial inclusion, vulnerabilities of legal professionals, and politically exposed persons. The FATF published a report on the vulnerability of politically exposed persons, who hold prominent public functions that can be exploited for money laundering, corruption, bribery, and terrorist financing. They also examined the risks of counterfeit currency destabilizing national economies and how it is used for illicit activities, including terrorist financing. Additionally, the FATF reported on the use of Hawala organizations for money laundering and financing terrorist activities. The FATF published reports on various methods used for money laundering and terrorist financing, including the use of legal and beneficial ownership information, gold, physical transportation of cash, and risk-based guidelines for evaluating financial services involving cash or other instruments. The FATF published reports on methods for money laundering and terrorist financing, including beneficial ownership information. They adopted a new methodology for country evaluations in 2013, focusing on compliance with FATF Recommendations. The FATF released a mutual evaluation report on the United States in December 2016, highlighting its unique role in international financial markets as the largest economy with the dollar as the global reserve currency. The report also mentioned the significant daily trading volume of foreign currencies in traditional foreign exchange markets. The over-the-counter foreign exchange derivatives market reported a daily turnover of $2.7 trillion in April 2016, with 88.0% of global foreign exchange turnover in U.S. dollars. The FATF highlighted the U.S.'s exposure to money laundering and terrorist financing risks due to its financial system's scope and openness. The FATF praised the U.S.'s efforts to combat these issues but recommended improvements in certain areas. The FATF recommended improvements for the United States in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Areas for improvement include gaps in the regulatory framework, lack of measures on designated nonfinancial businesses, and uncertainties in state-level anti-money laundering efforts. Main vulnerabilities were identified in cash, banking, money service businesses, casino, and securities sectors. The main terrorist financing threats and vulnerabilities include raising funds through criminal activity, individuals raising funds under the auspices of charitable giving but outside of any charitable organization, moving and placing funds through various financial institutions, and potential emerging threats from global terrorist activities. Fundamental improvements are needed to protect legal entities from money laundering and terrorist financing, ensure timely access to beneficial owner information, and apply preventive measures to all financial institutions and designated nonfinancial businesses. Effective supervision of all sectors is crucial, and technical gaps in the financial intelligence system need to be addressed. The IMF and World Bank participated in a pilot program between 2002 and 2003 to address these issues. The IMF and World Bank conducted a pilot program to assess national approaches to detecting money laundering and terrorist financing using FATF methodology. This program became a permanent part of their activities in 2004. The IMF has worked with the World Bank and FATF on over 70 AML/CFT assessments, providing technical assistance and research projects at an annual cost of $6 million. In 2009, the IMF initiated a donor-sponsored trust fund to strengthen AML/CFT regimes. The IMF is concerned about the impact of money laundering, terrorist financing, and related governance issues on the financial sector and economy. These activities can undermine financial institutions, discourage foreign investment, and have negative consequences on a country's financial stability and macroeconomic performance. IMF's efforts are driven by the recognition of the global impact of these activities on the financial integrity and stability of countries. The IMF recognizes the impact of money laundering, terrorist financing, and related crimes on the economy and financial sector stability. These activities can lead to loss of access to global financial markets, destabilizing capital flows, and financial sector fraud. Money laundering can also result in criminal proceeds flowing in and out of financial institutions, destabilizing economies due to differences in controls and regulations. Financial sector fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing can undermine a country's financial system and lead to capital outflows or loss of access to international markets. Problems with financial supervision and ownership by criminal elements can further exacerbate these issues, potentially causing economic paralysis. Tax fraud and money laundering can undermine the financial system by affecting government revenue, threatening banking stability, and distorting economic fundamentals. The IMF considers tax fraud as the most prevalent and significant crime for generating proceeds. Illegal activities outside the banking system can distort consumption, investment, savings, trade, exchange rates, and demand for money. Corruption at the national level can negatively impact fiscal balances, foreign investment, and growth, leading to adverse economic effects. Criminal activities like money laundering and terrorist financing can destabilize a country and have spillover effects on other nations. IMF's assessment of AML/CFT programs in 161 countries between 2004 and 2011 highlighted compliance issues. Compliance with FATF Recommendations among 161 countries surveyed by the IMF between 2004 and 2011 was 42.5%, with rare full compliance at 12.3%. Countries find it easier to adopt legislation and establish institutions than to ensure ongoing system functionality. Higher income countries with well-developed financial regulation frameworks have higher compliance levels, while emerging-market and low-income countries struggle due to poor understanding of AML/CFT best practices. Compliance is costly, requiring investment in institutions and international cooperation. The implementation of AML/CFT measures is hindered by poor understanding of best practices, inadequate training budgets, and lack of necessary preconditions. Country evaluations are resource-intensive, requiring extensive interviews and follow-up discussions. Assessments focus on both formal compliance and effective implementation of standards. The IMF and the World Bank propose a more flexible, targeted approach for assessing a country's compliance with AML/CFT standards. This approach will focus on areas of poor compliance, key areas of the standard, and specific risks faced by individual countries. Country assessments will be conducted with a risk-based approach to evaluate AML/CFT compliance. The FATF adopted a risk-based approach to assess compliance with AML/CFT standards, allowing for more targeted assessments. Legislation like the USA PATRIOT Act and P.L. 108-458 aimed to combat financial crimes and terrorism financing. The experience of the Financial Action Task Force highlights challenges in tracking terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force faces national hurdles in tracking terrorist financing, with domestic legal issues and established business practices hindering information sharing across borders. Member countries need to change laws, criminalize certain activities, and improve efforts to identify and track terrorist-related financial accounts to make progress. Money laundering and terrorist financing have economic implications that argue for greater control over these activities. According to the IMF, money laundering amounts to $600 billion to $1.6 trillion annually, with organized crime exploiting weak anti-money laundering systems. This can lead to macroeconomic consequences such as changes in money demand, risks to financial institutions, and increased volatility in capital flows and exchange rates."
