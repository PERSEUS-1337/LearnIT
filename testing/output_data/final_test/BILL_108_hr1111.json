    "content": "The Act titled \"Uniformed Services Divorce Equity Act of 2003\" allows for the proportionate division of retired pay for former spouses. Section 1408(c) of title 10, United States Code, is amended to allow for the division of disposable retired pay between a member and their spouse in the case of a court order issued after the enactment of the Uniformed Services Divorce Equity Act of 2003. The spouse or former spouse may be awarded 50 percent of the disposable retired pay if they were married throughout the member's creditable service. The former spouse may receive a share of the member's disposable retired pay based on the proportion of days of marriage during the member's creditable service. The spousal agreement for computation of retired pay must be in writing, signed, notarized, and unmodified by court order. SEC. 3. DURATION OF PAYMENT OF RETIRED PAY TO FORMER SPOUSES. Section 1408(c) of title 10, United States Code is amended to include provisions for the duration of payments of retired pay to former spouses based on the length of the marriage during which the member was qualifying for retired pay through military service. Payments will be made for a period equal to the number of months of the marriage during which the member was qualifying for retired pay, with exceptions for court-ordered payments that terminate upon the remarriage of the former spouse before the end of the specified period. Payments under paragraph (1) will terminate based on the length of the marriage during which the member qualified for retired pay through military service. If the marriage period is 240 months or more, payments will end according to court order terms or upon the death of the member or the spouse receiving the payments. Department of Defense payments can be terminated upon the member's written request if subject to subsection (c)(6)(A). Payments under paragraph (1) will terminate based on the length of the marriage during which the member qualified for retired pay through military service. If the marriage period is less than 240 months, payments can be terminated upon the member's written request or upon a court order modification. If former spouse payments have been made for less than the marriage period during which the member qualified for retired pay through military service, payments will continue as specified in the court order until the full marriage period is reached, but not before 24 months from the enactment of this Act. Payments for former spouses will terminate 24 months after the enactment of this Act if they have been made for a period equal to or greater than the marriage duration when the member qualified for retired pay through military service. The provisions of subsection (d)(4) of section 1408 of title 10, United States Code, apply to this subsection. The term \"court order\" is defined in this subsection. The term \"court order\" is defined in section 1408(a)(2) of title 10, United States Code. SEC. 4. Retired pay awarded based on retiree's length of service and pay grade at time of divorce. Section 1408(c) of title 10, United States Code, is amended to include provisions for calculating disposable retired pay for members who receive a final decree of divorce before receiving retired pay. The calculation is based on pay grade and length of service while married, with adjustments for increases in retired pay up to the effective date of retirement. SEC. 5 prohibits courts from ordering payments before retirement based on imputation of retired pay. SEC. 6 sets a limitation on the time for seeking division of retired pay. The amendment to Section 1408(c)(4) of title 10, United States Code requires the member's spouse or former spouse to obtain a court order for the treatment of disposable retired pay as property within two years of a final decree of divorce. This amendment applies to final decrees issued after the enactment of the Act. The Act prohibits retroactive payments of retired pay to a former spouse if more than two years have passed since the final decree of divorce. SEC. 7 amends subsection 1408(d)(4)(A) of title 10, US Code, regarding termination of liability for payments to former spouses. SEC. 8 prohibits the apportionment of disability pay. The amendment to subsection 1408(e)(4) of title 10, US Code, states that court cannot consider certain deductions from retired pay for disability compensation or chapter 61 retired pay as part of disposable retired pay for alimony payments to former spouses. Amendments to the Social Security Act limit compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities from being withheld for alimony payments. Amendments to the Social Security Act restrict withholding of veterans' compensation for alimony or child support, with limitations on the percentage that can be withheld. Effective June 25, 1981, these changes apply to court orders issued on or after that date, affecting retired pay starting from the enactment date. SEC. 9. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS. Gender-neutral references in Section 1408 of title 10, United States Code are amended to replace \"his\" with \"the member's\" and \"the member and his spouse\" with \"the member and the member's spouse\". The date of enactment reference is updated to \"after August 21, 1996\". The subsection caption is changed to \"Multiple Court Orders\"."
