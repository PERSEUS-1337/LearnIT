    "content": "The federal government, primarily Congress, has the exclusive power to establish rules for entry and removal of aliens in the United States. This authority is enforced through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which sets requirements for immigration, naturalization, and alien removal, as well as penalties for violations. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 establishes rules for entry and removal of aliens in the United States, with penalties for violations. It distinguishes between civil and criminal provisions, with criminal offenses for unauthorized entry and harboring unauthorized aliens, and civil penalties for entities hiring unauthorized workers. Alien removal processes are civil in nature. The Immigration and Nationality Act distinguishes between civil and criminal provisions for alien entry and removal in the United States. While unlawful presence is not a criminal offense, some conduct may be subject to both civil and criminal sanctions. Congressional authority allows states and localities to assist in enforcing federal immigration law. The notion of states possessing \"inherent\" authority to assist in enforcing federal immigration law has been discussed in federal courts and by the executive branch. However, state enforcement must always align with federal authority as established by the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. Congressional intent is crucial in determining if federal law preempts state or local actions. The extent of state and local law enforcement's authority to enforce federal immigration law without express authorization is a legal dispute. Several states have enacted measures to detect unlawfully present aliens, leading to ongoing litigation challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice. In a 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States, the Supreme Court limited states' ability to enforce federal immigration law without direct authorization or coordination with federal authorities. This report discusses state and local law enforcement's authority to assist in enforcing federal immigration law through investigation and arrest of violators. The report analyzes major cases on states' ability to assist in immigration enforcement, including the Supreme Court's ruling in Arizona v. United States. It briefly examines opinions by the Office of Legal Counsel within the Department of Justice. The report does not discuss legal issues raised by state and local measures to supplement federal immigration laws with additional penalties. In immigration enforcement, Congress can delegate authority to states to arrest, hold, and transport aliens into federal custody. Federal statutes authorize state and local law enforcement to engage in immigration enforcement activities, including arresting violators of federal immigration law. This does not cover provisions that involve sharing immigration status information between federal, state, and local authorities without direct authorization for state and local police to perform such actions. State and local authorities do not have direct authorization to perform immigration enforcement duties. Section 133 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 allows for delegation of immigration enforcement functions to state and local officers under INA Section 287(g). The Secretary of Homeland Security can enter into agreements with states or political subdivisions for qualified officers to perform immigration enforcement functions. State and local officers can perform specific immigration enforcement functions under 287(g) agreements, with federal supervision and training requirements. They are not considered federal employees except for specific purposes. State and local officers under 287(g) agreements are not federal employees but act under federal law for liability and immunity in civil actions. Written agreements are not required for officers to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, including communicating about immigration status and cooperating in identification and apprehension. The issue of state enforcement of federal immigration law revolves around the requirement for cooperation with federal authorities. The Supreme Court in Arizona v. United States clarified that state officers cannot unilaterally arrest removable aliens without federal approval. 287(g) agreements follow two models for enforcement. In the 287(g) program, two models are used for enforcement: the jail enforcement model and the task force model. The program allows designated officers to identify and process criminal aliens for removal by federal immigration authorities. In 2009, ICE renegotiated agreements with participating jurisdictions to enhance federal oversight, training, and communication within the program. The 287(g) program allows designated officers to identify and process criminal aliens for removal by federal immigration authorities. Agreements are in place with 64 law enforcement agencies in 24 states. Other programs like the Criminal Alien Program (CAP) and Secure Communities are also used to identify and detain criminal aliens. The Secure Communities program, implemented nationwide in 2013, shares information on persons arrested by state and local law enforcement to identify removable aliens. Fingerprints are sent to FBI's IAFIS and then to ICE's IDENT for matching. ICE personnel review databases to determine removability and issue detainers. Unlike 287(g) agreements, CAP and Secure Communities focus on identifying and detaining criminal aliens. The Secure Communities program, unlike 287(g) agreements, does not involve direct enforcement of federal immigration law by state or local law enforcement. It is implemented through an information-sharing arrangement between federal authorities. Additionally, federal immigration authorities sometimes have informal cooperative arrangements with state or local law enforcement officers, particularly along the borders. Section 372 of IIRIRA amended INA Section 103(a) to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to call upon state and local law enforcement for support in enforcing immigration laws. INA Section 103(a) allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to authorize state and local police to perform immigration enforcement functions in response to a mass influx of aliens. State and local officers may exercise the arrest powers of federal immigration officers in urgent circumstances. State and local officers can be authorized by the Secretary of Homeland Security to exercise civil or criminal arrest powers of federal immigration officers in cases of imminent mass influx of aliens. The DOJ implemented a rule in 2002 outlining the process for state and local law enforcement officers to assist in federal immigration functions during emergencies. The DOJ amended regulations in response to the need for flexibility during mass influx of aliens, allowing for abbreviation or waiver of training requirements for state and local law enforcement. Only one preemptory agreement was made with Florida in 1998 under this authority. The AEDPA authorizes state and local law enforcement to arrest unlawfully present criminal aliens who have violated INA Section 276. This allows for the arrest and detention of individuals who are illegally present in the US and have previously been convicted of a felony. Confirmation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service is required before such arrests can be made. The AEDPA allows state and local law enforcement to arrest criminal aliens for deportation. There is debate over whether there was a federal limitation on this before AEDPA. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted AEDPA Section 439 to only permit arrests for unlawful reentry with prior confirmation from federal immigration authorities. The Ninth Circuit interpreted AEDPA Section 439 to allow arrests for unlawful reentry with federal confirmation. The Tenth Circuit recognized pre-AEDPA federal law did not displace state authority in enforcing immigration laws. Congress authorized state and local police to enforce INA Section 274, criminalizing activities related to unauthorized aliens. State and local law enforcement officers are permitted to make arrests for violations of the federal alien smuggling statute, as they are considered \"officers whose duty it is to enforce criminal laws.\" The legislative history of INA Section 274 confirms this understanding, allowing state and local officials to enforce this provision. State and local law enforcement officers can enforce the federal alien smuggling statute, as they are authorized to do so. The power of state and local police to enforce federal immigration law without explicit authorization in federal statute has been a topic of debate, with the Supreme Court declining to definitively resolve the issue in Arizona v. United States. Recently, there has been a debate on whether state and local police can arrest individuals for criminal violations of federal immigration laws or civil violations that make them removable. Some states have passed laws allowing state police to arrest certain aliens for immigration status violations, but these measures have faced legal challenges on preemption grounds. The Supreme Court ruled that states are generally preempted from arresting or detaining aliens based on suspected removability under federal immigration law. Inquiries by state and local law enforcement regarding immigration status may occur during unrelated investigations, such as verifying a person's identity. These inquiries do not always constitute attempts to enforce federal immigration law and may not raise the same legal issues as situations where immigration status is the basis for a person's stop, detention, or arrest. The Supreme Court's ruling in Arizona v. United States limited states' ability to enforce federal immigration law without direct authorization or coordination with federal authorities. The Arizona law, known as S.B. 1070, was partially preempted by federal law, but allowed police to check immigration status during stops for state or local offenses. The Arizona law S.B. 1070 was challenged by the DOJ for conflicting with federal immigration law. A federal court injunction prevented enforcement of four provisions, upheld by the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court heard arguments on provisions related to enforcing federal immigration law and criminalizing certain conduct. The Arizona Court found that certain provisions of S.B. 1070 were preempted by federal law, including state criminal penalties for immigration-related conduct. However, there was a split decision on the permissibility of Arizona police enforcing federal immigration law. The Court ruled that police cannot arrest or detain based solely on immigration status violations, but can run immigration status checks with federal authorities if there is reasonable suspicion of a removable alien during a state or local offense stop. Section 6 of S.B. 1070, allowing warrantless arrest of aliens for specific criminal offenses, was upheld by a five-Justice majority. The Supreme Court found that Section 6 of S.B. 1070, which authorized warrantless arrest of aliens for certain criminal offenses, was facially preempted. Justice Kennedy stated that this provision would give Arizona police broader authority than federal immigration authorities, potentially leading to unnecessary harassment of aliens. The Court emphasized that states can only perform immigration functions in limited circumstances specified by federal law. The Supreme Court ruled that states are generally preempted from arresting and detaining individuals for suspected immigration violations, except under specific federal authorizations. Three Justices dissented, arguing that state and local police can assist in enforcing federal immigration law. The Arizona Court's discussion focused on the limited authority of states to enforce federal immigration law through arrests for immigration status violations. The Arizona Court found that most provisions of S.B. 1070 were preempted by federal law, but Section 2(b) was upheld, allowing Arizona police to investigate the immigration status of individuals suspected of being undocumented. The Arizona Court upheld Section 2(b) of S.B. 1070, allowing state police to investigate the immigration status of individuals suspected of being undocumented. The Court emphasized the sharing of immigration information among federal, state, and local authorities, and rejected a facial preemption challenge to the law. However, future challenges to this provision may still be possible. Following the Arizona ruling, lower courts have applied the Supreme Court's decision to state laws modeled after Arizona's S.B. 1070. In August 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit issued decisions concerning immigration enforcement measures adopted by Alabama and Georgia. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that a provision in the Georgia statute authorizing state police to run immigration status checks on persons stopped for state offenses was not facially preempted. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit recognized that state and local law enforcement agencies were generally preempted from making arrests for civil violations of immigration law without clear authorization under federal law. They also endorsed the idea that states could arrest individuals for criminal violations of federal immigration law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit issued rulings supporting state and local law enforcement's authority to investigate and arrest individuals for criminal or civil violations of federal immigration law. The validity of these rulings post the Supreme Court's Arizona ruling is uncertain, but they may still offer guidance to future courts and policymakers on immigration enforcement activities by states. The Ninth Circuit analyzed the authority of state and local police to enforce federal immigration law in cases like Gonzales v. City of Peoria and United States v. Arizona. In Gonzales, the court upheld a policy allowing local officers to arrest aliens for violating immigration laws, rejecting the argument that only the federal government can enforce these laws. The Gonzales court upheld the authority of state and local police to enforce federal immigration laws, stating that local police are not precluded from enforcing federal statutes. The court found that state and local enforcement of the criminal provisions of the INA did not conflict with federal interests, and there was no intent by Congress to preclude such enforcement. Therefore, local police officers may constitutionally stop or detain individuals for immigration violations, subject to state law. The Gonzales court upheld the authority of state and local police to enforce federal immigration laws, allowing them to stop or detain individuals for immigration violations based on reasonable suspicion or probable cause of criminal activity under the INA. The court distinguished between the preemptive effect of the INA's civil and criminal provisions, stating that the former constituted a pervasive regulatory scheme while the latter did not. The federal government does not occupy the field of criminal immigration enforcement, as stated by the Ninth Circuit in Arizona. The case involved a law in Arizona aimed at deterring the presence of aliens without lawful status. The DOJ and private entities filed lawsuits to prevent parts of the Arizona statute from taking effect. The federal government successfully blocked key provisions of the Arizona immigration law, with the Ninth Circuit affirming the lower court's decision. The panel ruled that state and local police lack authority to enforce certain immigration provisions and cannot mandate investigations into immigration status. The Ninth Circuit ruled that state and local police cannot enforce immigration laws or investigate immigration status, blocking key provisions of the Arizona immigration law. The court found that state involvement in immigration enforcement should occur under federal supervision, and that state and local cooperation should only be on an incidental basis when requested by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Arizona statute was deemed inconsistent with congressional intent. The Ninth Circuit ruled against Arizona's immigration law, stating that state and local police cannot enforce immigration laws or investigate immigration status. The court found that the law had a negative impact on foreign relations and could lead to multiple states creating their own immigration enforcement rules. One dissenting panel member argued that states should not be preempted from enforcing civil provisions of immigration law or investigating the status of deportable aliens. The dissent in the Ninth Circuit case argued that state and local police should be allowed to assist in enforcing both civil and criminal provisions of immigration law, even without a specific agreement. They also pointed to federal laws that support state and local participation in immigration enforcement activities. The majority ruling found that state and local police are generally preempted from making arrests for civil violations of immigration law. The Ninth Circuit ruling on S.B. 1070's immigration verification requirements was based on the \"mandatory\" nature of the requirements. The court's decision did not necessarily prevent Arizona law enforcement from verifying immigration status on a limited, case-by-case basis. The DOJ did not view discretionary verification attempts by state or local law enforcement as raising the same preemption concerns as Arizona's mandatory requirements. The Supreme Court later reviewed the Ninth Circuit's ruling. The Supreme Court reviewed the Ninth Circuit's ruling on S.B. 1070, agreeing on federal law's preemptive effect but disagreeing on the facial preemption of Arizona's mandatory immigration status requirements. In a previous case, federal immigration law was interpreted to generally prevent states from detaining individuals for civil immigration violations. This was exemplified in a case where extended detention led to the discovery of firearms and fraudulent documents during a traffic stop. The petitioner's extended detention was challenged in a criminal trial for unlawful possession of firearms and fraudulent documents. The circuit panel ruled that the extended detention could not be justified solely based on suspicion of being an unlawfully present alien. The panel referenced INA Section 287(g) and highlighted limitations on local law enforcement's enforcement of civil immigration violations. The court ruled that the petitioner's extended detention was unlawful as the local officer lacked reasonable suspicion of nonimmigration-related illegal activity. Evidence discovered during this detention was suppressed in subsequent criminal proceedings. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals supported the view that state and local officers could investigate and arrest individuals who violated the criminal or civil provisions of the INA. In the context of criminal investigations, state or local officers enforced civil provisions of federal immigration law by arresting or detaining individuals to determine their immigration status. In United States v. Salinas-Calderon (1984), a state trooper arrested individuals from Mexico found in a truck after a traffic stop, leading to a legal case. The state trooper detained individuals in a truck and charged the driver with unlawfully transporting unauthorized aliens. The court upheld the trooper's authority to inquire into immigration violations and make warrantless arrests based on probable cause. In 1999, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals considered state and local authority to enforce federal immigration laws in the case of United States v. Vasquez-Alvarez. An Oklahoma police officer arrested an individual suspected of drug trafficking after admitting to being an \"illegal alien.\" The alien had a felony record, had been deported before, and was charged with unlawfully reentering the US. Section 439 of AEDPA allows state and local law enforcement to arrest previously deported aliens convicted of criminal activity who unlawfully reenter the US. The Vasquez-Alvarez court rejected the defendant's argument that his arrest was unlawful because it did not follow the procedure outlined in AEDPA Section 439. The court cited previous cases stating that state law enforcement officers have the authority to investigate and arrest for violations of federal immigration laws. The court found that AEDPA Section 439 does not explicitly require confirmation of immigration status before an arrest is made. In the history of AEDPA Section 439, the court clarified that state and local police officers have the authority to enforce federal immigration law. The Tenth Circuit reaffirmed this in the case of United States v. Santana-Garcia, involving a traffic stop by a Utah state trooper. The court emphasized that AEDPA Section 439 simply provides an additional means for enforcing federal immigration law, alongside existing state law enforcement powers. The driver and passenger, traveling from Mexico to Colorado, admitted to being \"illegal\" when asked by a state trooper during a traffic stop. They consented to a search of their vehicle, leading to the discovery of illegal drugs. The court upheld the evidence, citing probable cause for arrest based on violations of state and federal law. The court upheld the state trooper's arrest of the defendants for suspected violations of federal immigration law based on their admission of unlawful status. The court recognized state officers' implicit authority to inquire into immigration violations and make warrantless arrests for any public offense committed in their presence, including federal law violations. The court did not distinguish between civil and criminal violations of immigration law in its decision. The Santana-Garcia court upheld a state trooper's arrest of defendants for suspected federal immigration law violations. State officers have the authority to inquire into immigration violations and make warrantless arrests for any public offense. The court did not differentiate between civil and criminal violations of immigration law. The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona likely prevents state and local police from independently enforcing federal immigration law for non-criminal violations. In recent decades, the executive branch has modified its views on state and local involvement in enforcing federal immigration law. The DOJ has urged state and local police not to detain or arrest individuals solely for being deportable aliens. In 1983, the DOJ encouraged greater involvement by state and local police in immigration law enforcement but emphasized federal authorities' responsibility for all civil immigration violations. In 1989, the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) stated that state and local law enforcement could enforce criminal offenses under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), but it was unclear if they could enforce non-criminal federal statutes. In 1996, the OLC clarified that state and local police lack legal authority to enforce the civil provisions of the INA. They can enforce federal statutes as long as it doesn't interfere with federal regulatory interests and complies with state law limitations. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) concluded in 2002 that state and local police can arrest aliens based on civil deportability, as federal law does not preempt their authority. States, like the federal government, are considered sovereign entities with the power to make arrests for violations of federal law. The 2002 OLC Opinion stated that state and local police can arrest individuals for federal violations, as federal law does not preempt their authority. The 2002 OLC Opinion concluded that state police lack the authority to arrest aliens based solely on civil deportability. Critics argue that the opinion is unsupported by judicial precedent or historical practice in immigration law. The 2002 OLC Opinion addressed state and local enforcement of civil immigration laws in limited circumstances, clarifying that states are not preempted from arresting individuals for federal immigration law violations. OLC opinions provide interpretive guidance for executive agencies but do not have the same weight as an act of Congress. The OLC opinions do not have the same weight as an act of Congress. Courts may consider executive agency opinion letters on legal matters to the extent that they \"have the power to persuade.\" It is uncertain if the OLC will revise its 2002 opinion in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Arizona, which limits state and local police discretion in enforcing immigration laws. Enforcement actions must be authorized by federal statute or approved by the Federal Government."
