    "content": "Social Security provides protection for insured workers and their eligible family members against income loss due to retirement, disability, or death. Monthly benefits are based on career-average earnings from jobs covered by Social Security. About 6% of workers are not covered, including state and local government employees with alternative retirement systems and federal employees under CSRS. Benefits aim to replace a percentage of a worker's income. Social Security benefits aim to replace a percentage of a worker's career-average earnings, with a higher replacement rate for low-paid workers. However, determining the appropriate replacement rate for split-career beneficiaries, who have both covered and noncovered employment, is challenging due to noncovered earnings being marked as zeros in Social Security records. Without adjusting for noncovered earnings, split-career beneficiaries would receive a higher replacement rate than those with the same earnings who spent their entire careers in covered employment. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) reduces Social Security benefits for certain retired or disabled workers with noncovered earnings and pension benefits. In December 2018, about 3% of all Social Security beneficiaries were affected by the WEP, with concerns that the current formula may overadjust benefits for some affected individuals. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) adjusts Social Security benefits for workers with noncovered earnings and pensions. Concerns have been raised about the current formula overadjusting benefits for some individuals. Legislative proposals aim to replace the WEP with a proportional formula to provide fairer benefits for all affected beneficiaries. The report discusses the proportional formula for Social Security benefits based on workers' earnings, years of noncovered earnings, and timing of those earnings. It also mentions the requirements for eligibility and the regular benefit formula's replacement factors. The PIA for workers eligible for benefits in 2020 is calculated based on factors like COLAs, early/ delayed retirement, and noncovered earnings. The WEP reduction is determined by years of coverage (YOCs), with a maximum benefit reduction of $480 for those with 20 or fewer YOCs. A worker with an AIME of $1,500 would receive an unadjusted monthly benefit of $1,036.80 compared to a WEP-reduced benefit of $556.80. The WEP reduction for Social Security benefits is based on years of coverage (YOCs), with a maximum reduction of $480 for those with 20 or fewer YOCs. The WEP factor increases by 5% for each YOC in excess of 20, reaching 90% for those with 30 or more YOCs. Workers need substantial covered earnings of $25,575 in 2020 to qualify for a YOC, with adjustments made annually. In December 2018, nearly 1.9 million beneficiaries were affected by the WEP, with 84% having 20 YOCs or fewer. Among the 1.9 million beneficiaries affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), 84% had 20 years of coverage or fewer, while 16% had 21-29 years. Approximately 18 million Social Security worker beneficiaries with noncovered earnings were exempt from the WEP in 2018, with 52% having 30 or more years of coverage. The WEP reduction is capped at one-half of the pension based on noncovered employment, and the Social Security benefit formula is progressive, providing more support for low-paid workers. The replacement rate for Social Security benefits varies based on the worker's earnings level, ranging from 83.3% for low earners to 29.4% for high earners. Noncovered earnings are treated as zeros in the Social Security records, resulting in lower average earnings. The formula may not differentiate between low earners due to low covered employment and those with noncovered employment. The WEP PIA addresses the issue of low replacement rates for workers with noncovered earnings by reducing the replacement rate for certain workers. For example, a low-scaled worker with noncovered earnings could receive a higher replacement rate than a worker with the same level of earnings who spent their entire career in covered employment. The WEP formula adjusts benefits for workers with noncovered earnings to ensure a fair replacement rate. However, it can result in a lower replacement rate for certain workers compared to those with covered employment throughout their careers. For example, a low-scaled worker with noncovered earnings may receive a replacement rate of 40.0%, significantly lower than a similar worker with covered employment. The WEP formula adjusts benefits for workers with noncovered earnings to ensure a fair replacement rate. A low-scaled worker may receive a 40.0% replacement rate, lower than those with covered employment. Higher lifetime earnings result in smaller benefit adjustments, with some beneficiaries experiencing underadjustment and receiving a higher replacement rate than similar workers with covered careers. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) adjusts Social Security benefits for workers with noncovered earnings to ensure a fair replacement rate. Workers with high lifetime earnings and some earnings not covered by Social Security may experience underadjustment, resulting in a higher replacement rate. The WEP formula applies the regular Social Security benefit formula to past earnings up to the taxable maximum from both covered and noncovered employment, then multiplies the resulting benefit by the ratio of career-average earnings from covered employment only to career-average earnings from both covered and noncovered employment. The proportional formula for calculating Social Security benefits adjusts for noncovered earnings to ensure a fair replacement rate. It calculates the benefit based on combined covered and noncovered earnings, but only the portion from covered earnings is paid out. This means beneficiaries with noncovered earnings receive the same replacement rate for covered earnings as those with only covered employment. The proportional formula for Social Security benefits provides a fair replacement rate, especially for workers with noncovered earnings. It offers a higher benefit than the current WEP for workers whose benefits are overadjusted, such as low- and medium-scaled workers. The proportional formula for Social Security benefits adjusts monthly benefit amounts based on workers' earnings scales. It increases benefits for some beneficiaries with noncovered employment while decreasing benefits for others, compared to the current WEP formula. The proportional formula for Social Security benefits adjusts monthly benefit amounts based on workers' earnings scales. It increases benefits for some beneficiaries with noncovered employment while decreasing benefits for others. If the proportional formula had applied in 2018, about 1.1 million beneficiaries affected by the current WEP would have received a higher benefit, while 0.5 million would have received a lower benefit. Additionally, 13.5 million beneficiaries exempt from the current WEP would have received a lower benefit. Beneficiaries exempt from the current WEP in 2018 would have received lower benefits under the proportional formula, especially those with 30 or more years of coverage and minimal noncovered employment. For example, a worker with 30 years of coverage and a noncovered pension would receive a higher Social Security benefit under the current WEP compared to the proportional formula. In 2018, roughly 9.4 million Social Security beneficiaries with noncovered earnings were exempt from the current WEP due to having 30 or more years of coverage. These beneficiaries would have minimal benefit reductions under the proportional formula. Another exemption applies to beneficiaries with noncovered earnings who do not receive a pension based on those earnings, potentially resulting in lower benefits under the proportional formula. In 2018, about 8.6 million Social Security beneficiaries with noncovered earnings and less than 30 years of coverage were exempt from the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) because they did not receive a pension based on those earnings. The WEP reduction is limited by a guarantee provision, ensuring that the reduction cannot exceed one-half of the noncovered pension benefit, resulting in small benefit reductions for those with short careers. The proportional formula may result in lower benefits for workers with short careers in noncovered employment compared to the current WEP. The reduction under the proportional formula is not limited like the WEP, leading to potentially lower benefits. Factors such as years of coverage (YOCs) and substantial earnings also impact the comparison between the two formulas. The number of YOCs determines the WEP replacement factor under current law, with workers needing substantial covered earnings to receive one YOC. YOCs are critical for determining the PIA under the WEP but not relevant for the proportional formula. Comparing monthly benefits based on YOCs shows differences in a medium-scaled worker's benefits under the current WEP PIA. The proportional formula may provide a higher benefit for a medium-scaled worker with fewer YOCs, but a lower benefit for those with more YOCs compared to the current WEP. This discrepancy is due to the current law exempting beneficiaries with 30 or more YOCs from the WEP, resulting in a higher benefit amount. The current-law WEP PIA underadjusts for workers with fewer YOCs, resulting in a higher benefit than the proportional formula. The difference in monthly benefits between the two formulas depends on earning levels, with the proportional PIA generally being higher for low- and medium-scaled workers with fewer YOCs. The WEP PIA is higher than the proportional PIA for workers with more YOCs. For high earners, the proportional PIA is generally lower than the WEP PIA. The difference in monthly benefits between the two formulas also depends on the timing of covered and noncovered employment. Security with lower WEP PIA, proportional PIA, and monthly benefit difference compared to medium-scaled workers. WEP and proportional PIA amounts depend on timing of noncovered employment and earning levels. Differences in benefit calculation, administration, and costs between current-law WEP and proportional formula. SSA's administration of WEP depends on type of noncovered employment for pension calculation. SSA relies on OPM for federal retirees' pension data but on self-reporting for state, local, and certain foreign pension retirees. SSA relies on beneficiaries to self-report noncovered pension amounts, leading to improper payments and computational errors related to overpayments. WEP accounted for 63% of reported overpayment errors from FY2013 to FY2017, totaling approximately $520 million annually. The proportional formula, based on covered and noncovered earnings reported on IRS Form W-2, would likely result in fewer errors compared to the current WEP formula. Annual Social Security statements provide benefit estimates to eligible workers. The Social Security Administration relies on self-reporting for noncovered pensions, leading to errors in benefit estimates. The WEP adjustment is not included in benefit statements, causing communication challenges for beneficiaries. The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 requires employers to disclose the WEP's effect to affected employees. The WEP adjustment is difficult to estimate without information on noncovered pensions, which is generally not available until the worker is entitled to such pension at a later date. Compared to the current WEP, the estimate of noncovered earnings used in the proportional formula and the corresponding proportional PIA would be relatively easier to include in the statement. In 1981, proposals were discussed to address Social Security benefits for individuals receiving pensions from noncovered employment as part of broad reform efforts to address Social Security's financing issues. The proportional formula for Social Security benefits was recommended in 1981 to address issues with noncovered pensions. This method would reduce the PIA based on combined earnings by the ratio of noncovered earnings to combined earnings. Other proposals suggested modifying the benefit formula for workers with pensions from noncovered work. The National Commission on Social Security Reform recommended eliminating the windfall portion of benefits for individuals with noncovered pensions in 1983. Two methods were suggested: the proportional formula based on covered and noncovered earnings, and the modified benefit formula with a 32% replacement factor. The SSA favored the proportional formula but noted it would require extensive data reporting and maintenance. The SSA recommended replacing the 90% replacement factor with a 40% factor to address the windfall issue in Social Security benefits. Congress incorporated this recommendation into the Social Security Amendments of 1983. Various bills have since been introduced to replace the current WEP formula with a proportional one. In 2004, bills were introduced to replace the current WEP formula with a proportional formula based on covered and noncovered earnings. The availability of sufficient earnings records since 1978 has alleviated concerns about administering the proportional formula. Legislative proposals address applying the formula to affected beneficiaries and how to handle those who would receive lower benefits. Some proposals aim to replace the current WEP formula with a proportional formula for certain beneficiaries and provide a monthly rebate to those affected. Different bills suggest applying the proportional formula to all beneficiaries after a specific date and including a no-benefit-cut provision. The bills introduced in the 116th Congress aim to provide rebates to beneficiaries affected by the current-law WEP and mandate a no-benefit-cut provision for future beneficiaries. Additionally, the bills include provisions to show noncovered earnings on Social Security statements and improve data exchanges between SSA and state/local governments for WEP administration."
