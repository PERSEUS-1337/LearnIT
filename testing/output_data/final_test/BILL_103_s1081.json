The term \"radioactive waste\" refers to material containing regulated radionuclides of negligible economic value, discharged with a dishonorable discharge or bad conduct discharge for former enlisted members. The Education and Training Program is outlined in Section 2. Establishment of an education and training program for qualified individuals in environmental engineering, sciences, and project management related to hazardous waste management and cleanup, to be developed in consultation with the Secretaries of Energy and Defense. The program aims to develop an academic program for individuals at higher education institutions, offering activities related to site remediation, characterization, and hazardous waste management. Specialized training for radioactive waste may also be included. The Administrator determines appropriate hazardous waste reduction activities, recycling, process and materials engineering, training for environmental positions, and environmental engineering for facility construction. The program established for personnel specialization includes educational activities in Earth sciences, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Environmental engineering, Statistics, Toxicology, Industrial hygiene, Health physics, and Environmental project management. The Administrator awards grants to hazardous substance research centers for academic programs in various fields, including environmental project management. Grants cover 100% of the costs, with funding split between the Environmental Protection Agency and other sources. Funding for hazardous substance research centers under this section is limited to 1 percent of the amounts allocated to the Environmental Protection Agency in fiscal year 1993 under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Funds for hazardous substance research centers must supplement, not replace, other EPA funding. 25% of the costs will come from the Defense Environmental Restoration Account in fiscal year 1993, with a limitation of 1% for the Defense Environmental Restoration Account. The Defense Environmental Restoration Account may be used to carry out this section. The Secretary of Defense shall transfer an amount to the Environmental Protection Agency for environmental cleanup. 25% of the cost will be funded from Department of Energy funds for fiscal year 1993. The Department of Energy may use up to 1 percent of funds for fiscal year 1993 for environmental cleanup. The Secretary of Energy will transfer the allocated amount to the Environmental Protection Agency. Hazardous substance research centers must use the funds as a supplement, not a replacement, to other Department of Energy funds."
