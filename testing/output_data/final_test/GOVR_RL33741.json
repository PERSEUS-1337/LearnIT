The Navy plans to shift procurement to the new frigate FFG(X) in FY2020, with funding requested for the first FFG(X). Congress is debating whether to procure additional LCSs in FY2020 and the impact on workloads at LCS shipyards if they are not involved in building FFG(X)s. The Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program has procured 35 LCSs through FY2019, with plans to shift procurement to the new frigate FFG(X) in FY2020. Congress's decisions on the LCS program will impact Navy capabilities, funding requirements, and the shipbuilding industrial base. The Navy organizes its surface combatants into large surface combatants (LSCs) and small surface combatants (SSCs), with SSCs being smaller, less capable, and less expensive to procure and operate than LSCs. The Navy aims to achieve and maintain a fleet of 355 ships, including 52 Small Surface Combatants (SSCs) by 2034. These SSCs can operate independently in lower-threat environments or in conjunction with other Navy ships in higher-threat environments. As of FY2018, the Navy had 27 battle force SSCs, including 16 LCSs and 11 mine warfare ships. The SSC force is projected to grow to 52 ships by FY2034, with a peak of 62 ships by FY2040. The Navy plans to reach a peak of 62 ships by FY2040, including 30 LCSs, 20 FFG[X]s, and 12 SSCs of a future design, before declining to 50 ships by FY2049. The LCS is a cost-effective surface combatant equipped with modular mission packages, including unmanned vehicles. The program began in 2001, with 35 LCSs procured through FY2019, primarily used for ASW, MCM, and SUW missions in contested littoral waters. The LCS program includes the development and procurement of ASW, MCM, and SUW modular mission packages for littoral waters. LCSs can also be used for peacetime engagement, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, maritime security, anti-piracy operations, support of special forces, and homeland defense. The program has faced controversy due to cost growth, design issues, survivability concerns, and questions about armament. The LCS program has faced concerns over armament, mission effectiveness, and modular mission package development. The Navy has made modifications to address these issues, with significant cost growth in the program coming to light around 2007. The program includes two different LCS designs, the LCS-1 or Freedom-class design developed by Lockheed, and the LCS-2 design. The Navy plans for FY2019 to be the final year of LCS procurement, with no additional LCSs requested in the FY2020 budget submission. The LCS program includes two designs, LCS-1 by Lockheed and LCS-2 by General Dynamics. LCS-1 has a steel hull while LCS-2 has an aluminum trimaran hull. Both designs have different combat systems but meet program requirements. LCS procurement is split between the two designs, with LCS-1 built by Lockheed in Wisconsin and LCS-2 built by Austal USA in Alabama. The LCS program includes two designs, LCS-1 by Lockheed and LCS-2 by General Dynamics. LCS-1 has a steel hull while LCS-2 has an aluminum trimaran hull. The LCS-2 design is built at the Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, AL, with Austal USA as the prime contractor. Ships 1 through 4 were procured with single-ship contracts, while the next 22 ships were procured under two 10-ship block buy contracts awarded in December 2010. The Navy plans to procure a total of 44 LCS mission packages, with 10 ASW, 24 MCM, and 10 SUW packages. The Navy's plan for the LCS program includes developing and deploying initial versions of mission packages, with a focus on improving testing and certification processes. They achieved Initial Operating Capability of the SUW Mission Package, reducing costs and completing operational tests ahead of schedule. The ASW Mission Package Pre-Production Test Article was also mentioned. The ASW Mission Package Pre-Production Test Article was delivered two months early in November 2018 and underwent end-to-end testing at the Navy's Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center in January 2019. The MCM Mission Package aviation systems have reached Initial Operating Capability and are being delivered to the Fleet. The modular nature of the Mission Packages allows the Navy to deliver capabilities while continuing to develop other systems. The LCS utilizes automation to reduce crew size, with an LCS carrying an MCM mission package and aviation detachment requiring about 88 sailors, compared to over 200 for a Navy frigate or over 300 for a Navy cruiser or destroyer. Most LCSs will operate with alternating dual crews to increase efficiency. The Navy aims for FY2019 to be the final year of LCS procurement, with no plans for additional purchases in FY2020. Saudi Arabia has bought four modified LCSs. The FY2020 budget includes $14 million for cost growth on previous LCS procurements and funding for LCS mission packages. The estimated combined procurement cost of three LCSs in FY2019 is $1,571.2 million. The Navy's procurement cost for three LCSs in FY2019 is $1,571.2 million. Congress debates whether to procure more LCSs in FY2020. Supporters argue it could hedge against delays in the FFG(X) program and help achieve small surface combatant force-level goals. Opponents suggest prior LCS procurement exceeds Navy's requirements, potentially impacting funding for other Navy programs. Another concern is future workloads and employment levels at the two LCS. The Navy is considering shifting procurement to a new frigate called the FFG(X) in FY2020. Five industry teams are competing for the FFG(X) program, with the Navy planning to announce the outcome in the fourth quarter of FY2020. This decision could impact future workloads and employment levels at the LCS shipyards. The FFG(X) program, covered in CRS Report R44972, may impact workloads and employment levels at LCS shipyards if a design proposed for construction at one of the LCS shipyards is chosen as the winner. If no design from an LCS shipyard is chosen, employment levels at both LCS shipyards and their supplier firms would be affected. Employment levels at LCS shipyards and their supplier firms would decline over time as backlogs of prior-year-funded LCSs are completed. One possible alternative for the FFG(X) program is to build FFG(X)s at two or three shipyards, including LCS shipyards, to accelerate production and reach the Navy's small surface combatant force-level goal sooner. The plan for the FFG(X) program aims to use competition to control prices, ensure quality, and complicate adversary defense planning. Critics argue it could weaken competition and increase funding requirements, potentially impacting other Navy or DOD programs. The Navy's plan to end LCS procurement in FY2019 and shift to FFG(X) procurement starting in FY2020 could potentially require offsetting reductions in other Navy or DOD programs. Another alternative could be to select a winner in the FFG(X) competition and begin procuring that design in FY2020, while shifting Navy shipbuilding work at LCS yards to the production of sections of larger Navy ships. This could involve converting one or both of the LCS yards into feeder yards. Under this option, one or both of the LCS yards could be converted into feeder yards to support the production of larger Navy ships. This could help maintain workloads and employment levels at the LCS yards, alleviate capacity constraints at other shipyards, and potentially achieve the Navy's 355-ship force-level objective sooner. The Navy is also considering retrofitting LCSs with additional weapons to enhance their capabilities, such as the Over the Horizon Weapon System (OTH WS) to increase lethality. The LCS program has faced concerns regarding survivability, lethality, technical risk, and test and evaluation issues. Reports from DOD's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), GAO, and DOD Inspector General have raised critical comments about various aspects of LCSs and their mission packages. The DOD Inspector General report on LCS MCM mission package systems criticized the Navy for declaring IOC before proving system effectiveness. Congressional action on FY2020 procurement funding for LCS program is summarized. The appendix provides details on LCS manning and deployment, including the 3-2-1 plan for crew rotation and forward deployment. The Navy implemented the 3-2-1 plan for crew rotation and forward deployment of LCS ships, aiming to maintain 50% of the force deployed at any given time. A new crewing and operating plan was announced for the first 28 LCSs, with the first four dedicated to testing mission packages and the remaining 24 divided into six divisions. The Navy's new crewing and operating plan for LCS ships involves dividing the 24 ships into six divisions, each consisting of four ships. These divisions will be homeported in Mayport, FL, and San Diego, CA, with each focusing on different mission areas. Each division will have one training ship and three ships operated by dual crews. The distinction between core crew and mission package crew will be eliminated. The Navy's new crewing and operating plan for LCS ships involves dividing the 24 ships into six divisions, each with specific mission packages. By FY2023, more than 50% of the ships will be forward stationed for 24 months at locations like Singapore, Sasebo, and Bahrain to reduce deployment cycle disruptions, improve crew training, and enhance ship ownership. The Navy's new plan for LCS ships involves dividing them into six divisions with specific mission packages. By FY2023, over 50% of the ships will be forward stationed for 24 months at locations like Singapore, Sasebo, and Bahrain to improve crew training and ship ownership. The Navy aims to achieve a percentage of LCSs in deployed status similar to the 3-2-1 plan, with the possibility of modifications as experience accumulates. The LCS program demonstrated that reducing acquisition cycle time is feasible, offering potential lessons for defense-acquisition policy makers. Supporters argue that under traditional Navy ship acquisition, it could take 10 to 11 years to develop and build a new frigate or corvette. In contrast, the LCS program saw LCS-1 enter service in 2008 and LCS-2 in 2010, achieving a significant reduction in acquisition cycle time despite incorporating major innovations. The LCS program demonstrated risks of reducing acquisition cycle time with design-construction concurrency, leading to cost growth, design issues, and construction-quality problems that embarrassed the Navy and reduced credibility in defending other acquisition programs. The challenges faced by the Navy in developing LCS operations, manning, training, maintenance, and logistics were exacerbated by the rapid acquisition strategy. Supporters argue that the costs of this strategy did not result in a significant reduction in acquisition cycle time, with the first fully equipped LCS entering service in late FY2014, almost 13 years after the program was announced. Pursuing a traditional approach could have avoided early problems and allowed for a fully equipped ship to enter service in 2011 or 2012. The LCS program validated the guideline that if an effort aims to be fast, cheap, and good, it will only succeed in two of these aspects. It also highlighted the risks of design-construction concurrency, but some argue that the LCS is too unique to offer relevant defense acquisition policy lessons for future Navy ships. The LCS program's cost growth and construction delays were not solely due to its rapid acquisition strategy, but also to factors like an incorrectly made reduction gear from a supplier firm, leading to a suboptimal construction sequence for LCS-1."
