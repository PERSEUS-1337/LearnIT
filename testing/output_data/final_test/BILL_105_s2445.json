    "content": "The Act titled \"Federalism Enforcement Act of 1998\" is cited as such. It includes findings related to federalism enforcement. Congress finds that federalism is rooted in limiting the national government's size and scope, with sovereign powers reserved to the States or the people as per the tenth amendment to the United States Constitution. The constitutional relationship between State and national governments is protected by the tenth amendment. The States have the freedom to define their moral, political, and legal character, possess authority to govern in most areas, encourage diversity in public policies, and can experiment with different approaches to public issues. The national government's actions should not exceed its enumerated powers under the Constitution, policies should support individuals and local entities in achieving their goals, states should have sovereignty in the absence of clear authority, and uncertainties about national government authority should be resolved against regulation. The national government should refrain from excessive regulation at the national level. SEC. 3. FEDERALISM POLICYMAKING CRITERIA. Executive departments and agencies must consider constitutional principles and consult with states before implementing federal actions that limit state policymaking discretion. Federal action should only be taken when constitutional authority is clear and there is a national scope problem. Federal action is justified for problems of national scope, not just common state issues. Constitutional authority is clear when it aligns with specific provisions, doesn't violate state authority, and isn't prohibited by the Constitution. National policies administered by states should be granted autonomy by the national government. The national government should grant States maximum administrative discretion. Federal oversight of State administration is not necessary. Executive departments and agencies should encourage States to develop policies, refrain from establishing national standards when possible, and consult with appropriate officials when national standards are required. The national government should grant States maximum administrative discretion and encourage them to develop policies. Consultation with appropriate officials is necessary when establishing national standards. SEC. 4. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PREEMPTION. The executive departments and agencies must consider specific criteria when developing policies with preemption implications, only preempting state law when there is clear evidence of Congress's intent or a direct conflict with federal authority under a statute. The issuance of preemptive regulations should only be done when expressly authorized by statute or when there is clear evidence of Congress's intent. Regulatory preemption of State law should be minimal to achieve statutory objectives. Departments or agencies should consult when foreseeing conflicts between State law and federally protected interests. When an executive department or agency plans to preempt State law through adjudication or rulemaking, they should consult with relevant State officials and provide notice and participation opportunities to affected States. SEC. 5 outlines special requirements for legislative proposals, emphasizing that executive departments and agencies should not submit legislation that directly regulates states, imposes unrelated conditions on federal grants, or preempts state law unless certain criteria are met. SEC. 6 addresses agency implementation. Each executive department and agency must appoint an official to ensure the implementation of the Act. The designated official is responsible for determining policies with federalism implications that require a federalism assessment. This assessment must be considered in all decisions related to the policy. The assessment should be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget and accompany any policy submissions as per Executive Order No. 12866. The designated official must certify that policies have been assessed according to the Act's principles, identify any inconsistencies, assess additional costs on States, and evaluate the impact on State sovereignty. Government agencies must ensure that their policies align with federalism principles outlined in the Act when submitting proposals to the Office of Management and Budget. They must also address any significant federalism concerns in regulatory submissions and legislative proposals."
