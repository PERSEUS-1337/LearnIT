    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hurricane Katrina Medicaid and SCHIP Relief Act of 2005\". It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act defines the term \"disaster period\" as the period following a major disaster declaration for Hurricane Katrina in a State, ending either when the declaration terminates or 6 months after it begins. The President can extend the disaster period for up to 6 months for a State. The term \"Katrina Survivor\" refers to individuals affected by Hurricane Katrina. During the week before a major disaster is declared, homeless individuals in the affected area will have their residence determined based on Social Security Act guidelines. Authority granted to provide medical assistance to Katrina survivors under Medicaid or Child Health Assistance Program. During the disaster period, States can offer medical assistance to Katrina Survivors under Medicaid or Child Health Assistance Program without the need for a State plan amendment. Assistance is provided without income, resources, residency, or categorical eligibility requirements, using streamlined procedures. The streamlined procedures for processing applications and determining eligibility for medical or child health assistance for Katrina Survivors include a common 1-page application form that requires the applicant to assign any rights under group health plans or third-party coverage for health care to the State. The streamlined procedures for processing applications and determining eligibility for medical or child health assistance for Katrina Survivors include self-attestation by the applicant, no requirement for documentation, issuance of an eligibility card valid during the disaster period, and presentation of the application to a Medicaid provider. If a facility participating in the State Medicaid or State child health plan, qualified to make presumptive eligibility determinations, identifies an applicant as a Katrina Survivor based on their application, the applicant will be deemed eligible for medical or child health assistance. During the disaster period, Katrina Survivors are granted continuous eligibility for medical assistance without the need for redetermination. They are treated as categorically needy individuals or targeted low-income children, with retroactive coverage under the State Medicaid or child health plan. The State shall reimburse providers for medically necessary items and services for Katrina Survivors not covered under their existing plan, without the need for redetermination during the disaster period. The State must verify the status of Katrina survivors enrolled in Medicaid or child health plans to ensure eligibility for medical assistance. Verification can be done through information obtained from the Social Security Administration or the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service or State Agency for a Katrina Survivor in a disaster-declared State is responsible for administering Medicaid or child health plans. Failure to make a good faith effort in verifying the status of Katrina survivors enrolled in these plans may result in disallowance of payments. If the Secretary determines that an individual enrolled as a Katrina Survivor is not eligible, all Federal payments made to the State for medical or child health assistance provided to that individual during the disaster period will be disallowed. Additionally, individuals who knowingly provide false information may be held liable for the full cost of medical assistance. The Secretary may exempt a State from recovering the full cost of medical assistance if it's not cost-effective. Any recovered amounts by a State must be returned to the Federal Government, with administrative costs reimbursed by the Federal Government. Exemption from error rate penalties for payments related to providing medical assistance to Katrina Survivors under section 4. SEC. 4 provides 100 percent federal financial assistance for medical and child health assistance, as well as administrative costs, to Katrina Survivors under State Medicaid and child health plans during the disaster period. SEC. 5 addresses the special needs of Katrina Survivors under the Medicare program. In the case of Katrina Survivors, the exclusion of the disaster relief period from computing Part B late enrollment penalty is specified. Additionally, provisions are made for extending the initial enrollment period and providing flexibility in documentation for low-income subsidies under Part D of the Social Security Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish documentation rules for Katrina Survivors considering the loss of documents due to Hurricane Katrina. SEC. 6. GENERAL PROVISIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will post a list of areas affected by Hurricane Katrina on the CMS website. States providing assistance based on this list will not be held liable if errors are later found. These provisions are designated as emergency requirements."
