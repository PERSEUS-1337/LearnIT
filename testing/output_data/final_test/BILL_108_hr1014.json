    "content": "The Act titled \"Gateway Communities Cooperation Act\" aims to improve the relationship between federal land managers and gateway communities to support compatible land management of federal and adjacent lands. Congress finds that many communities near Federal lands, including gateway communities, play a vital role in providing necessary services for visitors and employees of Federal land management agencies. Gateway communities play a crucial role in providing essential services for visitors to Federal lands, as Federal land management agencies are often unable to offer these services. These communities serve as entry points for visitors and offer services such as lodging, food, fuel, and emergency assistance. However, development in these communities can impact the management and protection of Federal lands. Federal land managers' decisions can have unintended consequences for both gateway communities and the Federal lands they serve. Gateway communities are impacted by decisions made by Federal land managers, but often lack technical planning skills. Interagency coordination is needed to align policies and actions for the benefit of both communities and Federal lands. Persuading gateway communities to make decisions that benefit both their communities and Federal lands is crucial. The purpose of this section is to require Federal land managers to communicate, coordinate, and cooperate with gateway communities to improve relationships, enhance facilities, and result in better local land use planning. Definitions for this section are also provided.
