    "content": "The United States is considering changes in its natural gas supply policy, with a focus on increasing LNG imports to meet rising demand. Various government agencies are working to streamline the approval process for new LNG terminals. Analysts predict LNG could make up 12% to 21% of total U.S. gas supply by 2025, up from 3% in 2005. Measures before Congress aim to boost domestic gas supply and LNG terminal construction. Congress is pushing for increased domestic gas supply and new LNG terminal construction through various incentives and proposals. This includes loan guarantees for an Alaska gas pipeline, incentives for domestic natural gas producers, and granting FERC authority to approve onshore LNG terminal siting applications. Additionally, there are proposals to lift federal restrictions on natural gas exploration and production on federal submerged lands and authorize the expansion of a natural gas transmission pipeline on federal lands in the Northeast. President Bush and Department of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman have expressed support for increasing LNG imports to meet the growing demand for natural gas. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan also highlighted the need to import cheaper LNG from other parts of the world due to production setbacks in the Gulf. Some in Congress have raised concerns about the implications of this policy. Some in Congress have questioned the implications of increasing LNG imports, citing concerns about safety, terrorism, and potential instability among foreign suppliers. Uncertainties exist regarding the integration of LNG infrastructure into North America's gas network and its impact on U.S. natural gas prices. The evolving global LNG market structure and changing political relationships among countries in the LNG trade are also factors to consider. The report will review the status of U.S. LNG imports and future demand in the international market. It will cover recent policy activities, private sector plans for infrastructure development, key considerations in market structure, and uncertainties. Natural gas is widely used in the U.S. for various applications, with consumption at 22 trillion cubic feet in 2005. The United States increased LNG imports due to constraints in domestic natural gas production. LNG is created by cooling natural gas to a liquid state for more efficient storage and transportation. LNG trade is expected to grow in the next 20 years to meet domestic demand and global expansion. The LNG infrastructure involves liquefaction plants at marine terminals for converting natural gas to LNG, which is then transported by tanker ships to import terminals in other countries. This process requires significant capital investments, with costs ranging from $2-$3 billion for a liquefaction plant, $500 million to $1 billion for an import terminal, and $150-$200 million for an LNG tanker. The LNG trade relies on long-term fuel purchase agreements to secure project financing for the entire supply chain. Over 90% of major LNG supply contracts have a term of 15 years or longer. While some flexibility has been incorporated, the supply-demand response is limited compared to other commodities markets. The United States has used LNG commercially since the 1940s to supplement domestic gas supplies during high demand periods. In the 1970s, LNG imports began to supplement domestic gas production in the United States with the construction of four import terminals. However, due to a drop in domestic gas prices, two terminals closed quickly. By 2002, U.S. LNG imports were only 0.17 Tcf, less than 1% of the natural gas supply. Since 2003, U.S. demand for LNG has been increasing due to plateauing North American gas production, leading to higher and more volatile gas prices. U.S. natural gas prices have become higher and more volatile, with gas prices at the wellhead rising to an average above $6.00/Mcf and a peak above $10.00/Mcf in 2005. International prices for LNG have fallen, making LNG more competitive with domestic natural gas. Forecasts project expansion in U.S. LNG imports over the next 20 years, with most expecting LNG to account for 12% to 21% of U.S. natural gas supplies by 2025. EIA's reference forecast projects U.S. LNG imports to reach 4.13Tcf in 2025. The EIA projects U.S. LNG imports to reach 4.13Tcf in 2025, accounting for approximately 16% of total U.S. gas supply. Global natural gas demand is expected to grow by 2.3% annually for the next 20 years, with significant increases in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Global gas demand growth is projected for Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and emerging Asia, with a significant portion to be met by new supplies of LNG. Most energy companies and analysts expect global LNG demand to triple by 2020, reaching 18 Tcf. LNG poses hazards due to its combustibility and extreme cold, as well as potential vulnerability to terrorist attacks. Assessing the risks from LNG releases remains controversial. The potential risk from LNG releases is controversial, with historical accidents raising public fears. Despite improvements in technology and safety standards, incidents still occur, such as a fire in an LNG processing facility in Algeria in 2004. Technical studies post-9/11 have been commissioned to reevaluate the safety hazards of LNG terminals and shipping. The Department of Energy commissioned a comprehensive LNG hazard study from Sandia National Laboratories in response to inconsistencies in previous studies regarding the safety hazards of LNG terminals and shipping. The Sandia report, released in December 2004, found that a worst-case LNG tanker fire could emit harmful thermal radiation up to 2,118 meters away. While the report stated that risks from accidental LNG spills are small and manageable, it also highlighted that intentional breaches could have more severe consequences. Proponents and opponents of new LNG terminals have used the Sandia findings to support their positions, leading to ongoing controversy. The federal government has been actively promoting increased LNG imports through new regulation, administrative actions, and legislation to foster LNG capital investment and streamline terminal approval. FERC regulations grant approval for new onshore LNG facilities and regulate prices for gas transmission. In December 2002, the FERC exempted LNG import terminals from rate regulation, allowing owners to set market-based rates and developers to secure proprietary terminal access. In February 2004, FERC streamlined the LNG siting approval process by coordinating with the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Transportation. They also established a new branch dedicated to LNG within the Office of Energy Projects. FERC approved the reactivation of two idled U.S. LNG terminals and expanded four existing import terminals between 1999 and 2005. Additionally, in September 2003, FERC approved the Cameron LNG project in Hackberry, LA, the first new LNG import terminal in the continental United States in over 25 years. In 2004, FERC approved the construction of two new gas pipelines connecting Florida to proposed LNG import terminals in the Bahamas. Offshore LNG terminal siting approval was transferred from FERC to MARAD and USCG in 2002, streamlining the permitting process and relaxing regulatory requirements. Offshore LNG terminals have a streamlined permitting process with proprietary access for owners, similar to onshore terminals. MARAD and USCG approved the first offshore LNG terminal in U.S. waters in 2003, with two more projects approved in 2004 and 2005 in the Gulf of Mexico. These terminals have a combined annual capacity of approximately 1.2 Tcf. As of January 2006, seven additional offshore terminal applications were under review. In January 2006, agencies were reviewing seven offshore terminal applications, two off the California coast, four in the Gulf of Mexico, and two off the coast of Massachusetts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 promoted new LNG terminal development by granting FERC authority to approve onshore LNG terminal siting applications and coordinating federal authorizations. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 grants FERC authority to set schedules for federal authorizations and regulations for LNG terminal siting applications. It also requires consultation with state agencies for safety considerations and development of emergency response plans by LNG terminal operators. Federal actions are increasing U.S. LNG imports, with concerns emerging about the process. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 grants FERC authority to set schedules for federal authorizations and regulations for LNG terminal siting applications, with concerns emerging about the infrastructure needs of LNG and the future structure of global LNG trade. To meet U.S. LNG imports of 4.13 Tcf in 2025, significant additions to North American import terminal capacity are required, including expansions at existing terminals and the need for six to ten new import terminals. LNG developers have proposed over 30 new terminals, raising questions about their location, integration into existing gas infrastructure, and security measures against accidents or terrorist attacks. Developers have proposed new LNG terminals near major consuming markets in California and the Northeast to avoid pipeline bottlenecks and minimize transportation costs. Federal agencies have approved the siting of ten new terminals in the Gulf of Mexico and two new Florida pipelines for proposed terminals in the Bahamas. Terminal siting has been controversial, with concerns about infrastructure needs and security measures against accidents or terrorist attacks. In 2003, LNG deliveries to Cove Point resumed, with natural gas priced below conventional supplies from the Gulf of Mexico. Federal agencies approved only one new LNG import terminal outside the Gulf, in Massachusetts, due to community concerns about safety and negative impacts. LNG developers faced opposition and withdrew terminal projects in California, Maine, North Carolina, Florida, and Mexico. In Maine, North Carolina, Florida, and Mexico, LNG terminal proposals faced opposition. In Alabama, community groups blocked onshore terminal proposals and called for offshore terminals. State and local agencies clashed with federal agencies over terminal siting approval. Delaware's environmental secretary blocked an LNG terminal development ruling it would violate Delaware's Coastal Zone Act. Massachusetts and Rhode Island filed petitions to reverse FERC's approval of an LNG terminal in Fall River, Massachusetts. FERC approved an LNG import terminal in Fall River, Massachusetts despite strong local opposition in the Northeast due to limited gas transmission infrastructure and higher gas prices compared to other regions. Maine consumers would have to pay 46% more for LNG delivered to Louisiana than to the Maine coast. The development of North America's gas pipeline network could be influenced by factors like weather, pipeline tariffs, and new natural gas supplies from Canada. Displacing proposed LNG terminals to the Gulf of Mexico could cost regional gas consumers billions in extra pipeline transportation charges. Siting new terminals in more receptive locations could bring them into service quickly, exert downward pressure on gas prices, and alleviate community safety concerns. LNG terminals may have a greater impact on pipeline infrastructure in the future if U.S. LNG growth projections are correct. The development of North America's gas pipeline network could be influenced by factors like weather, pipeline tariffs, and new natural gas supplies from Canada. Displacing proposed LNG terminals to the Gulf of Mexico could cost regional gas consumers billions in extra pipeline transportation charges. Siting new terminals in more receptive locations could bring them into service quickly, exert downward pressure on gas prices, and alleviate community safety concerns. LNG terminals may affect pipeline infrastructure in two ways, requiring new pipeline construction to handle large volumes of imported natural gas. Energy experts are concerned about the insufficient interstate pipeline capacity to handle future LNG supplies without substantial new additions. The availability of pipeline capacity directly affects transportation costs for LNG. Without sufficient infrastructure, gas may face oversupply issues similar to the electric utility industry. Some suggest building LNG terminals in gas-producing regions to avoid the need for extensive pipeline construction. Some argue that the most costly constraints in the gas pipeline network are at the ends of the pipelines, not the beginnings. Gas is expensive in Boston due to limited pipelines supplying the region, which wouldn't be solved by pumping more gas from the Gulf of Mexico. Adding LNG supplies to traditional producing regions may not be cheaper for consumers than building in-market terminals and increasing regional pipeline capacity. LNG terminals will also impact pipeline network flows. The construction of new LNG terminals in consuming regions may alter historical gas transportation patterns, potentially displacing traditional production and impacting existing pipelines. Analysts suggest that this could lead to reduced market leverage and lower cash flows for some pipelines. Predicting the long-term effects of these changes is complex but could have significant implications for current pipeline utilization and future infrastructure. The composition of LNG, primarily methane but also containing other hydrocarbon fuels like ethane, propane, and butane, can vary in heat content depending on its source. Higher heat content LNG from outside the US may pose challenges when imported due to potential damage to pipelines and equipment designed for lower heat content. Solutions include removing non-methane fuels, blending with domestic natural gas, or diluting with nitrogen. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is working with natural gas trade associations to establish national policies for natural gas interchangeability and quality. Safety and security requirements are imposed on LNG infrastructure to protect the public from accidents or terrorist attacks. Ongoing debate exists regarding the level of risk associated with LNG. The ongoing debate surrounds the risk and costs associated with LNG terminals and tanker shipments. Public agencies like the Coast Guard may bear the burden of mitigating these risks, especially in securing tanker shipments against terrorist attacks. The estimated public cost of security for an LNG delivery to the Everett terminal is around $80,000. The estimated cost of marine security for LNG shipments to terminals in the United States could range from $20,000 to $40,000 per shipment. With projected increases in LNG imports, the number of vessels calling at terminals is expected to rise significantly by 2025. The Coast Guard has allocated additional funding for maritime security to address the heightened security needs associated with the LNG trade. The public costs of LNG security may decrease as federally mandated security systems are implemented, but concerns remain about ambiguous accounting and potential diversion of resources. Supply bottlenecks at U.S. LNG terminals could impact regional gas availability, as seen during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 temporarily closed the Lake Charles LNG terminal, raising concerns about the vulnerability of LNG import terminals in the Gulf of Mexico region. Strikes at LNG terminals in Trinidad and disruptions in LNG shipments to the Everett terminal have previously impacted gas availability, with potential consequences for gas prices and regional power plants. The Gulf hurricanes, Trinidad strike, and September 11, 2001 events are seen as new supply risks for the United States as LNG becomes a larger part of gas supply. Some view these events as manageable uncertainties in fuel markets. The future sensitivity of U.S. natural gas markets to LNG terminal disruptions is uncertain and will depend on factors like supply diversity and pipeline development. Concerns may arise about the security of U.S. gas supply due to the concentration of gas supplies among major import facilities. Increasing LNG import capacity could lower gas prices, but the long-term effectiveness depends on global LNG supply, the development of an LNG spot market, and potential market concentration. The belief that LNG can act as a \"price-pressure safety valve\" assumes sufficient LNG availability to meet incremental gas demand. The global LNG production capacity is expected to exceed 24 Tcf annually by 2015, surpassing the projected global LNG demand of 18 Tcf in 2020. Tanker capacity is also keeping up with LNG demand growth, with 130 new ships on order to add to the current fleet of 191. The current tanker orders will increase the LNG fleet by 250% from 127 tankers in 2001 to 321 ships. There is sufficient interest to meet global LNG demand projections, but it is uncertain which export projects will be built. A robust spot market for LNG is seen as essential for U.S. importers to manage price and supply risks effectively. A spot market for LNG is crucial for importers to manage price and supply risks efficiently. It allows for short-term balancing of supply and demand, enhances price discovery and transparency, and supports financial trading and derivatives. Short-term contracts have been increasing, accounting for 11% of global LNG transactions in 2005, up from less than 2% in 1998. This market flexibility was evident when Suez Energy purchased a spot LNG cargo after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Suez Energy bought a spot LNG cargo to fulfill obligations to New England customers. South Korea purchased 36 spot LNG cargoes for winter heating demand. Indonesia sought four LNG cargoes due to production issues. Analysts predict a mix of long and short-term LNG contracts to stabilize trade. One major exporter expects 30% of global LNG capacity to trade on the spot market, tripling volumes by 2020. The potential growth in LNG demand could triple spot market volumes by 2020, but concerns remain about the role of market intermediaries. Independent marketers like Enron and Dynegy previously increased market liquidity but faced bankruptcy after scandals. Major banks are now exploring partnerships with LNG terminal companies to facilitate trading and marketing, though these partnerships are still in the early stages of development. The future LNG market may face concentration-related inefficiencies due to limited buyers and sellers, with a few exporting countries likely to dominate trade. Concerns exist about the emergence of a gas export cartel similar to OPEC. Some analysts speculate on the potential formation of a gas export cartel similar to OPEC, with major natural gas exporters establishing common policies and joint initiatives. Notably, there are efforts by Russian gas company Gazprom to collaborate with Iran in the gas sector. Some analysts speculate on the potential formation of a gas export cartel similar to OPEC, with major natural gas exporters establishing common policies and joint initiatives. The ability of a cartel to play a similar role in gas as OPEC does in oil is debatable, with OPEC controlling a larger share of global oil supply compared to gas. The market power of an association of LNG exporters remains uncertain due to the diversity of suppliers and competitive relationships. The diversity of LNG suppliers and the competitive relationship between LNG and traditional pipeline gas could impact the global LNG market differently than oil. The growth of United States demand may affect trading and political relationships with key market participants. By 2015, the United States could be the world's largest LNG importer, with South Korea, Spain, the UK, India, and China also importing significant quantities. Individual country energy policies may influence LNG price and availability worldwide. In 2001 and 2002, Japan's increased reliance on LNG led to a reduction in short-term deliveries to the United States. This also affected South Korea, which had to pay a premium for spot cargoes originally destined for Spain due to scarce LNG supplies in Asia. Spain attracted numerous LNG spot cargoes at the expense of the US in 2004-2005. In 2004-2005, Spain attracted numerous LNG spot cargoes, impacting US LNG terminals operating at less than 50% capacity in December, 2005. Trade with LNG exporters like Iran, Nigeria, and Venezuela may raise geopolitical concerns. The DOE is encouraging LNG supplies in South America and West Africa to mitigate risks of reliance on politically unstable regions. The DOE is working to attract investors to countries like Equatorial Guinea while addressing potential political instability through contract and regulatory reform. LNG trade can impact broader trading and political relationships, as seen in China's conflict with the US over securing LNG supplies from Iran. In 2004, Trinidad sought favorable trade terms with the US based on its status as a major LNG supplier. Russia's temporary withholding of natural gas supplies to Ukraine and the EU in 2006 caused concerns. The 2006 withholding of natural gas supplies by Russia to Ukraine and parts of the EU raised concerns about political linkages in the natural gas market. Several European countries are considering building new LNG terminals to reduce dependence on Russian gas. Russia's plans to become a major LNG exporter could complicate global gas trade, introducing new risks and opportunities. The option of developing LNG import capacity in the US appears economically attractive as domestic demand outpaces natural gas production. Currently, LNG supplies 3% of US natural gas, projected to rise to 21% by 2025. Challenges include ensuring production and import capacity, integrating LNG into the existing supply network, and securing infrastructure. Public opposition and new trading relationships also impact industry expansion. As practical challenges are addressed, the policy discussion shifts to long-term implications of increased LNG imports in the nation's energy supply. The United States may be heading towards dependency on LNG imports, similar to its reliance on foreign oil. This shift in energy policy could have significant economic impacts, especially in major consuming areas like California and the Northeast. Some analysts believe this dependency is inevitable, while others suggest alternatives such as increasing domestic gas production or conservation efforts. Congress is considering measures to incentivize domestic gas production and new LNG terminal construction, highlighting the ongoing debate over the relative merits of LNG and other energy sources. The policy questions surrounding LNG imports in the United States include the best long-term natural gas supply option, the federal government's role in LNG infrastructure development, and how Congress can manage risks in the global LNG trade within national energy policy. Decisions made now will impact the future of LNG, with varying perspectives on its attractiveness and risks."
