    "content": "The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides health coverage to uninsured low-income children and pregnant women above Medicaid eligibility levels. CHIP is jointly financed by the federal government and states, with states responsible for administration. Participation is voluntary, with states having flexibility to design their own programs within federal guidelines. Established in 1997 under the Balanced Budget Act, CHIP has seen additional funding and changes through other federal laws. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) has received increased funding and undergone significant changes through various federal laws. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) maintains the current CHIP structure until FY2019, while the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) repeals the sustainable growth rate mechanism. MACRA extends CHIP funding through FY2017 and maintains current provisions, including the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage. Congress will need to decide on the future of CHIP when federal funding expires after FY2017. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) works with Medicaid to provide health coverage to low-income children. It allows states to cover children with no health insurance in families with incomes above Medicaid eligibility levels. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded options for children in low-income families above CHIP eligibility levels. Congress's decisions on CHIP will impact health insurance options for targeted low-income children. The report describes CHIP's basic elements, eligibility, covered services, cost sharing, and financing. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) allows states to cover low-income children with no health insurance. States can design their CHIP programs in three ways: through Medicaid expansion, a separate CHIP program, or a combination approach. Federal funding is available to cover the costs of services for CHIP children. State choices in program design impact coverage for enrollees. Medicaid rules apply for CHIP Medicaid expansion, while Title XXI rules apply for separate CHIP programs. States may seek changes beyond these laws. As of July 1, 2014, states had various CHIP program designs, with some using Medicaid expansions, separate CHIP programs, or a combination approach. Most CHIP enrollees were covered through separate CHIP programs, while some were covered through CHIP Medicaid expansions. States can seek approval for program changes beyond federal laws through Section 1115 waivers. The CHIP program has seen a distribution of enrollees between CHIP Medicaid expansion and separate CHIP programs. Changes in eligibility rules under the ACA may alter this distribution. CHIP extends coverage to low-income children and pregnant women without health insurance, with income too high for Medicaid. States have broad discretion in setting their income eligibility standards for CHIP children, with eligibility varying across states. Children under age 19 make up the majority of CHIP program enrollment. States with a CHIP Medicaid expansion program must adhere to Medicaid eligibility rules. Medicaid eligibility rules from 1997 serve as the ceiling for CHIP children. States can cover CHIP children by expanding their Medicaid programs. States have the option to cover CHIP children under existing Medicaid eligibility pathways, reducing administrative burden. CHIP children are an optional eligibility group in Medicaid, with states determining enrollment criteria. Title XXI of the SSA allows states to use various factors in determining eligibility. Title XXI of the SSA allows states to consider factors like geography, age, income, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility when determining eligibility. States can set the upper income level for CHIP children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. Before January 1, 2014, states could use income disregards to expand eligibility. Two states and one California county used this method to expand their CHIP program. Beginning January 1, 2014, the ACA required the use of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) rules for determining eligibility for CHIP, Medicaid, and subsidized exchange coverage. This transition to MAGI eliminated the use of income disregards, limiting CHIP's upper income eligibility levels for states. States can now only rely on MAGI calculations to set income standards for CHIP coverage. Under the ACA, states can use CHIP funds to cover children losing Medicaid eligibility due to income disregards being eliminated. In 2014, 21 states transitioned stairstep children from CHIP to Medicaid to ensure uniform coverage up to 133% FPL. States were required to maintain CHIP income eligibility levels through September 30, 2019. The ACA required states to maintain income eligibility levels for CHIP through September 30, 2019. Statewide upper income eligibility thresholds for CHIP-funded child coverage vary significantly across states. Some states provide coverage above 301% FPL, with New York and California extending coverage above 400% FPL. Some states offer CHIP coverage above 400% FPL, including New York and California. Enrollment is concentrated among lower-income families despite eligibility for higher income levels. The ACA provides access to subsidized coverage through the exchange, but it may not always be affordable for low-income families. Variability exists in income eligibility levels for children and pregnant women in Medicaid, CHIP, and subsidized exchange coverage across states. States have flexibility in setting income eligibility levels for Medicaid and CHIP, leading to variability in coverage thresholds. For example, Alabama extends Medicaid eligibility to infants with income up to 141% FPL, while Iowa extends it to 240% FPL. In some areas, CHIP covers children up to 416% FPL, higher than subsidized exchange coverage. Not all children at specified income levels are eligible for all programs. The range of CHIP income eligibility varies among states, covering different segments of the income continuum. CHIP is available to uninsured children, while subsidized exchange coverage is not for those with minimum essential coverage. Medicaid eligibility for infants and pregnant women is set higher in some states. States use optional pathways to determine eligibility levels for these populations. CHIP provides health coverage to uninsured children, with Medicaid having higher enrollment numbers compared to CHIP. Some states have higher Medicaid income eligibility levels for infants and pregnant women. Nineteen states offer coverage to pregnant women under CHIP. States can extend CHIP coverage to pregnant women through the state plan option, Section 1115 waiver authority, or the unborn child pathway. Four states have extended coverage under these options. States can cover pregnant women through a state plan amendment under CHIPRA, with specific conditions to meet. The state plan option allows for CHIP coverage for pregnant women, including prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one. 15 states extend CHIP coverage to pregnant women ages 19 and older, regardless of immigration status, with coverage varying by state. See Figure B-4 for state-specific eligibility levels for unborn children, pregnant women, and newborns as of January 1, 2014. CHIP benefit coverage for eligible children depends on program design, including providing mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. States may enroll children in CHIP Medicaid expansions in Alternative Benefit Plans. Premium assistance for health insurance and benefits through Medicaid's EPSDT Program must be provided for CHIP children. The EPSDT program under CHIP covers health screenings, assessments, laboratory tests, immunizations, health education, and vision, dental, and hearing services. It sets Medicaid benefit coverage for children apart from other sources of health insurance by allowing coverage of all services listed in the Medicaid statute. States offering separate CHIP programs have more flexibility in designing their programs. States with separate CHIP programs have flexibility in designing their programs, including choosing from three benefit options: benchmark benefit package, benchmark-equivalent coverage, and benchmark- equivalent coverage with wrap-around benefits. States with separate CHIP programs have flexibility in designing their programs, including choosing from three benefit options: benchmark benefit package, benchmark-equivalent coverage, and Secretary-approved coverage. Benchmark-equivalent coverage must include basic benefits and at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services. Secretary-approved coverage is determined by HHS to provide appropriate coverage for uninsured children. The states have flexibility in designing their CHIP programs, with options for benefit packages. All states must cover essential services like emergency care, immunizations, and dental services. Mental health services must meet federal requirements. Abortion coverage is limited, and premium assistance for group health insurance can be offered under certain conditions. Some states offered premium assistance programs with federal matching funds in 2013. The study on benefit coverage in 42 CHIP programs across 38 states in 2013 showed variations in coverage types, ranging from Medicaid-modeled plans to more limited commercial market options. Basic medical services were generally covered without significant limitations, while restrictions were placed on services like therapy, orthodontia, hearing aids, and corrective lenses. Few services were not covered at all. In FY2013, managed care was the main delivery system for CHIP, with 84% of enrollees under managed care. Cost-sharing rules varied based on state programs, including premiums, deductibles, and copayments. Medicaid expansion children follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules. CHIP Medicaid expansion children may face service-related cost sharing for non-emergency care in an emergency room and for non-preferred prescription drugs. Medicaid waiver programs may also impose cost sharing. Premiums or enrollment fees for separate CHIP programs are income-dependent. Preventive services and pregnancy-related assistance are exempt from cost sharing for all CHIP families. Special rules apply to Indian children. Families with income under 150% FPL have capped premiums and may face service-related cost sharing. Families with income above 150% FPL may face cost sharing for CHIP programs, with a 5% annual family income limit on all types of cost sharing. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once the limit is reached. Only 2 states out of 42 CHIP programs impose cost sharing without limits. The study on 42 CHIP programs in 38 states found that most programs imposed some form of cost sharing in 2013. Premiums ranged from $10 to $33 per child, and service-related cost sharing varied. Some programs had cost-sharing limits lower than the 5% cap set by Title XXI. The federal government and states jointly finance CHIP. In FY2013, CHIP expenditures totaled $13.2 billion, with the federal government reimbursing states for about 70% of the costs. The federal share was $9.2 billion, and the state share was $4.0 billion. The federal government's share of CHIP expenditures is determined by the E-FMAP rate, which can range from 65% to 85%. The ACA included a provision to increase the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points. The ACA provision increased the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points for most CHIP expenditures from FY2016 through FY2019, raising the federal share significantly. States are expected to spend through their limited federal CHIP funding faster with the enhanced rate. CHIP federal funding includes national total appropriation amounts, state allotments, and expenditures. In FY2013, federal appropriation for CHIP was $17.4 billion, with state allotments totaling $8.9 billion and federal expenditures at $9.2 billion. The federal appropriation is the annual ceiling on federal CHIP spending, not factored into state allotments. States have two years to spend their allotment funds, with FY2013 federal expenditures consisting of funding from FY2012 and FY2013 state CHIP allotments. CHIPRA, ACA, and MACRA increased annual appropriation amounts for CHIP from FY2009 to FY2017. State allotments are federal funds allocated to cover state CHIP expenditures, with federal appropriations exceeding state allotments since FY2009. For FY2016 and FY2017, annual appropriation amounts were $19.3 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively. If federal appropriations are insufficient, state allotments would be reduced proportionally. CHIPRA established new allocation of federal CHIP funds among states based on actual use and projected need. Two formulas determine state allotments: even-year formula adjusts for inflation and population growth, odd-year formula adjusts previous year spending. The odd-year formula for state CHIP allotments is based on actual CHIP expenditures, while the even-year formula considers health care inflation and child population growth. State CHIP allotment funds are available for two years, leading to federal expenditures exceeding state allotments due to funding from previous years. Aggregate state CHIP allotment amounts may not align with annual federal appropriations. Since FY2009, state CHIP allotment amounts have consistently been lower than federal appropriations. States can use the allotment for CHIP benefit and administrative expenses, with limits on non-benefit spending. Shortfall funding sources include Child Enrollment Contingency Fund payments, redistribution funds, and Medicaid funds, with only one state and territory receiving funding since FY2009. Since FY2009, only Iowa has received Child Enrollment Contingency Fund payments, based on CHIP enrollment growth and per capita spending. Unused state CHIP allotment funds are redistributed to shortfall states after two years. Shortfall states are those unable to cover projected costs even after considering current year's allotment. To meet projected costs, states may receive funds from the current year's state allotment, unspent funds from the prior year, and Child Enrollment Contingency Fund payments. If funds are insufficient, states receive a proportionate share based on their shortfall. Only Puerto Rico has received redistribution funds since FY2009. States facing a shortfall after receiving funds may receive federal Medicaid matching funds. When Medicaid funds are used for CHIP, states receive the lower regular FMAP rate. Federal CHIP funding is capped at a lower regular FMAP rate, while federal Medicaid funding is open-ended with no cap. Some states use CHIP funds to finance Medicaid expenditures, such as covering costs for children above 133% FPL. States can also use CHIP funds for children aged 6 to 18 with annual income up to 133% FPL. Children aged 6 to 18 in families with annual income up to 133% FPL transitioned from CHIP to Medicaid in 2014 under the ACA. Congress faces a decision on the future of CHIP as federal funding is set to end after FY2017. The program was created in 1997 to provide affordable health coverage for low-income children. With the enactment of the ACA, the health insurance market has changed. If CHIP funding is exhausted, current coverage options may be limited. With the enactment of the ACA, CHIP-eligible children could potentially be eligible for Medicaid, subsidized coverage in health insurance exchanges, or their parent's employer-sponsored insurance. However, not all CHIP-eligible children would qualify for these programs, leading to concerns about some children becoming uninsured without CHIP. Providing child-specific safety net coverage is important as each low-income subsidy program plays a unique role in the healthcare system. Cost-sharing protections are greater for programs targeting lower-income families, and there are reservations about covering children in health insurance exchanges due to limited evidence on their effectiveness. Congress faces decisions regarding the future of CHIP funding, with options including extending funding for a few years or indefinitely. Policy changes could involve eligibility criteria and benefit coverage. The fate of CHIP will impact health coverage for children currently enrolled in the program. The extension of CHIP funding could lead to programmatic changes in eligibility and benefit coverage. States are expected to have federal CHIP spending in FY2018 using unspent funds from previous years. If funding runs out, states must adhere to MOE requirements through FY2019, maintaining income eligibility levels for CHIP children to receive Medicaid payments. The MOE impacts CHIP Medicaid expansion and separate CHIP programs differently. When federal CHIP funding is exhausted, CHIP-eligible children in Medicaid expansion programs switch to Medicaid, causing a decrease in federal share of expenditures. States with separate CHIP programs have exceptions to the MOE, such as enrolling children in health insurance exchanges or imposing waiting lists. If a state's CHIP allotment is insufficient, procedures must be established to screen children for Medicaid eligibility. If federal CHIP funding runs out, CHIP-eligible children in Medicaid expansion programs transition to Medicaid, reducing federal expenditure. States with separate CHIP programs can enroll children in health insurance exchanges or implement waiting lists. When a state's CHIP funding is inadequate, procedures must be set up to determine Medicaid eligibility for children. For those not eligible for Medicaid, states must establish processes to enroll them in qualified health plans certified by the HHS Secretary. If federal CHIP funding expires, states must establish procedures to enroll children in qualified health plans certified by the HHS Secretary. Not all CHIP children may be eligible for subsidized exchange coverage. Some CHIP enrollees would still have coverage through CHIP, Medicaid, health insurance exchanges, or employer-sponsored insurance. The coverage landscape is expected to change for some current CHIP enrollees if federal funding expires. In anticipation of the FY2015 congressional debate on the future of CHIP, the Urban Institute analyzed the potential impact of federal funding exhaustion on CHIP enrollees. If funding is not renewed, approximately two-thirds of separate CHIP-enrolled children would transition to their parent's employer-sponsored insurance or subsidized exchange coverage, while the remaining one-third would become uninsured. Approximately 1.1 million children, or 30.9%, would become uninsured in FY2016 if federal funding for CHIP is not renewed. Covered benefits vary among CHIP, Medicaid, exchange plans, and employer-sponsored insurance, with most plans including major medical benefits but dental benefits being offered separately in most exchanges. Medicaid and CHIP cover pediatric dental services. CHIP and Medicaid offer more comprehensive coverage compared to exchange plans. For instance, audiology exams and hearing aids are covered by all CHIP and Medicaid programs, while only a small percentage of exchange plans include these benefits. Out-of-pocket costs for CHIP are higher than Medicaid but lower than exchange or employer-sponsored insurance. Families with employer-sponsored insurance could face average annual premiums of $3,751 or 9.1% of family income. Moving CHIP children into Medicaid or health insurance exchanges would have different financing implications. Under CHIP and Medicaid, coverage is jointly financed by the federal government and states, while moving CHIP children into Medicaid would increase the state share of expenditures. On the other hand, moving CHIP children into health insurance exchanges would be solely funded by the federal government. Premiums for employer-sponsored insurance are shared by the employer and employees. See Appendix A for state-specific data on CHIP programs. The FY2015 CHIP E-FMAP rates and FY2013 CHIP expenditures are shown in Table A-2. State-by-state income eligibility levels for Medicaid, CHIP, and subsidized exchange coverage are provided for infants, children aged 1 to 5, children aged 6 to 18, and pregnant women in families with income under 400% of the federal poverty level. Eligibility levels vary by state and population, with subsidized exchange coverage available for children and pregnant women with incomes between 100% FPL and 400% FPL. Pregnant women with incomes between 100% FPL and 400% FPL without access to Medicaid or CHIP."
