    "content": "Biopower, which produces electricity from biomass feedstocks, accounted for 1.6% of total U.S. electricity generation in 2014. In comparison, fossil fuels and nuclear power made up 87% of electricity generation that year. Biopower also constituted nearly 12% of U.S. renewable electricity generation in 2014. One of its advantages is providing baseload power, unlike intermittent sources like wind and solar energy. Biopower production requires power storage or another power source like natural gas turbines. It is flexible in terms of fuel suppliers but faces challenges with infrastructure and feedstock supply. Legislative and regulatory uncertainty also surrounds incentives for biopower, with potential interest from Congress and the Obama Administration. Biopower may play a role in state-specific emissions goals like the Clean Power Plan. International demand for U.S. biomass feedstocks, such as wood pellets for biopower in the EU, could be part of future legislative discussions. Congress may debate the need for new national policies or incentives to promote biopower use. Considerations include feedstock availability, technological advancements, economic support, and environmental factors. Congressional action may focus on expanding or limiting legislative authorities for biopower. This report provides analyses on bioenergy, biopower, biomass feedstocks, federal incentives, and challenges to biopower production, along with legislative issues. Bioenergy is renewable energy derived from biomass, with forms including biopower, biothermal, and biofuels. Biomass is used to produce electricity, heat, fuels, and combined heat and power. Advantages of bioenergy include its renewable classification, but challenges exist as well. Bioenergy is a renewable energy source using biomass feedstocks, contributing to rural economic development and reducing GHG emissions. The carbon status of bioenergy is debated, but coproduct production is a benefit. Challenges include limited biomass availability and access, as well as the impact on soil and water nutrients from harvesting certain feedstocks. Biomass feedstock storage and transportation can be challenging and costly for energy generation. Bioenergy comes in three forms with varying levels of attention. All bioenergy forms share environmental and sustainability concerns in feedstock production, harvest, and transport. Biopower was the third-largest renewable energy source for electricity generation in 2014, after conventional hydroelectric power and wind. Congress and other stakeholders have tended to focus on one bioenergy form at a time, such as biofuels, leading to challenges in reaching a consensus on a comprehensive approach to bioenergy. In 2014, biomass was the third-largest source of electricity generation after hydroelectric power and wind. The top five states contributing to biomass generation were California, Florida, Georgia, Virginia, and Maine. The Energy Information Administration projects a 3.1% annual growth in biomass electricity generation through 2030, primarily from co-firing at coal plants and new dedicated biomass power plants. Woody biomass is the main feedstock for biopower, with wood and wood-derived fuels accounting for two-thirds of generation in 2014. Other sources include municipal solid wastes, landfill gas, and agricultural byproducts. Biopower, derived from biomass, was a significant source of electricity generation in 2014, with 723 trillion British thermal units consumed. It can provide firm power for baseload needs, running continuously throughout the day with consistent power supply. Biopower, originating from renewable biomass, is a consistent power source that can be replenished quickly. Biomass, such as organic matter from various sources like food crops and wood waste, can be converted into energy for biopower generation. Different regions can utilize native and cost-effective biomass feedstocks, like food waste in urban areas, to produce biopower. Woody biomass and wood waste are commonly used feedstocks, but biopower generation is flexible in terms of supply. The availability and cost of biomass feedstocks fluctuate, impacting biopower production. Some feedstocks, like yard waste, are cost-effective and easily integrated, while others, like forestry residues, have higher costs. Sustainable biomass supply is crucial to prevent resource depletion. Biopower biomass is not subject to the same constraints as liquid transportation fuels under federal statute. Feedstock diversity and availability pose challenges to biopower growth. Determining the amount of feedstock, market fluctuations, and weather variability affect estimates. It is uncertain if biomass supplies meet the needs of biomass-producing communities, the electricity industry, and the environmental community. Biopower infrastructure, including plant siting and power transmission, may present challenges. Proximity to feedstocks is crucial to reduce transportation costs in the current economic climate for biopower. Proximity to feedstocks is essential to reduce transportation costs for biopower. Retrofitting existing combustion plants for biopower production is possible, utilizing existing transmission infrastructure. Various biomass feedstock sources, including vegetation and organic wastes, can be used for electric power generation. Biomass feedstock is crucial for biopower plant feasibility studies, impacting storage, transport, and economic factors. Stakeholders debate ideal feedstocks and locations for growth. National-level data on biomass supply is lacking, and the potential use of genetically modified crops could affect biomass availability and environmental factors. Woody biomass is currently a significant feedstock for biopower production. Interest in wood pellets as a woody biomass feedstock for biopower has increased due to international demand. Wood pellets are small, compressed pieces of wood used for heating homes and generating electricity. Wood pellets are used for heating homes and producing electricity. Challenges include overheating and dust production. U.S. wood pellet production is increasing, with half being exported for large power facilities, driven by international policies like the EU's Renewable Energy Directive. The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive (RED) has led to increased use of wood pellets, with better data available for monitoring. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) reports that in 2013, domestic wood pellet production was 5.5 million metric tons, with half exported, mainly to the EU. There are concerns about the sustainability and environmental impact of the expanding wood pellet market, including potential ecosystem destruction and forest conversion. Some argue for stricter forestry sustainability measures, including certification programs and limits on whole tree harvesting, to protect forests and carbon storage. The wood pellet industry defends its practices, using low-grade wood and claiming limited use of whole trees. Discussions in the EU about sustainability criteria for biomass energy could impact the U.S. wood pellet sector, which relies on smaller forest owners for production. Forest owners provide wood for pellet production, facing challenges in tracking measures and meeting certification standards. Uncertainty exists regarding future market demands and policies, potentially leading to market tension between U.S. forest products and wood pellet sectors. Energy and environmental policy changes could impact wood pellet production and export. Biomass is converted to biopower through various processes like combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, and anaerobic digestion. Plants store energy through photosynthesis in cell walls, which can be released through combustion or anaerobic digestion. Different conversion technologies yield varying amounts and forms of energy. The supply of biomass feedstock is crucial for biopower generation, with the energy content determining the amount needed. The growing area required for biomass production depends on the feedstock's energy value. The area needed to produce biomass for biopower generation depends on the feedstock's energy value, power plant capacity, efficiency, and yield. Higher feedstock yield and plant efficiency require less growing area. Biopower plant size varies, with small-scale systems suitable for rural areas and large-scale systems for urban areas. The federal government and state initiatives support biopower through tax incentives, grants, and research programs. Some federal biopower initiatives support industry, including the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for biomass CHP, Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery System (MACRS) for depreciation deductions, and Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) for electricity generated using biomass. New Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) and Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) were introduced as part of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. CREBs offer lower interest rates for financing renewable energy projects, including biomass, through federal tax credits. QECBs allow state, tribal, and local governments to borrow money at attractive rates for energy conservation projects, including electricity production from renewable sources. Additionally, the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides loan guarantees and grants for agricultural producers and rural businesses to invest in renewable energy systems and energy efficiency improvements. The program offers funding for renewable energy systems, energy efficiency improvements, and renewable technologies. The DOE Section 1703 Loan Guarantee Program issues loan guarantees for projects with high technology risks. The USDA Repowering Assistance Biorefinery Program provides payments for eligible projects. The USDA Repowering Assistance Biorefinery Program provides payments to eligible biorefineries to install renewable biomass systems for heating and power, or to produce new energy from renewable biomass. The USDA High Energy Cost Grant Program assists power providers in lowering energy costs for families in areas with high per-household energy costs. The Tribal Energy Program Grant offers financial assistance, technical support, and education to tribes for renewable energy development. Biopower, including co-firing, waste-to-energy, and CHP, is viewed as beneficial yet complicated. It requires a high-level technical discussion to determine the best integration method for environmental and energy policies. Various stakeholders and evaluation prisms add complexity. Federal regulations play a significant role in shaping the biopower landscape. The EPA's CPP regulates CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, allowing states to use renewable energy like biopower to reach reduction goals by 2030. Congress and the executive branch support biopower in the U.S. energy portfolio, but disagreements remain on its specific role and importance. Biopower straddles agriculture, energy, and the environment. Supporters argue it benefits agricultural and forestry communities by adding value to their operations. Energy industry, technology, and renewable energy companies support biopower for its potential. Some companies and renewable energy companies support biopower for its potential in technology development and deployment, especially with federal financial assistance. Environmental standards for biomass cultivation and biopower plants could garner support from the environmental community if monitoring of land-use, biodiversity, and GHG emissions is in place. Legislative efforts are underway to further support the biopower industry, such as a proposed bioheat and biopower initiative and support for the carbon neutrality of forest biomass. Legislative efforts include the creation of a federal renewable electricity standard (RES) to promote renewable energy like biopower. Some concerns exist regarding the ability of agriculture and forestry sectors to meet biomass feedstock demands for biopower without impacting food, feed, and energy needs. Additional demand for feedstocks for biopower could potentially discourage production for other purposes. Some express unease about potential environmental impacts of producing feedstocks for biopower, fearing monoculture cultivation patterns that harm biodiversity. Concerns also arise about the feasibility and cost of scaling up biopower compared to fossil fuels. Opposition stems from doubts about biopower as a long-term electricity solution. No legislative efforts to reduce federal support for biopower in the 114th Congress have been introduced, but various organizations have expressed opposition. Several environmental organizations oppose biopower, specifically the use of forest biomass for production. The American Lung Association does not support biomass combustion for electricity production due to potential toxic feedstocks. Despite challenges, biopower production may increase to meet state renewable portfolio standards. Biopower has advantages over other renewables like wind and solar, functioning as baseload power plants using multiple biomass feedstocks. However, challenges include transportation costs, limited biomass availability for other uses, and environmental concerns about carbon neutrality. Regulatory uncertainty and the lack of a federal mandate hinder biopower development, although 29 states have renewable portfolio standards including biopower. Most biopower technologies are not yet commercially viable. Congress has enacted provisions authorizing research and development projects for biopower by the Departments of Energy and Agriculture. Several public laws contain these provisions to support biopower commercial applications. The public laws discussed illustrate the evolution of bioenergy policy in chronological order, starting from the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 to the Agricultural Act of 2014. These laws introduced the concept of biopower to reduce dependence on imported petroleum and natural gas. The Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 aimed to reduce dependence on imported petroleum and natural gas by encouraging the use of biomass as a liquid fuel. It defined alternate fuel sources, including biomass, for power plants to operate on, but did not explicitly support biopower research and development. The Energy Security Act of 1980 defines biomass energy as energy derived from sources such as biomass, municipal, industrial or agricultural wastes, wood, and renewable and geothermal energy sources. It also outlines criteria for biomass energy projects, including small-scale projects with limited production capacities. The Energy Security Act of 1980 defines biomass energy as energy derived from sources such as biomass, municipal, industrial or agricultural wastes, wood, and renewable and geothermal energy sources. It requires collaboration between DOE and USDA for biomass energy production and financial assistance. The Act also establishes demonstration biomass energy facilities to showcase advanced technology and authorizes grants for research on economical means of producing biomass energy. The Energy Security Act of 1980 defines biomass energy from various sources like biomass, municipal, industrial, or agricultural wastes, wood, and renewable energy. It mandates collaboration between DOE and USDA for biomass energy production and financial aid. The Act also sets up demonstration biomass energy facilities to display advanced technology and grants for research on cost-effective biomass energy production. In contrast, from 1981-1999, Congress did not focus much on biopower due to stable energy prices. Some biopower technologies had low success rates due to poor design, while others like biomass co-firing were economically uncompetitive. Since 2000, various biopower provisions have been included in public laws. Since 2000, public laws have included biopower provisions focusing on biomass for liquid transportation fuel. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 established a partnership between USDA and DOE for RD&D on biobased industrial products, including fuels, chemicals, building materials, and electric power produced from biomass. DOE and USDA have authority for biopower RD&D and commercial application support, with recent resources mainly directed towards liquid fuels for transportation. The Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 established a partnership between USDA and DOE for research on biobased industrial products, including fuels, chemicals, building materials, and electric power produced from biomass. It also created the Biomass Research and Development Board and Technical Advisory Committee to coordinate research activities and provide technical guidance. The Act authorizes the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy to award grants and financial assistance for eligible entities involved in biopower research and development. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-171) authorizes grants for research on biobased industrial products, including advanced biomass gasification, turbine technology, fuel cell technology, and other technologies determined by the Secretaries in consultation with the Biomass Research and Development Board. The Act also allows grants for the development and construction of biorefineries to demonstrate projects. The development and construction costs of biorefineries are supported by various acts such as the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which authorize grants for projects converting biomass into fuels, chemicals, and electricity. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes the Secretary of Energy to conduct RD&D and commercial application programs for bioenergy, including biopower energy systems and integrated biorefineries from biomass technologies for electricity or heat. It also amends the definition of biobased products to include industrial products produced from biomass and modifies the Biomass Research and Development Technical Advisory Committee. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorizes RD&D programs for bioenergy and biopower systems from biomass. It also amends the Biomass Research and Development Initiative to focus on research, development, and demonstration of biobased fuels and products. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 prioritize biobased fuels and products, authorizing significant funding for renewable energy research and development programs. The Energy Act of 2008 reauthorizes the Sun Grant program to enhance bioenergy research, defines biorefinery and biobased products, establishes the Biomass Crop Assistance Program for biomass conversion facilities. The Agricultural Act of 2014 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a competitive R&D program to encourage the use of forest biomass for energy. It defines a community wood energy system as an energy system that primarily services public facilities owned or operated by state or local governments, using woody biomass as the primary fuel. The Community Wood Energy Program provides grants for communities to plan and install wood energy systems in public buildings. The 2014 Farm Bill reauthorizes the Sun Grant program for bioenergy research and development, while also authorizing research on biomass sorghum for renewable biofuel and electricity."
