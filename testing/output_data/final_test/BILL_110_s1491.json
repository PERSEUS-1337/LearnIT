    "content": "The \"Ethanol Education and Expansion Act of 2007\" may be cited as the E-85 Fuel Expansion Program. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 is amended to include a new subsection (d) for the E-85 Fuel Program, defining E-85 fuel as a blend of gasoline with at least 85 percent ethanol content. The Secretary is authorized to make grants under this program. The Secretary will make grants to producer-based ventures for E-85 fuel infrastructure installation and provide subgrants to rural area retailers for E-85 fuel marketing. The Development Act allows for grants to install E-85 fuel infrastructure, covering 20% of total costs determined by the Secretary. The grant amount is reduced if the business receives other federal funding for the same purpose. The Secretary shall provide assistance for E-85 fuel infrastructure, with a limitation that not more than 70 percent of total costs shall be covered by the Federal Government and State and local governments. The Secretary will use $20,000,000 from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to carry out this subsection. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to include the E-85 Fuel Education Program under Title IX. The program aims to educate about E-85 fuel. The E-85 Fuel Education Program, defined as a blend of gasoline with at least 85% ethanol content, aims to educate governmental and private entities about the benefits of E-85 fuel use through competitive grants to eligible nonprofit organizations or higher education institutions. The E-85 Fuel Education Program provides competitive grants to eligible organizations for education on E-85 fuel production, use, and distribution. The Secretary of Energy must be consulted, and $1,000,000 is allocated annually from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds for fiscal years 2008 through 2012."
