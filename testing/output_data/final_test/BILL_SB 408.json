    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 2516.5 of the Business and Professions Code in California defines a \"midwife assistant\" as a person who provides basic administrative and technical support services for a licensed midwife or nurse-midwife. The assistant must be at least 18 years old, have completed a minimum amount of training hours, and receive a certificate of completion from a training institution or instructor. This new section outlines the requirements and responsibilities for midwife assistants in the state. \"Midwife technical supportive services include routine medical tasks performed by a midwife assistant under supervision. Specific authorization is required for procedures, either through a written order or standing order placed in the patient's medical record. Supervision by a licensed midwife or nurse-midwife is necessary during the performance of these procedures.\" A midwife assistant can administer medication by injections and perform technical support services under the supervision of a licensed midwife or certified nurse-midwife. This can be done in a licensed clinic with specific authorization. The midwife assistant can perform venipuncture or skin puncture to withdraw blood with authorization and supervision. They can also administer medications orally, topically, or rectally under the direction of a licensed midwife or certified nurse-midwife. The midwife assistant can assist in immediate newborn care, placement of fetal heart tone device, specimen collection, patient mobility, daily living activities, and provide patient information under the supervision of a licensed midwife or certified nurse-midwife. Perform basic patient data collection and simple laboratory tests in a medical office setting. Provide additional midwife technical support services as per board regulations. No authorization for licensure of midwife assistants or administration of local anesthetic agents by them. Board cannot adopt regulations violating prohibitions on diagnosis or treatment. The section prohibits midwife assistants from performing certain clinical tests and from being employed for inpatient care in general acute care hospitals. No reimbursement is required for this act as it creates new regulations related to crimes or infractions."
