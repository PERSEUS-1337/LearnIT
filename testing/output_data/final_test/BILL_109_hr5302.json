Congress believes States should find offsets for these suspensions to maintain transportation infrastructure investment. The \"Summer Relief for Motorists Act of 2006\" allows States to temporarily suspend their motor fuel excise taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, and kerosene by reducing the tax rates to zero cents per gallon during the suspension period. The \"Summer Relief for Motorists Act of 2006\" allows States to temporarily suspend motor fuel excise taxes on diesel fuel and kerosene for diesel-powered highway vehicles from May 29, 2006, to September 4, 2006. This suspension period also includes the maintenance of trust fund deposits to offset the reduction in revenues to the Treasury. The amendment made by this subsection shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. If tax has been imposed on highway motor fuel before the tax suspension date and is held by a dealer for sale, a credit or refund will be given to the taxpayer for the excess tax paid. No credit or refund shall be allowed unless a claim is filed with the Secretary of the Treasury within 6 months after the tax suspension date, based on a request from the dealer within 3 months after the tax suspension date. Exception for fuel held in retail stocks. The subsection provides an exception for highway motor fuel in retail stocks, disallowing credit or refund for such fuel. Definitions for terms like \"tax suspension date,\" \"highway motor fuel,\" \"dealer,\" and \"held by a dealer\" are also clarified. (c) Floor Stocks Tax.--\n    Imposes a tax on highway motor fuel held on the tax restoration date, calculated based on the difference between the tax on that date and any previously paid tax on the fuel. The person holding the fuel is liable for the tax. The tax imposed by paragraph (1) must be paid as prescribed by the Secretary on or before the 45th day after the tax restoration date. Definitions include the tax restoration date as the first day after the suspension period and highway motor fuel as any liquid taxable under section 4081 of the Internal Revenue Code. During the suspension period under section 4081(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the tax on highway motor fuel is exempt for certain uses, and the Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Treasury or delegate. Highway motor fuel held for specific exempt uses may qualify for a tax credit or refund. No tax on highway motor fuel held on the tax restoration date if amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons. Exempt fuel not included in calculation if tax is exempt by reason of paragraph (4). The tax on highway motor fuel is not imposed if the amount does not exceed 2,000 gallons and if the tax is exempt by reason of paragraph (4), controlled groups are treated as 1 person. The term \"controlled group\" is defined as per subsection (a) of section 1563 of the Code, with \"more than 50 percent\" replacing \"at least 80 percent\" for this purpose. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar to those of subparagraph (A) apply to a group of nonincorporated persons under common control if one or more of them is not a corporation. All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable to taxes imposed by section 4081 of the Code also apply to floor stock taxes imposed by paragraph (1) to the same extent. SEC. 4. SUSPENSION OF ROYALTY RELIEF. The Secretary of the Interior is required to suspend relief from royalty payments for oil and gas production on Federal land if certain price thresholds are met. The Secretary determines suspension of royalty relief based on price thresholds exceeding $4.48 per 1,000 cubic feet. Average prices are calculated using recent data. Existing leases for oil and gas production on Federal land may be renegotiated to ensure royalties are paid. Beginning one year after the enactment of this Act, a lessee must renegotiate a lease for oil or natural gas production on Federal land to be eligible for a new lease. Failure to renegotiate will result in ineligibility for new leases or transfers of existing leases. After one year of the Act's enactment, a lessee must renegotiate their lease for oil or natural gas production on Federal land to qualify for a new lease. Failure to renegotiate will make them ineligible for new leases or transfers of existing leases. Additionally, the lessee can enter into an agreement with the Secretary to modify the lease terms as per paragraph (1)."
