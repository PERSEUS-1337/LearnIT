    "content": "The Act titled \"Recycling Research and Development Act of 1993\" introduces cooperative recycling programs for plastics, automobiles, and appliances under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. This includes a new section on plastics recycling. The Recycling Research and Development Act of 1993 mandates the Secretary of Energy to prepare a comprehensive plastics recycling plan within 180 days of enactment. This plan includes research priorities, ongoing research efforts in industry, academia, and the Federal Government, and strategies for a cooperative program. The Secretary of Energy is required to establish a cooperative program with the plastics industry and other relevant experts for ongoing research projects and materials research. The Secretary must update and submit the plan to Congress whenever significant changes are proposed. The Secretary of Energy collaborates with the plastics industry and experts to conduct recycling technology research projects. This includes identifying plastic products not currently recycled in significant amounts and developing better methods for collecting and reclaiming plastics. The Secretary of Energy collaborates with the plastics industry and experts to conduct recycling technology research projects. This includes developing new commercial applications for recycled plastic products, improving plastic materials recovery and recycling technologies, and conserving energy in recycled plastic products. Requests for proposals must be submitted within 240 days of the enactment. The Secretary of Energy will solicit proposals within 240 days to conduct recycling projects and may provide financial assistance up to 50% of the total project cost. Additionally, 3 national recycling research centers will be established at higher education institutions to conduct research projects. The Secretary of Energy will provide grants to recycling research centers for up to 50% of project funds, with the rest from non-Federal sources. The Secretary will also support evaluations, tests, and consultations with other agencies for these projects. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1994 through 1999 is authorized to the Secretary of Energy for carrying out this section. \"Authorization of $10,000,000 for each fiscal year 1994-1999 for automobile recycling.\" The Secretary of Energy will prepare a comprehensive automobile recycling plan within 180 days of the enactment of the Recycling Research and Development Act of 1993. The plan will include research priorities, ongoing research efforts in industry, academia, and the Federal Government, and strategies for a cooperative program. The Secretary of Energy will establish a cooperative program with the automobile and automobile parts manufacturing industry, the automobile dismantling and recycling industry, and the plastics industry. The Secretary will update and submit plans to Congress whenever significant changes are proposed. The Secretary of Energy will collaborate with the automobile industry, dismantling and recycling industry, and plastics industry for joint automobile recycling technology research projects. Research will focus on overcoming obstacles to increased recycling of automobile components, incorporating recyclability into new car design, developing easily recyclable plastics, and creating new technologies for recycling automotive shredder residue. The Secretary of Energy will collaborate with industries for joint automobile recycling technology research projects, focusing on developing environmentally preferable substitutes for toxic materials, reviewing recycling efforts, and promoting public awareness. Requests for proposals will be solicited to conduct these projects, with federal funding provided. The Secretary of Energy may provide financial assistance for projects, not exceeding 50% of the total cost. Evaluations, tests, and demonstrations will be conducted to support these projects. Consultation with relevant agencies will be done. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1999 for carrying out this section. \"SEC. 4013. APPLIANCE RECYCLING.\" The Secretary of Energy must develop a comprehensive appliance recycling plan within 180 days of the enactment of the Recycling Research and Development Act of 1993. This plan will include research priorities, ongoing research efforts in industry, academia, and the Federal Government, and strategies for a cooperative program. The Secretary of Energy is required to develop a comprehensive appliance recycling plan within 180 days of the enactment of the Recycling Research and Development Act of 1993. This plan includes milestones for major Federal activities, coordination of ongoing research projects, and a cooperative program with various industries. The Secretary must update and submit the plan to Congress whenever significant changes are proposed. The Recycling Research and Development Act of 1993 mandates collaboration between the government and industries like steel and plastics to research appliance recycling technology. This includes identifying barriers to increased recycling, designing new appliances for recyclability, engineering recyclable plastics, and developing technologies for recycling appliance shredder residue. The Recycling Research and Development Act of 1993 requires collaboration between the government and industries to research appliance recycling technology, including developing environmentally preferable substitutes for toxic materials, reviewing recycling efforts, and promoting public awareness. The Secretary of Energy will solicit proposals for projects within 240 days of the Act's enactment and may provide federal funding for these projects. The Secretary of Energy may provide financial assistance for projects under this section, not exceeding 50% of the total project cost. Evaluations, tests, and consultations with relevant agencies are required. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1999. The table of contents for subtitle D of the Act is amended to include new items. Subtitle D of the Act is amended to include new items related to plastics, automobile, and appliance recycling."
