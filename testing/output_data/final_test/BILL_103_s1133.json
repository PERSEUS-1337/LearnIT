Congress finds that there has been substantial work done to identify infants and children born to young single mothers, substance abusing women, homeless women, economically disadvantaged women, and women in unstable domestic situations. Nonresidential programs have been established to improve outcomes for children born to poor, young, and single mothers, with many being successful. Residential programs have been proven effective and are crucial for special cases. The Act aims to establish residential programs for high-risk pregnant women and their children, including those who are addicted, homeless, in unstable domestic situations, or have other high-risk characteristics. The programs provide comprehensive support services to protect and enhance the first year of life for the children and offer the mothers a proper maternal beginning.

RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN. Amends the Public Health Service Act to establish residential programs for pregnant women and children, offering comprehensive support services. The Secretary will establish a program to award grants to eligible entities for residential programs serving high-risk pregnant women and children. Eligible entities include nonprofit shelters, public housing organizations, housing organizations serving section 8 tenants, drug treatment centers, domestic violence shelters, and other health centers. To be eligible for a grant under this program, an entity must submit an application to the Secretary, demonstrating how services will be provided, ensuring access to suitable housing, and outlining a plan for service provision. The applicant must provide a plan for housing program participants and their children after program completion, demonstrate linkages with community agencies for housing assistance, and establish relationships with child welfare agencies for advocacy and prevention services. A residential program established under this section shall provide comprehensive medical services, including assessment, screening, and referrals to appropriate medical providers for the mother and her family. The residential program offers pediatric medical services, referrals to community providers, addiction and substance abuse education, counseling, and psychological services for mothers and children. Other services include parenting and job counseling. The services provided include assessment, parenting skills counseling, access to schools, daycare, job counseling, re-entry counseling, referrals to other services, and follow-up services. To be eligible for services in a residential program, a pregnant woman must receive referrals, transitional housing assistance, transportation services, and case management including assistance with various applications. Pregnant women from special populations, including those addicted to substances, homeless, in unstable domestic situations, or with high-risk characteristics, can be admitted into a residential program until their infant reaches 1 year of age. All children of eligible pregnant women can also be admitted and stay in the program as long as their mother does. The program allows pregnant women from special populations to stay in suitable housing facilities with their children until the child turns 1 year old. Grants cannot be used for property rehabilitation, construction, or purchase, but can be used for residential support services. A peer review panel is established by the Secretary for initial reviews. The program allows pregnant women from special populations to stay in housing facilities with their children until the child turns 1 year old. A peer review panel is established to review applications for assistance under this section. $250,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1994 to 1996."
