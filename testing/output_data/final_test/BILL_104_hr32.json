    "content": "REQUIRED NOTICES TO CHARITABLE BENEFICIARIES OF CHARITABLE REMAINDER TRUSTS. (a) General Rule.--Every receiver must provide a written notice to charitable organizations when claiming a charitable contribution deduction for a transfer of a remainder interest in property described in section 2055(e)(2)(A). The notice must be given before the due date for filing a Federal estate tax return. The charitable deduction requires the estate to notify the charitable beneficiary with specific details including the decedent's information, fiduciaries' details, charitable beneficiary's information, trust governing instrument, and the interest the charitable organization may receive. Additionally, a description of the estate's financial condition may be required. The fiduciary of a charitable remainder trust must provide the charitable beneficiary with a copy of the tax return and other necessary information as required by the IRS. If this information is already provided for a specific trust taxable year, it does not need to be furnished again. The fiduciary must provide necessary tax information to the charitable beneficiary for each trust taxable year, with the beneficiary agreeing to reimburse for costs. Penalties may apply. Penalties may apply for failure to file required returns or furnish notices under specific sections related to trusts and exempt organizations. Penalties of $10 per day may be imposed on organizations, trusts, or fiduciaries for failure to file required returns or furnish notices under specific sections, not exceeding $5,000 in total. The Secretary may also impose penalties on managers for non-compliance. The Secretary may demand filing of returns or notices from organizations, trusts, or fiduciaries. Failure to comply may result in a $10 per day penalty, not exceeding $5,000 in total. Managers may also face penalties for non-compliance. The amendment to section 6034A will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1994. For decedents passing away after January 6, 1995, the amendment to section 6036 will be effective. Executors of estates claiming a charitable deduction for transfer of property must provide a notice to the charitable beneficiary by December 31, 1996."
