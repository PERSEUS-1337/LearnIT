    "content": "The \"National Icebreaker Fund Act of 2015\" establishes the National Icebreaker Fund under Chapter 15 of title 14, United States Code, as a new subchapter III for icebreakers. The \"National Icebreaker Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States for the construction, alteration, and renovation of icebreakers for the Coast Guard. The Fund can also be used for leasing or chartering icebreakers for the Coast Guard, with amounts authorized by law. The National Icebreaker Fund includes funds for construction, alteration, and renovation of icebreakers, as well as receipts from icebreaker disposition, unobligated transferred funds, contributions, and appropriations for icebreaker projects from the Department of Defense or other Federal agencies. The National Icebreaker Fund allows for the construction, alteration, and renovation of icebreakers, as well as the lease or charter of icebreakers. The Secretary can transfer unobligated funds to the Fund at the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, the Secretary can accept contributions of money, property, or assistance for icebreaking support in the polar regions. The National Icebreaker Fund allows for the construction, alteration, and renovation of icebreakers in the United States, with limitations on using funds for foreign vessels. The National Icebreaker Fund allows for the lease, charter, construction, alteration, or renovation of icebreakers in the Arctic for various purposes such as search and rescue, maritime safety, drug interdiction, and environmental response. The Fund can also be used for additional capabilities necessary for national defense missions. The National Icebreaker Fund allows for missions related to research and resupply in the Antarctic. Appropriated funds deposited in the Fund expire after 10 years. Budget requests for the Fund must separately identify amounts for icebreaker construction, alteration, renovation, lease, or charter. The Fund is defined as the National Icebreaker Fund established by subsection (a). The term 'icebreaker' is defined as an icebreaker capable of operations in polar regions. A clerical amendment is made to the analysis by striking items relating to subchapter III and inserting new ones. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of the National Science Foundation, shall establish an agreement with nations operating facilities in Antarctica to provide icebreaking services by constructing, leasing, renovating, operating, or maintaining an icebreaker capable of performing such services."
