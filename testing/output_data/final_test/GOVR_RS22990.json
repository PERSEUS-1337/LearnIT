    "content": "Gas hydrates are a potentially huge global energy resource, with estimates of 100,000 trillion cubic feet or more for gas-in-place. However, these estimates have not been successfully constrained, and there is no confirmed commercial production of gas hydrates. The technical and economic challenges suggest a vast difference between the amount in place and what can be produced. Countries like the United States, Japan, India, and South Korea are interested in developing this resource. Currently, countries like Japan, India, South Korea, and China are involved in national research and development programs. Burning natural gas produces less CO2 compared to coal. Increasing the U.S. supply of natural gas from gas hydrates could reduce reliance on imported gas and decrease CO2 emissions. Global estimates suggest vast untapped gas hydrate resources offshore. The potential size and producibility of global gas hydrate resources can be depicted using a resource pyramid. The apex of the pyramid represents arctic and marine sandstones, which may host tens to hundreds of TCF of gas hydrates. Sandstones are preferred reservoirs due to higher permeability compared to marine shales, which are more challenging. Continued research and development efforts are likely to focus on producing gas hydrates from sandstone reservoirs. The 113th Congress may evaluate U.S. policies on gas hydrate development, especially offshore in the Gulf of Mexico post-Deepwater Horizon incident. Federal R&D aims to enable commercial methane production from gas hydrates while minimizing risks. Questions include assessing the program's progress since the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000 and determining appropriate funding levels. The 113th Congress may consider market forces and federal involvement in the development of gas hydrates, along with technological advances and economic viability. Price volatility of natural gas and infrastructure needs will impact private-sector investment in commercial production. Countries like Japan and India, lacking large domestic natural gas resources, may also be affected. The United States, lacking large onshore natural gas resources like Japan or India, may have an incentive to pursue research and commercial production of offshore gas hydrates. Gas hydrates occur naturally in permafrost regions and seafloor sediments, forming an ice-like solid substance when water and gas combine at low temperatures and high pressures. Methane is the primary component of natural gas found in gas hydrates, where frozen water molecules create a cage-like structure around high gas concentrations. Heating and depressurizing gas hydrates causes a significant volume expansion. Gas hydrates present challenges for commercial exploitation due to uncertainties in their occurrence and extraction methods. Estimates of vast resources must consider terms like in-place resources, technically recoverable resources, and proved reserves. In-place resources are the largest estimates, technically recoverable resources can be produced with current technology, and proved reserves are estimated quantities that can be extracted. Gas hydrates have no confirmed commercial production or proved reserves, unlike natural gas. The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Agency estimates vast undiscovered gas resources, but proved reserves are limited. The U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management report in-place estimates for gas hydrate resources. The USGS and BOEM have estimated significant gas hydrate resources in the Gulf of Mexico and the entire U.S. outer continental shelf. The USGS also conducted a first-ever assessment of undiscovered technically recoverable gas hydrates in northern Alaska, suggesting potential commercial viability despite limited field testing. The USGS assessment in northern Alaska suggests potential commercial viability for about 85 TCF of undiscovered technically recoverable gas hydrate resources. The total area covered by the assessment is 55,894 square miles, extending from the National Petroleum Reserve in the west to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the east. Gas hydrates in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) represent a potential source of natural gas in addition to the considerable resource base already estimated to exist offshore the U.S. Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico coastlines. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) estimated that the undiscovered technically recoverable natural gas resources for the Alaska OCS would add an additional 131 TCF mean value. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) estimated that the undiscovered technically recoverable natural gas resources for the Alaska OCS would add an additional 131 TCF mean value. In-place estimates for gas hydrate resources in the OCS are typically much higher than undiscovered technically recoverable estimates. On February 1, 2008, BOEM released an assessment of gas hydrate resources for the Gulf of Mexico, with a mean estimate of over 21,000 TCF. The report estimated over 6,700 TCF of sandstone-hosted gas hydrates in the Gulf of Mexico, with potential for production using current technology. Drilling in 2009 revealed gas hydrate-bearing reservoir rocks in sand and shale, but commercial recoverability may be limited. The USGS and BOEM have discovered thick sequences of fracture-filling gas hydrates in various reservoirs, increasing confidence in assessing marine gas hydrate energy potential. BOEM's 2012 report estimated 21,700 TCF of in-place gas hydrate resource along the Atlantic OCS and 8,190 TCF along the Pacific OCS, with lower values than a 1995 USGS assessment due to different modeling approaches and new field program data. Gas hydrates can pose a hazard for oil and gas drilling operations, especially when wells encounter gas hydrate zones. Companies try to avoid these zones due to limited understanding of their properties. Wells are cased with steel pipes to protect against gas hydrates, but drilling without precautions can cause gas leaks from dissociated hydrates. Gas hydrates can pose a hazard for oil and gas drilling operations, especially when wells encounter gas hydrate zones. Offshore drilling operations that disturb gas hydrate-bearing sediments could compromise equipment and cause gas leaks. Increases in temperature or decreases in pressure can cause gas hydrate dissociation, leading to rapid gas release during drilling operations. Gas hydrate production is hazardous, with potential pressure buildup and damage to well equipment. Gas hydrates pose hazards for drilling operations, including uncontrolled gas releases and damage to well casing. Exploiting gas hydrate resources requires mitigation strategies similar to drilling for conventional oil and gas deposits. The DOE aims to enable commercial methane production from gas hydrates by 2015 through research and development efforts. Legislation has authorized funding for methane hydrate R&D programs, totaling $155 million from FY2006 to FY2010. DOE has spent approximately $79 million on the R&D program for gas hydrate research from FY2006 to FY2013. A field trial conducted by ConocoPhillips on the North Slope of Alaska tested methods for recovering gas hydrates. The Administration requested $5 million for gas hydrate research in FY2014. The Ignik Sikumi #1 well drilled in 2011 successfully recovered methane from gas hydrates during production testing. Wellbore conditions must be managed effectively to enhance methane production. Further work is needed before commercial exploitation in permafrost regions. Alaska offers 26,000 acres for long-term gas hydrate research in cooperation with DOE. Alaska offers 26,000 acres for long-term gas hydrate research in cooperation with DOE. Japan's JOGMEC successfully produced methane from gas hydrate deposits in the Eastern Nankai Trough, marking the first offshore production test of gas hydrates. This development is crucial for Japan's future energy supply. Japan's future energy supply heavily relies on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports due to the shutdown of nuclear reactors after the Fukushima disaster. Increased reliance on imported natural gas has reached record levels since the incident."
