    "content": "The federal government has a long history of involvement in the Florida Everglades, with projects starting in the 1940s to control flooding. Factors like flood control projects and development have led to the wetlands shrinking. Ecosystem restoration efforts began over 15 years ago, with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan approved in 2000, authorizing $700 million for initial projects. Legislation authorized $700 million for federal appropriations for initial Everglades projects. Additional projects will be presented to Congress for authorization as planning is completed. Projects must receive federal and state appropriations to be completed. In WRDA 2007, three additional projects were authorized. State projects may contribute to restoration but are not credited toward federal requirements under CERP. The River of Grass acquisition is the most recent non-CERP project by the state. The South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) is proposing to purchase land south of Lake Okeechobee from U.S. Sugar Corporation to improve water quality and regulate outflows. The plan involves removing land from cultivation for sugarcane and citrus farming to store and treat water for the Everglades. This proposal could impact funding for CERP projects and alter their schedule. The River of Grass land acquisition began in mid-2008 and has been revised multiple times. Governor Charlie Crist announced the state's intention to purchase U.S. Sugar's agricultural lands in June 2008. The State of Florida planned to purchase U.S. Sugar Corporation's agricultural lands, including 180,000 acres, for $1.34 billion. The acquired land would be used to store and treat water for the Everglades. Financing would come from bonds issued by SFWMD, repaid through property taxes. The proposal was amended in May 2009. In May 2009, SFWMD announced an amended proposal to purchase 40% of U.S. Sugar's lands for $536 million. U.S. Sugar would lease back some of the land for up to 20 years. SFWMD had the option to acquire the remaining 107,000 acres at a fixed price per acre. In August 2010, a second amended purchase agreement was approved to further scale down the acquisition. The SFWMD Governing Board approved the purchase of 26,800 acres for $197 million in August 2010. The majority of the land, consisting of sugarcane and citrus acreage, will be leased back to U.S. Sugar Corporation. The remaining 153,200 acres can be optionally purchased over 10 years with SFWMD funds, not through bonds. Opponents have raised objections in state court regarding the financing of the transaction, claiming it lacks a valid public purpose. Florida Crystals, a major sugar producer, has also contested the acquisition. The purchase of 26,800 acres for $197 million by SFWMD has faced opposition from Florida Crystals and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians. Arguments against the deal include unfair advantage to competitors and doubts about SFWMD's financial ability. Supporters claim the acquisition is in the public interest for Everglades restoration. The Florida Supreme Court is reviewing the opponents' appeal, which could impact the finalization of the deal on October 11, 2010. The proposed land acquisition by the State of Florida is facing questions about its impact on Everglades restoration and reducing phosphorus levels in the ecosystem. Proponents highlight the restoration benefits of taking 42 square miles of land in the Everglades Agricultural Area out of production, particularly in the C-139 basin. The State of Florida's proposed land acquisition in Hendry County, specifically in the C-139 basin, aims to reduce phosphorus inputs into the ecosystem by taking land out of production. The acquired lands could also be used for stormwater treatment areas to mitigate phosphorus outflows from Lake Okeechobee and potentially for building storage structures for water management and ecosystem restoration. Concerns include the location, continuity, timing, and benefits of the purchase, with most of the 26,800 acres planned for acquisition remaining under cultivation. The proposed land acquisition in Hendry County aims to reduce phosphorus inputs into the ecosystem by taking land out of production. Concerns include the fragmentation of land parcels, potential delays in land transfers, and the presence of canker disease on the proposed purchased land. Some argue that the majority of the land will remain in production, limiting the restoration benefits for the Everglades. The River of Grass acquisition aims to remove land from cultivation for restoration projects to reduce phosphorus inputs into the ecosystem. Delays in this process could hinder restoration efforts, leading to irreversible losses in the Everglades ecosystem. Stakeholders are concerned about the impact on the implementation of CERP. The proposed land acquisition by the State of Florida may not align with CERP goals, as it is not credited towards the state/federal cost share required. While SFWMD supports the purchase for Everglades restoration, it is unclear if it directly benefits CERP projects. Some worry that the acquisition could impact other restoration projects, like the A-1 reservoir, which was suspended in 2008. The proposed land acquisition in Florida may not align with CERP goals and could impact other restoration projects like the A-1 reservoir. Judge Federico Moreno ordered the A-1 reservoir project to be reinstated, which may constrain financing for other restoration projects. Some question if funding for the land acquisition deal would be better spent on CERP projects due to expected declines in state funding for restoration activities. The L-8 reservoir, a CERP project, may face potential reduction in funding. State funding decisions for CERP projects will be finalized in September 2010. Concerns exist about the impact of proposed land acquisition on phosphorus loading in the Everglades ecosystem. The acquisition could reduce phosphorus levels by constructing stormwater treatment areas and removing farms. The state acknowledges high nutrient loads in some proposed acquisition areas. The proposed land acquisition for restoration in the Everglades ecosystem may not strategically maximize phosphorus reduction. Delays in other restoration projects, like the A-1 reservoir, could impact phosphorus mitigation efforts. The acquisition is a long-term investment compared to other ongoing projects. The impact of land acquisition on Everglades restoration projects, including CERP projects, depends on budget decisions in late September 2010. Funding reductions could cause delays affecting phosphorus mitigation and water storage capacity. Congress may need to reconsider currently planned CERP activities in light of these circumstances."
