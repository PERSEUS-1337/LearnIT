    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Weather Service Modernization Performance Review Act of 1994\". Congress finds that the safety and welfare of the public depend on accurate and timely weather information. The National Implementation Plan for modernization of the National Weather Service is a cost-effective approach. Some geographic areas may not fully benefit from the weather service implementation under the plan. The National Weather Service modernization plan must be independently reviewed to ensure it meets legal requirements and does not reduce radar coverage at 10,000 feet. SEC. 3. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SECRETARY. The Secretary of Commerce is responsible for ensuring the National Implementation Plan for the modernization of the National Weather Service does not degrade service in any specific geographic area, including maintaining radar coverage and providing radar coverage for areas with unique weather threats. This monitoring must occur biennially until two years after the plan's implementation is completed. The Secretary of Commerce ensures the National Implementation Plan for modernizing the National Weather Service does not degrade service in specific geographic areas. A notice is published for public comment on areas of uncertainty. An independent review by the National Research Council evaluates weather conditions and NEXRAD radar coverage in identified areas. The National Research Council evaluates NEXRAD radar coverage, effects of closing local Weather Service offices, and transferring warning responsibility to remote offices. Recommendations are submitted to the Secretary regarding the National Implementation Plan for modernizing the National Weather Service. The Secretary must establish radar coverage below 10,000 feet or improve radar services. Within 60 days of receiving recommendations from the National Research Council, a report with recommendations and proposed actions must be submitted to Congress. No actions affecting public safety, such as closing weather service offices or decommissioning warning radars, can be taken until an independent review is completed. (g) The Secretary must consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Transportation regarding radar coverage from Department of Defense and Department of Transportation radars to supplement the civil system."
