Section 3006A of title 18, United States Code is amended to establish the Federal Defender Commission as an independent agency with 12 members appointed by the President. The Commission will have a Director appointed by the President with specific qualifications and a 6-year term. The Federal Defender Commission is an independent agency with 12 members appointed by the President. Members must have primary experience in criminal defense and be former Federal defenders. Qualifications include being a member of the bar of the highest court of a State and having significant experience in the legal defense of criminal cases. The Federal Defender Commission is an independent agency with 12 members appointed by the President. Members must have primary experience in criminal defense and be former Federal defenders. Qualifications include being a member of the bar of the highest court of a State and having significant experience in the legal defense of criminal cases. Members of the Commission cannot be employed as a Federal defender, prosecutor, law enforcement official, or serving as an active judicial officer of the United States. The term of a member of the Commission is 6 years, and they can serve after the expiration of their term until a successor takes office. The Federal Defender Commission consists of 12 members appointed by the President, with 6 members initially appointed for 2-year terms to stagger the terms. The Commission's duties include consulting with district courts on providing representation to those unable to afford it and appointing a Federal Public Defender based on recommendations from relevant entities. The Federal Defender Commission appoints members to carry out plans for each district and develop national guidelines for Federal Public Defender offices. This includes quality representation, program evaluation, attorney and staff management, training, specialty resources, and research pilot programs. The Federal Defender Commission appoints members to carry out plans for each district, including research and development pilot projects, statistical studies, and committees. The plan may combine districts if cost-effective and necessary for effective representation. The Commission determines the need for Federal Public Defender offices and their geographic boundaries. The Commission may appoint additional employees to assist in carrying out its duties. Members and employees shall be compensated at rates determined by the Commission. The Commission shall not interfere with attorneys' professional responsibilities to their clients. Representation under this section grants the authority to enforce professional responsibility standards for attorneys. Plans must include providing representation for financially eligible individuals charged with criminal offenses, juvenile delinquency, probation violations, required arrests, and supervised release violations. The curr_chunk outlines various scenarios where individuals are entitled to the appointment of counsel, including facing supervised release violations, mental condition hearings, custody as a material witness, and criminal adjudication. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of legal representation for individuals seeking modifications of imprisonment terms, clemency, or pardons. Representation may be provided for financially eligible persons in certain cases, and private attorneys may be appointed from a panel for specific cases based on ethical considerations. Private panel attorneys are assigned on a rotating basis for individual cases, with the Federal Public Defender not involved in their selection. Attorneys on the panel must have significant experience in criminal defense and undergo ongoing training and certification. Performance in representing defendants is regularly peer-reviewed and certified by members of the local criminal defense community. Each district shall have a budget analyst hired by the Commission, who must be operationally independent and have significant experience in criminal defense practice. The analyst will provide timely, objective, and independent analysis of the budget. The budget analyst will oversee reimbursement for costs by private attorneys and may mediate payment claims. The Federal Public Defender appoints staff, sets salaries, and makes necessary contracts for office functions, with salaries comparable to those of the United States Attorney's office. The term of a Federal Public Defender is four years. The term of a Federal Public Defender is 4 years, with the possibility of serving beyond that until a successor is appointed. The Commission can remove a Federal Public Defender for cause with three-quarters majority approval and fill vacancies in the same manner as the original appointment. Additionally, the Commission may establish a Community Defender Organization for representation in the District. A Community Defender Organization is a nonprofit defense counsel service established by an authorized group to provide representation in the District. The organization can receive payments from the Commission if its bylaws are included in the district's plan. Each organization must submit an annual report to the Commission detailing its activities, financial position, anticipated caseload, and expenses for the next fiscal year. Organizations can apply for grants to cover expenses needed to establish the organization. The Community Defender Organization or Federal Public Defender can apply to the Commission to change its structure. The Commission may allow the change if it serves the purposes of the section. Appointed counsel must represent the individual at every stage of the proceedings. The United States magistrate judge or the court may appoint counsel for individuals who are financially unable to pay for representation, as the interests of justice may dictate. The appointment of counsel can be terminated if the person becomes financially able to obtain counsel. Substitution of appointed counsel can be made at any stage of the proceedings in the interests of justice. This section does not apply to representation in the Local Courts of the District of Columbia. In Columbia, the section excludes representation in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia or the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. Definitions include 'circuit,' 'district court,' and 'representation' which encompasses legal counsel and related services. 'State' is broadly defined to include any State or other jurisdiction. The term 'State' in the section includes any State or similar entity where a district court is established. The Federal Defender organization and Community Defender Organizations established before the enactment of the Act will continue to operate. The General Accountability Office will conduct a study on the provision and cost of Federal Defense services within 4 years of the Act's enactment."
