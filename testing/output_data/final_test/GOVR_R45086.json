    "content": "The Congress is debating how to address climate change, with a focus on the human influence. The Trump Administration has expressed uncertainty about this influence, calling for public debate. Scientific assessments have shown increasing consensus on human impact on climate change, with the latest report in 2017 stating a high level of confidence. The 2017 report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) stated that human influence is the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th Century. Climate change science has evolved since the early 1800s, with significant investments leading to advancements in empirical observations and climate models. Scientists have increased confidence in detecting and understanding climate change, attributing it to human-related greenhouse gas emissions. Over nearly two centuries, research has shown high scientific confidence in global warming primarily caused by human activities. The report chronicles 200 years of scientific statements on human and natural contributions to climate change, showing the evolution of views and confidence over time. The concept of greenhouse gases warming the Earth is not new, with carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases contributing to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect, dating back to 1827, has been relatively undisputed among scientists. The debate has focused on whether the climate is warming overall and the factors contributing to it, including human activities and natural variations. By 1900, various theories on climate change had been proposed. Since the late 1800s, various theories on climate change, including changes in solar energy, Earth's orbital geometry, volcanoes, continents' geography, and GHGs, were debated. By the 1900s, the relationship between CO2 concentrations and Earth's temperature was theoretical. Over time, advancements in measurement technologies, simulation models, research, and observations have improved climate science, leading to better quantification of the relationships between natural and human-related GHG emissions. Since the late 1800s, theories on climate change have evolved, with a focus on factors like natural and human-related greenhouse gas emissions, changes in atmospheric concentrations, rising global temperatures, and shifts in climate patterns. Human activities have increasingly impacted climate change since the 19th century, with advancements in scientific capacity enabling better detection and attribution of these influences. In the late 1930s, Guy Callendar's work on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and regional temperatures marked a significant step in understanding climate change. Guy Callendar's calculations in the late 1930s showed a correlation between increasing CO2 concentrations and regional temperatures, indicating a potential climate warming due to human activity. David Keeling's precise measurements in the 1950s further confirmed this link, establishing a quantitative benchmark for future studies on the global carbon cycle and its impact on rising global temperatures. In the mid-20th century, a period of flat or decreasing global temperatures raised uncertainty about future climate changes and human influence. This coincided with concerns about \"global dimming\" attributed to pollution before leveling off around 1980. The warming hiatus may have been influenced by both human (GHG, pollution) and natural factors. In the late 1970s, scientific assessments indicated a probable human contribution to climate change due to increasing GHG emissions. By the early 2000s, improved observations and computational models clarified the relative role of human versus natural influences. Collaborative assessments were established to inform policymakers on the strengths and weaknesses of scientific analysis regarding climate change. Table A-2 summarizes conclusions on human and natural influences on climate change from major assessments by NAS, IPCC, and USGCRP. Scientific confidence has grown in attributing global warming since the mid-20th century to human activities, supported by longer observational records, satellite data, and improved understanding of atmospheric physics. Improved understanding of atmospheric physics and advanced climate models now better simulate atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Despite uncertainties in cloud effects, current assessments confidently attribute human influence as the main cause of observed warming. Future climate outcomes hinge on various factors, including socio-economic development and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This appendix provides bibliographic references and quotations on global climate change, including the influence of CO2, GHGs, and natural factors. It includes tables with selected scientific literature and assessments up to 1987, highlighting human-related contributions to climate change. Scientific assessments from major U.S. and international organizations, starting in 1977, have evaluated the human contribution to global climate change. These assessments were influential in the scientific community and were produced by USGCRP, NAS, and IPCC."
