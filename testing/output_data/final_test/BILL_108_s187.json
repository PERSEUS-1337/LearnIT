Congress finds that federal agencies heavily rely on networked computer systems to provide critical services to the American people, facing an increasing number of cyber threats that can cause irreparable harm to network systems and undermine public confidence in internet security. The Internet is being used by terrorists to achieve their goals, with evidence showing that al Qaeda operatives have browsed sites offering software to control critical infrastructure. The Bush Administration acknowledges the need for improved federal cyberspace security, as most agencies receive failing grades for their cyber security programs. Federal agencies must take significant steps to protect themselves against cyber attacks by identifying vulnerabilities in their computer networks. Federal agencies must take steps to protect their computer networks by detecting vulnerabilities, monitoring for new risks, testing against identified vulnerabilities, and ensuring adequate protection. The Act defines key terms such as Chief Information Officer and vulnerability in the context of information technology. It also references the elimination of significant vulnerabilities in federal government IT. The Chief Information Officer of each agency is required to identify and eliminate significant vulnerabilities in the agency's information technology, setting performance goals based on the current state of IT as a baseline. The Chief Information Officer of each agency must identify and eliminate vulnerabilities in the agency's information technology. Performance goals are set based on the current state of IT as a baseline, with target ratios of vulnerabilities per IT. Tools must be procured or developed to achieve these goals, personnel trained in their use, and regular testing conducted to assess the extent of vulnerabilities. The Chief Information Officer of each agency must assess compliance with performance goals for information technology and develop a plan to address vulnerabilities. This information must be included in the agency's annual report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget ensures the review of annual reports by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for governmentwide standards. The NIST develops guidelines for Chief Information Officers based on the reports. The National Institute of Standards and Technology develops guidelines for Chief Information Officers to comply with governmentwide standards, identifying and eliminating common vulnerabilities in information technology. The Director designates significant vulnerabilities for mandatory action. The Secretary of Commerce mandates the use of guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for agencies to address vulnerabilities in information technology, unless exceptions are approved by the agency's Chief Information Officer and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Secretary of Commerce mandates the use of guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for agencies to address vulnerabilities in information technology, unless exceptions are approved by the agency's Chief Information Officer and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, with the concurrence that the use of such guideline would not increase the security of the information technology covered by the standard. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n    Authorization of Appropriations:\n    - $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 for the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop guidelines required by section 4(c).\n    - Agencies to receive necessary funds for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to implement this Act.\n    Availability:\n    - Funds for NIST shall remain available until expended.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n    Act to take effect 180 days after enactment."
