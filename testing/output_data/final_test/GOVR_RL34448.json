    "content": "The 111th Congress shows strong interest in supporting federal research and development (R&D) activities for national defense, health, safety, environment, and energy security. The government funds scientific and engineering R&D to advance knowledge, develop the workforce, and enhance U.S. innovation and competitiveness globally. Federal R&D efforts have led to breakthroughs in technologies like jet aircraft, the Internet, communications satellites, and disease defenses. President Bush requested $147.0 billion for R&D in FY2009, a 2.7% increase over FY2008 funding. The increase was primarily for the American Competitiveness Initiative and funding for medical countermeasures under Project BioShield. Some questioned the classification of $2.175 billion for DHS as R&D facilities construction, as it seemed intended for product acquisition rather than research or development. The FY2009 budget request included an advance appropriation for R&D funding, accounting for over half of the net increase in funding. Analysis of federal R&D funding is complex due to factors like omitted Congressionally directed spending, inconsistencies in reporting, and mis-categorization of funding. The inclusion of funding for R&D, facilities, and equipment in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 further complicates the figures reported by OMB. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated approximately $22.7 billion for R&D, facilities, equipment, and related activities to federal agencies. President Bush's FY2009 budget request showed that five agencies would receive 92.8% of total federal R&D funding, with the Department of Defense receiving the largest share at 54.8%. The report analyzes R&D budget requests for various federal agencies, including NSF, DOE, DOC, and NIST. The Bush Administration proposed larger increases for agencies in the American Competitiveness Initiative, while reducing funding for the Department of Agriculture. Congress authorized significant R&D increases for these agencies under the America COMPETES Act. R&D funding for four agencies has decreased: Department of Agriculture by $357 million (-15.5%), Department of Veterans Affairs by $76 million (-7.9%), Department of the Interior by $59 million (-8.7%), and Environmental Protection Agency by $7 million (-1.3%). President Bush's FY2009 request included $29.3 billion for basic research, $27.1 billion for applied research, $84.0 billion for development, and $6.5 billion for facilities and equipment. Federal R&D funding can be viewed in terms of each agency's contribution to basic research, applied research, development, and facilities and equipment. The federal government is the largest supporter of basic research, with the Department of Health and Human Services (primarily NIH) accounting for over half of all federal funding. Industry is the primary funder of applied research in the United States, while industry also provides the majority of funding for development. The federal government is the primary funder of development, with the Department of Defense accounting for the majority of federal funding. Initiatives like the National Nanotechnology Initiative and the American Competitiveness Initiative aim to increase funding for research and science education. President Obama has pledged to double funding for basic research over 10 years, following in the footsteps of President Bush's ACI proposal in 2006. The federal government aimed to double physical sciences and engineering research funding in three agencies over ten years from FY2007 to FY2016. Despite authorization levels set by the America COMPETES Act, FY2008 funding fell short of doubling targets. Estimated FY2008 funding for research totaled $10.61 billion, a 3.5% increase from FY2007. President Bush requested $12.21 billion for FY2009, a 15.1% increase over the previous year. The federal government aimed to double physical sciences and engineering research funding in three agencies over ten years from FY2007 to FY2016. Despite falling short of doubling targets in FY2008, estimated funding totaled $10.61 billion, with a 15.1% increase requested for FY2009. The NSF, DOE Office of Science, and NIST saw increases in proposed funding for FY2009, with additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 110-329) provides FY2009 appropriations for the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, along with supplemental funding for disaster relief. Division A of the act also includes continuing appropriations for FY2009 at their original FY2008 levels to agencies not otherwise addressed in the act until March 6, 2009, or until the enactment of an appropriation for any project or activity provided for in the act. On February 23, 2009, H.R. 1105, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8), was introduced in the House and passed two days later. On March 6, Congress extended the continuing appropriations provisions of P.L. 110-329 through March 11, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) was passed on February 13 and signed into law on February 17, providing funding for R&D, facilities, and equipment. The final version of the act includes approximately $22.7 billion for R&D, facilities, and equipment and related activities. President Bush signed into law the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, providing additional funding for FY2008 to the Department of Defense for research, development, test, and evaluation activities. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $365 million to the Department of Defense for Defense Health Program RDT&E, and $338 million to other agencies for science-related activities. This included $150 million for the National Institutes of Health, $62.5 million each for NASA, NSF, and the Department of Energy for various programs. Additionally, $62.5 million was provided for defense environmental cleanup. The funding levels and execution of federal R&D have been impacted by previous appropriations processes. The Department of Energy's FY2008 R&D budget cuts led to layoffs at various laboratories and universities. Delays in the appropriations process may affect planned R&D, equipment acquisition, and facilities construction. President Bush's FY2009 R&D funding requests are analyzed in the following sections. President Bush's FY2009 budget requested increased funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), totaling $1.53 billion, with specific increases in various research areas. The FY2009 budget requested increased funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI), with specific increases in research areas such as safety, nanomanufacturing, major research facilities, and education. Funding would have decreased for nanomaterials research and nanoscale devices. Additionally, President Bush proposed increased funding for the Networking and Information Technology R&D program in FY2009. The Bush Administration proposed $2.01 billion for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) in FY2009, with NASA, NOAA, DOE, and NSF receiving the majority of the funding increase. Congress also supports research and development in the Department of Defense through its RDT&E appropriation, primarily for military hardware and software development. The Department of Defense (DOD) primarily appropriates funds for Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) in Title IV of the defense appropriation bill. RDT&E funds are also allocated for the Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program, and Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund. These programs support health care delivery, medical research, chemical weapons destruction, and counter-IED efforts. The Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund, administered by the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Office, includes RDT&E monies but lacks a specific line item for it. Congress typically funds these programs in Title VI of the defense appropriations bill, including funds for the Global War on Terror. Requests and appropriations for GWOT often include funds for various transfer funds such as the Iraqi Freedom Fund and the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. For FY2009, the Bush Administration requested $79.6 billion for DOD's baseline Title IV RDT&E, with additional funding for the Defense Health Program and Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program. The Global War on Terror Pending request included $2.9 billion for RDT&E. The Bush Administration requested $2.9 billion for RDT&E in the FY2008 GWOT Pending supplemental request. They also made a FY2009 GWOT \"Bridge\" request for $379 million in classified RDT&E. RDT&E funding in Title IV has increased from $42 billion to $80 billion in FY2009, a 60% increase in constant dollars. Congress has historically appropriated more for RDT&E, reaching its highest levels since 1948. RDT&E funding has reached its highest levels in constant dollars since 1948. Congress has consistently appropriated more for RDT&E than requested since FY1996. The funding is allocated to military departments, DOD agencies, and Defensewide accounts, with budget activities categorized as basic research, applied research, advanced development, and specific weapon systems development. Budget activity 6.6 and 6.7 support system improvements in existing operational systems and provide management support for test and evaluation facilities. Congress is particularly interested in S&T funding to develop new technologies and maintain U.S. military superiority. DOD aims to stabilize baseline S&T funding at 3% of overall funding, with a FY2009 request of $11.5 billion in Title IV. The FY2009 S&T funding request in Title IV was $11.5 billion, which was $1.3 billion less than the previous year. DOD aims to stabilize baseline S&T funding at 3% of the overall budget, but the request fell short at 2.2%. Basic research (6.1) is a focus, with over half of DOD's budget for it going to universities. Over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities, with the FY2009 request for basic research being $1.7 billion. Congress passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, providing supplemental funding for the Department of Defense and the Global War on Terror. Congress did not provide all the RDT&E funding requested in the FY2008 GWOT Pending request, but added funds for the Defense Health Program and directed a general reduction of RDT&E funds. In FY2009, Congress provided additional funding for RDT&E, including $9 million for the Air Force. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 allocated $80.5 billion for Title IV RDT&E, with $13.5 billion for S&T and $1.8 billion for basic research. Congress also reduced Title IV funding by $218 million due to revised economic assumptions. In FY2009, Congress provided additional funding for RDT&E, including $903 million for Defense Health Program and $289 million for Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $350 million for energy-related RDT&E in the House version of H.R. 1, and $200 million in the Senate version. The Senate bill initially allocated $200 million for the Manufacturing Technology Program to demonstrate energy efficient technologies. The final bill reduced the funding to $300 million and required the Secretary of Defense to report on fund usage and progress. Debate surrounded whether the funds should focus on short-term job retention or be used for a longer-term transition. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with the House and Senate passing different versions of the bill. The funds were intended for the development of technologies and equipment needed in both wars. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for the development of technologies and equipment. The House provided $201 million for research in traumatic brain injuries, psychological health, and orthopedics, while the Senate recommended $34 million for information technologies in support of Wounded, Ill, and Injured program. There are differences between the House and Senate versions, such as the Navy's Manned Reconnaissance Systems request being zeroed by the House and increased by $26 million by the Senate. Additionally, the Senate added $61 million to the Air Force request for LINK 16 Support and Sustainment. The Department of Homeland Security requested $1.449 billion for R&D in FY2009, with the House recommending $1.447 billion and the Senate recommending $1.476 billion. The final appropriation was $1.465 billion, with no additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Directorate of Science and Technology is the primary DHS R&D organization. The DHS Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the main R&D organization within DHS, conducting research in its own labs and funding R&D in national labs, industry, universities, and other government agencies. The FY2009 budget request for S&T included increases for the Explosives program and Laboratory Facilities program, with a focus on countering improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and startup costs for the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC). The House committee recommended a total of $887 million for S&T, with increases for various programs including Infrastructure and Geophysical, Laboratory Facilities, first responder technologies, homeland security industrial base, and University Programs. The Senate committee recommended a total of $919 million for S&T, with increases for cyber security research, Infrastructure and Geophysical program, and construction at PNNL. Decreases included Innovation and Human Factors funding. The committee recommended $5 million for the Homeland Security Institute as a separate item, not part of the Transition program as requested by the Administration. The final appropriation for S&T was $933 million, with increases in funding for cyber security research, the National Institute for Hometown Security, Southeast Region Research Initiative, construction at PNNL, and University Programs. Decreases included funding for Innovation. Funding for the Homeland Security Institute was provided separately. Congress is facing issues regarding S&T Directorate's priorities and relationships. The S&T Directorate's priorities, relationships with federal R&D organizations, budgeting, and allocation of R&D resources are key issues facing Congress. The directorate announced new university centers of excellence in 2008, with plans to terminate or merge existing centers. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for DHS nuclear detection efforts, with a 16% budget increase in FY2009. The FY2009 budget request for DNDO saw a 16% increase, mainly in the Systems Acquisition account for procurement of Advanced Spectroscopic Portals (ASPs). The House committee recommended $544 million for DNDO, with reductions in funding for new headquarters employees, a fellowship program, and the Radiation Portal Monitoring Program. The House bill also imposed restrictions on ASP procurement until performance certification and prohibited high-risk concurrent development and production of software and hardware. The Senate committee recommended $541 million for DNDO, with a $23 million reduction in the Radiation Portal Monitoring Program due to delays in certification. They continued the prohibition on full-scale procurement of ASPs and high-risk concurrent development. The Senate urged DNDO to prioritize programs based on risk and contract with an independent organization to develop a framework for defensive efforts. The final appropriation for DNDO was $514 million, with reductions in Transformational R&D initiatives. The final bill included $10 million for new initiatives in Transformational R&D and $38 million from the Radiation Portal Monitoring Program due to development delays. Congressional focus has been on DNDO's testing and analysis for the purchase of ASPs. The requirement for secretarial certification before full-scale ASP procurement has been postponed multiple times, now expected in mid-2009. The 111th Congress completed action on legislation providing FY2009 funding to NIH, totaling $30.253 billion, an increase of $933 million from FY2008 levels. Congressional interest remains in the global nuclear detection architecture overseen by DNDO and the roles of DNDO and the S&T Directorate in research and development. The FY2009 funding for NIH saw a significant increase of $11.333 billion (38.7%) over FY2008, with additional funds provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This brought the total funding to $40.653 billion, with ARRA funds available through FY2010. President George W. Bush's FY2009 request for NIH was about level with the original FY2008 amount. In FY2008, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $29.171 billion to NIH, with an additional $150 million from the Supplemental Appropriations Act, bringing the total to $29.321 billion. The FY2009 request was $155 million below the FY2008 enacted program level. Funding for NIH primarily comes from the annual appropriations bill for Labor/HHS. In FY2008, the Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $29.171 billion to NIH, with an additional $150 million from the Supplemental Appropriations Act, bringing the total to $29.321 billion. The FY2009 request was $155 million below the FY2008 enacted program level. NIH receives funding from various sources including separate legislation for diabetes research and transfers to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The total funding available for NIH activities, including add-ons and transfers, is called the program level. The Senate committee recommended a program level total of $30.113 billion for NIH in FY2009, with a potential additional $78 million for the NIH Superfund account. The House Labor/HHS subcommittee proposed a higher funding of $30.238 billion for NIH, $125 million more than the Senate committee's amount. In FY2009, the total NIH program level was projected at approximately $30.316 billion, $1.145 billion over the original FY2008 amount. Congress doubled the NIH budget in FY2003, with annual increases of 14%-15% from FY1999 to FY2003. From FY2004 to FY2008, increases were between 1%-3% each year. President Bush requested no increase for NIH in FY2009, while advocates recommended a 6.5% increase. In FY2009, the NIH funding level decreased in purchasing power from the FY2003 peak. The regular NIH appropriations were below the FY2003 level, but the total FY2009 funding level increased over the FY2003 level. The NIH organization includes the Office of the Director and 27 institutes and centers focusing on specific areas of research and health. The NIH consists of the Office of the Director and 27 institutes and centers focusing on specific areas of research and health. Each institute manages its own research programs with separate appropriations from Congress. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposed mostly level funding for the institutes, with slight increases for some, while the Senate and House recommended higher increases for most institutes. The Subcommittee recommended increases for most of the ICs compared to FY2008 levels, with exceptions. NCRR received a 6.3% increase for clinical research training, NLM was increased by 2.4%, and the genome research institute decreased by 0.6%. The budget requested $126 million for Buildings and Facilities, an increase of $7 million. The House subcommittee agreed with the $126 million funding for Buildings and Facilities, while the Senate committee recommended $147 million. The final omnibus funding was at the requested level, with a 5.6% increase over FY2008. Additionally, the stimulus bill provided $500 million in supplemental funding for NIH B&F activities. The OD account saw a net $52 million drop, with the National Children's Study funded at $111 million in FY2008. The Bush Administration proposed to end funding for a study that Congress continued to support, leading to an increase in FY2009 funding of up to $192 million. President Bush also proposed increases for NIH Roadmap initiatives, with a request of $534 million for FY2009. The Senate committee recommended $568 million for the Common Fund, a $73 million increase. In FY2009, the Senate committee recommended $568 million for the Common Fund, a $73 million increase, and boosted overall funding for the OD account to $1,275 million, an increase of $166 million (15%). The final amounts in the omnibus were higher than the request but lower than either committee allowance: $1,247 million for OD overall, an increase of $135 million (12.2%), and $541 million for the Common Fund, an increase of $46 million (9.2%). In FY2009, NIH's biodefense portfolio saw a 1.2% increase to $1,748 million. The House subcommittee allocated $100 million for countermeasures research, while the Senate committee did not discuss it. NIH's main concerns include supporting investigator-initiated research and expanding the supply of new investigators. Total funding for research project grants (RPGs) was $15.5 billion in the FY2009 request, with an estimated 38,257 awards proposed. In FY2009, NIH's biodefense portfolio increased by 1.2% to $1,748 million. The House subcommittee allocated $100 million for countermeasures research, while the Senate committee did not discuss it. Total funding for research project grants (RPGs) was $15.5 billion in the FY2009 request, with an estimated 38,257 awards proposed. The Senate committee estimated funding for 10,471 competing RPGs, while the House subcommittee estimated funding for 10,812. The request proposed no inflationary increases for noncompeting RPGs and an average annual cost of competing RPGs at about $361,000. The House subcommittee and omnibus explanatory statement included a 2% increase for new and continuing grants, with an expected success rate of 18%. Success rates for various ICs would have ranged from 8% to 26%. The appropriators did not comment on expectations for success rates, which were estimated to range from 8% to 26% for various ICs. Funding from the stimulus is expected to improve success rates, with a focus on short-term projects. NIH efforts are aimed at supporting new investigators and encouraging young scientists to pursue research careers. The request proposed funding for programs like the Pathway to Independence program and National Research Service Awards, with increases in stipends for fellows. The request for the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) was for $475 million, including funding for New Innovator Awards and the NIH Director's Bridge Award. The 110th Congress supported these initiatives with funding increases beyond the request. Specific amounts mentioned in the omnibus appropriations included $35 million for Transformative Research Project Grants and $80 million for other programs. The NIH budget included specific amounts for various programs: $35 million for Transformative Research Project Grants, $80 million for New Innovators Awards, $41 million for Director's Pioneer Awards, and $24 million for rare and neglected diseases. The CTSA program received $475 million, with additional funding from the Common Fund and NCRR. Other proposed changes included increased support for research centers, R&D contracts, the NIH intramural research program, research management and support, and a decrease in other research grants. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside taps into NIH and other HHS agencies' budgets to assess federal health programs and redistribute funds. NIH is the largest donor of evaluation funds but a minor recipient. Budget tables do not subtract the tap amount from agencies' appropriations. The 111th Congress provided emergency FY2009 supplemental appropriations for NIH in the economic stimulus legislation, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The appropriations will supplement NIH's regular appropriations for FY2009 and FY2010, with $10 billion allocated for biomedical research and research facilities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $10 billion for biomedical research and research facilities. This included $8.2 billion for NIH extramural and intramural research, with $400 million designated for transfer to NIH for comparative effectiveness research. Additionally, $1 billion was allocated for grants to construct and renovate university research facilities, and $300 million for grants for shared instrumentation and other capital. NIH received $300 million for grants for shared instrumentation and research equipment at extramural facilities, and $500 million for intramural facility construction and improvement from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. NIH plans to fund projects that stimulate the economy, create jobs, and make scientific progress within 2 years. They will focus on new research grant applications, supplemental awards for current grants, and the NIH Challenge initiative. The NIH received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for grants for shared instrumentation and research equipment at extramural facilities, as well as for intramural facility construction and improvement. They plan to fund projects that stimulate the economy, create jobs, and make scientific progress within 2 years, focusing on new research grant applications, supplemental awards for current grants, and the NIH Challenge initiative. Additionally, the NIH Reform Act of 2006 made managerial and organizational changes to enhance the authority and tools for the NIH Director to do strategic planning and established a \"common fund\" for trans-NIH research. The Bush Administration requested $10.535 billion for Department of Energy (DOE) R&D in FY2009, with the final appropriation being $10.905 billion. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009 provided funding for continuing DOE activities at the FY2008 rate through March 6, 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided additional funding for DOE R&D programs, with the DOE Office of Science receiving a 19% increase from FY2008. This increase was part of the American Competitiveness Initiative announced by President Bush in 2006, aiming to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies over 10 years. Congress further accelerated this growth through the America COMPETES Act, setting authorization levels to double R&D funding for these agencies in seven years. The Bush Administration's FY2009 request for R&D funding saw a higher percentage increase for the Office of Science, exceeding the annual target to reach the ACI doubling goal. Despite House and Senate bills recommending increases in FY2007 and FY2008, final appropriations fell short of the ACI amount. In FY2009, the House committee suggested $140 million more than the request, while the Senate committee proposed $82 million less. The final appropriation was $4.758 billion, with an additional $15 million for ARPA-E. Notable increases within the Office of Science included $153 million for Energy Frontier Research Centers, $66 million for the National Synchrotron Light Source II construction, and $73 million for basic energy sciences. The Senate committee recommended reducing basic energy sciences by $153 million below the request; $59 million of that amount represented solar energy R&D activities transferred to another account. The requested 17% increase for high energy physics was mostly for programs cut in the final FY2008 appropriation. The requested 72% increase for fusion energy sciences was to fund the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), which was eliminated in the final FY2008 appropriation. The estimated cost of ITER is between $1.45 and $2.2 billion with a completion date between FY2014 and FY2017. The final appropriation for fusion energy sciences included $90 million less than the request for ITER and no funding for National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) project. The final appropriation for biological and environmental research included increases of $23 million for climate change research and $10 million for nuclear medicine. The requested funding for DOE national security R&D was $3.132 billion, with proposed increases for naval reactors program and reliable replacement warhead program, and a major proposed decrease for proliferation detection R&D. The House and Senate committees recommended different funding amounts for various programs within the DOE budget. The final appropriation included increases for nonproliferation and verification R&D, inertial confinement fusion, and decreases for advanced simulation and computing. The reliable replacement warhead program received no funding. The DOE energy R&D budget request was $2.681 billion, down 2% from FY2008. R&D on nuclear energy and coal was set to increase, while hydrogen R&D was to decrease. Gas and oil technology programs were to be terminated. The requested increase for nuclear energy R&D was mostly for the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI). The House and Senate committees recommended substantial increases in energy R&D, particularly in energy efficiency and renewable energy, but decreases in nuclear energy. Funding for gas and oil technology programs was to remain at the FY2008 level. The House and Senate committees recommended substantial increases in energy R&D, particularly in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 included additional funding for DOE R&D programs, while the Senate-passed version included even more funding for energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D. The enacted version included funding for ARPA-E, the Office of Science programs, and energy efficiency and renewable energy. The FY2009 budget included $2.5 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy, with allocations for biomass and geothermal energy, as well as $3.4 billion for fossil energy R&D. The National Science Foundation (NSF) received a 13.0% increase in funding, part of a plan to double the NSF budget by 2016 under the American Competitiveness Initiative. The FY2009 budget request aimed to double NSF funding by 2016 as part of the America COMPETES Act. Strategies included maintaining momentum across disciplines, building a top science workforce, ensuring accountability, and supporting transformative research. Transformative research is described as endeavors with extraordinary outcomes, revolutionizing disciplines or creating new fields. Recommendations have been made to allocate funds specifically for this type of research in the global science and engineering environment. The FY2009 budget request aimed to double NSF funding by 2016 as part of the America COMPETES Act. Strategies included supporting transformative research to drive innovation and competitiveness. The FY2009 request included $5.594 billion for Research and Related Activities, a 16.0% increase from the previous year. Concerns have been raised about the imbalance between support for life sciences and physical sciences in research funding. The America COMPETES ACT authorizes increased federal research support in the physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering, with a 20.2% increase for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences directorate in the FY2009 request. This portfolio provides a significant portion of federal funding for basic research in mathematics and physical sciences at colleges and universities. Integrative Activities (IA) is a cross-disciplinary research and education program funded by IA, supporting research instrumentation acquisition and development at institutions, including Partnerships for Innovation and disaster research teams. In FY2008, support for EPSCoR was transferred to IA from EHR. NSF's FY2009 request for EPSCoR was $113.5 million, supporting research infrastructure, co-funding, and outreach in 27 jurisdictions. Funding allocation: new awards and infrastructure (67%), co-funding (31.7%), and outreach (1.7%). International research partnerships are crucial for competitiveness and addressing global issues. Administration requested $47.4 million for the Office of International. The Administration requested $47.4 million for the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE) which manages NSF's offices in Beijing, Paris, and Tokyo. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) received $491.0 million for polar research challenges in FY2009, focusing on arctic and antarctic sciences. NSF leads U.S. participation in the International Polar Year and international research partnerships in the Arctic and Antarctic. In FY2009, NSF took over funding for three icebreakers supporting polar research, with one scheduled for drydock. An additional $9.0 million was allocated for backup icebreaking services. NSF also led nanotechnology research with a $396.8 million contribution to the National Nanotechnology Initiative's $1.53 billion FY2009 request. Funding supported research in nanoscale science and technology, including new drug delivery systems. The NSF supports research in emerging areas of nanoscale science and technology, including new drug delivery systems, advanced materials, and more powerful computer chips. Funding is also directed towards research and education on the environmental, health, and safety impacts of nanotechnology.

The Math and Science Partnership Program (MSP) was proposed at $51.0 million. At the graduate level, NSF focused on Integrative Graduate Education and Research. At the graduate level, NSF's priorities include Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, Graduate Research Fellowships, and Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education. Additional priorities support underrepresented groups and diverse institutions in the scientific and engineering enterprise through programs like Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program, Tribal Colleges and Universities Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology. Improving the success rate of grant applicants is a long-term priority for NSF. In FY2009, NSF aimed to increase the funding rate to 23.0% by supporting 1,370 research grants. The MREFC account received $147.5 million, a 33.2% decrease from FY2008, to acquire and construct major research facilities. NSF prioritizes ongoing projects and National Science Board-approved new starts for funding. In FY2009, the National Science Board required MREFC projects to have the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding or infrastructure technology to qualify for support. The FY2009 request reflected NSF's stricter standards for funding. Three projects from FY2008 (Alaskan Regional Research Vessel, Ocean Observatories Initiative, and National Ecological Observatory Network) needed final design reviews and risk management plans to avoid cost overruns. Ongoing projects in FY2009 included Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ($51.4 million), Atacama Large Millimeter Array ($82.3 million), and others. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill providing $6.854 billion for the NSF in FY2009, with $5.544 billion allocated to R&RA. The Senate proposed a similar bill with the same funding amounts. Additional funding included $840.3 million for EHR and $147.5 million for MREFC. President Bush signed the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, providing $62.5 million in emergency funding for the NSF. This included $22.5 million for R&RA, with $5.0 million designated for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program. Additionally, $40.0 million was allocated for EHR, with $20.0 million directed towards the Robert Noyce scholarship program. The FY2008 supplemental funding was not included in the table column below. President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, allocating $3.0 billion for the NSF. This included $2.5 billion for R&RA, $400.0 million for MREFC, $100.0 million for EHR, and $2.0 million for the Office of Inspector General. Specific allocations were made within R&RA and EHR programs. The House and Senate versions of the legislation had differing funding levels for the NSF.

In March 2009, President Obama signed the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, providing a total of $6,490.4 million for the NSF, with $5,183.1 million for R&RA, $152.0 million for MREFC, and $845.3 million for EHR. The NIST research focuses on developing generic technologies and diffusing government-developed advances to benefit the American economy. The FY2009 budget proposed $638.0 million for NIST, with a reduction to $636.0 million due to cuts in the Technology Innovation Program and Manufacturing Extension Partnership funding. Development under the STRS account at NIST was set to increase by 21.5% to $535.0 million, with MEP receiving $2.0 million to transition to independence. Construction support would decrease by 38.3% to $99.0 million. In the 110th Congress, funding for NIST was proposed at $816.9 million in H.R. 7322, with increases for STRS and MEP, while construction spending was to decrease by 19.6% to $129.0 million. In the 110th Congress, proposed funding for NIST included $813.5 million, with increases for STRS, TIP, and MEP. The construction budget would have decreased. No final appropriations legislation was enacted. In the 111th Congress, NIST was funded at $819.0 million, with increases for STRS and MEP, while TIP funding remained constant. Construction budget received a 7.2% increase. The construction budget received a 7.2% increase in funding, with additional allocations for the STRS account, TIP, and MEP. The final version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided extra funding for research grants and equipment. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, P.L. 110-161, allocated $360.0 million for construction, with $180.0 million designated for research science buildings. An additional $20.0 million was transferred from the Health Information Technology initiative to NIST for health security and interoperability standards testing.

In FY2008, funding for NIST decreased, with ATP receiving $65.2 million and MEP receiving $89.6 million. Construction funding tripled to $160.5 million. President Bush's budget proposed $640.7 million for NIST, with STRS increasing to $500.5 million. ATP had no funding, MEP was reduced to $46.3 million, and construction expenses increased to $93.9 million. The Bush Administration aimed to double funding for innovation research at NIST over 10 years. The former President's budgets requested increases in intramural R&D at NIST, with appropriations for in-house programs also increasing. The omnibus appropriations legislation provided a small increase in the STRS account for FY2008. President Bush's budget proposed significant funding increases for the STRS account in FY2008 and FY2009, but actual appropriations were less than the requests. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations bill included a 7.2% increase in support for the STRS account and construction. The bill includes a 7.2% increase in support for the STRS account and construction, with additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Funding for NIST's extramural programs has been a major issue, with uncertainty surrounding the Advanced Technology Program. Support for ATP was cut in FY2006 and replaced with the Technology Innovation Program in FY2007, focusing on small and medium-sized firms. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2008, provided funding for TIP, while the Bush Administration's FY2009 budget did not include financing for the program. The FY2009 budget request did not include financing for the Technology Innovation Program (TIP), while the House and Senate bills supported it similar to FY2008. The budget for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) has also been debated for years. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided a 22.8% increase in MEP financing, while TIP funding remained constant. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 did not provide additional support for TIP or MEP. President Bush proposed $577 million in R&D funding for NOAA in FY2009, which is 14% of NOAA's total budget request. The R&D request consisted of 93% research funding and 7% development funding, with 70% for intramural programs and 30% for extramural activities. The OAR received $288 million, a 11% decrease from the previous year. The FY2009 NOAA R&D budget request was for $577 million, representing 14% of NOAA's total budget. This amount included funding increases for NOS, NMFS, and NESDIS, while NWS R&D remained flat. President Bush's budget proposal allocated $260 million for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and $372 million for OAR labs and cooperative institutes. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a total of $633 million for R&D for FY2009, which was 9.9% greater than the FY2009 request. The largest R&D monetary increase was $33 million for OAR, with climate research and high performance computing R&D benefiting the most. The Senate's largest percentage increase was for NOS at 23.2%, or an additional $13 million, mainly for congressionally directed programs. The House passed H.R. 7322 (110th Congress) for Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2009. Funding for NOAA included over $376 million for climate change research, satellite sensors, and other critical areas. However, no final FY2009 appropriations legislation was enacted by the close of the 110th Congress. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 froze most NOAA funding at FY2008 levels. Division B of the act provided $17 million in supplemental appropriations for NOAA to improve hurricane forecasts. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 approved $4.365 billion in discretionary funding for NOAA, $468.6 million above the FY2008 appropriation. Funding for all line offices and programs increased relative to previous years. R&D funding levels for P.L. 111-8 could not be determined. Total funding increases were seen across all program activities. In the 111th Congress, funding for NOAA R&D activities increased, with significant allocations for various programs such as NOS, NMFS, OAR, NWS, NESDIS, and Program Support. The House version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act recommended $1 billion for NOAA, with $600 million designated for NESDIS to support climate and weather research. Some scientists have raised concerns about the lack of support in program management, technological innovation, and critical instrumentation for Earth observations. The House bill proposed $400 million for marine habitat restoration and improving marine ecology, with uncertainty on R&D funding allocation. The Senate recommended $1.022 billion for NOAA, including $377 million for the ORF account, with $645 million for procurement and construction, including $70 million for supercomputing activities related to climate research.

The Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2009 provided funding for NASA activities at the FY2008 rate until March 11, 2009. The Vision for Space Exploration, endorsed by Congress, includes goals such as retiring the space shuttle by 2010, completing the International Space Station by 2017, and sending humans to Mars. NASA is developing Orion and Ares I for crewed flights, with the first expected in March 2015. The FY2009 budget request included increases for Vision-related programs. The Obama Administration's potential changes to the Vision are uncertain. The FY2009 budget request included increases for Vision-related programs, with Constellation Systems seeing a $576 million increase and the International Space Station receiving a $247 million increase. Science and Aeronautics programs saw decreases. The Senate and House committees recommended varying amounts for Constellation Systems, while all provided more funding than requested for the International Space Station, Science, and Aeronautics. The FY2009 budget request included increases for Vision-related programs, with Constellation Systems and the International Space Station receiving funding boosts. Science programs saw a nearly flat request, with increases for Earth Science and Planetary Science offset by a decrease for Astrophysics. The request included funds for the NASA/DOE Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) but not for the Space Interferometer Mission (SIM). Both House and Senate committees recommended more funding than the request for Science programs. The final bill provided additional funding for Science programs, including Earth Science decadal survey missions and Mars Science Laboratory. The House and Senate recommended more funding than the request, with the final bill allocating $400 million for Science and $150 million for Aeronautics. In FY2009, the USDA received $2.280 billion for research and education activities, a 12.0% decrease from the previous year. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) received $1.050 billion, $117.2 million less than the previous year. The ARS focuses on food and fiber production, new product development, biocontrols for pest management, and support for USDA programs. The Administration proposed a $41.0 million reduction in funding for ARS. The Administration proposed a reduction of $41.0 million in funding for the ARS, along with discontinuation and redirection of $105.0 million in lower priority programs. The redirected funds will focus on critical research priorities such as livestock production, food safety, crop protection, and human nutrition. Additionally, $13.2 million was allocated for buildings and facilities in the FY2009 request for ARS. Funding from the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) supports research, education, and outreach at various institutions including land-grant universities and historically black colleges. The FY2009 budget for CSREES included funding distribution to states through competitive awards, formula funding, and special grants. The budget proposed a decrease of $189.7 million, with reductions in Congressional add-ons and lower priority programs. Funding for Agricultural Experiment Stations and 1890 formula programs saw slight decreases. The primary goal was to expand competitive, peer-reviewed research programs, including modifications to the Hatch formula program. The FY2009 budget proposed significant changes to research funding, including expanding the multistate research programs' share of Hatch funds to 70.0% and allocating McIntire-Stennis funds for a competitively awarded multi-state research program. Extension programs would also be strengthened through competitively awarded grants to address national issues like agricultural security and pest risk management. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) would receive $256.5 million, a $65.6 million increase from the previous year. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) received a $65.6 million increase in funding for FY2009.

It included $1,187.2 million for ARS and $1,222.2 million for CSREES. President Bush proposed $617 million for DOI R&D in FY2009, with USGS receiving $546 million, a decrease from FY2008 levels. R&D funding for three USGS research divisions would have declined in FY2009, while funding for the Biological Research Division would have remained flat. A new program, Global Change, received $7.4 million in FY2008 and President Bush proposed a 260.1% increase to $26.6 million for FY2009. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 provided continuing appropriations for FY2009 at FY2008 levels until March 6, 2009. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) was introduced in the House on February 23, 2009, and passed two days later. H.R. 1105 was passed by the Senate on March 10 without amendment, and President Obama signed the act on March 11. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) provided $140 million for various projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) allocated $140 million for repair, construction, and restoration activities, equipment upgrades, national map activities, and other improvement projects. USGS Geographic Research focuses on mapping the nation's terrain, monitoring changes, and analyzing reasons for these changes. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposed a $5.6 million cut to Geographic Research R&D funding. In FY2009, funding for Geological Resources R&D would decrease by $33.4 million (-15.2 percent) to $185.5 million from its estimated FY2008 level of $218.8 million. The Geological Resources Program assesses energy and mineral resources, researches geological processes, and conducts important geological hazards research. USGS Water Resources R&D focuses on water availability, quality, and flood hazards. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposed a $21.4 million cut for Water Resources R&D. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposed a $21.4 million cut for Water Resources R&D, reducing it to $106.7 million from its FY2008 level of $128.1 million. The USGS Biological Research program, with a budget increase of $0.5 million to $180.3 million, supports research on fish, wildlife, and natural habitats through various research centers and field stations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducts research and development activities to support decisions on environmental pollution control. EPA's scientific research is funded through the Science and Technology (S&T) appropriations account, which receives funding from a base appropriation and a transfer from the Hazardous Substance Superfund account. The Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 provided $816.5 million for EPA's Science and Technology account, with a $30.7 million increase from FY2008. This accounted for nearly 11% of the total $7.64 billion provided for the agency in FY2009. The full committee markups for funding Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for FY2009 were postponed. No bills were introduced prior to the enactment of P.L. 110-329 and P.L. 111-6, which extended continuing appropriations for FY2009. Funding for EPA research programs in FY2009 varied compared to FY2008 and President Bush's requested amounts. The largest increase in funding was for EPA homeland security activities. The FY2009 enacted appropriation for EPA Science and Technology activities saw a 29% increase from FY2008 levels, totaling $41.9 million. Research within the S&T account is conducted by various entities, including EPA's own laboratories and facilities, managed primarily by the Office of Research and Development (ORD). The EPA Science and Technology (S&T) account funds research conducted by various entities within the agency, including research laboratories and grants. It also supports applied science and technology activities through program offices like the Office of Water. The S&T account incorporates elements of the former EPA Research and Development (R&D) account and other accounts that were in place until FY1996. The Office of Management and Budget reports budget authority amounts for R&D at EPA, but does not explicitly relate them to specific program activities. EPA's recent annual appropriations have been requested. The EPA's annual appropriations are requested, considered, and enacted through eight statutory appropriations accounts established by Congress in FY1996. Funding for agency laboratories and facilities, including rent, utilities, and security, has shifted from the Environmental Programs and Management account to the Science and Technology account since FY2007. This change impacts comparisons of S&T appropriations over time. The adequacy of funding for scientific research at EPA has been a concern for some Members of Congress and stakeholders. There is ongoing debate about the downward trend in federal resources for scientific research and whether regulatory actions are based on \"sound science.\" Title VII of Division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated $7.22 billion for EPA, but did not include funding for research activities. The funding included $6 billion for state grants for water infrastructure projects, $100 million for Brownfield cleanup grants, $300 million for Diesel Emission Reduction Act grants, $600 million for remedial cleanup projects at non-federal sites, and $200 million for cleanup grants under the Leaking. President Bush requested $901 million for Department of Transportation (DOT) R&D in FY2009, an increase of approximately $78 million (9.5%) from FY2008 funding. DOT receives R&D funding from the Transportation Trust Fund through authorization legislation like SAFETEA-LU. No final FY2009 appropriations legislation was enacted. President Bush's FY2009 request for Department of Transportation R&D was $78 million higher than FY2008 funding. The Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 provided $823 million for DOT R&D, $78 million less than the request. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2009 did not provide sufficient detail for a complete analysis of the R&D funding for the Department of Transportation. The bill expired at the end of the 110th Congress, and details on R&D funding were not publicly available. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) accounted for over 80% of DOT's R&D funding request in FY2009. President Bush requested $392.8 million for FHWA R&D, a 5.4% increase from FY2008. Research programs focus on safety, congestion reduction, mobility improvement, and cost-effectiveness of highway infrastructure investments. In FY2009, FHWA's budget would have provided $166.9 million for R&D, an increase of $23 million (16%) from FY2008. Additionally, $51.3 million was allocated for R&D for the Intelligent Transportation Systems program, an increase of $7.5 million (17%) from FY2008. However, there were decreases in R&D funds for State Planning and Research. President Bush requested $335.0 million for FAA R&D, a 23.2% increase from FY2008. The FY2009 budget for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) R&D was $335.0 million, with an increase in funding for NextGen Air Transportation System (NextGen) to address air traffic growth and improve efficiency. Funding for NextGen R&D under Research, Engineering, and Development increased from $24.3 million in FY2008 to $56.5 million in FY2009, with an additional $69.4 million allocated for systems development and infrastructure under ATO. S.Rept. 110-418 reported that S. 3261 (110 th Congress) provided $171 million for FAA's Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) activity, approximately equal to President Bush's request. FAA's RE&D activity accounts for approximately one-half of the agency's total overall R&D funding. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposed $16.8 million in R&D funding for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), up $4.9 million over the FY2008 level. No funding was provided to the Department of Transportation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) for research, development, equipment, facilities, or related activities."
