    "content": "International trade is crucial for the world and U.S. economies, but it also poses challenges for trade-sensitive sectors. Congress closely monitors U.S. trade performance due to concerns about large trade deficits impacting economic growth, unemployment, deindustrialization, and financial stability. This report analyzes the trade deficit using mainstream economic analysis to understand the macroeconomic forces causing imbalances. The report evaluates economic concerns about trade deficits and examines policy responses to trade imbalances. The current account balance measures international transactions with three components: goods and services balance, investment income balance, and net unilateral transfers. Goods are tangible items, services are intangible output, income transactions involve international investments, and unilateral transfers are one-sided exchanges. The current account balance measures international transactions with three components: goods and services balance, investment income balance, and net unilateral transfers. For the United States, the current account deficit is largely due to a goods and services deficit, making the terms current account deficit and trade deficit interchangeable. Australia has a large current account deficit due to investment income deficit. It is important to distinguish between bilateral and multilateral trade balances. Bilateral balances are between two countries, while multilateral balances are across all trading partners. Even if the US current account was balanced, it would still have bilateral imbalances with individual trading partners. The United States has experienced rising current account deficits since the 1980s, leading to increasing surpluses abroad. In 2009, the US trade deficit decreased to $378 billion, down from $706 billion in 2008. The US trade deficit decreased to 2.7% in 2009 from 4.9% in 2008 and a record high of 6.1% in 2006, largely due to the recent recession. The Bretton Woods system constrained trade post-WWII until 1973, but its collapse led to persistent deficits since the 1980s, not solely due to trade barriers or foreign dumping. Trade imbalances are not caused by rising trade barriers or foreign dumping but by macroeconomic spending and saving behavior. Since the 1980s, the US has been spending beyond its output, leading to a current account deficit. Understanding balance of payments accounting conventions is crucial to grasp the forces behind these deficits. The external balance is crucial for a country's economy, requiring the current account to equal the negative of the financial account. This means that a current account deficit (buying more goods and services than selling) must be balanced by a financial account surplus (net inflow of capital). This balance is essential for understanding trade imbalances caused by macroeconomic spending and saving behavior. A country with a current account surplus (selling more goods and services than buying) will have a financial account deficit (buying more assets than selling). The balance between the current account and financial account is crucial for understanding trade imbalances. The external balance identity links current account balance with international capital flows, requiring asset exports to exceed imports to pay for all imports. The internal balance identity states that a country's current account balance equals the difference between gross saving and investment. The internal balance identity explains that a country's current account balance is determined by the difference between gross saving and investment. This relationship is derived from the national income and product accounts, where GDP equals consumption, government spending, investment, and exports minus imports. The simplified expression shows that a current account imbalance is matched by an imbalance between domestic saving and investment. The current account imbalance is always matched by an imbalance between domestic saving and investment, indicating a net inflow or outflow of output from or to the rest of the world. The internal balance identity links the current account to domestic spending and saving activity, showing that economic forces must reconcile the two balances. The equation CA=-FA= (S-I) represents the need to satisfy both identities, highlighting the connection between the current account balance, international trade in assets, and domestic spending and saving behavior. The identities linking current account balance to domestic spending and saving behavior do not establish causality. Changes in current account could induce changes in financial account, affecting domestic saving and investment. Causality can only be determined through an empirical economic model. The standard model suggests domestic saving-investment balance as the cause of current account balance. In today's global economy, the domestic saving-investment balance influences the current account balance through international financial flows. Imbalances between saving and investment lead to capital inflows or outflows, affecting the current account deficit or surplus. This section examines the economic forces behind the adjustments needed for internal and external economic balance, including investment-saving imbalances and cross-border asset flows impacting the current account balance. The flow of capital between countries and changes in the current account balance are influenced by domestic saving-investment imbalances. In a global economy with open markets, capital flows can help reconcile these imbalances. Capital inflows allow countries with a saving shortfall to use foreign savings for domestic investment, while capital outflows enable countries with excess savings to invest abroad. This process helps achieve a saving-investment balance for both nations. Global saving equals global investment, with differences in real interest rates between economies driving saving flows between countries. A nation with a surplus of domestic saving will have low domestic interest rates, leading to some saving flowing outward for more profitable investment opportunities abroad. Conversely, a nation with a saving shortfall will tend to invest abroad. The economy with low domestic saving will have high interest rates, attracting foreign saving to finance domestic investment. Without international capital flows, domestic investment would be limited to domestic saving, leading to a balanced current account. The Bretton Woods system maintained this balance through controls on capital flows until its collapse in 1971. The Bretton Woods system collapsed in 1971 due to the decline in its control of cross-border capital flows, leading to the inability to maintain fixed exchange rates. Exchange rates for advanced economies are primarily determined by global foreign exchange markets, where changes in demand and supply of national currencies cause currency values to fluctuate. The investor's exchange of home currency for dollars to buy assets increases demand for dollars, raising the exchange rate. This leads to a higher value of the dollar, impacting exports and imports. Exchange rates adjust to balance current account deficits or surpluses caused by capital flows. The standard model of international macroeconomics predicts that countries with domestic saving exceeding domestic investment will run a current account surplus, while those with a shortfall of domestic saving relative to investment will run a current account deficit. Deficits and surpluses are co-determined by international asset market transactions and goods and services market transactions, influencing the demand and supply of dollars on foreign exchange markets. Economists argue that asset market transactions dominate and dictate the exchange rate's movement due to their scale and speed. Electronic exchanges allow for instant transfers and a high volume of transactions. U.S. international asset transactions have been significantly larger than needed to finance trade deficits in recent years. For example, in 2007, U.S. residents purchased $1.2 trillion in foreign assets while foreign residents purchased $1.9 trillion in U.S. assets, exceeding the $731 billion trade deficit. States could have financed the $731 billion trade deficit in a year through asset sales to foreigners. U.S. and foreign investors engaged in over $2 trillion of asset transactions, indicating that asset transactions have been the determining force in the exchange rate movement. The dollar appreciated from 1994 to 2002 as the trade deficit grew, contrary to what would be expected if goods market transactions were the determining force. Countries with a net inflow of foreign capital tend to see their exchange rate appreciate, while those with a net capital outflow tend to see depreciation. Interest rate differentials between countries also play a significant role in exchange rate movements. Interest rates between countries influence capital flows, but other factors like investor perception of risk and return can also affect flows. Diversification across asset types and currencies is advised to spread risk and avoid overexposure. Foreign investors may reconsider accumulating dollar assets if the risk outweighs the reward. Foreign investors may slow or halt their purchase of dollar-denominated assets to improve portfolio diversity. With over $8 trillion in U.S. assets in foreign portfolios, achieving diversification is crucial. The safe-haven effect also influences capital flows, as investors seek low-risk options in stable economies like the United States. The safe-haven effect influences capital flows as investors seek low-risk options in stable economies like the United States, leading to fluctuations in the demand for Treasury securities and the value of the dollar. Foreign investors prefer deep and liquid asset markets, with the U.S. offering a variety of instruments and large, liquid markets capable of handling significant fund flows. The special status of U.S. asset markets allows for large capital inflows with minimal impact on the dollar's price. Foreign investors are attracted to U.S. Treasury securities, influencing exchange rate expectations. Adjustments for expected future dollar depreciation are crucial for calculating expected returns in investors' home currencies. The accumulation of foreign exchange reserves in readily exchangeable currencies like the dollar serves as a store of international liquidity to cope with currency crises arising from volatile private capital flows. Foreign exchange reserves are crucial for developing economies to finance balance-of-payments deficits and withstand financial crises. Official purchases are used to counter unwanted exchange rate changes, with China and other East Asian economies actively buying and selling foreign assets to maintain currency stability. The IMF estimates global reserves to be essential for economic stability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates global foreign exchange reserves to be about $8 trillion in 2009, with 61% in dollar-denominated assets. The U.S. Treasury reports official holdings of Treasury securities at $2.7 trillion, reflecting the dollar's role as the dominant reserve currency. Foreign central banks, particularly China, hold significant amounts of dollar assets, influencing U.S. financial markets and the economy. The largest holder of foreign exchange reserves is China with $2.5 trillion, followed by Japan with $1 trillion. Other countries like Korea, India, Russia, and Brazil also have significant holdings. The United States has comparatively small official holdings at about $130 billion. A domestic saving-investment imbalance can occur due to rising investment or falling saving rates. The US has a low rate of gross saving compared to Western Europe and Japan, with a pattern of falling saving rates since the 1970s. In Western Europe and Japan, both saving and investment rates fell, leading to no significant change in their current account balances. In contrast, the United States saw a decrease in saving rates while investment rates remained stable or increased, resulting in larger current account deficits. This imbalance was fueled by a global increase in saving outside of advanced economies not absorbed by domestic investment. The decline in saving and investment rates in Western Europe and Japan since the 1970s is believed to be the main reason for the decrease in their current account balances. In the United States, the household saving rate sharply declined from near 10% in the 1970s to near zero by 2005. The collapse of the U.S. household saving rate over the past 25 years has been a subject of much economic research, with no single theory fully explaining the phenomenon. Capital gains on real estate, stocks, and other investments in the 1990s significantly increased household wealth, reducing the need to save. The decline in national saving rates in the United States can be attributed to various factors such as increased government spending on Medicare and Social Security, streamlined credit market vehicles like credit cards and home equity loans, and changes in government saving due to fluctuating budget deficits and surpluses. These factors have led to a decrease in the overall saving rate over time. The national saving rate in the United States declined due to factors like increased government spending, credit market changes, and fluctuating budget deficits. From 2001 to 2007, budget deficits contributed to pushing the national saving rate down. Table 2 illustrates U.S. gross saving, gross investment, and net capital inflows since 2000. The economy saw a rise in investment rates post the 2001 recession, while saving rates remained stagnant, leading to a growing saving-investment imbalance and current account deficit, peaking in 2006. In 2006, the U.S. saw a stabilization in the saving-investment gap and trade deficits despite strong economic growth. The saving-investment imbalance was stabilized by increased business and government saving. Following the financial crisis and recession from 2007 to 2009, both saving and investment rates decreased, with a larger drop in the investment rate leading to a reduction in the saving-investment imbalance and current account deficit. Trade deficits and capital inflows can have both economic benefits and costs. Trade deficits and capital inflows can bring economic benefits that exceed the costs. Standard economic theory suggests that these deficits can lead to a more efficient allocation of saving and consumption over time through intertemporal exchanges. When a nation borrows from abroad for current investments, it can support a higher rate of investment than domestic saving alone could finance. When a nation borrows from abroad for investments, it can support a higher rate of investment than domestic saving alone could finance. This international asset transaction allows for a more global utilization of savings, efficient allocation of investment spending, and preferred distribution of spending over time. Net borrowers run trade deficits, while net lenders run trade surpluses, benefiting both parties economically. Trade deficits can be sustained for many years without negative effects as long as external borrowing and debt service costs do not exceed the economy's productive potential. The inflow of foreign capital used to finance domestic investment can increase the economy's productive capital, leading to higher output and wages. The U.S. trade deficits in the 1990s were a result of a rising investment rate outpacing a rising saving rate. The U.S. trade deficits in the 1990s were a result of the investment rate outpacing the saving rate. The current account deficit and capital inflow are symptoms of a low national saving rate. The imbalance is due to the domestic saving rate falling relative to the domestic investment rate, leading to increased consumption financed by foreign capital. This raises concerns about economic short-sightedness in funding retirement needs. The trade deficit may indicate economic short-sightedness in meeting future obligations, requiring greater saving and less consumption. A higher saving rate could reduce the trade deficit, but a decline without increased domestic saving could lead to decreased investment, slowing economic growth and making it harder to fund internal and external demands. Concerns arise about the instability of external finance sources if foreign investors withdraw funds, causing interest rates to rise and disrupting the economy. The fear of a \"dollar crash\" scenario arises from perceptions of unsustainable foreign debt in the U.S. economy, leading to expectations of a significant depreciation of the dollar. This could trigger a run on the dollar, causing a disorderly depreciation and sharp rise in interest rates. This would dampen spending in interest-sensitive sectors and stress the economy. In the United States, interest rates may impact spending in interest-sensitive sectors and financial markets. Despite potential positive effects like increased export sales and stimulus, a dollar crash scenario could have immediate negative consequences. However, a disorderly adjustment is unlikely due to the U.S. economy's productivity and innovation, offering higher returns with lower risk compared to Europe or Japan. Foreign demand for dollar assets strengthened during the recent financial crisis and recession, making the return on these assets more reliable than higher yielding assets of emerging economies. The demand for dollar assets is expected to remain strong, supported by long-term foreign investments in the United States that are stable and less sensitive to short-term economic changes. China and other emerging economies are tied to export-driven economic development programs. The economies are closely linked to export-driven development programs, especially to the American market. To maintain currency competitiveness, they will continue to hold large amounts of dollar assets, putting upward pressure on the dollar and downward pressure on U.S. interest rates. There is concern about a potential diversification out of dollar assets by China, which could lead to a collapse of the dollar, higher U.S. interest rates, and reduced economic activity. However, China is unlikely to do this as it would also devalue its remaining dollar assets. The global market may fall sharply, eroding the value of dollar assets. China is deterred from diversifying due to potential losses and negative effects on the global economy. The growing pool of world savings, including inflows from China, India, and oil-exporting countries, will likely continue to attract demand for dollar assets. The dollar's status as the world economy's reserve currency and its market size and stability make it a preferred choice for international investors seeking liquidity and a store of value. The strong international demand for dollar assets is supported by markets and the needs of investors for liquidity and a store of value. A depreciating dollar could jeopardize its reserve currency status. Trade deficits allow nations to spend beyond domestic output by importing foreign goods, but do not necessarily reduce domestic production. Domestic industries may operate at full capacity even with large inflows of foreign products. Trade deficits do not lead to a net reduction of domestic output and employment due to intra-industry trade in intermediate products and product differentiation leading to specialization across countries. This structure of production increases both domestic output and imported foreign output of necessary components, regardless of capacity utilization. Standard economic analysis shows that trade deficits do not result in a net loss of output or jobs in the economy. Instead, they lead to a shift in the composition of output and employment. The trade deficit can impact the exchange rate, encouraging the substitution of foreign goods for domestic ones. However, the capital inflow associated with the deficit can stimulate other parts of the economy. The Federal Reserve uses monetary policy to maintain full employment levels, minimizing deviations during recessions. During economic expansions, trade deficits do not necessarily reduce total economic activity but can change the composition of domestic output and employment. For example, from 2001 to 2007, despite a $400 billion increase in the trade deficit, the unemployment rate decreased from 6% to 4.6% and civilian employment rose from 136 million to 144 million workers. The rising exchange rate due to the net inflow of capital can impact the economy. The rising exchange rate from foreign capital inflow can shift resources towards importing foreign goods, negatively affecting the output and employment of U.S. tradable goods sectors like manufacturing. From 2000 to 2007, while the overall economy grew at a 2.5% annual rate, the manufacturing sector only grew at 0.5%, leading to a decline in manufacturing employment. During the 2000-2007 period, manufacturing employment in the United States fell by 3.5 million jobs due to slow growth in manufacturing output and increased foreign competition, leading to a trade deficit in manufactures. During the 2000-2007 period, manufacturing employment in the United States fell by 3.5 million jobs due to slow growth in output and increased foreign competition, leading to a trade deficit in manufactures. The trade deficit increased by about $230 billion, potentially displacing about 2 million jobs in the manufacturing sector. The 1990-2000 period also saw a similar increase in the trade deficit, but with a critical difference in the strength of the dollar. The rise of the dollar after 1996 led to a relative price decrease of U.S. manufactured goods compared to foreign goods, impacting trade flows with a time lag. The dollar's appreciation continued until early 2002, affecting the output of the U.S. manufacturing sector. Despite a 22% fall in the dollar by 2007, the impact on trade flows was not evident until that year. The positive impacts on the manufacturing sector from trade flows began to be outweighed by the negative effects of the recession in 2008. Economists argue that it is more beneficial to encourage adjustment to trade effects than to protect sectors. Government programs offer trade adjustment assistance, and a policy response to reduce the trade deficit may not be necessary if its effects are overall beneficial. An orderly reduction in foreign investors' demand for dollar assets could naturally decrease the trade deficit. The adjustment to trade effects may not be achieved on the best terms for the United States, as it could lead to a reduction in domestic investment rather than an increase in domestic saving. Macroeconomic policies are more effective in reducing the trade deficit than traditional trade-policy responses. To effectively reduce the trade deficit, policies must address saving-investment imbalances at home and abroad. Trade policy tools alone would not significantly change the saving-investment imbalances that cause the trade deficit. The domestic saving-investment imbalance, influenced by macroeconomic policy tools, can impact the trade balance. Trade policy actions directly affect imports and exports but do not change the trade balance. Actions targeting one side of the trade equation can lead to effects on the exchange rate and the other side of the equation. Trade policy actions can impact the exchange rate and the trade balance. For example, using tariffs or quotas to reduce imports can appreciate the dollar, reduce export sales, and trade levels. Similarly, export subsidies can stimulate exports but may not change the trade balance. Exchange rate changes can offset the effects of trade policy actions on trade balance. To efficiently reduce or eliminate the U.S. trade deficit, economists argue for a rebalancing of global spending. This would involve the United States reducing domestic spending while economies with trade surpluses increase domestic spending. This rebalancing could lead to a fall in domestic investment rates. The United States faces three alternatives to address the trade deficit: a decrease in domestic investment, an increase in domestic saving, or a combination of both. Regardless, the dollar will need to depreciate to induce changes in spending at home and abroad. Macroeconomic policy, such as monetary policy, can influence saving and spending flows to reduce the trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit in 2008 and 2009 had negative effects on economic growth. Government fiscal decisions impact budget deficits and public saving levels. In the late 1990s, a rise in overall saving was due to a federal budget surplus. Since 2000, budget deficits have increased. To eliminate the trade deficit, a substantial and sustained budget surplus is needed. The government would need a substantial budget surplus to reduce the trade deficit, but with ongoing federal borrowing, this seems unlikely. Proposals to increase private saving include using the tax code to incentivize saving, but the effects on the saving-investment balance are uncertain. Other proposals like individual retirement accounts may only shift saving without increasing overall saving. The recent economic downturn has led to a slight increase in personal saving, but its long-term sustainability is uncertain. The increase in personal saving may not be enough to offset the fall in public saving caused by deficit spending. As domestic investment rises with economic recovery, the saving-investment imbalance may worsen, leading to a potential increase in the trade deficit. Foreign economic policy can impact efforts to reduce the trade deficit. The United States aims to reduce its trade deficit and support its manufacturing sector. The deficit reflects both American overspending and foreign underspending. To address this, countries with trade surpluses should adjust their policies to balance spending with output. This will help the U.S. decrease its reliance on imports. The U.S. aims to reduce its trade deficit by balancing spending with output. Foreign economies may need to allow their currencies to appreciate to help shrink the deficit. If foreign policies counter U.S. efforts to raise domestic saving, a larger dollar depreciation may be needed. Effective global rebalancing requires significant adjustments in surplus economies like Germany, Japan, and China. Constraints may limit their ability to save less and spend more, potentially preventing currency appreciation. Bilateral imbalances with the United States are likely even if the current account is balanced, reflecting differences in comparative advantage and production structures. Germany's inability to adjust its exchange rate independently within the eurozone reduces flexibility. The effects of recession have limited room for fiscal expansion in Japan and Germany. China's trade surplus with the US could positively impact the US economic recovery. China's economic growth has remained strong, with expected strong aggregate demand in the medium term. China's exchange rate and trade balance have been influenced by domestic spending and export-led growth model. China allowed the renminbi to appreciate but re-pegged it to the dollar during the global financial crisis. There are uncertainties about whether a greater share of spending will be domestic demand, affecting China's trade surplus. China's exchange rate is pegged to the dollar to maintain high external demand. It is uncertain if China will move away from this model to boost domestic demand. Economic policy abroad may not focus on rebalancing domestic spending to reduce the U.S. current account deficit. A larger real depreciation of the dollar might be needed to decrease the trade deficit, but this could be risky due to potential market disruptions and uneven currency falls. The dollar has depreciated unevenly against other currencies, with China limiting the strengthening of the renminbi relative to the dollar. This imbalance places more burden on the euro area and other economies with freely floating currencies. The trade deficit could decrease if foreign investors diversify away from dollar assets, reducing the capital inflow and trade deficit. The depreciation of the dollar against other currencies, particularly due to reduced demand for dollar assets by foreign investors, has led to a decline in the US trade deficit since 2002. However, the sustainability of this adjustment during the current economic expansion is uncertain. If the decrease in capital inflow is not balanced by an increase in domestic savings, it could result in a reduction in domestic investment, potentially slowing long-term economic growth. The trade deficit's direction in the near future will depend on the net capital flows into and out of the American economy, influenced by risk and reward factors. If foreign investors view further investment in the US as riskier, the capital inflow will decrease, lowering the trade deficit. Conversely, if the rate of return from US assets becomes more attractive, the capital inflow could increase, raising the trade deficit. A US recovery is expected to include a rebound in investment spending. Increased investment spending without a corresponding increase in domestic saving may lead to a rise in the trade deficit. Private saving rate is expected to be higher post-recession, but government saving rate may be lower. Private investor behavior is influenced by available investment alternatives, with global options affected by economic recoveries. Europe and Japan are expected to rebound slower than the US, while emerging markets, especially in Asia, are anticipated to outpace developed economies. Most emerging markets in Asia are projected to surpass developed economies like the United States. The adequacy of diversification in foreign suppliers' asset holdings, which already include substantial dollar balances, could impact the U.S. economy. Diversification may slow the accumulation of dollar assets, not lead to a mass sell-off. Private capital inflows weakened between 2002 and 2007 due to diversification. It is uncertain if foreign central banks will continue to increase their large holdings of dollar assets. The recent financial crisis, policy responses, and global economic weakness make projections for U.S. trade uncertain. Projections for the U.S. trade deficit's near-term path carry uncertainty due to negative shocks and the global economy's weakened state. Most forecasts show the U.S. economy on a recovery path in 2010 and beyond, with varying paces among forecasters. The IMF predicts a modest increase in the U.S. current account deficit for 2010 to $487 billion, rising to $638 billion by 2015 as investment spending rebounds stronger than domestic saving. The U.S. trade deficit is projected to increase to $638 billion by 2015, remaining stable at around 3.5% of GDP. Foreign investors find the U.S. attractive due to weaker global recovery, leading to net capital inflows. Global Insight forecasts a larger increase in the trade deficit compared to the IMF, reaching $641 billion in 2012. The trade deficit in the U.S. is projected to increase to $638 billion by 2015, reaching around 3.5% of GDP. The sharper rise in the trade deficit is driven by a faster-paced recovery and stronger domestic investment spending, along with low domestic saving. Slower-paced recoveries in other major economies lead to an inflow of foreign capital."
