    "content": "Emoji suggestion systems based on typed text aim to enhance text messaging by increasing emoji usage. A study compared lexical and semantic emoji suggestions, finding that both increased emoji usage significantly. However, the suggestion mechanisms did not impact the chatting experience. Design guidelines for future emoji suggestion systems were formulated based on the study findings. Emojis are widely used in text-based communication, with billions sent daily. Manual emoji selection can be tedious, leading to the development of emoji suggestion systems to improve the entry process. Products that suggest emojis automatically have made the emoji entry process more seamless. These products come in two variations - lexical and semantic suggestions. Lexical suggestions show relevant emojis based on recent keywords typed by the user, while semantic suggestions propose emojis based on the message's content meaning. The impact of different emoji suggestion systems on emoji usage, usability, engagement, and conversation clarity is not well explored. The study implemented a keyboard with lexical and semantic emoji suggestions to evaluate their performance. Results showed that semantic suggestions were perceived as more relevant. An in-lab study and a 15-day field deployment were conducted to assess emoji usage in real-world settings. The study conducted a 15-day field deployment to evaluate emoji suggestion systems, finding that semantic suggestions increased emoji usage and were perceived as more relevant than lexical suggestions. However, neither suggestion type significantly impacted participants' overall chat experience. The study's contributions include results from online and in-lab studies comparing suggestion relevance, as well as design guidelines for emoji suggestion systems. Emoji-related research has become more prominent as emojis have grown in number and popularity. Emojis usage has steadily increased since emojis were introduced to the Unicode Standard in 2009. Emojis represent richer information than plain text and are easier to share than images, giving them certain advantages over other forms of communication. According to a report by Swiftkey in 2015, users inputted over one billion emojis in a four-month period. Traditional \"face\" emojis comprised nearly 60% of all emojis sent, with roughly 70% expressing positive emotions. Emojis are used to convey various emotions, and the number used in a message can determine the sender's arousal. Emoji combinations can convey more complex expressions. Research found three major reasons for emoji use: to provide emotional or situational information, change the tone of a message, and engage the recipient to maintain their relationship. Emojis are used to convey emotions and can change the tone of a message. People personalize their use of emojis, like using a pizza emoji to express love. There are over 2,800 emojis, making visually searching for them tedious. Emoji entry techniques like grouped enumeration are common on keyboards. EmojiZoom displays all emojis at once. Searching and selecting emojis can be tedious. EmojiZoom displays all emojis at once, but querying techniques like text search or sketching in keyboards like Gboard are slow. Suggestion-based input methods, like Dango, offer semantic emoji suggestions based on typed text. The user can tap on an icon to see more emoji options suggested based on semantic content. This technique is similar to Dango's semantic suggestion method, offering affective emojis like faces. Google's Smart Reply also generates replies with emojis based on conversation context. Emojis in the keyboard implementation are linked with the meanings of typed messages using DeepMoji by Felbo et al. The model by Felbo et al. used in this paper had limitations in predicting emojis based on emotions rather than meanings. It was trained for only 64 emojis, mostly faces. Our Android keyboard, built using AnySoftKeyboard, incorporates emoji suggestions based on semantic content. The Android keyboard replaces word suggestions with emoji suggestions. Users can input special characters or numbers using designated buttons. Emojis are suggested after typing a word, with five options presented using the DeepMoji model. The keyboard sends a request to a remote server for emoji suggestions. The keyboard sends an HTTP POST request to the server for emoji suggestions when the user finishes typing a word. The server returns the top-five related emojis based on lexical suggestion, using an open-source emoji library. If no match is found, the keyboard presents the most recent suggestions. The keyboard updates emoji suggestions after the user finishes typing each word, not just keywords. Semantic suggestion returns a fixed number of emojis, while lexical suggestion can produce a variable number. The frequency of emoji suggestion updates is not forced to be the same for both mechanisms. Our keyboard logs input statistics related to text and emoji entry, including typed characters, deleted characters, manually added emojis, and emojis selected from suggestion lists. A preliminary crowd-sourced experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of lexical and semantic emoji suggestion systems in terms of human-perceived accuracy. The study quantified the human-perceived accuracy of emoji suggestion mechanisms by sampling 50 tweets from the Sentiment140 dataset. Respondents on Amazon Mechanical Turk were asked to select relevant emojis for each tweet without knowing different suggestion mechanisms were used. Results showed overall relevance of selected emojis divided by total shown, with 5,000 total emojis. The study analyzed the accuracy of emoji suggestion systems using 50 tweets from the Sentiment140 dataset. Respondents evaluated 5,000 total emojis, with 52.5% alignment for semantic suggestions and 21.6% for lexical suggestions. Semantic suggestions provided relevant emojis 94.6% of the time, while lexical suggestions only did so 32.6% of the time. The study compared emoji suggestion systems using 50 tweets, with semantic suggestions being more relevant in 47 out of 50 cases. This confirmed the hypothesis that semantic suggestions are perceived as more relevant than lexical suggestions. The study did not explore how these suggestion mechanisms impact the chatting experience, leading to a planned laboratory experiment to investigate this further. The study recruited 26 participants aged 18-34, divided into 13 pairs who did not know each other. Each participant received $8 USD for a 30-minute study using Nexus 6P smartphones with a specific keyboard installed. Wechat 6 was used for instant messaging. Participants in the study used Wechat 6 for instant messaging to verify data logged by a mobile keyboard. They engaged in three 10-minute chat sessions with another participant, each session assigned to a different emoji suggestion condition. The participants were instructed to avoid using Wechat's built-in emoji button to ensure logging functionality. The study aimed to compare emoji suggestion conditions in online chat conversations. The study compared emoji suggestion conditions in online chat conversations using Wechat 6. Participants engaged in three chat sessions with different emoji suggestion conditions. They were instructed not to use Wechat's built-in emoji button to ensure logging functionality. The questionnaire assessed online chatting and emoji use behavior, with Likert scale answers provided. The participants in the study found the emoji suggestion system to be useful and easy to use. They preferred it over the system with no suggestions. The usability survey used Likert scales to gather feedback on the emoji suggestion keyboards. Participants filled out questionnaires before and after each chat session to assess their engagement and perceived expressiveness and clarity. The questionnaires were based on prior work on computer-mediated communication. Participants in the study used lexical or semantic suggestions in a session and completed a usability questionnaire adapted from the SUS survey. They were interviewed with open-ended questions about their experience with suggestion keyboards in online chatting. The study had a single-factor three-level design with suggestion mechanisms as the independent variable. Statistical analyses were used for character and emoji count measures. The study compared three levels of the Suggestion factor: no suggestions, lexical suggestions, and semantic suggestions. One pair of participants was excluded for not conducting a realistic conversation, resulting in 12 valid participant pairs. Data logs and surveys were collected for analysis. In the study, data logs and surveys were collected from 24 participants to analyze their chat experience and emoji suggestion usability. Participants communicated mostly through their phones and used emojis in online conversations. Different methods were used to enter emojis, with some manually selecting from a list and others using lexical suggestions from the keyboard. Descriptive results of the logged data are provided in Table 6. The study analyzed participants' chat experience and emoji suggestion usability. Participants used emojis in online conversations, with some manually selecting from a list and others using lexical suggestions. Semantic suggestion resulted in more selected emojis than lexical suggestion. Data were analyzed using mixed model ordinal logistic regression, but there were no significant results for questions regarding the chat experience. Based on the analysis of emoji counts, different suggestion levels did not significantly affect chat experience. Participants preferred semantic suggestions over lexical ones, but overall, the suggestion type did not impact the chat experience. Participants noticed the difference in suggestion mechanisms and provided more positive feedback on semantic suggestions. Participants preferred semantic suggestions over lexical ones, mentioning convenience and time-saving aspects. Feedback indicated that semantic suggestions were more relevant and led to more emoji usage. A 15-day field deployment study also supported these findings, focusing on the usability and effects of emoji suggestion systems on everyday conversations. Participants in the study were recruited based on specific criteria and were compensated for their participation. The study involved three five-day periods, with participants using different keyboard suggestion mechanisms. During the study, participants used different keyboard suggestion mechanisms in three five-day periods. They were instructed to use the emoji suggestion system and fill out a questionnaire about online chatting and emoji usage. Usage information was logged, including Total Characters and Total Emojis. Participants in the study had their keyboards installed and configured to personal preferences. They met with a researcher after each five-day period to reconfigure the keyboard and fill out a questionnaire. The survey after the second period included questions about emoji suggestions and their impact on online communication. During the study, participants had their keyboards configured to personal preferences and met with a researcher after each period to reconfigure and fill out a questionnaire. The survey after the second period focused on emoji suggestions and their impact on online communication. 54 data logs were collected, along with 18 survey results and 54 open responses analyzed using inductive analysis. Among the 18 participants, most stated they primarily communicate with their phone. Participants in the study primarily communicated with their phones and used emojis in online conversations. They manually selected emojis from a list or used lexical suggestions from the keyboard. Those who used lexical suggestions increased their emoji usage by 31.5%, while those using semantic suggestions increased by 125.1%. The average daily emoji usage was low, with some participants using over 10 emojis per day. Results showed that emoji usage significantly increased with semantic suggestions compared to lexical suggestions over different periods. The change in emoji usage was attributed to the suggestion type rather than just time. Usability survey responses did not show significant differences between semantic and lexical suggestions. The analysis results from the online study showed that users preferred semantic emoji suggestions over lexical ones, with no significant impact on the online conversation experience. The study aimed to assess how emoji suggestion systems influence chat experiences and daily emoji usage, finding that semantic suggestions were perceived as more relevant. The study found that emoji usage had a stronger effect on senders than receivers, and the suggestion system did not impact the overall chat experience. Participants were most excited about semantic suggestions, as they found the predicted emojis related to the sentiment of their messages. During field deployment, participants used more emojis from semantic suggestions than lexical suggestions, showing the former provided more relevant emojis. Design guidelines for future emoji suggestion systems include suggesting diverse emojis and combining suggestions from multiple systems for variety. Some participants appreciated rare emojis suggested by the lexical system. Emoji suggestion systems should provide diverse emojis and combine lexical and semantic suggestions for variety. Personalization based on user preferences and usage behaviors, such as recognizing the recipient or scenario, is also important. Participants in the study preferred emoji suggestions at the end of messages to avoid distraction. The suggestion frequency differed between the semantic and lexical systems, with the former updating with each word typed and the latter updating after predefined keywords. The study aimed to measure emoji suggestion relevance independently of frequency. The study compared two emoji suggestion systems: lexical and semantic. Participants preferred emoji suggestions at the end of messages to avoid distraction. The semantic system was perceived as more relevant. The existing semantic-level suggestion model used only 64 emojis, limiting diversity. The DeepMoji model could be extended to more emojis, but the original set was chosen to align with prior research findings. Our study found that semantic emoji suggestions were used more than lexical suggestions, leading to an increase in emoji usage and preferred for their relevance to emotions. Emojis themselves, rather than the suggestion system, have the most significant impact on the chat experience. Design guidelines were offered for emoji suggestion systems to enhance text-based communications by incorporating semantic information."
