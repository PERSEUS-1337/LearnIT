    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, and President Trump signed the bill into law on December 12, 2017. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (P.L. 115-91) addresses personnel-related issues of high congressional and constituent interest. CRS will update the report to reflect enacted legislation and provides contact information for CRS analysts. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 114-328). The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were enacted before the September 11 terrorist attacks. In response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength. However, reductions began in 2011 due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. The Air Force's end-strength declined from 2004-2015 but increased in 2016 and 2017, while the Navy's end-strength declined from 2002-2012, increased in 2013, and has since remained stable. Authorized end-strengths for FY2017 and proposed end-strengths for FY2018 are shown in Figure 1. The FY2018 budget proposed no change for the Army and Marine Corps, a slight increase for the Navy, and a significant increase for the Air Force in comparison to FY2017. The final bill approved higher end-strengths for the Army and Marine Corps than the Administration's request. The Navy and Air Force end-strengths remained the same as the Administration's request. Section 402 of the House bill would adjust the minimum end-strengths required by 10 U.S.C. Section 619 to match the authorized end-strengths set in Section 401. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 16 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposed increases for the Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard, while no change was proposed for the Marine Corps Reserve, Army National Guard, and Army Reserve. The final bill approved end-strengths identical to the Administration's request for all reserve components. The final bill approved end-strengths identical to the Administration's request for all reserve components except for the Army Reserve and Army National Guard, which were approved an extra 500 personnel each. Congressional interest in military personnel costs and recruiting high-quality personnel remains a focus, particularly regarding the military pay raise. The statutory formula dictates a 2.4% increase in basic pay for 2018, unless overridden by Congress or the President. The final bill enforces the 2.4% raise for all servicemembers starting January 1, 2018. The FY2018 President's Budget requested a 2.1% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula. The pay adjustment was not adopted. Servicemembers are entitled to government-provided housing or a housing allowance, known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Some live on privatized military bases. Congress granted DOD special authorities in the mid-1990s to partner with private firms to improve housing quality. The Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) allows DOD to partner with private firms to improve housing for servicemembers. The FY2015 NDAA authorized a 1% reduction in BAH payments, with an additional 1% reduction per year through 2019. Payments to privatized housing operators are tied to BAH rates. The final bill requires the Secretary of Defense to offset the 2018 BAH reduction for MHPI housing lessors. A report on MHPI will be provided to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Recent reform proposals aim to reduce DeCA's reliance on appropriated funds while maintaining commissary benefits and revenue from DOD's NAF entities. Congress has not made significant changes to reduce the commissary subsidy. A GAO report in March 2017 highlighted DOD's lack of assurance in maintaining desired savings for commissary patrons and recommended improvements in savings rate methodology, product management efficiency, and cost-benefit analyses for service contracts and distribution options. DOD agreed with some recommendations but partially concurred with others. In FY2017, Congress authorized $1.2 billion in commissary funding. Proposed reports on cost-saving measures for military commissaries were not adopted, as previous reports were deemed sufficient. The President's FY2018 budget request included funding for the Department of Defense to operate 240 commissary stores worldwide with over 14,000 employees. The House bill authorized $1.34 billion for commissary operations, $45 million less than the Administration's proposal. The Senate proposed $1.3 billion for commissary operations in FY2018. Section 4501 authorized $1.39 billion for commissary operations, while Section 4601 allocated $40 million for the construction of a new commissary in Stuttgart. The Senate bill authorizes $40 million for the construction of a new commissary in Stuttgart, Germany. There was a provision in the Senate-passed bill regarding transportation of fresh fruit and vegetables to commissaries in the Asia-Pacific region, but it was not adopted.

The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) allows a portion of a military retiree's pay to be withheld to provide a monthly benefit to a surviving spouse. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) offsets reductions in SBP payments for spouses receiving benefits from both SBP and DIC. SSIA payments are currently $310 per month and taxable, with an extension until May 31, 2018 under the FY2017 NDAA. The NDAA extended the payment of SSIA until May 31, 2018. It includes provisions to repeal the dollar-for-dollar reduction in payments to surviving spouses and permanently extend the authority to pay SSIA with inflation adjustments starting in 2019. Additionally, modifications were made to ensure equitable treatment under the SBP for members of the uniformed services. The SBP provides treatment for members of the uniformed services covered by the modernized retirement system who elect to receive a lump sum of retired pay. Congress has enacted legislation for off-duty education and credentialing for servicemembers.

The Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and DOD Skillbridge program support servicemembers and veterans in education and employment. TAP includes preseparation counseling with specific topics required by Congress. The final bill expands some statutory requirements. The final bill expands some statutory requirements for the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) but does not adopt provisions for additional reviews and reports on servicemember transition. Conferees encourage replicating successful re-employment initiatives in states like Florida and Arizona. The final bill includes provisions to improve employment skills verification for transitioning military members and encourages replicating successful re-employment programs in states like Florida and Arizona. It also calls for assessing benefits and programs related to licensing and credentialing for servicemembers. The conference report called for GAO to assess benefits and programs available to separating servicemembers by October 1, 2018. The USMAP allows eligible servicemembers to complete civilian apprenticeships while on active duty. Program eligibility has been expanded to all uniformed servicemembers at the Secretary of Defense's discretion. The final bill did not adopt a Senate provision to broaden job training opportunities through DOD's Skillbridge program. The conference report called for GAO to assess benefits and programs available to separating servicemembers by October 1, 2018. The final bill did not adopt a Senate provision to broaden job training opportunities through DOD's Skillbridge program. The Secretary is urged to encourage other Federal agencies to participate in the SkillBridge program. Additionally, a proposal to use tuition assistance program funds for cybersecurity and computer coding skills was not adopted.

Background: In 2005, DOD issued its first department-wide sexual assault policies and procedures, following recommendations from the Joint Task Force for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. The Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) was established as a permanent oversight body for all service-level programs. Between 2012 and 2017, DOD implemented various initiatives in response to sexual assault and harassment issues. Between 2012 and 2017, DOD implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to sexual assault prevention and response. In FY2016, estimated sexual assault prevalence rates were 4.3% for women and 0.6% for men, slightly lower than in 2014. DOD is required to produce an annual report for Congress on sex-related offenses, with additional reporting requirements added in the final bill. The conferees did not adopt the definition of \"sexual coercion\" for annual reporting. They also did not adopt House Section 532, which required additional reviews of SAPR programs for the Army National Guard and Reserve components. Instead, DOD was directed to provide a briefing on the implementation of GAO's recommendations in a 2017 report on sexual assault in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. Congress has expressed concerns about the discharge character of veterans who experienced sexual trauma in the military, as psychological trauma from sexual assault can lead to negative behavioral changes. The final bill requires DOD to provide statistics on applications to Discharge Review Boards related to sex-related offenses. It also expands processes for sexual assault survivors to challenge their discharge characterization. The final bill mandates sexual assault prevention training for new accessions and requires service secretaries to provide training to enlistees in a delayed entry program. Concerns about male victims of sexual assault led to DOD implementing gender-specific treatment, such as male-only therapy groups and enhanced medical staff training. The final bill mandates sexual assault prevention training for new accessions and requires service secretaries to provide training to enlistees in a delayed entry program. Additional training for special victims' counsels on male-specific challenges for victims of sex-related offenses is also required. Senate Armed Services Committee held hearings on online sexual harassment and nonconsensual sharing of intimate images by servicemembers. General Robert B. Neller suggested a more explicit UCMJ provision to hold perpetrators of these actions accountable. The conference report includes a provision adding a punitive article to the UCMJ prohibiting the \"wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual images.\" Other potential changes to judicial process were not adopted, including a House provision that would create an open discovery rule. The Administration shares Congress' goal of preventing sexual assault in the military. While sympathetic to Section 524's intent, open file discovery for victim's counsel could hinder successful prosecution by giving defense more chances to challenge testimony. The provision was not adopted, but conferees urged the President to grant Special Victims' Counsel access to relevant case information. The DOD's child development program (CDP) provides subsidized childcare services for eligible military personnel and civilian employees' children aged birth to 12 years, benefiting around 160,000 military children worldwide. The DOD's Child Development Program (CDP) provides subsidized childcare services for eligible military personnel and civilian employees' children aged birth to 12 years worldwide. Section 558 of the final bill would require DOD to set and maintain the hours of operation of childcare development centers in a manner that considers the demands and circumstances of military service, and Section 575 requires the Secretary of Defense to report on the feasibility and advisability of certain childcare provisions by September 1, 2018. The Secretary of Defense is required to report on the feasibility of expanding childcare services, including operating hours, contracting with private-sector providers, and expanding services to National Guard and Reserves. The final bill also grants direct hire authority to recruit childcare providers for DOD facilities if there is a critical hiring need and a shortage of providers. Regulations will be prescribed for implementation. The final bill grants direct hire authority to recruit childcare providers for DOD facilities in case of critical hiring needs and shortages. Regulations will be prescribed for implementation by May 1, 2018. Additionally, the bill requires a review of pay grades for DOD childcare services provider positions to ensure fair and competitive wages. Military service academies within DOD offer free tuition, room and board, and a monthly stipend to cadets and midshipmen. Cadets and midshipmen at military service academies receive free tuition, room and board, and a monthly stipend while enrolled. They must also participate in professional development activities and summer training. Graduates are offered a commission in the military with a minimum five-year active duty commitment, which can be partially completed in the Reserve component. Prior to 2016, some cadets and midshipmen could have their active service commitment reduced under certain circumstances. Exceptional cadets or midshipmen with unique talents may be released from active duty after 2 years for professional sports, providing significant media exposure. In 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter allowed deferment for some recruits, but in 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis reinstated the pre-2016 policy. The Department reinstated the pre-2016 policy requiring two years of active service for graduates. The Senate bill proposed allowing graduates in professional sports to serve in the Selected Reserve for their five-year obligation, which the Administration strongly opposes. The final bill would require service academy graduates to complete at least two consecutive years of commissioned service before pursuing a career as a professional athlete.
