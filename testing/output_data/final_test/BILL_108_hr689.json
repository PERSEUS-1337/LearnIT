If the general rate exceeds the excess, it will be disregarded, and the general rate will be treated as the tax rate. Separately stated general sales taxes are treated as taxes paid by the consumer. The deduction amount is determined under tables prescribed by the Secretary. The tables prescribed by the Secretary for the Sales Tax Equitability Act of 2003 must reflect the provisions of the paragraph and be based on average consumption by taxpayers on a State-by-State basis, considering filing status, dependents, adjusted gross income, and State/local sales tax rates. Adjusted gross incomes are the only requirement for determining the tables. The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act, based on adjusted gross incomes up to a certain amount determined under section 68(b)."
