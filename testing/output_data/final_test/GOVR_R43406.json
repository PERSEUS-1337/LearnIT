    "content": "The pit production capacity for nuclear weapons is a significant challenge for the United States. The goal is to increase production to 30 pits per year by 2021 and 50 to 80 pits per year by 2030. This report provides technical and regulatory details for decision-makers on pit projects worth billions of dollars. The report contains technical and regulatory details on pit production options for nuclear weapons. It discusses the importance of pit production infrastructure in achieving national goals related to nuclear war risk and global security. The Nuclear Posture Review outlines policy objectives to prevent nuclear proliferation, reduce the role of U.S. nuclear weapons, maintain deterrence, and strengthen regional security. Strategies like deterrence, counterproliferation, and arms control are used to implement these policies through delivery systems like bombers and ballistic missiles. The U.S. will not develop new nuclear warheads but will retain existing weapons in its arsenal. The United States will retain existing nuclear weapons in its arsenal for the foreseeable future. Extending the service life of these weapons may require replacing or modifying components, including newly manufactured pits for some weapons. The current infrastructure lacks the capacity to produce pits at the required rate, raising concerns about the ability to replace weapons if needed, which could undermine strategies and policies. Plutonium, a dense and radioactive metal, is crucial for nuclear weapons but has challenging characteristics. It is difficult to work with and can change density significantly. The current infrastructure lacks the capacity to produce pits at the required rate, which could undermine national goals. Plutonium is a challenging material with unique properties. It can be brittle or malleable, expands when solidifying, and tarnishes quickly. Aging from the inside out, it reacts with oxygen, hydrogen, and water, degrading over time. Radioactive decay causes self-irradiation damage, altering its properties. Alloying with materials like gallium can stabilize it. Handling plutonium poses significant risks, as inhaling particles can cause lung cancer. There is also a concern about terrorists using it to build improvised nuclear devices. Plutonium, a challenging material with unique properties, can be used to build nuclear weapons. Facilities holding large quantities of certain plutonium isotopes require high security measures. Plutonium is manufactured by exposing uranium fuel rods to neutrons in nuclear reactors and separating it using chemical processes. The desired isotope for nuclear weapons is plutonium-239, which fissions readily when struck by neutrons. Weapons-grade plutonium consists mainly of plutonium-239. A pit, made of plutonium, triggers a thermonuclear weapon. A thermonuclear weapon, or hydrogen bomb, consists of a hollow shell of plutonium surrounded by chemical explosives. The explosives create an implosion wave that compresses the plutonium, leading to a fission chain reaction and explosion. Modern weapons use only plutonium in the pits to reduce size and weight, a design strategy important during the Cold War. During the Cold War, reducing the size and weight of nuclear weapons was crucial to maximize their explosive force and fit more on missiles. Studies have shown that the lifespan of plutonium pits, used in modern weapons, has increased over the years, with projections ranging from 45-60 years in 2003 to over 150 years in 2012. Ongoing research suggests that pit reuse is possible without significant effects. The lifespan of plutonium pits has increased over the years, with studies showing they can last for many more decades. This longer pit life allows for maintaining a stockpile with a lower production rate and the potential for reusing retired pits. Ongoing research supports the conclusion that pit reuse is feasible. The fabrication of plutonium pits requires precision to meet exacting standards. As plutonium decays, it produces americium, increasing radiation dose and impurities in weapons-grade plutonium. Purification processes involving nitric acid, high-temperature processing, and electrorefining are necessary for new pit production. Waste from these processes contains radioactive material and harmful substances, requiring proper disposal. Pits are made from welded \"hemishells,\" with the Rocky Flats Plant being a key producer. The fabrication of plutonium pits involves precision and multiple steps. Pits are made using a wrought or cast process, with LANL currently using the cast method. Each hemishell is inspected for flaws through various techniques like x-ray imaging. It takes about three months to make a pit, with materials characterization examining bulk properties of plutonium samples to ensure correct manufacturing processes. Manufacturing processes like MC and AC are used for plutonium pit production. MC does not require a large amount of laboratory space, while AC involves analyzing samples for isotopic composition and impurities. AC typically analyzes 22 samples per pit, with samples cut into smaller pieces and dissolved in acid for analysis. The plutonium-acid mixture from pit production is split into smaller samples for analysis. Each sample, containing milligram or microgram quantities of plutonium, undergoes specific preparation and analysis using specialized equipment. Purity of plutonium ingots for hemishell production is assayed by comparing samples with standard materials. Waste generated from pit fabrication, such as plutonium-acid samples and trimmings, is handled by extraction or solidification for burial. Alamos extracts plutonium from pits for burial at WIPP. Weapon components deteriorate over time due to heat and radiation from plutonium. Some components, like electronics, become hard to support and may not be compatible with new delivery systems. NNSA and DOD aim to increase the safety and security of weapons. The Nuclear Weapons Council oversees and plans life extension programs (LEPs) for various weapon types, ranging from minor component replacements to major overhauls. Some argue against LEPs that go beyond minimum requirements, citing cost and potential performance issues. However, LEPs are ongoing for the W76 warhead and B61 bomb, with support from Congress and the Administration. Additional LEPs are in the planning stages. The United States plans to conduct Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for nuclear warheads, with a preference for refurbishment or reuse of existing components. This approach is in line with the Nuclear Posture Review and the Stockpile Management Program, ensuring safety, security, and reliability on a case-by-case basis. New pits may be fabricated for some LEPs, while others may reuse pits from retired weapons. The need for new \"nuclear components,\" pits in this case, drives pit capacity requirements. The Nuclear Weapons Council has determined a production capacity of 50 to 80 pits per year is needed to meet future LEP demands. Andrew Weber testified in 2013 on the necessity for a near-term pit production capacity of 10 to 20, increasing to 30 by 2021, and a longer-term capacity of 50 to 80 pits per year. The U.S. plutonium strategy is driven by the need for a pit production capacity of 50 to 80 per year, based on assessments of existing infrastructure at Los Alamos. This range was established in 2008 to meet pit operational requirements, evolving from a decision to utilize the modernization program at Los Alamos instead of the Modern Pit Facility. The Nuclear Weapons Council assessed the pit production capacity needed per year and determined it was probably good enough, accepting some risk. The capability to deliver, based on anticipated modernization at Los Alamos, could range from 50 to 80 pits per year. The Nuclear Weapons Council assessed the pit production capacity needed per year, with a range of 50 to 80 pits per year. NNSA's 2013 report mentioned plans for up to 80 pits per year by FY 2030, but there were discussions about the need for a capacity of 125 pits per year. One option being considered is reusing retired pits in Life Extension Programs (LEPs) to potentially reduce the required pit production capacity below 80 pits per year. This approach would depend on the availability of suitable pits and the specific details of each LEP. LANL could also use its unused capacity to produce new pits concurrently with LEPs using retired or original pits, without the need for additional AC or foundry work. LANL could stockpile new pits to enable lower production rates and maintain continuous operation for pit production and support. However, the planning and design work for new pits would need to be certified, and it may not be possible to do this work far enough in advance for continuous production. The production capacity of 80 pits per year was based on LANL's presumed capacity using existing buildings, not on strategic analysis. The Union of Concerned Scientists stated that if pits last 150 years or more, there is no need to replace aging pits for the foreseeable future. Even if pits need to be replaced by 2089, a production capacity of 50 per year would be adequate. The NNSA could replace all existing pits by 2089 if production started in 2019, assuming the U.S. stockpile remains at 3,500 warheads. However, the U.S. is likely to reduce its arsenal in the future. The NNSA could wait longer to produce replacement pits or reduce the annual rate of production. There is no need to expand pit production capacity beyond 50 per year to replace aging pits. John Harvey argues for providing margin to accommodate unknowns in pit production capacity. Reserve production may be necessary for unexpected technical problems or geopolitical reversals. The need for reserve production capacity above known requirements is crucial for a responsive nuclear infrastructure, aligning with the President's NPR vision. Delaying needed capacity increases risk, and aiming for higher production levels could enhance the ability to meet lower requirements. However, setting a goal of 80 pits per year may be excessive if it surpasses actual needs. According to Greg Mello, it may not be desirable to aim for 80 pits per year if it exceeds actual needs. History shows that efforts to acquire excess pit production capacity have failed and can be more costly. It may be better to acquire the minimum necessary capacity and have a contingency plan in place. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act directed the assessment of annual plutonium pit production requirements for a safe nuclear arsenal. Different pit production rates were considered, including 10 to 20 pits per year, 20 to 30 pits per year, 30 to 50 pits per year, 50 to 80 pits per year, and larger. Reducing capacity could lower facility requirements and allow for delays. The report focuses on acquiring the maximum capacity of 80 pits per year by 2030, even though a lower capacity may suffice. The Nuclear Weapons Council suggested that a capacity to build 50 pits per year could be scaled up to produce 80 pits per year in double-shift operations. Reducing capacity could lead to lower facility requirements and potential delays in construction. Pu-238, an isotope of plutonium, is highly radioactive and used for power sources in deep space probes and defense. It is not ideal for pit production due to its short half-life and heat generation. Pu-238 is classified as low-grade material due to its difficulty in fabrication and potential problems for surrounding materials in a nuclear weapon. Understanding terms like dose and rem is essential for discussing constraints on plutonium buildings and compliance options. The biological effects of ionizing radiation are measured in rem. A dose of 0-25 rem has no detectable clinical effects but increases the risk of cancer and genetic effects. A dose of 25-100 rem is unlikely to have serious effects, while 100-200 rem may cause minimal symptoms like nausea and fatigue. Plutonium-239 equivalent is used to assess the radiological hazard of radioactive materials, including weapons-grade plutonium. The hazard categories for nuclear facilities are based on the consequences of unmitigated releases of hazardous radioactive and chemical material. Hazard Categories are determined by the amount of Pu-239E a building is designed to hold, with each category having the potential for certain consequences in the event of an accident. The Hazard Categories for nuclear facilities are determined by the amount of Pu-239E a building is designed to hold. The final categorization is based on an 'unmitigated release' of hazardous material, considering quantity, form, location, dispersibility, and interaction with energy sources. Safety features are not considered in the categorization. Buildings must be designed to specific Hazard Category standards based on the amount of Pu-239E they are intended to hold. The Hazard Categories for nuclear facilities are determined by the amount of Pu-239E a building is designed to hold. A Radiological Facility holds less Pu-239E than an HC-3 building. The Radiological Laboratory/Utility/Office Building (RLUOB) is limited to 38.6 g of Pu-239E, far less than enough to support production of 80 ppy. LANL provided information on Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) standards for buildings in various Hazard Categories. The design basis earthquake for buildings in various Hazard Categories is defined as ground motion with an annual frequency of 4 x 10 -4 or once in 2,500 years. Structures are designed to withstand this ground motion using national codes and standards, with a 1-2% failure probability. The Design Basis Accident (DBA) is the worst-case scenario each building must survive. The Design Basis Accident (DBA) for buildings is specific to each building and could be a flood, explosion, tornado, or earthquake. For plutonium buildings at Los Alamos, the main threat is an earthquake that could collapse the building, start a fire, and release plutonium oxide particles into the air based on factors like Airborne Release Fraction (ARF) and Leak Path Factor (LPF). The Design Basis Accident (DBA) for plutonium buildings at Los Alamos involves factors like Airborne Release Fraction (ARF) and Leak Path Factor (LPF) that determine the release of plutonium oxide particles into the air. The Respirable Fraction (RF) refers to the fraction of particles that could be inhaled and cause biological damage, including lung cancers. NNSA noted that the frequency of the DBA is much less than the frequency of the DBE due to multiple steps required for the DBE to result in the DBA. The difference between Design Basis Event (DBE) and Design Basis Accident (DBA) is crucial as interrupting the path from one to the other can reduce the probability of DBA. Radiological Facilities like RLUOB do not have a DBA due to minimal radioactive material, but may need upgrades if converted to HC-3 standards. Material At Risk (MAR) is defined by DOE. For the conversion of RLUOB to HC-3 standards, Material At Risk (MAR) is a key consideration. MAR is the amount of radioactive materials that could be dispersed in a Design Basis Accident (DBA). It includes scenarios like molten plutonium spilling in an earthquake. Maximally-exposed Offsite Individual (MOI) is a standard used to assess potential exposure to the public. The DOE guideline sets a maximum dose of 25 rem for MOI exposure in specific buildings. Another document sets the dose at 5 rem to avoid exceeding the 25-rem limit. A DSA must be prepared for HC-2 or HC-3 buildings to determine the MAR limits for collocated workers or MOIs. The DSA MAR limit for HC-2 buildings like CMR and PF-4 at LANL is building-specific, with CMR permitting 9 kg of Pu-239E and PF-4 allowing 2,600 kg on the main floor. No DSA is needed for Radiological Facilities due to their small MAR. Uranium and plutonium are categorized based on Security Category (SC) by DOE. DOE categorizes uranium and plutonium based on Security Category (SC) levels, with SC I and II requiring high security measures for facilities with Special Nuclear Materials (SNM). SC-I includes assembled weapons and 2 kg or more of plutonium ingots, while SC-IV has lower security requirements for smaller quantities of plutonium. Safety Class structures, systems, and components (SSCs) are defined by 10 CFR 830.3 to limit radioactive hazards. The nuclear weapons complex consists of eight sites that maintain U.S. nuclear weapons. Safety Class structures, systems, and components (SSCs) are defined to limit radioactive hazards. Safety significant SSCs contribute to defense in depth and worker safety. Safety-class systems must operate in conditions that would otherwise result in an unacceptable risk to the public. The Department of Energy (DOE) used to own and set policy for the Complex, but in 2000, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) took over these functions. Contractors operate Complex sites at the direction of NNSA, with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) being one of these sites. LANL has buildings relevant to pits that were designed in the late 1940s and used for plutonium R&D. The CMR building is showing signs of age and was described as \"genuinely decrepit\" in a 2009 congressional commission report. In 2010, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) raised concerns about CMR's ability to detect ventilation system failures promptly due to its age and lack of alarms. DNFSB also reported that CMR and Y-12 uranium processing facilities are structurally unsound and unsuitable for long-term use. CMR is vulnerable to earthquakes as it was not designed to withstand seismic loads adequately. The CMR building is reinforced with two steel rods in each concrete beam and a 2 to 4-inch thick concrete floor reinforced with chicken wire. Experts estimate a 1 in 370 to 1 in 333 chance of collapse annually, with a 50% probability of collapse in a 250-year earthquake event. The probability of surviving a Design Basis Earthquake is less than 0.2%, with a 1 in 36 chance of collapsing in 10 years. DNFSB also calculated a 1 in 55 chance of seismic collapse within a 10-year timeframe. The Board is concerned about the safety risk posed to workers by prolonged operations in the existing CMR facility. The NNSA limited material-at-risk in the facility to reduce public dose consequences after an earthquake. PF-4 is the main building for plutonium work, manufacturing pits and supporting various projects. It houses the ARIES system for converting plutonium into plutonium oxide for nuclear reactor fuel. It also conducts pit surveillance for weapons inspection. PF-4 at Los Alamos is being inspected for potential problems, including seismic vulnerability. The building lacks modern structural standards and faces a credible risk of collapse in an earthquake. LANL took steps to improve safety after a seismic threat assessment in 2007. The building was completed in FY2010 and office operations began in October 2011. The Radiological Laboratory Utility Office Building (RLUOB) was completed in 2006 and office operations started in October 2011. It has 19,500 square feet of laboratory space and is permitted to hold 26 grams of WGPu. The building was designed for unclassified R&D on plutonium and some AC support, with a focus on efficiency using open hoods instead of gloveboxes. The RLUOB was built to a high standard with a powerful ventilation system, modern HEPA filtration, and a focus on Nuclear Quality Assurance standards. It exceeds radiation protection controls of older facilities like PF-4 and CMR Building. The RLUOB was built to the Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA)-1 standard, designed to withstand a design basis earthquake (DBE) occurring once in 2,500 years. It does not meet hazard category 2 or 3 standards but was constructed to work with the CMRR-NF. Los Alamos estimates that a collapse would require an earthquake with a magnitude of 4 or higher. The Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado produced pits for nuclear warheads on a large scale until operations halted in 1989 due to safety and environmental violations. The United States has not been able to produce more than about 10 pits per year since then. There have been extensive efforts to restore pit production capacity on a larger scale. In 1989, efforts to restore pit production capacity on a larger scale have been ongoing, with many proposed projects but none successfully completed. Key parameters have changed from one proposal to the next. Congress directed a study on nuclear weapons complex modernization in 1988 and 1989. Secretary of Energy James Watkins noted in 1991 that dramatic world changes required further reassessments of the Nuclear Weapons Complex. The DOE report proposes a reconfigured Nuclear Weapons Complex called Complex-21, which would be smaller, less diverse, and less expensive to operate. It aims to support nuclear deterrent stockpile objectives and presents two reconfiguration alternatives, including relocating the functions of the Rocky Flats Plant. The DOE proposes Complex-21, a reconfigured Nuclear Weapons Complex, to consolidate NMP&M elements at a single site. A two-pronged approach to restore pit production includes an EIS process and a Record of Decision in December 1996 for reestablishing pit production capability at PF-4. Los Alamos planned to build a small number of pits for W88s at PF-4 to replace destroyed pits in a surveillance program. The facility produced its first war reserve W88 pits in 2007 and served as a pilot plant for larger production. The stockpile stewardship program faced challenges in certifying these pits without nuclear testing. The Modern Pit Facility (MPF) was approved to produce a larger number of pits. The Modern Pit Facility (MPF) was approved by NNSA in FY2002 to produce pits with capacities ranging from 125-450 ppy. The facility would have a pit lifetime of 45-60 years and was designed to address various stockpile size and composition requirements. Congress initially supported the MPF project. The Modern Pit Facility (MPF) was approved by NNSA in FY2002 to produce pits with capacities ranging from 125-450 ppy, with a pit lifetime of 45-60 years. Congress initially supported MPF but later became concerned with the lack of study of alternatives, production capacity, and pit aging. Funds for MPF were eliminated in the FY2006 budget cycle. In 2004, efforts to reconfigure the nuclear weapons complex began, with the House Appropriations Committee pushing for a systematic review of requirements for the weapons complex over the next twenty-five years. The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board formed the Nuclear Weapons Complex Infrastructure Task Force to evaluate the stockpile, Design Basis Threat, and resources needed. The task force recommended the design of a Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) to modernize nuclear weapon design for the post-Cold War era. The task force recommended the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) as a modernized nuclear weapon design for the post-Cold War era. They envisioned RRW as a \"family of weapons\" to make up the future stockpile, along with a Consolidated Nuclear Production Center (CNPC) for production and dismantling. The CNPC would have cutting-edge nuclear component production technologies and support plutonium operations. The report analyzed the timing for the CNPC to support a stockpile of 2200 active and 1000 reserve weapons, with a required pit lifetime of 45 years and production rates of 125 pits per year. The CNPC must be functional by 2014 or could be delayed to 2034 if pit lifetime uncertainty is accepted. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act directed the development of a plan for transforming the nuclear weapons complex by 2030, submitted in October 2006. The report submitted in October 2006 aimed to implement U.S. policy on strategic deterrence outlined in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. It envisioned a smaller stockpile by 2030 mainly composed of Reliable Replacement Warheads (RRWs). Complex 2030 would maintain eight sites with high-security SNM only at production and testing sites, and labs would not require high-security SNM levels for operations. Unlike the SEAB report, Complex 2030 would not include a Consolidated Nuclear Production Complex but would have a consolidated plutonium center. The report aims to implement U.S. policy on strategic deterrence by envisioning a smaller stockpile by 2030 with Reliable Replacement Warheads. Complex 2030 would maintain eight sites with high-security SNM only at production and testing sites. It includes plans for a consolidated plutonium center at an existing Category I/II SNM site in the early 2020s, with upgrades to LANL facilities and completion of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) by 2022. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) facility at LANL is planned to support plutonium operations until 2022, then transition to material science. The existing CMR facility at LANL is set to be closed, with CAT I/II plutonium quantities to be removed from LLNL. Plans for Complex 21 have shifted capacity to a baseline of 125 ppy, focusing on R&D on SNM, particularly plutonium. The CMR building faced issues due to aging and design, prompting DOE and NNSA to change replacement plans over the past few decades. In 1983, DOE first recognized the need to replace the outdated CMR. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) facility at LANL faced issues due to aging and design, prompting DOE and NNSA to develop replacement plans. Several large replacement projects were proposed over nearly 2 decades, including the Special Nuclear Materials Research and Development Laboratory Replacement Project at LANL. Funding was allocated for this project in the late 1980s, but it did not come to fruition. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) project began as a replacement for the aging facility at LANL. NNSA approved the mission need in 2002 and issued a Record of Decision in 2004 for the project, which included two buildings - CMRR-NF for pit production support and RLUOB for offices and utilities. In 2005, NNSA authorized the preliminary design for the project. The preliminary design for the CMRR project was approved in 2005, with the goal of supporting plutonium manufacturing and R&D at Los Alamos. Concerns arose as costs increased and schedules slipped, while the need to replace the aging CMR facility became more urgent. Michael Anastasio emphasized the importance of CMRR for national security and other missions, highlighting the need for consistent funding and requirements throughout the project. The Administration issued a report in November 2010 to secure Senate approval of the New START Treaty. The Administration issued a report in November 2010 to secure Senate approval of the New START Treaty, committing to fully fund the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR). However, in the FY2013 budget, funding for CMRR-NF was eliminated and deferred for at least five years due to affordability concerns and alternative methods to achieve its tasks. Section 3114 of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act directed the construction of a building at Los Alamos National Laboratory to replace the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building. Congress did not appropriate funds for this project in FY2013 or FY2014, but an exception was included in the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act. The NNSA was authorized to spend funds on a modular building strategy to complement the plutonium facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Two facilities, including the Nuclear Materials Storage Facility, were built, found unusable, and demolished. The Nuclear Materials Storage Facility (NMSF) was poorly designed and constructed, leading to numerous deficiencies such as HVAC system control issues and inability to dissipate heat. A 1997 report by the DOE Inspector General criticized the facility, which was never usable and required renovation. The Nuclear Materials Storage Facility (NMSF) had various deficiencies, including issues with HVAC system control, heat dissipation, inability to limit radiation exposure, peeling of epoxy coating, and inability to open and secure doors. Due to these problems, the facility was never used for storage of nuclear materials and was demolished in 2008. Another failed project at Rocky Flats was the $225 million plutonium processing building, Building 371, which operated for only a month in 1982 before being shut down. Building 371 at Rocky Flats Plant, completed in 1981, operated for a month in 1982 before being shut down due to new processing technology issues. The Energy Department estimated it would cost $400 million and take eight years to fix. Deputy Secretary of Energy called it a fiasco. Building 771, the older processing plant, was shut down after employees were exposed to plutonium dust, halting operations at the plant. The buildings at Rocky Flats Plant, including Building 371, were never operational and were eventually torn down and decontaminated. Congress has been concerned about cost growth and schedule delays in nuclear weapons complex programs. Congress has urged NNSA to thoroughly analyze alternatives before making decisions, citing past projects that were deferred or canceled after significant time and money were spent on them. The House Armed Services Committee directed GAO to study NNSA's process for analyzing alternatives for nuclear weapon systems and facilities. Section 3113 of the FY2014 defense authorization bill requires independent reviews of guidance issued for such analyses, with results submitted to the Nuclear Weapons Council and congressional defense committees. Congress encourages following the analysis results for decision-making. The House Armed Services Committee directed GAO to study NNSA's process for analyzing alternatives for nuclear weapon systems and facilities. Section 3112 of the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act and Section 311 of the FY2014 energy and water development appropriations bill require reports on analysis of alternatives for nuclear programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about NNSA's ability to assess alternatives early in project planning stages. The House Armed Services Committee directed NNSA to submit a plan on how to strengthen its ability to assess alternatives for nuclear weapon systems and facilities. This was in response to wasteful spending on projects that could have been avoided with better assessment of alternatives. Lawsuits under NEPA have delayed or stopped many projects in the nuclear weapons complex. Compliance with NEPA, stressed by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, is crucial for DOE programs and projects. Timely attention to NEPA is essential for mission accomplishment and integrating NEPA compliance with management practices is key. DOE NEPA Order is a tool to enhance efficiency in compliance efforts. The DOE has a tool to improve NEPA compliance efforts, including options to increase plutonium in RLUOB for production support. NEPA Section 102 may require an EIS for these options due to potential risks to the human environment in accidents. In 2008, NNSA prepared a broad EIS for LANL, including the plutonium program. Since then, no EIS has been prepared for the program, but a Supplemental EIS was done in 2011 for the CMRR-NF component. Greg Mello argues that an EIS should precede NNSA's choice on post-CMRR-NF plutonium sustainment alternatives. Los Alamos Study Group has filed NEPA lawsuits against construction projects in the past. The NEPA landscape includes a statute emphasizing environmental values in governance, CEQ regulations binding on agencies, agency regulations tailored to each agency, CEQ guidance cited by courts, and a body of case law establishing NEPA \"common law.\" This body of law allows citizens to sue agencies for NEPA compliance. The NEPA law allows citizens to enforce compliance with agencies. DOE requires an EIS and ROD for major projects. A thorough EIS for CMRR-NF could have prevented design flaws and delays. Strong EISs and RODs would improve DOE's project management. The NNSA must conduct an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) before choosing between post-CMRR-NF plutonium sustainment alternatives. The proposed alternatives could have significant environmental impacts and cost billions of dollars. Upgrading RLUOB to an HC-3 facility may be a more environmentally friendly option. The NNSA must conduct an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) before choosing between post-CMRR-NF plutonium sustainment alternatives. Upgrading RLUOB to an HC-3 facility may tilt the scales towards that choice but is not a reason to avoid an EIS. LANL is considering building \"modular\" plutonium facilities and briefing this option to Congress. An EIS is required for choices of this magnitude, and none of the alternatives have been weighed or compared in any EIS. NEPA's regulations and case law are clear that an agency cannot analyze one project's alternatives and build something quite different. The NNSA must conduct an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for plutonium sustainment alternatives. NEPA's analysis of alternatives serves public purposes beyond environmental ones, as highlighted by John Immele. A thorough EIS analysis would comply with NEPA, address congressional desires, and prevent cost escalation. The NNSA must conduct an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for plutonium sustainment alternatives to comply with NEPA, address congressional desires, and prevent cost escalation. Various options are available to meet production goals, support necessary plutonium work, reduce safety and security risks, maximize cost-effectiveness, and complete the project on schedule. The NNSA must conduct an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for plutonium sustainment alternatives to comply with NEPA, address congressional desires, and prevent cost escalation. Maximize cost-effectiveness, complete the project on schedule, and provide a planning margin for future missions or regulatory requirements. Congress faces a choice among imperfect options, with a list of options presented in a logical progression. Consider options using existing buildings at Los Alamos. LANL's PF-4 building, with 60,000 sf of lab space, could potentially increase pit production to 30 per year without relocating ongoing programs. This would require reconfiguring space and investing in new equipment. NNSA's Plutonium Metal Processing subprogram would process plutonium alloy from returned pits to create a metal inventory for future use, easing constraints on analytical processes. NNSA's plutonium strategy aims to increase pit-manufacturing capacity by utilizing space in PF-4 and RLUOB more efficiently. This includes reclaiming unused rooms in PF-4 and adding AC equipment in RLUOB, affecting a total of 8,000 sf in PF-4. Additionally, a study considered using a facility at Livermore and RLUOB for these purposes. The Los Alamos study considered using Livermore and RLUOB for AC work, as PF-4 lacks space for production. AC operations using small plutonium samples are easier in hoods, but require a powerful ventilation system. The ventilation system in PF-4 is not sufficient to support the hoods needed for 30 ppy, making it difficult and costly to upgrade. Retrofitting the ventilation system for open-front hoods may not be possible due to its bulkiness. It is improbable that PF-4 alone could handle all the work needed for pit manufacture and supporting tasks. Given the limitations of PF-4 in producing 80 pits per year, an alternative option is to resume work on CMRR-NF, which was deferred for at least five years. Construction starting in FY2018 could lead to completion by 2029, contributing to the goal of 80 pits per year by 2030. Funding from Congress would be necessary for this option, but it could provide the necessary space for weapons production. The Administration deferred CMRR-NF due to affordability concerns, with the cost and schedule of UPF potentially impacting the feasibility of simultaneous projects. Section 3114 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 required a new building at Los Alamos to replace the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building at Los Alamos National Laboratory, associated with Department of Energy Hazard Category 2 special nuclear material operations, was deferred by the Administration due to affordability concerns. Congress is considering modular buildings as an alternative to CMRR-NF, with a modified RLUOB potentially meeting most functionality requirements. The Administration deferred the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building at Los Alamos National Laboratory due to affordability concerns. Congress is considering modular buildings as an alternative, with a modified RLUOB potentially meeting most functionality requirements. Options 8-10 would meet most functionality requirements of P.L. 112-239, but not the requirement for a new building. Congress expressed concern over escalating cost and delays of CMRR-NF, imposing cost and schedule caps on the project. Building CMRR-NF would not address the fact that PF-4 would be over 50 years old when CMRR-NF came online, leaving aging and seismic issues unresolved. A new building could combine the functions of PF-4 and CMRR-NF, addressing aging and seismic issues. This option may be more cost-effective and efficient, but faces challenges such as increased complexity and costs, as well as the need for designing from scratch. The NNSA's TA-55 Reinvestment Project plans to extend PF-4's life to 2039, so combining the two buildings would forgo a decade of PF-4 useful life. Despite advances in design and construction, it may be premature to start planning a replacement facility now if RLUOB and PF-4 can continue necessary plutonium work for another quarter-century. Despite advances in design and construction to reduce seismic risk, building at Los Alamos still poses earthquake risk. Constructing at Pantex, a site with low seismic risk, would solve this issue, but would require rebuilding infrastructure. Savannah River Site has seismicity similar to Los Alamos but lacks equipment for weapons manufacture. Tradeoffs exist in choosing a new site for nuclear weapons complex facilities. The seismic risk at Los Alamos is comparable to that of Pantex. Building a new facility at another site would involve regulatory issues and time-consuming processes. Maintaining CMR at Los Alamos until 2019 for pit production and nuclear forensics is a temporary solution. The CMR building at Los Alamos is considered \"genuinely decrepit\" and \"structurally unsound\" according to a congressional commission and a DNFSB study. Upgrades could extend its operation until 2039, but there are concerns about safety standards from the 1950s not meeting current requirements. Multiple wings have been stripped down for decommissioning, highlighting issues with heating, electrical, and ventilation systems. The CMR building at Los Alamos is in poor condition, with problems in heating, electrical, and ventilation systems. Refurbishing the ductwork is deemed too expensive. The building has drains concreted shut, gloveboxes with plastic bags instead of drain connections, and water leaks in the ceiling. There are concerns about radioactive contamination, corrosion in piping, and seismic robustness. No plans have been made to extend its service life beyond 2019. Given the poor condition of the CMR building at Los Alamos, retrofitting for utility and seismic robustness may not be feasible at a reasonable cost. If no alternative facility is ready by 2019, keeping CMR operational would result in additional costs, inefficiencies, and risks. A logical construct matching tasks to buildings may provide alternative options for handling plutonium work. The work involving MC and ARIES at PF-4 requires high security and MAR. PF-4 is the only building with the necessary attributes for pit work. Efficiency can be increased by moving tasks not needing high MAR and security out of PF-4. Producing 80 ppy would require more hemishells, raising MAR substantially. One approach discussed is building a new module at LANL for the pit foundry. One approach discussed is to move Pu-238 work out of PF-4 to free up floor space for pit work. Pu-238 is highly radioactive and accounts for a significant portion of PF-4's MAR allowance. Moving Pu-238 would also increase floor space for other tasks like casting hemishells. The text discusses the possibility of moving certain activities, such as AC and MC, out of PF-4 to free up floor space. This could involve relocating the gas gun to another building, releasing floor space and reducing the need for additional AC in PF-4. Moving AC and some MC out of PF-4 would free up space but little MAR, while moving Pu-238 out of PF-4 would free up substantial space and MAR, making it more likely for PF-4 to produce 80 ppy and conduct other plutonium work. Vault storage space is crucial for pit production as it acts as a buffer to hold plutonium for various production tasks. When CMRR-NF was designed in the early 2000s, NNSA decided to add vault space to PF-4 due to uncertainty about the final disposition of material from other sites. The PF-4 vault has accumulated excess material over the years that can be de-acquisitioned and shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The vault space at PF-4 is crucial for pit production and holding plutonium for various production tasks. Plutonium stored in the PF-4 vault can be de-acquisitioned and sent to different sites for disposal or storage. Options include the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, Savannah River Site, Y-12, Pantex Plant, Device Assembly Facility at Nevada National Security Site, and K Reactor at Savannah River Site. Cleaning out the vault at PF-4 will create space for needed plutonium for production, potentially supporting production of 80 pits per year. Increasing pit production to 80 pits per year at PF-4 could exceed the MAR limit. One option is to move Pu-238 work to a different site due to its different properties from Pu-239 work. Pu-239 and Pu-238 have different properties and applications. Pu-239 is used in weapons and nuclear power reactors, while Pu-238 is used for defense and space missions. Options for processing Pu-238 include upgrading existing facilities or conducting work at Idaho National Laboratory or Savannah River Site. LANL proposed building modules for Pu-238 work, while INL currently operates with Pu-238 heat sources. INL operates the Space and Security Power Systems Facility, handling Pu-238 heat sources produced by LANL. They could potentially take over all LANL Pu-238 operations, including recovery, purification, and source fabrication, with a capacity of processing 5 kg per year. Upgrading an existing building at INL would be necessary to handle the fabrication of Pu-238 sources, requiring modifications to safety systems and equipment. The DOE report highlighted the advantages of establishing Pu-238 processing capability at INL, including improved safety systems and equipment, enhanced security measures, and cost-effective operations. However, drawbacks such as inexperience with Pu-238 processing were noted. The drawbacks of establishing Pu-238 processing capability at INL include inexperience with operations, loss of co-location with related NNSA programs, safety risks due to uncertainty in requirements, and moving operations away from LANL. SRS also has a history of Pu-238 production from the mid-1960s to early 1980s before operations were moved to LANL. The last SRS reactor was shut down in 1993, and work is underway at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to produce Pu-238. SRS has a heavily shielded concrete structure called H Canyon, which began operations in 1955 to process irradiated targets and fuel rods from SRS reactors. It is the only U.S. facility that can chemically process large quantities of radioactive material like spent fuel rods. The Savannah River Site (SRS) has facilities like the HB-Line and Building 235-F for processing radioactive material, including Pu-238. The HB-Line, operational since the late 1980s, can dissolve Pu-238 oxide in nitric acid. Building 235-F, not in use since 1984 due to contamination, fabricated heat sources from Pu-238 oxide. The SRS plan involves receiving Pu-238 in various forms for processing. The Pu-238 oxide is dissolved in nitric acid in the HB-Line and then transferred to H Canyon for purification. The purified solution is sent back to HB-Line where plutonium is precipitated and turned into plutonium oxide. A new Plutonium Testing and Processing Facility (PTPF) in H Canyon would press plutonium oxide into pellets for heat sources. H Canyon and HB-Line can process a range of 1 to over 30 kg of Pu-238 per year. The HB-Line and H Canyon facilities can process a wide range of Pu-238 quantities, built to high safety standards. Operations at H Canyon are planned until 2018-2020, with uncertainty beyond that. Revitalizing facilities may not be justified without a long-term mission. The value of processing Pu-238 for the weapons program is questioned, as it may not justify building the Plutonium Testing and Processing Facility (PTPF). The DOE compared cost and schedule estimates for two options: INL option costing $122 million to $272 million and taking eight years, and SRS option costing $153 million to $215 million and taking 7\u00bd to 9\u00bd years. DNFSB noted degradation at H-Canyon that could pose risks to facility operations. The DOE completed repairs to address identified deficiencies that could challenge safe operations at a facility. Some safety-related repairs are still pending. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has Building 332 in its \"Superblock\" complex, built for plutonium work in 1961 and 1975. It was a Hazard Category 2/Security Category I facility, handling plutonium with updated ventilation and electrical systems. Building 332 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, part of the \"Superblock\" complex, was designed to withstand seismic activity and has updated ventilation and electrical systems. It has been reclassified as SC-III, limiting the amount of plutonium it can hold to reduce security risks. The facility no longer stores SC-I/II quantities of Special Nuclear Material, with a focus on reducing vulnerability and security costs. Building 332 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has ample space for AC work, with 24,000 total sf of laboratory space. Some space is used for fabricating plutonium samples for experiments. LLNL is currently using 5,000 sf for AC and MC, with potential for another 6,000 sf. The facility has excess air handling capacity to support open-front hoods and believes it can support AC for 80 ppy. Waste from experiments is processed and shipped to WIPP, with liquid waste solidified with cement. LANL and LLNL have different waste handling approaches. LANL and LLNL differ in waste handling approaches. LANL can recover plutonium from liquid samples and solidify waste for shipment to WIPP using AC. LLNL lacks these capabilities and would simply cement liquid waste for shipping. LLNL believes cementing liquid waste is sufficient due to lower waste generation compared to LANL. LLNL's capacity to support AC for 80 ppy while performing other missions is in question, as it could add schedule risk. Public concern may arise over shipping hundreds of plutonium samples per year. While LLNL could stay within MAR limits with weekly shipments, there are potential issues with commercial carriers. The LANL engineer highlighted challenges in pit manufacturing, emphasizing the lack of standardized delivery dates due to interruptions in the fragile manufacturing process. Dissolving certain plutonium samples takes five days, raising concerns about exceeding MAR limits. Increasing AC work at LLNL could enhance plutonium expertise across the nuclear weapons complex, but would require additional staff and equipment. This could strengthen LLNL's capabilities for peer review and AC, while LANL remains the center of excellence. LANL is the main center for plutonium in the nuclear weapons complex, and diluting its capability would not be ideal. Manufacturing war reserve pits requires high-quality AC, which LANL has the expertise for. While LLNL could assist with AC, LANL would still need substantial in-house capability due to the nature of plutonium processing. The logistics of splitting manufacturing and AC capabilities between sites may not be efficient. LANL's 2012 study recognized that LLNL could help with AC when needed. SRS has a long history with plutonium, having operated five large reactors producing 36 metric tons of plutonium, mostly WGPu. While no longer producing plutonium, SRS still has industrial-scale AC capability and infrastructure in place for plutonium characterization. SRS repurposed its K Reactor to store tons of plutonium from various sources, requiring ongoing analytical chemistry to characterize the isotopic composition and impurities for storage and fuel purposes. SRS operates nuclear materials processing facilities 24/7, conducting analytical chemistry in F/H Laboratory and Building 773-A for AC. These labs have excess capacity in hoods and gloveboxes due to past nuclear weapons production. SRS believes F/H Laboratory could handle the AC for 80 ppy with some new instruments and hiring technicians. Both labs have large ventilation capacity, with F/H Laboratory equipped with six fans. SRS could perform AC and Pu-238 missions concurrently using different facilities. SRS works closely with LANL on AC and is part of LANL's quality assurance program. LANL sends SRS metal samples annually for AC as part of the Plutonium Metal Standards Exchange program. Multiple sites, including the United Kingdom's Atomic Weapons Establishment, exchange plutonium samples. LANL and SRS exchange plutonium samples for accountability checks. LANL is open to conducting some accountability checks at other sites if needed. Plans to consolidate plutonium work at a single site have been proposed over the past two decades. Consideration for conducting more work at LANL includes utilizing existing buildings for various tasks. Recently developed plans at Los Alamos National Laboratory include upgrading wings of the building for Pu-238 operations, pit disassembly, pit fabrication, and other programs. Upgrades to the pit fabrication wing will remove unused gloveboxes, consolidate laboratory space, and improve equipment layout to enhance operations. This is in response to the limitations faced by RLUOB in conducting necessary activities due to space constraints and material limits. The plan at Los Alamos National Laboratory includes upgrading the pit fabrication wing to increase pit production capacity. Space consolidation will allow for the addition of equipment to achieve capacities of up to 80 pits per year for some operations. However, challenges remain in scaling all operations to this capacity due to space constraints. LANL has not analyzed space-fit issues for producing 80 pits per year. LANL could achieve a capacity of 80 pits per year in PF-4 by increasing the limit of WGPu in RLUOB and reconfiguring space in PF-4. This would require a MAR of 1,000 g WGPu in RLUOB, space reconfiguration in PF-4, and improving pit fabrication operations. Converting RLUOB to an HC-3 building would support LANL's pit work for DOD, free up space in PF-4, and improve operational efficiency. However, the conversion process would require substantial effort to meet regulatory requirements. Converting RLUOB to an HC-3 building would require many tasks to comply with regulatory requirements, including preparing various documents and potentially making physical modifications such as seismic upgrades. LANL has not estimated the cost or schedule to complete seismic upgrades to RLUOB, which could be expensive. Upgrading RLUOB to HC-3 would likely be quicker and less costly than building a new facility. Regulations limit the amount of WGPu RLUOB can hold. Removing this limit could have implications. Regulations on plutonium facilities may seem disconnected from end goals. The DOE has burdened the Complex with rules and regulations that focus on process rather than mission safety. Cost/benefit analysis and risk informed decisions are absent, resulting in a risk-averse posture at all management levels. Hazard Category regulations limit the amount of plutonium in a building to protect emergency responders and the public. The dose for a collocated worker (CW) and a maximally-exposed offsite individual (MOI) would be significantly lower than DOE guidelines. Specifically, the CW dose would be 10.41 rem compared to a guideline of 100 rem, and the MOI dose would be 0.49 rem compared to a guideline of 5 to 25 rem. Option 10 focuses on using RLUOB for AC/MC in pit production if Congress waives the Pu-239E limit. A MAR limit of 1,000 g WGPu may be sufficient for RLUOB to support 80 ppy with additional floor space needed. The current plan involves using specific lab spaces for AC work, with a focus on efficiency and security measures. Options like using RLUOB for AC/MC in pit production are being considered, with potential advantages in addressing long-standing concerns raised by Congress. Option 10 and Option 7 (AC at LLNL or SRS) are being evaluated for their feasibility and benefits. Option 10 for pit production would reduce cancellation risk, building unsuitability, and cost growth concerns. Using existing facilities like RLUOB could address long-standing Congress concerns. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act capped spending for UPF and CMRR-NF, while the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act established a Director for Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation in NNSA. Equipping RLUOB for AC and some MC would be the fastest way to augment capacity, as it already has infrastructure to support work on small samples. Adding equipment to PF-4 would be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Adding equipment to PF-4 would be challenging and time-consuming due to compliance requirements, security checks, and limited space. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act requires the construction of a building to replace CMR functions at a cost not exceeding $3.7 billion. If RLUOB could replace CMR functions, it would save the cost of building CMRR-NF, estimated between $3.7 billion and $5.9 billion. Delaying CMRR-NF could increase costs, and it might be canceled. The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act requires the construction of a building to replace CMR functions at a cost not exceeding $3.7 billion. Delaying CMRR-NF could increase costs, and it might be canceled in favor of a modular strategy authorized by Section 3117 of the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act. The two modules referenced in Section 3117 would be smaller and potentially less costly than CMRR-NF, but could still reach billions of dollars in cost. Using RLUOB would help avoid design and construction risks, such as design errors that could lead to additional costs for taxpayers. Option 10 could potentially allow NNSA to stop work in CMR by 2019, reducing safety hazards and costs for taxpayers. It may also free up lab space in PF-4 by relocating the gas gun, but there are concerns about meeting the 2021 pit production goal if CMR's service life is extended. Option 10 proposes increasing efficiency by relocating sensitive equipment from PF-4 to RLUOB, freeing up space and improving usability. NNSA anticipates upgrades will extend PF-4's service life until 2039, while RLUOB should have a 50-year service life. Placing the pit program on a sustainable path soon would avoid uncertainty for the plutonium program, providing a long-term foundation. Upgrading RLUOB for low-MAR work may be necessary even if high-MAR activities are moved to modules. Congress could defer decisions on other plutonium facilities for a decade if PF-4 and RLUOB remain in service for another 25 years. Upgrading existing buildings for pit production to minimize environmental impact and simplify NEPA compliance. Concerns about RLUOB's seismic safety due to potential collapse in a more powerful earthquake than it was designed for in 1995. The upper two office floors of RLUOB are designed to be seismically robust, similar to an emergency response building. While less robust than the lower floors, they are sturdier than a standard office building. Detailed analysis is needed to determine seismic performance, potential breaches, suitable reinforcements, effectiveness, and cost. Non-governmental organizations and the public may have concerns about relaxing standards for nuclear facilities. Some may oppose relaxing standards for nuclear facilities, fearing increased risks. Introducing more than 26 g of WGPu into RLUOB could pose a direct threat in case of an earthquake. This project could set a precedent for other plutonium projects at Los Alamos. The laboratory is considering a modular option with a tunnel connecting PF-4 and RLUOB for high-MAR plutonium operations. Transporting samples between the buildings by trucks could delay this option. Some may fear NNSA's ability to conduct an adequate EIS for the proposal due to concerns about segmentation and potential impacts on connected and cumulative actions. The EIS preparation must adhere to regulations regarding limitations on actions and consider cumulative impacts from past, present, and future actions. Failure to assess all reasonable alternatives or account for cumulative impacts can result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This includes actions like up-equipping RLUOB, building tunnels, and constructing modules. The EIS must consider cumulative impacts from past, present, and future actions, including up-equipping RLUOB, building tunnels, and constructing modules. The possibility of building modules under the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act would require analyzing the impact of the alternative before committing to any projects. The planned unclassified research on plutonium at LANL's laboratory space could attract potential recruits and benefit the weapons program. If RLUOB is allowed 1,000 g of WGPu, most unclassified space would convert to classified. Concerns remain about seismic robustness and possible collapse of office floors. The construction of RLUOB in FY2010 cost $164.0 million for the facility and $199.4 million for equipment. An RLB, a Radiological Laboratory Building, could be a more cost-effective option as it eliminates the office structure and utilizes existing plans from RLUOB. The Central Utility Building (CUB) was intended to support both RLUOB and a larger building, CMRR-NF. If RLB were built as a copy of RLUOB, it would need regulatory relief to hold enough plutonium for AC/MC work to support 80 ppy. Building RLB to HC-3 standards would be costly due to higher standards. RLB might be sited where CMRR-NF was planned, potentially impacting modules. Regulatory relief or high costs for HC-3 RLB could pose challenges for holding 1 kg of WGPu. Los Alamos's preferred approach to the plutonium strategy involves maximizing the use of RLUOB, repurposing space in PF-4, and building buried modules linked to PF-4 for high-MAR work. These modules would be designed as HC-2, each serving a single purpose and utilizing PF-4 infrastructure and systems. The LANL approach for plutonium strategy involves building buried modules connected to PF-4 for high-MAR work, such as Pu-238 processing and pit foundry tasks. These modules would be smaller in size compared to RLUOB and PF-4 to reduce seismic loads on equipment. The LANL plans to construct buried modules between RLUOB and PF-4 for high-MAR work, made of thick concrete matching the density of the rock for seismic stability. This approach aims to reduce seismic loads on equipment and enhance security during plutonium transportation. The traditional \"big box\" building approach is no longer considered sustainable. The traditional \"big box\" building approach for constructing facilities like PF-4 or CMRR-NF is no longer politically and fiscally sustainable. Senator Lamar Alexander warns that the NNSA needs to find a more effective way to design these multi-billion dollar facilities or risk losing congressional support. The design tends to be overly ambitious and cautious, including everything that might be needed over the building's life while also complying with a growing body of regulations. Meeting goals and requirements simultaneously is challenging due to uncertainties. Los Alamos proposes a new approach to construction using modular design for facilities like CMRR-NF. Modular construction offers advantages such as faster and cheaper building, specific safety planning for each module, and the ability to build modules as needed. This approach would provide a steady level of funding and make the funding profile more predictable for Congress and the Administration. The modular building strategy for facilities like CMRR-NF aims to reduce costs and improve construction efficiency by learning from previous modules. The concept is gaining momentum, with preliminary design work and cost estimates already in progress. Questions remain about the necessity of the strategy and whether other options, such as relocating Pu-238 work, could eliminate the need for modules. The need to potentially move MAR out of PF-4 to free up space for additional pit work is being considered, along with the possibility of delaying a decision on building modules. The cost and complexities of constructing HC-2 buildings for modules, which would require their own ventilation, power, and safety equipment, are also being weighed against the projected service life of existing facilities. The NNSA is considering the cost and feasibility of building modular facilities for nuclear construction projects. While the modular approach offers benefits like smaller scale and lessons learned from previous projects, concerns remain about potential cost and schedule issues. Congress questions whether the modules would be a reliable solution. Additionally, the option to upgrade existing facilities like PF-4 and RLUOB is being compared to building new modules. The NNSA is considering building modular facilities for nuclear construction projects, weighing the benefits and concerns. The analysis focuses on improving safety and efficiency in Option 10, with potential application to Options 8, 9, and 11. Work is already underway on safety improvements through TRP. Improving safety and efficiency through TRP is not relevant to Options 2, 3, 4, and 12 as new buildings would already comply with modern safety standards. Option 5, CMR, is too vulnerable to earthquakes for significant safety and efficiency improvements. Options 6 and 7 involve modifying existing buildings at different sites. A DBA is necessary for HC-3 buildings, not Radiological Facilities, to minimize the risk of a DBA. Constructing a DBA for RLUOB with WGPu would help analyze accident sequences and identify points for intervention. NNSA is conducting work at PF-4 through TRP to reduce the probability and consequences of a DBA. A DBA for RLUOB might specify an amount of Pu-239E in the building and include an earthquake followed by a fire that lofted plutonium oxide particles into the air, resulting in a dose to personnel beyond DOE guidelines. This section discusses possible ways to mitigate the risk of each event in the DBA sequence. LANL did not study the probability that RLUOB could survive an earthquake of given magnitude because that analysis is not required. RLUOB was designed to survive the 1995 design basis earthquake, appropriate for an HC-3 building. If used for 1,000 g of WGPu, strengthening may be desirable to reduce consequences and probability of collapse. Seismic resistance is a design consideration at facilities like SLAC near the San Andreas Fault. Most buildings are designed to resist vertical loads, but earthquakes impose lateral loads as well. Seismic resistance requires buildings to withstand both lateral and vertical loads. Strengthening methods include improving connections between columns and beams, adding diagonal bracing, steel plates, buttresses, and strengthening floor diaphragms. Base isolation technology is another effective method. SLAC has utilized these techniques for office buildings. Base isolation technology, external bracing, strengthening internal connections, shear walls, and internal dampers are effective methods to strengthen buildings against seismic forces. These techniques can reduce seismic loads and absorb energy from seismic motion, leading to reduced displacements and accelerations. NNSA has undertaken projects to improve seismic resistance for PF-4, including seismic upgrades to prevent gloveboxes from falling over during an earthquake and releasing plutonium. The upgrades aim to add about 25 years of expected useful life to the facility. NNSA has taken various actions to address seismic hazards at PF-4, such as strengthening the roof and bracing ventilation room columns. Additional repairs could further reduce radiation exposure. Steps to prevent building collapse followed by a fire include removing combustible material and implementing safety programs. NNSA implemented measures at PF-4 between 2010 and 2012 to reduce the consequences of a post-earthquake fire, including controlling ignition sources, repairing the main fire wall, and enhancing fire suppression systems. These actions decreased the potential radiation dose from 2,860 rem in 2008 to 23 rem in 2012 and less than 1 rem by 2020. The risk of a fire in RLUOB should also be reduced. Plutonium ingots are unlikely to be lofted into the air during a fire due to their high melting temperature and the formation of a protective layer of plutonium oxide. NNSA has implemented various measures at PF-4 to reduce plutonium consumption in a fire, including using fire-resistant safes, special containers, and lower-actuation-temperature sprinkler heads. Material-at-risk limits have also been imposed to minimize potential plutonium release in accidents. Future plans at PF-4 include strengthening gloveboxes, anchoring them securely to the floor, installing fire suppression equipment, and improving fire barriers to reduce the risk of plutonium release in accidents. Updating aging techniques from the Cold War era with modern technologies and practices could further decrease the amount of plutonium consumed in a fire. Possibilities include taking fewer samples per pit and utilizing improved analytic instruments for better understanding of plutonium and its impurities. Improved understanding of plutonium and its impurities could lead to reducing the number of samples taken. This could result in less workload, workforce, and floor space required in nuclear facilities. Reducing redundant analyses and accepting less precision in measurements could also speed up sample processing. Reducing sample processing time by allowing one analysis technique to perform multiple measurements could free up floor space in nuclear facilities. This would decrease worker exposure to radiation and allow for higher production rates or conducting analysis under lower risk conditions. Even in the event of a disaster, such as an earthquake or fire, the material would not pose a threat unless it escaped. In the event of a disaster like an earthquake or fire, plutonium oxide particles in RLUOB may not pose a threat if contained within the building. Various techniques, such as using foam to trap plutonium, could further reduce leakage and prevent criticality problems. Developing these methods would be beneficial for buildings with nuclear materials. In a worst-case accident scenario involving plutonium at RLUOB, the potential radiation dose would be very low. Even with a 40% leak path factor, the resulting dose would be 1.45 rem if 1 kg of WGPu was released. This calculation provides a baseline for estimating the dose from a release of nuclear materials. In a worst-case accident scenario involving plutonium at RLUOB, the potential radiation dose would be very low, with a dose of 1.45 rem even with a 40% leak path factor. Appendix B provides a more detailed calculation showing even lower results for an MOI, with the possibility of the dose being much less than shown in tables. The efficiency of space usage is crucial for enabling more pit work in PF-4 and RLUOB, with pit fabrication requiring dedicated space in PF-4. Utilizing space more efficiently in PF-4 and RLUOB by repurposing and relocating equipment could increase productivity and allow for two shifts per day, reducing costs and environmental impact compared to building new facilities. LANL estimates a 1.6 productivity increase with two shifts. The Rocky Flats Plant and SRS have operated with multiple shifts, and PF-4 is cleaning out excess plutonium with some sent to WIPP. Designing equipment for space efficiency could increase productivity. Increasing plutonium in a room raises worker dose, especially in PF-4 with kilogram quantities. Congress may need further information to examine the costs, risks, and benefits of options discussed in the report. NNSA could conduct studies on potential PF-4/RLUOB production capacity and repurposing PF-4 space to increase productivity and efficiency. Los Alamos plans to repurpose space in PF-4 for pit production. The feasibility and cost of converting RLUOB to HC-3 standards are being studied, involving potential physical changes to the building. A \"study of studies\" is needed to determine the feasibility and cost of converting RLUOB to HC-3 standards. This would involve assessing the adverse consequences of operating RLUOB with 1,000 g of WGPu. If deemed unsafe, further steps short of full conversion to HC-3 could be explored. Study of having LLNL, SRS, or both perform AC to support pit production: LLNL and SRS have infrastructure for AC, but may need upgrades and additional staff. Dispersing AC expertise to other sites in the nuclear weapons complex could be beneficial, but concentrating them at LANL is also advantageous. Unlikely that a site other than LANL would perform all AC for pit production. Questions include whether other sites should perform some AC, how much capacity to disperse, which sites to choose, and the cost of upgrades. Study of Pu-238 options: Pu-238 activities are costly due to high radioactivity levels. Pu-238 activities are costly due to high radioactivity levels. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy prepared a study on moving Pu-238 to different sites like INL, SRS, or LANL. The study did not consider the costs and benefits to the weapons program, which could impact the decision. Moving Pu-238 to another site could potentially contribute to production goals without building new facilities, but would involve significant costs and temporary disruptions. Congress could direct NNSA to conduct a study on these costs. Congress could direct NNSA to contract with an independent organization to study the cost implications of the current regulatory system governing nuclear facilities. Past efforts to construct facilities for holding Pu-239E have resulted in escalating costs and schedule delays, leading to canceled programs and unusable buildings. NNSA could report on the tradeoffs between cost and risk in the regulatory system. Long-term planning challenges for NNSA's nuclear facilities include delays, cost growth, and uncertainty in budgeting due to factors like sequesters, short-term resolutions, and changes in Administration planning. Pit production planning has been particularly difficult, with plans often being stretched out, canceled, or modified substantially. Pit production at Rocky Flats Plant ceased in 1989, LANL started war reserve pit production in 2007, NNSA has not needed to expand capacity, and there is no plan for larger-scale production. Planning for MPF began in 2002, Congress canceled it in 2005, and CMRR planning was deferred for at least five years. Delays have also affected other nuclear weapons complex projects and LEPs, raising questions about the value of long-term planning. Requirements for pit production capacity have been inconsistent, reducing credibility. Options studied for MPF in 2003 ranged from 125 to 450 ppy, supporting a stockpile of 20,000 weapons with a 450-ppy capacity. The interim capacity at LANL was 10 ppy, with a goal of 30 ppy by 2021 and a requirement of 50-80 ppy by around 2030. Despite the deferral of CMRR-NF, the requirement for 50-80 ppy remains, but it is unclear if the number needed is 50 or 80. Steady increases in estimates of pit life and reductions in numbers of weapons may reduce the required capacity, making it hard to determine what new facilities or modifications are needed. The differing time horizons between Congress and NNSA cause problems in determining the need for new facilities or modifications. NNSA takes over a decade to complete a major nuclear facility project, while Congress and the Administration frequently change course on plutonium strategy. Shortening the project timeline would benefit NNSA, as longer timelines increase the chance of plans being altered by intervening events. The funding and completion of a new plutonium facility face challenges due to the differing time horizons between Congress and NNSA. Congress finds cost overruns and delays unacceptable, but the lengthy process of analysis, planning, and construction cannot be rushed. Finding a balance between political and technical needs is crucial for successful nuclear facility projects. The NNSA faces challenges in meeting federal regulations and avoiding cost overruns and delays in construction projects. Congress canceled the MPF and deferred the CMRR-NF due to cost and schedule issues. Two plutonium buildings were built but found unusable and torn down. The NNSA faces challenges in meeting federal regulations and avoiding cost overruns and delays in construction projects. Congressional support for a modular strategy increases the likelihood of canceling the CMRR-NF. Many believe NNSA weakens its case for future projects with excessive estimates, changing plans, and risks of doing nothing. Time spent in planning and construction for new buildings can reduce risks by studying environmental impacts, seismicity, and incorporating safety measures. The NNSA faces challenges in meeting federal regulations and avoiding cost overruns and delays in construction projects. Congressional support for a modular strategy increases the likelihood of canceling the CMRR-NF. Pit production in PF-4 requires AC support from CMR, which is at high risk of collapse in an earthquake, potentially disrupting production for years. Bringing another facility online in an emergency would be costly and risky. The CMR facility has a high risk of collapse in an earthquake, putting all plutonium at risk of dispersal and contamination. This could lead to costly and time-consuming cleanup efforts, disrupting laboratory operations for months or years. Moving operations out of CMR as soon as possible is recommended to avoid these potential problems. The regulatory system defines a building's Hazard Category by MAR, with a tradeoff between cost and compliance. Safety is the objective, but MAR serves as a surrogate for safety, making it easier for regulators to measure. Compliance with DOE regulations as a Radiological Facility is limited to less than 26 g of WGPu, while an HC-3 building can hold between 38.6 grams and 2,610 grams of Pu-239E. The analysis considers factors like construction details, seismic robustness, and plutonium dispersion in case of an earthquake. Dose, not MAR, determines safety, with doses below DOE guidelines even at maximum permitted levels. Policy and strategy should drive weapons and infrastructure, but delays and cost overruns impact implementation. The political system is more flexible than the regulatory system, which is bound by statutes and regulations. The system lacks the ability to trade risk against cost, leading to excessive spending to minimize minimal risks. H.R. 1960 aims to introduce cost-benefit calculations into recommendations by DNFSB. The FY2014 defense authorization bill aimed to introduce cost-benefit calculations into DNFSB recommendations, but this provision was not included in the final legislation. The political system, unlike the regulatory system, has the authority to decide tradeoffs and offer regulatory relief. For example, political decisions could impact the feasibility of options like RLUOB/PF-4 for pit production based on DOE hazard categorization standards. The regulatory system provides limited support for pit production upgrades, focusing on meeting HC-3 requirements. In contrast, the political system can assess if upgrades reduce MOI risk and determine if the risk is acceptable without upgrades. Various options discussed in the report could address Pu-238 concerns, enable plutonium activities, and achieve 80 ppy production with minimal environmental impact and cost. Detailed studies are needed to evaluate these options further. The regulatory structure laws governing nuclear facilities prioritize worker safety, public health, and environmental protection. Key laws include the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977. Legislation holds authority over regulations, orders, and standards in the nuclear industry. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1970 established a national policy on the environment, mandated the preparation of environmental impact statements for projects with significant environmental impact, and created the Council on Environmental Quality. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) was established as an independent agency by the FY1989 National Defense Authorization Act. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was established as a separate agency within the Department of Energy by the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) was established as a separate agency within the Department of Energy by the FY2000 National Defense Authorization Act. NNSA is responsible for the nuclear weapons program and nuclear safety management, outlined in 10 CFR 830 to ensure protection of workers, the public, and the environment from hazards. The Nuclear Safety Analysis Report (SAR) is required for contractors responsible for nuclear facilities to evaluate safety bases. The Nuclear Safety Analysis Report (SAR) is required for nuclear facilities to evaluate safety bases. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) is the main regulator of nuclear weapons complex facilities, providing independent analysis and recommendations to ensure public health and safety. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) provides recommendations to the Secretary of Energy on measures to protect public health and safety at Department of Energy defense nuclear facilities. Recommendations are not requirements, but the Secretary has accepted every recommendation to date. The DOE Office of Health, Safety and Security (HSS) integrates functions for health, safety, environment, and security to provide consistent policy development and technical assistance. The DOE Office of NEPA Policy and Compliance ensures Department actions comply with NEPA requirements before project implementation. It serves as the Department's focal point for NEPA expertise in all program areas. The DOE Office of General Counsel reviews environmental impact statements for public release. NNSA Headquarters sets policy for the nuclear weapons complex, programs, and operations. NNSA Field Offices are part of the regulatory oversight. The NNSA Field Offices are responsible for regulatory oversight of the nuclear weapons complex sites, which are government-owned and contractor-operated. They hold contracts with the contractors and provide direction for implementing policy set by NNSA headquarters, Congress, and the Administration. The Los Alamos Field Office, for example, administers the contract with Los Alamos National Security, LLC. If Congress were to grant regulatory relief to RLUOB to hold more WGPu, calculations would be needed to assess the risk to laboratory staff and the public. The calculations for dose resulting from a major accident involving plutonium at RLUOB are specific to the laboratory staff and the public. The dose is calculated for a Maximally Exposed Offsite Individual and a Collocated Worker, based on their proximity to the building. The calculations do not assess risks from other factors like fire or earthquakes. The calculation for dose resulting from a major accident at RLUOB involves factors like Material At Risk (MAR), Damage Ratio (DR), and Airborne Release Fraction (ARF). It assumes a worst-case scenario of a collapse and fire releasing plutonium into the air. The Airborne Release Fraction (ARF) is specific to the type of material released into the air during an accident, such as plutonium oxide or plutonium metal. In this case, the ARF value used is 0.002, reducing the dose by a factor of 500. The calculation for dose resulting from an earthquake at RLUOB with 1,000g WGPu could be higher if the ARF value is incorrect. Los Alamos stated that the ARFs and RFs used in the calculation are typically very conservative. Los Alamos stated that the ARFs and RFs used in the calculation are typically very conservative, with values much lower than recommended for Safety Analysis. The actual dose from a collapse of RLUOB with 1,000g WGPu could be significantly smaller than indicated in Table B-2. The Leak Path Factor (LPF) is related to engineered containment mechanisms, while the Respirable Fraction (RF) is assumed to be 1 in this calculation. In the calculation, LPF is set at 1, indicating no containment is assumed. Source Term (ST) is the released material that provides dose, calculated by multiplying factors. Chi over Q (\u03c7/Q) determines plutonium particle deposition rate. Breathing Rate (BR) and Specific Activity (SA) are crucial in dose calculation. The Specific Activity (SA) of Pu-239PE is measured in curies per gram and is used to calculate dose. The Dose Conversion Factor (DCF) converts SA to rem, a measure of radiation absorbed by human tissue. DOE sets guidelines for radiation exposure in accidents involving radioactive material. Workers in close proximity to Special Nuclear Material (SNM) have a higher guideline dose of 100 rem compared to 5-25 rem for the general public. A dose of 0-25 rem has no detectable clinical effects, while 25-100 rem can have serious effects. The doses in Table B-1 and Table B-2 are very low, with a dose of 25-100 rem causing serious effects and 100-200 rem resulting in minimal symptoms. The fissile material in pits is Pu-239, but the actual material, WGPu, contains mainly Pu-239 along with other plutonium isotopes. The ratio of Pu-239 to other isotopes varies between batches and changes over time due to radioactive decay. The text discusses the conversion of radioactive material to a single unit for compliance with MAR limits. It mentions the variability in isotopic content of WGPu and the conversion factor to g Pu-239E. RLUOB is limited to holding 38.6 g Pu-239E but may need 1,000 g of weapons-grade plutonium for production support. The table shows doses from an accident releasing plutonium quantities. The table includes 2,610 g Pu-239E (1,760 g WGPu) as the maximum amount for a Hazard Category 3 building. Even in a worst-case scenario, the dose from an accident at RLUOB would be below DOE guidelines. Los Alamos National Laboratory outlined tasks needed for RLUOB to exceed Hazard Category 3 threshold. The tasks needed to convert RLUOB to an HC-3 facility are extensive and come from various sources. Some tasks may require significant effort and could result in physical changes to the building, such as seismic strengthening or added safety equipment. Structural engineers aim to ensure buildings are safe against earthquake ground motion, with building codes evolving over time based on lessons learned from past earthquakes. The 1971 San Fernando earthquake led to new seismic requirements being added to design codes, particularly for reinforced concrete buildings. The RLUOB was designed to withstand earthquake motion better than the CMR, which is vulnerable to collapse in a significant earthquake. LANL estimates that the CMR is at risk of collapse in an earthquake occurring once every 167 to 500 years. The RLUOB was built to a high standard to understand construction issues for the CMRR-NF. It was designed to withstand ground motions from a once in 2,500 years earthquake, with reinforced concrete for the basement and first two floors, and steel framing for the upper floors. RLUOB was constructed to be seismically robust, designed to withstand earthquakes with 4 to 12 times more force than what would collapse CMR. Its steel frame allows for energy dissipation through bending deformations, making it more resilient. Unlike CMR, RLUOB was built with a better understanding of seismic risks in the area, with no seismic fault directly underneath it. The seismic characteristics of the underlying geology impact a building's ability to withstand ground motion. LANL analyzed the space requirements for AC to support 80 pits per year, finding that RLUOB and CMRR-NF could support AC for 40-50 pits per year. The original plan allocated 16,500 square feet for AC in both buildings. If RLUOB held 1,000 g WGPu and CMRR-NF remained deferred, RLUOB could exceed the space needed for AC without using gloveboxes in PF-4. Performing analytical chemistry tasks in gloveboxes can be done for sample management and solid sample analysis, but tasks requiring fine manipulation are better suited for hoods. This can slow down analysis time and reduce capacity. By optimizing space use and potentially implementing two shifts per day, a configuration of PF-4 and RLUOB with 1,000 g WGPu could accommodate AC tasks efficiently. A configuration of PF-4 plus RLUOB with 1,000 g WGPu could potentially support the fabrication of 80 ppy and provide the necessary AC. Further analysis is needed for a confident conclusion."
