However, they also come with financial costs for construction, operation, maintenance, rehabilitation, and repair. Most dams in the US are owned by private entities, state or local governments, or public utilities. There are safety concerns associated with dams, especially as they age and deteriorate. Federal government agencies own a small percentage of the dams in the National Inventory of Dams. The risks of dam deterioration due to lack of maintenance, misoperation, natural hazards, and security threats can threaten public safety, economies, and the environment. Recent dam safety incidents, such as breaches in North Carolina and South Carolina, and the near failure of Oroville Dam in California, have highlighted these risks. Congress has taken steps to expedite inspections of dams and associated structures. California has expedited inspections of dams and spillway structures. Congress has long been concerned about dam safety, especially after dam failures in the 1970s. Following 9/11, there was a focus on dam security. With aging dams and increasing population density, attention is now on mitigating dam failure through inspection programs, rehabilitation, and emergency preparedness. This report highlights the federal role in dam safety. The federal role in dam safety in the United States involves agencies like FEMA, USACE, and Reclamation. Congress faces issues such as funding for dam safety programs and public awareness of risks. Dam safety focuses on preventing failures due to aging dams, floods, misoperation, and security challenges. The risks associated with dam misoperation and failure may increase as populations and development encroach upstream and downstream of some dams. Safe operation, maintenance, and routine inspections are fundamental for dam safety. The National Inventory of Dams (NID) database in the United States, maintained by USACE, defines a dam as any artificial barrier that can impound water, with specific height and storage capacity criteria for inclusion. The National Inventory of Dams (NID) database in the United States, maintained by USACE, includes dams with a capacity of more than 15 acre-feet, greater than 6 feet in height with a storage capacity of at least 50 acre-feet, or those that pose a significant threat to human life or property. Earthen dams are the most common type, made from natural soil or rock. Other types include concrete dams, tailings dams, overflow dams, and dikes. Levees, which control water movement, are not covered in this report. Dams serve various purposes such as recreation, flood control, irrigation, and hydroelectric power generation. Dams serve multiple purposes such as fisheries management, irrigation, hydroelectric power, mining, and navigation. Many dams were built over fifty years ago and may not meet current safety standards. Dam failures can occur due to various reasons like floods, faulty design, misoperation, overtopping, foundation defects, and seismic activity. Dam failures can occur due to various reasons such as floods, faulty design, misoperation, overtopping, foundation defects, and seismic activity. Engineers have documented over 1,600 dam failures resulting in approximately 3,500 casualties in the United States since the 19th century. Between 2000 and 2019, states reported 294 failures and 537 nonfailure dam safety incidents. Some dam failures have resulted in notable disasters in the United States. Recent events have brought attention to dam safety, with incidents like the Oroville Dam evacuation in California and multiple dam breaches in North and South Carolina due to extreme storms. Other notable failures include the Kaloko Dam in Hawaii and the Silver Lake Dam in Michigan, causing significant damage and casualties. Federal guidelines establish hazard potential ratings to assess the potential harm. Federal guidelines use hazard potential ratings to quantify the harm from dam failure. The ratings (low, significant, high) indicate damage, not likelihood of failure. 65% of dams in the NID are low hazard, but reclassification has increased high hazard dams from 9,921 to 15,629 from 2000 to 2018. Hazard creep, development near dams, is a key factor. Reclassification to high or significant hazard can trigger action. Reclassification from low to high hazard potential may lead to stricter regulatory requirements, including increased spillway capacity, structural improvements, more frequent inspections, and updating emergency action plans. The 2018 NID shows that 63% of high hazard potential dams had satisfactory or fair condition assessments, 15% had poor assessments, and 22% were not rated. Actions may be taken for dams with poor assessments, such as reservoir drawdowns, to reduce risk. In dam safety, risk consists of likelihood of triggering events, structural deficiencies, and consequences. Prevention involves proper design, construction, inspections, and maintenance. Response includes community planning, emergency prep, and stakeholder awareness. Policies focus on preventing failure and preparing for consequences. Rehabilitation aims to bring dams up to standard. Rehabilitation of dams involves bringing them up to current safety standards, including increasing spillway capacity and addressing structural deficiencies. A 2019 study projected that the cost to rehabilitate high hazard potential dams in the NID would exceed $70 billion. Funding requirements for dam safety rehabilitation and repair are expected to increase as infrastructure ages and design standards evolve. Emergency action plans (EAPs) and inundation maps are crucial for informed decision-making to reduce the risk of dam failures. EAPs outline preplanned actions to minimize damage and loss of life during emergencies, including early warning procedures and responsibilities of different parties. Inundation maps show critical areas for action in case of a dam failure. Many agencies overseeing dams require EAPs, especially for high hazard dams. In 2018, 74% of federally owned dams and 80% of state-regulated dams in the United States had Emergency Action Plans (EAPs) focusing on high hazard potential dams. Federal agencies provide tools like FEMA's RiskMAP program and Decision Support System for Water Infrastructure Security (DSS-WISE) Lite to assist dam owners, regulators, emergency managers, and communities in preparing for and responding to dam failures. FEMA conducted emergency dam-break flood simulations for 36 dams in Puerto Rico during Hurricane Maria. DamWatch is a monitoring tool for nonfederal flood control dams in Puerto Rico, alerting personnel during critical events. ShakeCast notifies dam owners of potential earthquake impacts. The federal government is involved in dam safety through various actions. The National Dam Safety Program (NDSP) was established in 1996 under FEMA's direction, following legislative and executive actions. It facilitates collaboration among federal agencies, states, and dam owners for safety. Congress has reauthorized the NDSP four times and enacted other dam safety programs. The National Dam Safety Program (NDSP) was established in 1996 under FEMA's direction to provide dam safety resources, training, and grant assistance to state programs. The program does not enforce uniform standards but allocates grant funding to states through the National Dam Safety Review Board (NDSRB). The Interagency Committee on Dam Safety (ICODS) coordinates federal efforts for dam safety, chaired by FEMA and including representatives from various agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), International Boundary and Water Commission, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Tennessee Valley Authority, and various government departments oversee dam safety. Most states have regulatory programs for dam safety, covering 69% of NID dams. State programs include safety evaluations, inspections, emergency preparedness, and funding limitations may impact their activities. The Model State Dam Safety Program recommends one full-time employee for every 20 regulated dams. California is the only state meeting this target. Some states lack authority to require EAPs for high hazard dams. The National Dam Safety Program Act authorizes state assistance programs. Grant Assistance to State Dam Safety Programs is available for states meeting minimal requirements set by the National Dam Safety Program Act. Funding is allocated based on a formula, with one-third distributed equally among participating states and two-thirds based on the number of state-regulated dams. The grants aim to improve state programs using the Model State Dam Safety Program as a guide, supporting activities such as training, inspections, awareness workshops, and coordination with emergency preparedness officials. Some funds may also go towards supporting the salaries of full-time employees in state dam safety programs. In FY2019, FEMA distributed $6.8 million in dam safety program grants to 49 states and Puerto Rico. The grant funds support the salaries of FTEs conducting activities, not for rehabilitation and repair. FEMA provides technical training to dam safety inspectors upon states' request, regardless of participation in the matching grant program. At the end of each odd-numbered fiscal year, FEMA submits a report to Congress on the NDSP's status, progress in dam safety, and any recommendations for legislation. Federal agencies and states provide FEMA with annual program performance assessments on key metrics such as inspections, rehabilitation and repair activities, EAPs, staffing, and budgets. USACE provides summaries and analysis of NID data to FEMA. Metrics for the dam safety program show improvement, with the percentage of state-regulated high hazard potential dams with EAPs and condition assessments increasing over the years. The percentage of dams inspected has remained stable, with USACE and Reclamation owning 42% of federal dams. The federal government, through agencies like USACE and Reclamation, owns 42% of federal dams, including many large dams. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, own smaller dams. Each federal agency is responsible for maintaining the safety of the dams they own, following the Federal Guidelines for Dam Safety. Inspections are recommended at least once every five years, with some agencies requiring more frequent inspections. Inspections of federal dams are typically conducted every five years, with some agencies requiring more frequent inspections based on hazard potential. Inspections may lead to updates on hazard potential and condition assessments. Funding for inspections comes from agency O&M budgets. After identifying safety deficiencies, federal agencies may prioritize risk reduction measures or rehabilitation and repair activities. Funding constraints may require agencies to prioritize dam rehabilitation and repair investments alongside other construction projects. Federal agencies have shifted from a standards-based approach to a portfolio risk management approach for dam safety programs, evaluating all modes of failure and prioritizing rehabilitation efforts. USACE implements inspections and risk analyses for its dams, using a Dam Safety Action Classification System to address safety risks. USACE uses a Dam Safety Action Classification System (DSAC) to address dam safety risks, funded through various accounts including Investigations, O&M, and Construction. The Dam Safety and Seepage/Stability Correction Program conducts evaluations and studies for high-risk dams. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) evaluates high-risk dams for safety incidents and unsatisfactory performance, providing determinations for modification or reclassification. Dam safety modification studies investigate deficiencies and propose risk-reducing alternatives, with USACE funding construction through project-specific line items. Cost-sharing authorities like major rehabilitation and dam safety assurance are used for modifications, scheduled based on funding availability. Major rehabilitation is for significant structural repairs or replacements related to dam safety. Major rehabilitation for dam safety repairs requires nonfederal sponsors to pay a standard cost share. USACE does not support facilities turned over to local sponsors for O&M. Dam safety assurance cost sharing applies to all USACE-built dams. Modifications are based on new data or safety criteria changes. Section 1203 of the Water Resources Development Act reduces sponsor responsibility to 15% of nonfederal cost share. GAO recommended policy clarification for cost sharing in USACE dam safety repairs. The GAO recommended policy clarification for cost sharing in USACE dam safety repairs, specifically regarding the \"state-of-the-art\" provision. USACE implemented a new policy allowing for this provision across its dam portfolio, resulting in a significant reduction in nonfederal cost share for the Harland County Dam repair. Recent dam safety construction projects by USACE have varied in cost, with most ranging from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. In FY2018, USACE funded $268 million for 10 dam safety construction projects at DSAC 1 and DSAC 2 dams. In FY2019, USACE estimated a $20 billion backlog for dam safety concerns at DSAC 1 and DSAC 2 dams. Reclamation's dam safety program, authorized by the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978, provides for inspections and repairs at Reclamation dams. Reclamation conducts dam safety inspections through the SEED program using DSPR. Corrective actions are carried out through the ISCA program, funded by Reclamation for modifications on priority structures based on identified risks and needs. The Reclamation Safety of Dams Act Amendments of 1984 requires a 15% cost share. In 2015, P.L. 114-113 increased Reclamation's authority to approve dam safety modifications up to $20 million without congressional authorization. The Secretary of the Interior can develop additional project benefits alongside dam safety modifications if deemed necessary. Nonfederal and federal funding participants must agree to a cost share for these benefits. Congress appropriated $71 million in FY2019 for dam safety projects. In FY2019, Congress appropriated $71 million for dam safety modifications, including funding for SEED and the Dam Safety Program. Reclamation estimated that dam safety projects through FY2030 would cost between $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion. The Commissioner of Reclamation serves as the DOI's coordinator for dam safety and provides training to other DOI agencies. Some federal agencies are involved in dam safety activities for nonfederal dams. Congress has enacted legislation to regulate hydropower projects, mining activities, and nuclear facilities, which may utilize dams. States may also have jurisdiction over these activities and dams, overseeing dam safety in coordination with federal regulations. FERC has the authority to issue licenses for hydroelectric projects, including dams owned by state or local governments. Approximately 3,036 dams are regulated by FERC's dam safety program, with 1,374 being nonfederal dams listed in the 2018 NID. FERC oversees the licensing and inspection of nonfederal dams, including high hazard ones in California, New York, and Michigan. Licenses are typically for 30-50 years and require relicensing. FERC conducts regular inspections and mandates more thorough ones for certain dams every five years. FERC conducts regular inspections of nonfederal dams, including high hazard ones in California, New York, and Michigan. These inspections involve a detailed review of design, construction, performance, and current condition assessment of the entire project. If deficiencies are identified, the project owner must submit a plan to remediate them, with FERC monitoring the corrective actions. In cases of highly critical findings, FERC can require immediate risk-reduction measures, such as reservoir drawdowns. After the 2017 spillway incident at Oroville Dam, California's Department of Water Resources and FERC engaged independent teams to investigate the causes of the incident. After the 2017 spillway incident at Oroville Dam, FERC convened an after-action panel to evaluate dam safety program focusing on design, construction, and operations. Reports raised questions about FERC's oversight, highlighting failures due to overlooked technical details like spillway components and original design. Limited attention to spillways compared to main dams was also noted. After the Oroville incident, FERC identified 27 dam spillways with safety concerns and is working with dam licensees to address deficiencies. A 2018 GAO review found FERC prioritizing individual dam inspections but lacking portfolio-wide risk analyses. FERC has begun developing a risk-assessment program for regulated dams and produced draft guidelines for risk-informed decision-making. The Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulates private dams used in or resulting from mining, with approximately 1,640 dams in its inventory. Of these, 447 are in the 2018 National Inventory of Dams (NID), with 220 classified as high hazard. MSHA develops standards and conducts inspections to ensure compliance with regulations. The Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulates private dams used in or resulting from mining, with approximately 1,640 dams in its inventory. MSHA inspects each surface mine and associated dams at least two times a year and each underground mine and associated dams at least four times a year. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) administers the federal government's responsibility to regulate active coal mines under Title V of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. OSMRE regulates 69 dams at coal mines under federal and Indian lands regulatory authority. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates uranium mill tailings dams, storage water pond dams at in situ leach (ISL) uranium recovery facilities, and dams integral to the operation of other licensed facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) directly regulates eight dams, deferring oversight to other federal agencies when necessary. States may regulate dams associated with nuclear activities through agreement state programs. Nonfederal dam owners are responsible for safety and rehabilitation, with an estimated $65.9 billion needed for rehabilitation in 2019. Some states offer limited assistance through grant or loan programs. The WIIN Act authorized FEMA to administer a grant program for high hazard dam rehabilitation, providing funding assistance for repair, removal, or rehabilitation of nonfederal high hazard potential dams. Nonfederal sponsors like state governments or nonprofit organizations can apply for grants to distribute funding received from FEMA to eligible dams. The WIIN Act authorized FEMA to administer a grant program for high hazard dam rehabilitation, providing funding assistance for repair, removal, or rehabilitation of nonfederal high hazard potential dams. Eligible dams must meet specific criteria and commit to certain requirements to receive grant funding from FEMA. The WIIN Act allocated varying amounts of funding annually from FY2017 to FY2026 for the High Hazard Dam Rehabilitation Grant Program. FEMA distributes grant money to nonfederal sponsors for high hazard dam rehabilitation. Grants are based on a formula with a maximum of $7.5 million per sponsor. Congress allocated $10 million in FY2019 for this program. 26 nonfederal sponsors were awarded grants in FY2019. In FY2019, 26 nonfederal sponsors were awarded grants ranging from $153,000 to $1,250,000 for dam rehabilitation. The NRCS provides assistance for watershed activities related to managing water in agricultural or rural areas. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program was created to address the aging watershed dams constructed with NRCS assistance. The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program, authorized under the Grain Standards and Warehouse Improvement Act of 2000, provides assistance for rehabilitating watershed dams to extend their service life and ensure compliance with safety standards. NRCS may cover up to 65% of rehabilitation costs, with discretionary funding of up to $85 million annually. Over $700 million has been appropriated for projects since FY2000. Congress has allocated over $700 million for rehabilitation projects, with the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program receiving an average annual appropriation of $11.2 million. The USACE's Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) provides federal support for selected nonfederal dams meeting specific criteria, including flood control assistance for damaged facilities. As of 2017, 33 nonfederal dams were considered \"active\" in RIP. Congress may consider oversight and legislation relating to dam safety in the larger framework of infrastructure improvements and risk management. This includes evaluating the federal role for dam safety, appropriations for federal dam safety programs, project modifications for federal dams, and financial assistance for nonfederal dam safety programs and dams. Congress may also review policies for disclosure of dam safety information in the context of providing dam safety risk. The federal government has been involved in overseeing national dam safety standards since the 1970s, providing technical assistance for dam design, construction, and maintenance. Despite improvements in dam safety metrics, deficiencies in federal and state programs have been highlighted, with incidents like the 2017 spillway incident at Oroville Dam raising concerns. Some federal agencies have faced criticism for their dam safety programs, such as the Department of Defense lacking a consistent dam safety inspection policy. Some federal agencies are implementing new dam safety policies following findings of deficiencies in federal and state programs. Congress may consider oversight activities to incorporate lessons learned from incidents like the Oroville Dam into dam inspection protocols. Financial and other limitations are reported by some agencies in revising or expanding their dam safety programs, which Congress may need to address through new authorities or appropriations. Some stakeholders advocate for a larger federal role in nonfederal dam safety due to limited resources and authorities at the state level. However, concerns exist about encroaching on state and local sovereignty and the potential growth of the federal government's role. Dam removal is considered as a potential policy alternative. Dam removal is a potential policy alternative to rehabilitating and repairing high hazard dams. Congress has considered incentives to encourage states to remove dams that are deemed unnecessary or too costly to repair. When considering dam removal for safety reasons, policymakers must weigh the costs and benefits of removal. The cost of O&M, rehabilitation, and repair for nonfederal high hazard dams in the NID is estimated at $18.7 billion, with an overall cost of $65.9 billion for nonfederal dams. Calls for increased federal funding to prevent emergencies and loss of lives. Twenty-three states have established funding programs for dam rehabilitation. Twenty-three states have established state-funded grant or loan programs to assist dam owners with repairs. The FEMA High Hazard Dam Rehabilitation Grant Program was authorized by Congress in the WIIN Act, with $10 million allocated in 2019. Congress is debating funding for the program in FY2020, with the House Committee recommending no money and the Senate Committee recommending $10 million. There is a discussion on focusing federal resources on federal dams versus nonfederal dams, as federal agencies own only 3% of dams in the NID, but many of these are large dams that can impact large populations and require costly repairs. In FY2019, USACE estimated a $20 billion backlog for dam safety concerns, with investments in dam rehabilitation and repair needed to alleviate risks. Reclamation estimates dam safety modification projects for Reclamation-owned dams would cost $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion through FY2030. Congress is considering authorizing mandatory funding from the Reclamation Fund for dam O&M, rehabilitation, and repair to address the backlog. Some support this proposal, while others argue it would remove necessary oversight. Water Council and Members of Congress argue that increasing mandatory funding for dam safety would remove oversight and control of the Reclamation Fund, leading to budget deficits. Agencies with smaller dam portfolios face challenges due to lack of resources, especially when dam safety competes with other projects. The Fish and Wildlife Service suggests downgrading small impoundments from the definition of a dam to alleviate financial burdens and reduce unnecessary dam safety obligations. Some stakeholders recommend alternative funding structures for dam safety, such as a federal low-interest revolving loan program or financial credit for disaster assistance. Congress may consider maintaining current spending levels for dam safety, as metrics for the National Dam Safety Program and federal agencies owning dams have shown improvement. Certain federal dam safety programs are adopting risk-based approaches to managing their dam portfolios. Congress may consider amending the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to include rehabilitation and repair of nonfederal dams for credit assistance. Funding for dam safety programs would require both authority and appropriations from Congress. Many Americans may be unaware of living downstream of a dam, highlighting the need for public awareness. The public may not be aware of living downstream of a dam or the potential risks associated with dam safety. Lack of access to dam safety information and public confidence in dam integrity may contribute to this lack of awareness. Dam safety processes and products aim to enhance community resilience, but access to this information is generally restricted. The security of water infrastructure, including dams, was highlighted after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, emphasizing the potential disruption to water resources from malicious attacks. A malicious attack could disrupt water resource services, threaten public health, and result in catastrophic flooding. Federal policy restricts public access to dam condition assessments due to security concerns post-9/11. Dam assessments are considered critical infrastructure and are only accessible to approved government users. FEMA is considering making condition assessments of NID dams unrestricted for public access, raising concerns about sharing inundation scenarios for public safety versus malicious use. Currently, inundation mapping data is shared with emergency managers, not the public. Some argue that disclosure of information on NID dams to emergency managers is sufficient for public safety, considering the risk of malicious use post-9/11."
