    "content": "The report reviews the process for congressional consideration of foreign arms sales proposed by the President, as outlined in the Arms Export Control Act. The executive branch can proceed with a sale unless Congress passes legislation prohibiting it. The President must submit the proposal to Congress after determining readiness. The Department of State notifies Congress of a major arms sale 20 days in advance. The executive branch provides informal notification of major arms sales to congressional committees 20 days before formal action. This practice began in 1976 and was updated in 2012 with a \"tiered review\" process by the State Department. Committees are notified 20-40 days before formal notification for major arms sales. During the Congressional review period, committees can raise concerns and have them addressed before formal notification. If significant concerns are raised, the review period can be extended. Congress must be formally notified 30 days before final steps can be taken under Section 36(b) of the AECA. Congress must be formally notified 30 calendar days before the Administration can conclude a government-to-government foreign military sale of major defense equipment valued at $14 million or more, defense articles or services valued at $50 million or more, or design and construction services valued at $200 million or more. For sales to NATO member states, NATO, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New Zealand, Congress must be formally notified 15 calendar days in advance. Higher thresholds apply for NATO members and certain countries. The Arms Export Control Act requires formal notification to Congress before the sale, enhancement, or upgrading of design and construction services for certain countries. Additional reporting requirements apply to articles listed on the Missile Technology Control Regime. Commercially licensed arms sales also require notification to Congress 30 days in advance for certain thresholds. Formal notification to Congress is required for arms sales valued at $50 million or more, with specific thresholds for sales to NATO members, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New Zealand. The thresholds are $25 million for major defense equipment, $100 million for defense articles and services, and $300 million for design and construction services. Additionally, firearms sales over $1 million must also be notified to Congress. Formal notification to Congress is required for arms sales valued at $1 million or more, with specific thresholds for sales to NATO members, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New Zealand. The President must submit a report to relevant committees at least 45 days before exports' delivery if technology or capability has been enhanced or upgraded. This requirement applies for 10 years after Congress has been notified of the export. According to Section 36(b)(5)(C), upgrades or enhancements meeting certain value thresholds require a new notification to Congress. The export will be treated as a separate offer with all the necessary requirements. Higher thresholds apply to sales to NATO members, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New Zealand. A congressional recess does not halt the 30-day review period. If Congress does not block the sale within 30 days of notification, the executive branch can proceed with the sales process. The sales contract for arms purchases must be signed, and items transferred 31 days after statutory notification. Congress can block arms sales using a joint resolution of disapproval under Section 36(b) of the AECA. Notifications must be submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Speaker, who refers them to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. After receiving a Section 36(b) notification, opponents can introduce joint resolutions in the House and Senate to block arms sales. If no resolution is introduced, expedited congressional action does not occur. Committee hearings would follow, and if a majority supports the resolution, it would be reported to the respective chamber. Efforts would then be made for floor consideration of the resolution. Since 1976, procedures have been in place to expedite the consideration of arms sales resolutions of disapproval in the Senate. Section 36(b)(2) of the AECA requires resolutions to be considered in accordance with Section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976. This rule also applies to resolutions related to commercially licensed arms sales under Section 36(c)(1) of the AECA since 1980. Section 601(b) establishes rules to ensure timely consideration of resolutions of disapproval, superseding the standing rules of the Senate. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is given 10 calendar days to review a resolution of disapproval before further action is taken. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has 10 calendar days to review a resolution of disapproval. A Senator can move to discharge the committee if it fails to report back within the 10 days. The discharge motion is privileged and limits floor debate to one hour. The motion to proceed to consider a resolution of disapproval is also privileged and cannot be amended. The Senate can limit debate on a resolution of disapproval to 10 hours and restrict amendments. The Senate has the power to change its rules at any time. The House must consider a motion to proceed with a joint resolution disapproving an arms sale. The House of Representatives may consider a joint resolution disapproving an arms sale, which is given precedence over other legislative business. The resolution can be called up on the floor without a special rule, and amendments can be offered under the \"five-minute rule\" in the Committee of the Whole. The Rules Committee could set the framework for floor consideration of the resolution. The House Rules Committee could set a time limit for debate and exclude amendments to a joint resolution of disapproval for an arms sale. Once passed by both the House and Senate, the resolution would go to the President who could veto it. Congress would then need a two-thirds majority in both houses to override the veto. Congress also has the power to block or modify a proposed sale of major defense equipment through regular legislative processes. Congress has the power to block or modify arms sales through regular legislative processes, regardless of AECA reporting requirements. A properly drafted law could prevent a sale transaction at any time, even before formal notification or after the 30-day statutory period. Congressional action is not constrained by AECA notifications, but would require overriding a presidential veto. Congress can block or modify arms sales through legislative processes, requiring a two-thirds majority to override a presidential veto. It is advantageous to act before a sales contract is signed to avoid political damage and financial liabilities. The legislative vehicle for prohibiting or modifying arms sales can take various forms. The legislative vehicle for prohibiting or modifying arms sales can take various forms, such as a rider to a bill or a freestanding bill. It must be passed by Congress and contain a restriction on the sale of military equipment to specific countries. The President can waive statutory review periods in case of an emergency. The President has the authority to proceed with arms sales without delay in emergency circumstances, providing detailed justification to Congress. The Foreign Assistance Act allows for waivers of provisions to make cash arms sales available up to $750 million and funds up to $250 million annually. The President can waive provisions for cash arms sales up to $750 million and funds up to $250 million annually, with restrictions on amounts per country. Congressional consultation and justification are required before exercising this authority. Despite potential majority support in Congress to block or modify arms sales, passing legislation faces significant obstacles. Even if Congress can pass a law, the President can veto it and only needs one-third plus one support to sustain the veto. While Congress has not successfully blocked arms sales, it has influenced timing and composition through strong opposition during consultations with the executive branch. On May 24, 2019, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo directed the State Department to notify Congress of 22 pending arms transfers to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The transfers included defense articles and services, as well as a coproduction agreement for Paveway precision-guided munitions in Saudi Arabia. The Senate later passed legislation prohibiting certain arms transfers, including the Paveway coproduction agreement and support for the Aurora Fuzing System for the Paveway IV Precision Guided Bomb Program. The Senate passed resolutions prohibiting arms transfers, including the manufacture of the Aurora Fuzing System for the Paveway IV Precision Guided Bomb Program. The House also passed resolutions prohibiting transfers to the UAE of defense articles and services for the Maverick AGM-65 missile and Paveway systems. President Trump vetoed the bills, and a Senate vote to override the vetoes failed. The Senate passed resolutions to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia, including E-3A AWACS aircraft and missiles. President Reagan made commitments to Congress regarding the sale. Legislation was later enacted to require certification of these commitments before delivery. In 1986, President Reagan proposed the sale of additional missiles to Saudi Arabia, but the Senate passed legislation to block it. In 1986, the Senate passed legislation (S.J.Res. 316) to block the sale of Stinger missiles to Saudi Arabia. President Reagan vetoed the legislation but agreed not to include the controversial missiles in the sales proposal. The Senate sustained the veto, allowing the sale of other missiles to proceed. In 2016, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee rejected a motion to prohibit the sale of defense articles, including F-16 aircraft. In 2016, the Senate rejected a motion to prohibit the sale of defense articles, including F-16 aircraft, to Saudi Arabia. The State Department advised Pakistan to use national funds for the purchase after objections from Congress. The U.S. offer expired when Islamabad failed to submit a letter of acceptance by the deadline. The bill aimed to restrict the transfer of certain defense articles and services to support precision guided munitions for Royal Saudi Air Force planes."
