    "content": "Recent drought in the Southeast has intensified a tri-state water conflict involving Alabama, Florida, and Georgia over water allocation and management in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river basin. The water at stake is vital for municipalities, industries, hydropower dams, power plants, navigation interests, agriculture, and the Apalachicola Bay oyster industry. Management of the current drought may shape long-term ACF management, federal drought responses, and the role of the Endangered Species Act in water resources management. The drought in the Southeast has heightened a water conflict among Alabama, Florida, and Georgia in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river basin. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers faces challenges in managing reservoirs to meet water needs while complying with federal law and protecting ecosystems. Georgia's upper basin users are concerned about water depletion from Lake Lanier during the ongoing drought. The report provides an analysis of federal water management issues in the ACF basin during drought. Decision-makers must balance the harm to aquatic species from reduced flows against the benefits of storing water for future use. Sections cover water resources, federal reservoir operations, ACF water uses, and how species protections impact Corps operations. The fourth section discusses how species protections impact Corps operations in the ACF basin, while the fifth section briefly mentions legislation in the 110th Congress related to water supply and management in the Southeast. The report concludes with comments on federal water policies and projects in the ACF basin. The ACF basin drains areas of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, with Congress authorizing federal facilities for water resources development in 1945 and 1946. The Corps currently operates five dams in the basin. The Corps operates five dams in the ACF basin, with four storing water and one for navigation. These dams include Buford Dam, West Point, W. F. George, Woodruff, and Andrews Dam. Changes in water resource use have occurred since the reservoirs were built, originally for navigation, hydropower, and flood control. The Atlanta metro area has grown economically and in population, leading to increased competition for ACF waters. Conflicting interests arise in maintaining water storage and river flows. Recognizing the start of a drought is challenging, as is making decisions on tradeoffs between current and future costs. The current drought surpasses conditions experienced in Georgia during the mid-1950s, considered the state's most severe drought. 2007 was the second-driest year on record for Atlanta. In 2007, Lake Lanier experienced significant drawdown due to low runoff in the basin, triggering urgent concern from water users. Lake Lanier provides 72% of the water supply for Atlanta and refills slowly. Lake Lanier provides a significant portion of Atlanta's water supply and refills slowly. The conflict among states escalated due to the lack of a water allocation agreement, leading to concerns about Georgia's water conservation efforts and the justification for minimum flow requirements in the Apalachicola River. Georgia officials in the 1970s and 1980s were increasingly worried about water supply for the Atlanta metro area. In the 1980s, Georgia officials were concerned about water supply for Atlanta's growing needs. The Corps agreed to provide more water storage in Lake Lanier, leading to lawsuits from Alabama and Florida over the impact on the lower basin and NEPA compliance. The reallocation issue remains unresolved, sparking ongoing legal disputes and a failed tri-state water compact. The conflict over water allocation in the ACF states remains unresolved, with disputes between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The states follow different water rights doctrines, making allocation challenging. Riparian rights in the east allow reasonable usage by those bordering waters, while prior appropriation in the west gives superior rights to the first users. This has led to a failed tri-state water compact and ongoing legal battles. The conflict over water allocation in the ACF states between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia remains unresolved. The states follow different water rights doctrines, making allocation challenging. The federal government has authority to manage water resources, but recognizes states' authority in water allocation within their jurisdictions. Federal laws often require federal agencies to defer to state laws or cooperate with state officials in implementing federal laws. The ACF conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia remains unresolved due to differing water rights doctrines. Federal laws require cooperation with state officials in implementing laws, affecting water use in the basin. Federal investments in dams regulate river flows, impacting water use. ESA protection and NEPA reviews influence dam operations. Litigation and lack of agreement on water allocation result in piece-meal guidance for dam operations by the Corps. The Corps operates ACF dams with piece-meal guidance, lacking comprehensive analysis or review. Current operations are based on a 2007 exceptional drought modification to a 2006 interim plan for Woodruff Dam, amending the 1989 draft plan for the entire ACF. The 1989 WCP for the ACF has not been finalized due to litigation and expectations for a negotiated agreement on tri-state water allocation before 2003. The WCP established operational zones for federal reservoirs to manage releases based on changing storage volumes throughout the year. The Corps adopted the Interim Operations Plan (IOP) for Woodruff Dam in October 2006, adding new in-stream flow requirements for the Apalachicola River to protect endangered species. The plan is interim until a comprehensive ACF water control plan is adopted, establishing minimum flows based on different inflow rates into reservoirs. This constrained the Corps' operations to meet minimum flow requirements in normal and dry conditions. The Interim Operations Plan (IOP) for Woodruff Dam, adopted in October 2006, imposed new in-stream flow requirements on the Corps to protect endangered species in the Apalachicola River. The plan required releases from reservoir storage to meet minimum flow requirements in both normal and dry conditions. The IOP guided Corps' operations in 2007, resulting in criticisms from upper basin interests regarding reservoir management and the unnecessary risk of system storage depletion. The Corps implemented an Exceptional Drought Operations (EDO) modification to the Interim Operations Plan (IOP) in response to long-term impacts on federal reservoir management and water use in the basin. The EDO, approved through a Biological Opinion, reduced the minimum flow requirement for the Apalachicola River, allowing more water to be stored in basin reservoirs. The EDO modified the IOP to reduce minimum flow requirements for the Apalachicola River, allowing more water to be stored in reservoirs. This decision aimed to mitigate the risk of lower flows in the future due to drought conditions. The effects on electricity generation were also considered, with no significant immediate harm reported. Triggers were established for the Corps to reduce flows as per the BiOp. The Corps and FWS agreed on triggers to reduce flows in the Apalachicola River from 5,000 cfs to 4,750 cfs, then to 4,500 cfs. Reduction to 4,150 cfs may be considered in late spring 2008. Flows had not yet been reduced below 4,750 cfs due to winter rains. The Corps proposed a modified IOP to incorporate elements of the EDO and other changes, with a Biological Opinion expected by June 1, 2008. The modified IOP proposal includes storing more water during winter and drought periods, releasing more during spawning periods to avoid triggering lower Apalachicola River minimum flows. The Corps plans to store 50% of basin inflow, eliminate a minimum flow of 6,500 cfs during wetter periods, make fish spawn releases dependent on storage level, and switch to a three-season operation regime. The Corps began revising its water control manual for ACF reservoirs in 2007-2008 winter. The omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 prohibits implementing a new water control manual but requires data on basin withdrawals by September 2008. The Corps plans to spend $1 million on updating the water control manual for ACF reservoirs by September 2008. The revision is crucial due to the failure of a tri-state agreement and ongoing litigation. Consumptive water use in the basin reduces available water for other uses. Efforts to reduce consumption include efficiency programs and emergency measures. Municipal, industrial, and agricultural sectors are the main consumers in the ACF basin. Georgia dominates consumptive water use in the ACF basin, with municipal and industrial use averaging 290 million gallons per day. The Atlanta metro area is the largest consumer, but other communities also rely on ACF water. Georgia's agriculture sector has variable demand, concentrated from May to September depending on precipitation and soil conditions. Georgia agriculture's consumptive use of surface water and groundwater affecting ACF river flows can exceed 650 mgd during a dry summer's growing season, fall to close to nothing during winter months, and averages 170 mgd during a normal year. Alabama consumes less ACF water than Georgia, averaging less than 50 mgd annually from the Chattahoochee River for municipal and industrial use. Florida has few consumptive withdrawals directly from the Apalachicola River, with permits for less than 3 mgd from the Chipola River. The district in this region of Florida adopted a rule limiting water withdrawals to reserve water in the Apalachicola and Chipola Rivers for fish and wildlife. M&I water supplies are withdrawn from various sources including ACF rivers, federal reservoirs, and aquifers. The Corps now operates ACF reservoirs for multiple purposes including fish and wildlife protection, water quality protection, and recreation in addition to the original authorized purposes. Lake Lanier also supplies water to the Atlanta metro area, with litigation ongoing regarding the Corps' operation of the reservoirs for water supply. The Corps cites the Water Supply Act of 1958 as authorization to provide water supply storage space at Corps facilities for M&I purposes. Contracts for space in the reservoir do not guarantee a fixed quantity of water, and the Corps delivers water if available without affecting authorized purposes. The act does not allow significant modifications to projects for M&I water supply. Most M&I water from Lake Lanier is provided under temporary contracts, with a proposal to replace them with interim storage contracts. The 28-county Atlanta metropolitan area, home to over 5 million people, requires congressional authorization for increased water storage space as part of a Settlement Agreement. By 2030, the region may grow to 8 million people, receiving over 99% of its water from surface water sources. Atlanta's history as a rail center has led to its unique position as a major metropolitan area in the headwaters of a river system. Metropolitan North Georgia heavily relies on surface water sources, with Lake Lanier and the Chattahoochee River supplying 72% of its water. The region's water supply is vulnerable to drought and changes in Buford Dam operations. Additionally, the Corps-operated Lake Allatoona reservoir on the Etowah River provides 12% of the water supply. The Etowah basin in the ACT provides 12% of Metropolitan North Georgia's water supply, with groundwater currently making up less than 1% of the total supply. Groundwater was a significant source before the 1940s, but the region shifted to surface water due to increased demands. Aquifers in northwest Georgia are small, limiting significant yields from individual wells. There is some exploration into expanding groundwater use for supply augmentation during droughts, but it is not expected to be a major long-term supply. The Water Supply and Water Conservation Management Plan for the Atlanta metro area predicts a shortage in water supply between 2013 and 2020 unless water from Lake Lanier and Lake Allatoona is reallocated. A review by the Pacific Institute criticized the plan's population projections and conservation measures, suggesting that cost-effective demand management could meet future demand without reallocations. The Conservation Management Plan for the Atlanta metro area emphasizes reallocating water storage in Lake Lanier and Lake Allatoona for water supply needs through 2030. It also includes efforts for new reservoir permitting, water conservation measures, and concerns about reduced in-stream flows in the Apalachicola River. Upper basin interests argue for the economic benefits of reallocating Lake Lanier storage for M&I water supply and reservoir recreation, estimating a $19.3 billion benefit. Lower basin interests criticize the analysis for overlooking ecosystem costs, lower basin losses, and ecosystem services value. Agricultural water supply is a significant use in the ACF's Flint River sub-basin, accounting for over 90% of annual withdrawals. Agricultural water use in the Flint River sub-basin influences ACF reservoir operations, especially during droughts. Irrigation increases crop yields but can impact stream flow and aquifer levels during dry conditions. The current drought has raised concerns about the effects of irrigation on water availability in the area. Agricultural irrigation in southwest Georgia, particularly in the lower Flint River sub-basin, has significantly increased since the late 1970s, with 40% of harvested cropland being irrigated. Irrigation greatly enhances crop yields, quality, diversity, and economic returns. The majority of irrigation water is withdrawn from aquifers connected to surface waters, exacerbating the impact of climatic drought on low stream flows in the area. Converting to more water-intensive crops could increase agricultural water demand in Georgia. Irrigation water conservation measures are encouraged for all holders of agricultural water permits. Starting January 2006, conservation measures are required for new or modified permits, including source water management and more efficient irrigation. The USDA, along with state and private partners, funds water conservation efforts in the Flint River basin through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. The 1998-2002 drought raised awareness in Georgia regarding drought impacts and interest in drought planning and management. The first Georgia Drought Management Plan was adopted in 2003, with unique indicators developed through a participatory approach. Georgia's plan covers monitoring, communication, response, and mitigation measures but lacks a vulnerability analysis. Alabama's plan is currently operational. Georgia's drought management plan focuses on short-term actions to reduce water demand during a drought, lacking measures for long-term demand management related to population growth and industrial/agricultural sectors. This limitation is common among state drought plans. The state of Georgia's drought risk is increasing due to population and agricultural growth, despite improvements in the drought plan since 2000. Some stakeholders criticize Georgia for not taking enough emergency conservation actions and not fully complying with the Drought Management Plan. The plan involves meetings to inform decision-makers when a region moves into the next drought level, with specific restrictions implemented at each level. During the current drought, levels 1, 2, and 3 were declared with corresponding restrictions on residential outdoor water use. In September 2007, Level 4 drought was declared for 61 north and western counties in Georgia, prohibiting most outdoor residential water use. Governor Perdue mandated a 10% cut in water withdrawals by permit holders in these counties. Data showed indicators for Level 4 had been met along the Chattahoochee River in July 2007. Critics argue Georgia's actions were insufficient, but supporters defend the Drought Management Plan. Georgia's actions during the Level 3 drought were defended by supporters, who argued that the plan was evolving and performing well. Upper basin stakeholders blamed the low storage levels on the IOP for allowing reservoir drawdown. In addition to the Drought Management Plan, Georgia's Environmental Protection Division drafted a comprehensive statewide water management plan in 2008. The Flint River Drought Protection Act was enacted in 2000 to address drought effects on flows in the Flint River and other creeks in the sub-basin. The Division conducts auctions to pay irrigators to temporarily cease irrigating during severe droughts in the Flint River basin. The program was implemented in 2001 and 2002, reducing irrigation by up to 130 mgd. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the auctions. The program was not activated in 2006 or 2007 due to lack of severe drought declaration. Apalachicola Bay oysters are vital to the economy of northwestern Florida's Franklin County, employing over 1,000 people and generating $10 million annually. The county harvests more than 90% of Florida's oysters and 10% of the nation's supply. Oysters contribute significantly to the value of commercial marine landings in the area. Apalachicola Bay is home to the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve and serves as a crucial nursery area for Gulf of Mexico commercial fish species. Recent debate on ACF water management during the drought has focused on protecting four species listed under the federal ESA: Gulf sturgeon, fat threeridge mussel, Chipola slabshell mussel, and purple bankclimber mussel. Water quality factors like flow, temperature, and dissolved oxygen are crucial for these species. The threatened Gulf sturgeon migrate upriver from the Gulf of Mexico to spawn, but are hindered by the Woodruff Dam. (See Figure 1) The endangered fat threeridge mussel, threatened purple bankclimber, and Chipola slabshell live in the sand and gravel bottoms of streams and rivers, facing habitat destruction from manmade structures and pollution sources. Concern for these species is highest among the three mussels due to the impact of flow rates on their biology. The Corps requested expedited consultation with FWS under the Endangered Species Act for their proposed EDO to reduce flows from the Jim Woodruff Dam. FWS responded, stating adverse impacts to listed species, especially mussels, are likely as flows drop below 5,000 cfs. The EDO aims to maintain a maximum fall rate until 4,150 cfs is achieved. The rationale for adopting the EDO's lower minimum flows was to reduce storage demand and ensure sustained flows for listed species during a severe drought in the ACF basin. FWS concluded in a BiOp that the EDO would have no appreciable effect on Gulf sturgeon survival and recovery, and limited its opinion to June 1, 2008. The FWS directed incremental reductions in flow levels for the EDO to protect listed species. The ITS included mandatory measures for the Corps to implement, such as reporting, monitoring, and conducting studies on the impact of lower flows on species. The ITS provided recommendations to the Corps to address conflicts with the ESA related to lower flows and mussel mortality. Bills were introduced in 2007 to address these issues. Recent bills, H.R. 3847 and S. 2165, aim to suspend the Endangered Species Act for federal and state agencies managing federal river basins during droughts threatening the region's well-being. Another bill, H.R. 2650, seeks to modify ACF authorizations to deauthorize navigation in a section of the Apalachicola River. The bill H.R. 135 aims to address navigation issues in the Apalachicola River through dredging and ecosystem restoration. It also proposes a study to create a comprehensive water strategy for the nation. The bill has been referred to the House Natural Resources Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for consideration. The Infrastructure Committee has not taken action on H.R. 135, a national bill related to federal reservoir management for water supply, including the ACF reservoirs. The bill proposes the creation of a commission to develop recommendations for water supply, conservation, and financing options, with a final report due within three years of its first meeting. H.R. 5887, introduced on March 11, 2008, requires the Corps to conduct a study on long-term water management in the southeastern US, focusing on the ACF, ACT, and Savannah River basins. The study aims to develop recommendations for addressing current and future water needs in the region within three years. The bill is in response to the tri-state disagreement over water allocation and managing various water uses in the area. The tri-state disagreement over water allocation in the southeastern US persists, drawing attention to the operation of ACF reservoirs. The federal government's response to the current drought may set precedents for long-term basin management. The federal government has a history of involvement in water resource development to address changing demands on infrastructure, including water supply quality and quantity issues. Congress makes decisions on planning, constructing, and financing water projects within the context of conflicting objectives and legal decisions. The federal government has a history of involvement in water resource development to address changing demands on infrastructure, including water supply quality and quantity issues. The management of rivers, such as the ACF, involves complex and conflicting objectives, legal decisions, and institutional mechanisms. Changes in how rivers are valued have led to a reexamination of the distribution of economic and other benefits in river management alternatives. This has sparked a debate over fundamental questions about water management. The debate over ACF management raises questions about water resources management, prioritizing river uses, evaluating alternatives, and managing extreme conditions. Federal actions on various rivers are controversial and frequently challenged. Despite 20 years of lawsuits, the basin states have been unsuccessful in resolving water allocation issues. The basin states have been unsuccessful in resolving water allocation issues through a compact, leading to several pending cases related to ACF waters in federal district courts. These cases include Alabama v. U.S. Corps of Engineers, Southeastern Federal Power Customers, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Georgia v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Georgia I and II cases), and Florida v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Several cases related to ACF waters have been filed in federal district courts, including Florida v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, City of Columbus v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and City of Apalachicola v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These cases were consolidated in March 2007 to avoid repetitive litigation over similar issues, with a focus on determining the authorized purposes of Lake Lanier. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled in February 2008 that congressional authorization was required to provide local water supply for municipalities near the reservoir, impacting the D.C. case. The Alabama case and the ACF Compact involved a lawsuit filed in 1990 by Alabama and Florida against the Corps over larger water withdrawals approved for Georgia, citing downstream user impacts and non-compliance with NEPA. The Corps exceeded its authority under the Water Supply Act of 1958 by reallocating storage in the ACF reservoirs, leading to a lawsuit. The authorized purposes of Lake Lanier are disputed among the parties, with Georgia claiming additional authorized uses. Settlement negotiations resulted in the ACF Compact, approved in 1992. The ACF Compact was approved by Congress in 1997 to allocate surface waters of the ACF Basin among states. Despite negotiations, no agreement was reached, and the Compact expired in 2003. Litigation has since resurfaced as states seek to secure their water rights. SeFPC, a non-profit consortium, challenged Corps contracts for increased water withdrawals from Lake Lanier, claiming it exceeded authority under the Water Supply Act of 1958. This led to diminished hydropower generation flow-through. The Alabama and D.C. cases, related to downstream water users, were intertwined. In 2003, a settlement was reached in the D.C. case involving Georgia and the Corps. In 2003, a settlement agreement was reached in the D.C. case involving Georgia and the Corps. Alabama and Florida challenged the agreement, leading to a preliminary injunction in the Alabama case. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals later vacated the injunction. In 2005, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Alabama district court's injunction order, stating that Alabama and Florida did not show an imminent threat of harm or a likelihood of winning the case. In February 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court reversed the district court's approval of a settlement agreement between Georgia and the Corps, which allocated water to Georgia for municipal use. The court ruled that the agreement required prior congressional approval under the Water Supply Act, as it constituted a major operational change. In 2000, Georgia requested increased water releases from Buford Dam until 2030 for municipal and industrial supply. Georgia sued the Corps in 2001 for more water supply, but the request was denied due to lack of legal authority without additional legislative approval. Florida and SeFPC tried to intervene in the case but were denied by the court. The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit overturned the district court's decision regarding Georgia's request for increased water releases from Buford Dam. The case was returned to the district court for further adjudication, which found similarities to a parallel case in Alabama and suspended proceedings in the Georgia I case. In 2006, Georgia sued the Corps over an interim operations plan for Woodruff Dam, claiming it constituted a change from the only. Georgia sued the Corps over the Interim Operations Plan (IOP), arguing it deviated from the approved water control plan from the 1950s. The state claimed the increased water releases for the Apalachicola River jeopardized its future water supply, especially during dry weather conditions. Florida also challenged the IOP through a lawsuit regarding its impact on protected species downstream. The BiOp concluded that the Corps' operations under the IOP were not likely to jeopardize the species or their habitat, despite Florida's claims of significant damage. Florida also alleged that Georgia's water usage purposes were not authorized. The City of Columbus sued the Corps in 2007, challenging the validity of the IOP and claiming the lack of reliable flow in the rivers. The City of Columbus filed a lawsuit claiming that the lack of reliable flow from the Chattahoochee River impaired its ability to provide services in compliance with regulatory requirements. The City of Apalachicola also sued the Corps in 2008, alleging inadequate NEPA review of the IOP affecting the Apalachicola Bay ecosystem. The City of Apalachicola claimed inadequate NEPA review for the original IOP, modified IOP, and EDO. They also alleged non-compliance with CZMA and violations of various acts. Cases were consolidated in federal court for efficiency. The Columbus case was included in the litigation, along with other cases related to the ACF dispute. The D.C. case was excluded from consolidation as it had already reached the appellate court. The U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed the ACF litigation yet. The D.C. Circuit's decision on the ACF dispute may impact future litigation involving Lake Lanier's authorized purposes and environmental reviews. The court ruled that reallocating water supply storage for municipal use would need congressional approval, potentially affecting other cases. The settlement agreement was deemed unenforceable, but the D.C. case litigation could continue separately. The settlement agreement was found unenforceable, allowing the D.C. case to proceed. Parties may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which could uphold or overturn the D.C. Circuit's decision. Other statutory challenges may be reviewed in the district court if remanded, potentially leading to consolidation with other cases. The consolidated cases in the 11th Circuit may interpret required congressional authorization differently than the D.C. Circuit. Collateral estoppel may bind other courts to the D.C. Circuit's decision, preventing re-litigation of resolved issues. The D.C. Circuit's decision on collateral estoppel binds other courts, preventing re-litigation of resolved issues if specific criteria are met. The Corps conducted an environmental assessment (EA) for the Exceptional Drought Operations (EDO) at Woodruff Dam under NEPA, finding no significant impact. Legal challenges to EAs can be based on timing, contents, and conclusions. Legal challenges to EAs are based on timing, contents, and conclusions. Timing refers to whether the document informed the agency decision, while challenges based on contents argue that the agency did not thoroughly consider environmental effects. The conclusion that no EIS was needed can also be challenged. NEPA requires agencies to comply to the fullest extent possible, but does not mandate specific outcomes. The courts have upheld the NEPA process when agencies have taken a hard look at environmental impacts and met Section 4332(2)(C) requirements. To comply with NEPA, agencies must ensure that the environmental review informs the decision-making process. NEPA regulations by the CEQ emphasize the timing of environmental reviews, requiring them to be conducted before the agency makes a decision. The review should start as soon as a proposal is presented to ensure it contributes effectively to the decision-making process and is not used to justify decisions already made. The environmental review process, whether for an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessments (EAs), should not be used to justify decisions already made. EAs are meant to determine if an EIS is necessary and should precede any agency decision on a course of action. Starting the environmental review early is beneficial, as it helps integrate the NEPA process with other planning efforts. Agencies are required to conduct environmental assessments to assist in their planning and decision-making process. Agencies must integrate the NEPA process early to ensure environmental values are reflected in planning and decisions, avoid delays, and prevent conflicts. Courts have emphasized that NEPA review should precede agency actions to prevent environmental considerations from being an afterthought. NEPA aims to incorporate environmental factors into decision-making at each stage of the process. The Ninth Circuit emphasized the importance of conducting a NEPA review before making agency decisions to consider environmental consequences. A reviewing court may find that an agency did not adequately assess environmental effects if the decision predates the environmental review. NEPA documents can influence the court's assessment of whether the agency thoroughly examined environmental impacts. The regulations outline the required contents of NEPA documents, which are meant to be concise while addressing the project's necessity. EAs are concise documents that consider the project's need, environmental impacts, alternatives, agencies consulted, and potential need for an EIS. The NEPA review and ESA's biological assessment can be synchronized for projects affecting listed species. Courts defer to agency determinations in EAs, but this deference can be reduced under certain circumstances. Courts may reduce judicial deference when agencies pre-judge environmental impacts. The environmental document must support conclusions for court approval. If an EA with no significant impact is inadequate, courts may remand the action for a new EA. In rare cases, courts may direct agencies to prepare an EIS. NEPA suits are brought under the APA, where courts review agency actions for arbitrariness or capriciousness. Courts review agency actions under the APA for arbitrariness or capriciousness. Parties must demonstrate standing to sue, showing they were adversely affected by the agency action. Economic injury alone is not sufficient for standing, but a recreational kayaker's reduced use of a river could qualify. Plaintiffs can be individuals or groups, as long as they can prove a distinct injury from the community at large. Hydropower at dams on the ACF provides power primarily during peak demand, with concerns about decreased river flows affecting turbine operations. Water levels are currently sufficient for generating peaking power. The Southeastern Power Administration markets power from Corps-operated dams to customers in the Southeast through five-year contracts. SEPA enters into five-year contracts with preference customers based on 1981 drought levels, obligated to meet requirements even with hydroelectric shortfall. Additional costs from purchasing power on the open market are passed on to customers. SEPA relies on other utilities for transmission lines. Nuclear Generation Plant Farley in Alabama is a 1,711 MW plant crucial for local power system stability. Plant Farley in Alabama requires a minimum water flow of 2,000 cfs to operate at full load under its current permit. Even at lower flows, the plant can still operate with one unit at full load with much less water than required for two unit operation. Plant Farley in Alabama can operate with one unit at full load with much less water than required for two unit operation. Both Farley units are necessary for reliable operation of the local power system during off-peak seasons. Alternative natural gas-fired generation could be used to compensate for reduced generation from Farley, but reliability risks would be greater during summer peaks and very cold winter periods. Coal-fired and gas-fired power plants are dependent on water for steam processing and cooling. Newer power plants use cooling towers to evaporate water instead of discharging it back into the water source. Thermal discharge from power plants can affect aquatic species survival, especially in low water years. Plant Scholz in Florida Panhandle is the only coal-fired plant potentially affected by low flow in the Apalachicola River. Plant Scholz in Florida Panhandle, a base load plant with a capacity of 92 MW, is crucial for maintaining local power system reliability during high-demand periods and low demand periods. It can operate with flows at 5,000 cfs and is expected to continue operating without modifications for three months with EDO flows. The plant does not anticipate any issues with thermal discharge at lower flows and plans to make intake system modifications to operate into the summer of 2008 if needed.

It can operate with flows at 5,000 cfs and is expected to continue operating without modifications for three months with EDO flows. The plant plans to make intake system modifications to operate into the summer of 2008 if needed, but shutting down could lead to reliability concerns and increased costs for power generation."
