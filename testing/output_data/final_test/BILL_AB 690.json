    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14132.100 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to cover federally qualified health center services and rural health clinic services on a per-visit basis. Effective October 1, 2004, federally qualified health center (FQHC) and rural health clinic (RHC) per-visit rates will be increased annually by the Medicare Economic Index. FQHCs and RHCs can apply for rate adjustments based on changes in services provided, evaluated according to Medicare reasonable cost principles. A change in scope of service for FQHCs and RHCs includes additions or deletions of services, changes due to regulatory requirements, relocation or remodeling, technology advancements, and increased service intensity for specific patient populations. Changes in services, provider mix, operating costs related to service modifications, indirect medical education adjustments, direct graduate medical education payments, and project scope changes approved by HRSA are considered scope-of-service changes. No cost change alone constitutes a scope-of-service change unless specific criteria are met. The cost increase or decrease is due to changes in the scope of services defined in previous sections and must comply with Medicare reasonable cost principles. Changes in services can include modifications in type, intensity, duration, or amount of services. The FQHC or RHC can request scope-of-service changes once per fiscal year if the net change in rate exceeds 1.75 percent. Approved rate changes are retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. An FQHC or RHC must request a scope-of-service rate change within 90 days of the start of the fiscal year if there was a decrease in services that would significantly lower the per-visit rate. If onsite pharmacy or dental services are discontinued, a rate change request must be submitted within 90 days of the following fiscal year. The rate change is effective if the per-visit rate decreases by more than 2.5 percent. If approved scope-of-service changes were implemented after the start of the fiscal year but before written instructions were issued, the adjusted reimbursement rate will be retroactive. Changes must be submitted within 150 days of written instructions or the end of the fiscal year. References to \"fiscal year\" apply to the individual FQHC or RHC. An FQHC or RHC may request supplemental payments for extraordinary circumstances beyond their control if PPS payments are insufficient. These payments are at the discretion of the department and not subject to other regulations. Extraordinary circumstances include acts of nature or changes in regulations. Inflation alone is not a valid reason for supplemental payment. If an FQHC or RHC's PPS rate covers all costs, including extraordinary circumstances, no supplemental payment is needed. The department accepts requests for supplemental payments throughout the prospective payment rate year. Requests must be in writing, accompanied by documentation demonstrating the need for the payment. Documentation should include data showing the reasons for the request and cost implications, which must be material and significant. Each affected year requires a separate request. Requests for supplemental payments must be submitted in writing for each affected year. The amounts granted will be paid as lump-sum amounts and must be repaid if not used for specified purposes. The department will notify the provider of its decision in writing. An FQHC or RHC \"visit\" is defined as a face-to-face encounter with a healthcare provider. The definition of a \"visit\" for an FQHC or RHC includes a face-to-face encounter with various healthcare professionals, such as physicians, podiatrists, dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, and comprehensive perinatal services practitioners. It also encompasses attendance at an adult day health care center and other providers specified in the state plan. A visit for an FQHC or RHC includes a face-to-face encounter with healthcare professionals like physicians, dentists, and others specified in the state plan. Additionally, a visit can involve a dental hygienist or a dental hygienist in alternative practice. An FQHC or RHC including the services of a dental hygienist in alternative practice can apply for a rate adjustment and bill these services separately. Multiple encounters with dental professionals on the same day count as one visit. The department will determine which rates need adjustment and provide forms for calculation. This adjustment does not change the scope of services provided by the FQHC or RHC. The FQHC or RHC can bill for all other visits at the existing rate until the rate adjustment for visits with a dental hygienist is approved. Any rate changes will be retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year, with a six-month window for adjustments to be made. An FQHC or RHC can add dental hygienist services as a change in scope of service. If services are partially reimbursed by third-party payers, the department will reimburse the difference between the per-visit PPS rate and receipts from other plans on a contract-by-contract basis. An entity qualifying as an FQHC or RHC after 2001, a newly licensed facility, or a relocated FQHC or RHC can choose between two methods to establish their reimbursement rate based on per-visit rates of comparable facilities in the same or adjacent areas. The department will establish a reimbursement rate for new FQHCs or RHCs based on projected allowable costs for the first 12 months, adjusted annually by the Medicare Economic Index. Additional methods may be adopted for rate setting, consistent with federal regulations. The department requires FQHCs or RHCs to submit their annual utilization report to establish caseload comparability. Reports should be in the format of the prior year, even if changes have occurred. Comparable FQHCs or RHCs do not need to submit reports, but must be identified. The rate for a newly qualified entity under this subdivision is effective retroactively to the date of qualification. FQHCs or RHCs can bill for Medi-Cal covered benefits on a fee-for-service basis until informed of their enrollment, and the department will reconcile payments with the prospective payment rate. Visits at intermittent clinic sites or mobile units of FQHCs or RHCs will be billed and reimbursed at the same rate as the establishing entity, with the option for a scope-of-service adjustment. FQHCs and RHCs may elect to have pharmacy or dental services reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, with costs adjusted out of the clinic base rate for scope-of-service changes. They can appeal grievances or complaints concerning ratesetting and scope-of-service changes as prescribed by Section 14171, with rights and remedies cumulative to other provisions of state law. The department must promptly seek federal approvals by March 30, 2008, to implement this section, including any necessary amendments to the state plan. If any element is not approved, waivers will be requested from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Implementation will only occur if federal financial participation is obtained."
