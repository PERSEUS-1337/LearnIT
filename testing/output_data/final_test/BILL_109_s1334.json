    "content": "The \"Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act\" will take effect one year after enactment and includes definitions for clarity. The \"Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act\" defines key terms such as Commission, off-season, professional athlete, professional sports event, and professional sports league. The \"Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act\" defines terms like professional sports season as the period for athletes to compete in leagues, and Protocol as the United. The \"Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act\" defines Protocol as the United States Anti-Doping Agency Protocol for Olympic Movement Testing and any successor to that protocol. Professional sports leagues must have a testing policy meeting specific requirements to organize events, as outlined in the \"Professional Sports Integrity and Accountability Act.\" Professional sports leagues are required to adopt and enforce policies to prohibit the use of banned substances and methods by athletes, conduct testing for prohibited substances, and prevent complicity in violations. The prohibited substances and methods during the sports season are outlined in the Protocol. During the off-season, all substances and methods prohibited out-of-competition by the Protocol are banned for professional athletes. Violations include the presence of prohibited substances in bodily specimens. Professional athletes can violate the testing policy by having prohibited substances or markers in their bodily specimen, refusing to submit to a test without justification, or by being absent from the United States. Any person associated with a professional sports league can violate the policy by administering prohibited substances to athletes or assisting in violations. Professional athletes must undergo testing for prohibited substances at least 3 times a year, randomly and without advance notice. Tests must be conducted by an independent entity not affiliated with any sports league. The independent entity determines methods, policies, and procedures for collecting, transporting, and analyzing bodily specimens of professional athletes for prohibited substances. Specimens are analyzed in a US Anti-Doping Agency approved laboratory. Athletes are tested for all prohibited substances and methods during each test. Professional sports leagues may grant exemptions to individual athletes for prohibited substances if they have a legitimate medical use, are for a documented medical condition, and are prescribed by a licensed US doctor. Violations of the rules result in penalties. Any person violating the rules of a professional sports league will face immediate suspension without pay for a minimum of 2 years for the first offense and permanent suspension for any subsequent violations. The league must publicly disclose the violator's name, penalty, and details of the violation within 10 days of notification. Adjudication proceedings must be publicly disclosed within 10 days of termination. A violator in a professional sports league is entitled to a prompt hearing, right to appeal, and representation. Violators are suspended without pay during proceedings. Each professional sports league must maintain documentation and records related to required policies and procedures, available to the Commission upon request. Privacy is protected for athlete health information disclosed to the Commission. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. The Commission enforces this Act like a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act regarding unfair or deceptive acts. Enhanced civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per day may be imposed on professional sports leagues for violations. The Commission can create regulations to enforce this Act and delegate administration to appropriate agencies. SEC. 7. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. The United States Anti-Doping Agency is not considered a government agent under this Act. Professional sports leagues can have stricter policies than those outlined in this Act. Congress recognizes the expertise of the United States Anti-Doping Agency in testing for performance-enhancing substances. It is recommended that professional sports leagues consult and follow the Agency's recommendations. Athletes' records achieved with performance-enhancing drugs should be invalidated. All professional sports organizations should adopt testing policies that meet the requirements of the Act."
