    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Southern Atlantic Energy Security Act\" and includes definitions for key terms. The \"Southern Atlantic Energy Security Act\" defines key terms such as Director, Institution of higher education, Qualified revenues, Secretary, and South Atlantic planning area. The \"Southern Atlantic Energy Security Act\" defines the Continental Shelf between Virginia and Georgia and the term \"State\" includes Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. SEC. 3. PRESERVING COASTAL VIEWSHEDS. Prior to conducting a lease sale within 30 nautical miles of the coastline, the Secretary must consult with the Governor of each affected State to establish lease stipulations for managing surface occupancy to address concerns about coastal viewsheds. Considerations include restricting surface production facilities within 12 nautical miles from the coastline and allowing only subsurface facilities beyond that point. The Secretary must consult with Governors to establish lease stipulations for managing surface occupancy within 30 nautical miles of the coastline. Permanent surface facilities within this zone must minimize impacts on coastal viewsheds. Onshore facilities within 12 nautical miles of the coastline are allowed for oil and gas resources in the South Atlantic planning area. The States are allowed to establish lease stipulations for managing surface occupancy near the coastline. Temporary surface activities related to oil and gas leases are not restricted by this. The Secretary will include the South Atlantic planning area in the leasing program for fiscal years 2017-2022, with 1 lease sale in 2021 and 2 lease sales in 2022. The Secretary and the Secretary of Defense will work jointly to implement lease sales under this Act to preserve national security and allow exploration of energy resources. The Secretary shall not make any tract available for lease if conflicts with military operations are determined by the President. The lease of a tract on the outer Continental Shelf under this Act must not conflict with military operations related to national security. No exploration, development, or production of oil or natural gas can occur if it conflicts with any military operation as determined by the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary must approve leases for exploration, development, or production on the outer Continental Shelf to ensure they do not conflict with military operations related to national security. SEC. 6. DISPOSITION OF REVENUES. For fiscal years 2017 through 2022, the Secretary will deposit 50% of qualified revenues in the general fund of the Treasury and 50% in a special account for disbursement to States. The Treasury Secretary will allocate these revenues to each State based on a formula inversely proportional to the distances between them. The allocation of funds to States is based on a formula that considers the distances between the coastline point closest to the leased tract and the geographical center of the tract. Each State receives a minimum of 10% of the available amounts, with the Governor having discretion on how to use the funds for land conservation and public transportation projects. The funds allocated to States are used for various projects, including establishing renewable energy production, enhancing beach nourishment, and geological education for the energy future of the United States. SEC. 7. ENHANCING GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL EDUCATION FOR AMERICA'S ENERGY FUTURE. The Secretary will partner with selected higher education institutions to study geological and geophysical sciences on the Atlantic region of the outer Continental Shelf. Research will focus on understanding hydrocarbon potential in the South Atlantic planning area and promoting these sciences at US universities. Governors may nominate institutions for participation in the partnership. Governors may nominate institutions for participation in a partnership with a preference for those with a strong admissions rate for veterans of the Armed Forces. The selected higher education institutions will study geological and geophysical sciences on the Atlantic region of the outer Continental Shelf. The Governor can nominate higher education institutions for excellence in geophysical sciences, engineering, or technical studies related to seismic research. Selected institutions can conduct research after notifying the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Permit is required for research activities. An institution of higher education conducting research under this section must obtain a permit for using explosives. The data produced from geological and geophysical activities must be considered scientific research, not used for commercial purposes, shared publicly, and submitted to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management within 60 days. The institution of higher education conducting research under this section must share collected data with the Director. The Director cannot charge fees for data provision, except for a data reprocessing fee. The Director must report data derived from partnerships to the Senate and House committees every 180 days. The Director must establish an Atlantic regional office by the end of the Outer Continental Shelf leasing program for fiscal years 2012 through 2017. The office will be located in an area with high potential for resource development within the outer Continental Shelf leasing program for fiscal years 2017 through 2022."
