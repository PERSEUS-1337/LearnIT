    "content": "The U.S. manufacturing sector's decline in employment has sparked congressional interest, leading to the introduction of numerous bills to support domestic manufacturing. Proponents argue that government policy can help mitigate the relative decline compared to other countries. Changes in the sector may be influenced by factors like technological advances, consumer preferences, and macroeconomic forces. This report aims to inform the manufacturing policy debate by examining these changes. This report provides a comparative analysis of the manufacturing sector in various countries, highlighting the United States' position. Data from different sources are used, but there are statistical limitations due to varying definitions of manufacturing. The report aims to inform the debate on manufacturing policy without discussing specific policy options. Some countries use different methods to gather compensation data, making international comparisons challenging due to tax and benefit variations. Statistical organizations may adjust raw data differently, affecting data compatibility. Manufacturing analysis is complex due to arbitrary distinctions between manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities, impacting value-added calculations. The size of a nation's manufacturing sector is measured by value added, which captures the economic contribution of manufacturers. This can be calculated as total sales minus the cost of inputs. Caution is advised in interpreting data due to variations in compensation gathering methods and arbitrary distinctions between manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities. The value added in manufacturing is calculated as total sales minus the cost of inputs, including raw materials and electricity. It is important to adjust for imported parts and components in domestic factories and exported goods used in other countries. China has surpassed the United States in manufacturing, according to U.N. estimates. China displaced the United States as the largest manufacturing nation in 2010, with a manufacturing value added exceeding $3 trillion in 2016. The U.S. share of global manufacturing value added has declined over time, from 29% in the early 1980s to 18.1% in 2015 and 2016. Japan's reported manufacturing value added fell 27% between 2012 and 2015, before rising 10% in 2016. The global shares of Japan and Germany have significantly declined since the 1990s due to the rapid increase in manufacturing activity in emerging economies, particularly China. China's share of global manufacturing output has stabilized around 25% to 26% since 2014. Manufacturing value added in the United States rose by 41% from 1997 to 2016. Globally, manufacturing contributes 17% of all economic value added, a figure that has remained relatively stable in recent years. Manufacturing value added in the United States accounted for 12% of the total GDP in 2016, which is more significant compared to the United Kingdom, France, and Canada, but less important than Japan, Indonesia, Germany, China, and South Korea. China's manufacturing share of economic output decreased from 32% in 2010 to 27% in 2016, while the U.S. remained stable. A high ratio of manufacturing value added to GDP may indicate barriers to reallocating capital and labor to other sectors. The United States has seen a growth in manufacturing value added from 2008 to 2016, outperforming many other wealthy countries. China, South Korea, Mexico, and Germany had faster growth in manufacturing value added during the same period. Exchange-rate changes did not play a role in these findings. U.S. manufacturers participate in international supply chains, with U.S.-made goods having less foreign content compared to other major manufacturing countries. Approximately 78% of the value of U.S. exports in 2014 was added in the United States, higher than China, Canada, South Korea, and Mexico. Domestic content varies by product, with an estimated 66% of the value of U.S. exports of motor vehicles added in the United States. In 2016, the United States had a high share of domestically added value in exports of computers and electrical equipment, outperforming other countries. The U.S. has shown strong growth in manufacturing value added compared to other high-income economies from 1990 to 2016. Foreign investment data indicate that the U.S. is an attractive manufacturing location among high-income countries. In 2016, 45% of foreign direct investment in the United States went into manufacturing, with $89 billion invested in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Data on foreign investment in U.S. manufacturing may be affected by \"inversions,\" where U.S. corporations become subsidiaries of foreign corporations for tax reasons. This could impact international comparisons of capital investment in manufacturing. International comparisons show that U.S. gross investment in fixed manufacturing capital is similar to West European economies but lower than South Korea. The low level of investment in the U.S. may indicate a focus on return on capital or the ability to outsource manufacturing abroad. The U.S. faces obstacles in outsourcing manufacturing work abroad due to policies promoting domestic production. Measuring manufacturing activity is challenging due to the blurred line between manufacturing and services. Statistical confusion can arise when design activities are counted as value added in manufacturing. Identifying manufacturing work has become more challenging in recent years due to the blurred line between manufacturing and services. The location of design creation can determine whether it is classified as a manufacturing or service-sector product. Total employment and value added remain the same regardless of the economic sector. As of May 2016, over 760,000 production workers were employed by employment services firms in the U.S. In the United States, manufacturing workers employed by employment services firms may be classified as service-sector workers. Workers in warehousing and storage facilities also engage in manufacturing activities, but their output may not be captured as value added in manufacturing. Determining where value is added to a service used in a manufactured product can be challenging due to international supply chains and the involvement of service providers. Efforts to measure the value of manufacturing-related services are still in their infancy. U.S. exports of manufactured products have a lesser proportion of services content compared to other advanced economies. Only 5% of U.S. service sector jobs depended on manufacturing exports in 2015. U.S. manufacturers made comparatively little use of imported services content in exports. The importance of services purchased by U.S. manufacturers from outside firms is illustrated in the data. U.S. manufacturers may be more vertically integrated and less reliant on purchased services. The efficient transportation system in the U.S. results in lower spending on transportation compared to other countries. Global value chains play a role in the dispersed production of goods like electrical equipment and automobiles. Global value chains show that activities close to producers or consumers tend to be in high-wage countries, while physical production tends to be in lower-wage countries. Services play a growing role in the value of manufactured goods. Data limitations hinder international comparisons of manufacturing employment trends. China, India, and Mexico have incomplete data on manufacturing employment. Manufacturing employment trends in advanced economies have shown long-term declines. The United States experienced a 4% decrease from 2008 to 2016, with other countries like Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom seeing larger declines. Over the quarter-century from 1990 to 2016, the US had lower decreases compared to some countries like the UK, France, Sweden, and Japan, and similar decreases to Germany, the Netherlands, and Canada. Mexico has had consistent nationwide data on manufacturing employment since 2005. The importance of manufacturing jobs has declined globally, not just in the United States. Germany saw a similar decrease in manufacturing work hours as the US from 1990-2016, while France, Japan, and the UK had larger declines. The timing varied among countries, with the US experiencing a steep drop in the 2000-2010 period. Since 2010, international manufacturing work hours have grown by 8%. Since 2010, manufacturing work hours in the United States have grown 8%, with only South Korea and the Czech Republic showing faster growth. The decline in demand for labor in manufacturing is due to improved labor productivity. From 2002 to 2016, U.S. manufacturing labor productivity increased more rapidly than in Canada, Western Europe, and Japan. However, since 2010, U.S. labor productivity in manufacturing has declined, indicating a slower investment in labor-saving technology compared to other countries. The International Federation of Robotics reported that Korea, Germany, Japan, and the United States have varying levels of industrial robot usage. The average compensation per employee in U.S. manufacturing was $39.01 per hour in 2016, higher than in Japan, South Korea, and southern Europe. Chinese manufacturing compensation data is limited, with an average wage of approximately $4.26 per hour in urban areas in 2016. The average hourly wage in India's manufacturing sector was $1.47 in 2014, but this figure may overstate labor costs as it excludes informal workers. Hourly compensation costs vary greatly among industries, with U.S. sawmill workers earning around $18.60 per hour and aircraft manufacturing workers earning over $40. Total U.S. labor costs are similar to major European economies. U.S. labor costs are comparable to major European economies and higher than those in emerging economies. High-technology manufacturing, such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, and aerospace, is considered technology-intensive with beneficial economic spillovers. Manufacturers in the United States spend significantly more on research than other countries, with China being the only exception. Chinese manufacturers' R&D spending has grown rapidly and surpassed that of the United States by 18% in 2015. R&D spending by manufacturers in high-income economies has increased since 2010, but Asian economies like China, South Korea, and Taiwan have seen even faster growth. Manufacturers account for 68% of all R&D conducted by businesses in the United States. In the United States, manufacturers account for 68% of all business-financed R&D, lower than in Germany, Japan, South Korea, and China. U.S. manufacturing research intensity increased before the recent recession but has not grown since 2008. U.S. manufacturers spend around 10.5-11.3% of sales on R&D, similar to other countries with substantial R&D in manufacturing. Countries with substantial R&D in manufacturing, like the U.S., spend more on R&D relative to value added. National differences in R&D intensity are influenced by the composition of the manufacturing sector, with industries like aircraft, spacecraft, and electronic instrument manufacturing being the most research-intensive. In the U.S., a large proportion of manufacturers' R&D is in high-technology sectors such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, and aircraft manufacturing. In medium-technology sectors like motor vehicle and machinery manufacturing, a significant portion of manufacturers' R&D expenditures are allocated."
