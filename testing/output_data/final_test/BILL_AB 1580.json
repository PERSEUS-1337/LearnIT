    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1785.11.9 of the Civil Code defines terms related to protected consumers, including individuals under 16 years of age, incapacitated persons, and those in foster care settings. A \"record\" is a compilation of information created by a consumer credit reporting agency for compliance with this section. A \"representative\" is a person authorized to act on behalf of a protected consumer, with specific definitions for those in foster care settings. A \"security freeze\" restricts access to a protected consumer's record if no file exists for them at a credit reporting agency. A security freeze restricts access to a protected consumer's record on their credit report, with specific requirements for documentation proving authority to act on behalf of the consumer. To place a security freeze on a protected consumer's credit report, sufficient proof of identification is required, such as a court order, valid power of attorney, notarized statement from a representative, or certification from a welfare or probation department. This includes providing a social security number or a copy of the social security card. To place a security freeze on a protected consumer's credit report, proof of identification is needed, such as a birth certificate, driver's license, government-issued ID, utility bill, or certification from a welfare or probation department. Certain exemptions apply to the use of the consumer's credit report by specific entities. Entities exempt from needing proof of identification to access a protected consumer's credit report include a person administering a credit file monitoring subscription service, a person providing a copy of the report at the consumer's request, state or local agencies, law enforcement agencies, trial courts, private collection agencies with legal authorization, child support agencies, and the State Department of Health Care Services investigating Medi-Cal fraud. The Franchise Tax Board or its agents can investigate or collect delinquent taxes, unpaid court orders, or fulfill statutory responsibilities. A consumer credit reporting agency must place a security freeze for a protected consumer if requested by their representative with proper identification proof. If a consumer credit reporting agency does not have a file for a protected consumer, they must create one upon receiving a request. The agency must also disclose the process for placing and removing a security freeze when requested by the protected consumer's representative. Within 30 days of a request meeting requirements, a consumer credit reporting agency must place a security freeze for the protected consumer and send written confirmation within 10 days. The agency cannot release the protected consumer's credit report or any derived information unless the security freeze is removed. The security freeze remains in effect until removed. To remove a security freeze, a protected consumer or their representative must request removal from the consumer credit reporting agency and provide proof of identification. To remove a security freeze, a protected consumer or their representative must provide sufficient proof of identification and pay a fee as authorized. The consumer credit reporting agency must remove the freeze within 30 days of receiving a valid request. The agency cannot charge a fee for most services but can charge up to $10 for each placement or removal of a security freeze for a protected consumer. A consumer credit reporting agency cannot charge a fee for placing or removing a security freeze in certain circumstances: when there is a report of identity theft, for a protected consumer under 16 years old, or for a protected consumer in foster care. A consumer credit reporting agency can remove a security freeze or delete a record for a protected consumer if based on a material misrepresentation. Procedures can be developed using various methods to place or remove a security freeze for a protected consumer."
