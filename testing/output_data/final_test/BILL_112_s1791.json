To qualify for the exemption, the issuer must disclose all investor rights, be a state-incorporated entity, and file a notice with the Commission. The Commission will establish disqualification provisions for individuals utilizing the crowdfunding exemption, similar to those in the Dodd-Frank Act. Securities issued under this exemption will be considered restricted securities with a one-year holding period.

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to exempt crowdfunding intermediaries from being classified as brokers. Crowdfunding intermediaries are defined as open to the public, providing communication portals for investors, and warning investors of risks. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 exempts crowdfunding intermediaries from being classified as brokers. These intermediaries warn investors about the speculative nature of investments in startups, emerging businesses, and small issuers, the 1-year restriction on securities sales, and take measures to reduce fraud risks. Employees are prohibited from investing in the offerings made through these intermediaries. The crowdfunding intermediary, exempt from broker classification, warns investors about investment risks, prohibits employees from investing, and provides necessary information to the Commission. The crowdfunding intermediary provides continuous investor-level access to its website and requires potential investors to demonstrate competency in recognizing investment risks. The crowdfunding intermediary must conduct a background check on the issuer's principals and meet other areas as determined by the Commission. Additionally, the issuer must state a target offering amount and withhold capital formation proceeds until at least 60 percent of the target offering amount is raised from investors other than the issuer. The issuer must provide basic notice of the offering to the Commission, including the issuer's name, legal status, address, website, principals' names, purpose of capital formation funds sought. The issuer must outsource cash-management functions, maintain appropriate books and records, and define a complaint resolution process for investors. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 exempts crowdfunding intermediaries from being classified as dealers, and provides protection to investors in case of unresolved disputes. SEC. 8. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are amended to update references to section 4."
