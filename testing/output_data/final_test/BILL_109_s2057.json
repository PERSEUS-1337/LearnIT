    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that $127 billion is needed for school repairs in the US, with 14 million students attending schools needing extensive repairs. In 2004, $29 billion was spent on education infrastructure, and there is a link between school conditions and student achievement. Researchers at Georgetown University found that students in schools in poor condition had test scores 10.9 percentage points lower than those in excellent condition. Moving students to new facilities led to a 20 percent improvement in test scores. The Government Accountability Office reported that 52 percent of schools lacked sufficient technology, affecting 21.3 million students. Many local educational agencies struggle to secure financing for school facilities. The challenges facing public schools and libraries in the United States require concerted efforts from all levels of government and communities. The country's competitive position in the global economy is at risk if schools and libraries are not equipped for the 21st century. The poor state of collections in school libraries has increased demands on public libraries, leading to a higher need for material and physical space. Research shows that 50 percent of a child's intellectual development occurs before age 4, making public and school libraries crucial for early childhood development by providing books and resources for a head start in life and learning. The State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program is established. The Secretary of Education may enter into cooperative agreements with States to establish State infrastructure banks for providing loans to local educational agencies for school construction, renovation, or reconstruction. Grants are awarded to States for initial capital to make these loans. The Secretary of Education can cooperate with States to create State infrastructure banks for loans to local educational agencies for school construction. Congress grants consent for States to establish a multistate infrastructure bank through an interstate compact. Congress reserves the right to alter or repeal this section. Each infrastructure bank established under this section must use repayments to make additional loans. States setting up an infrastructure bank must contribute at least 25% of the grant amount from non-Federal sources and appoint a capable entity to manage loan funds. The infrastructure bank must use repayments to make additional loans. States must contribute at least 25% of the grant amount from non-Federal sources and appoint a capable entity to manage loan funds. Funds can be used as reserves for debt issued by the State, with investment income generated by funds available for use in providing loans for eligible projects. Loans from the bank will bear interest. The infrastructure bank must ensure that loans bear interest at or below the lowest bond rate, repayment starts within 1 year of project completion, repayment term not exceeding 30 years, and submit annual reports to the Secretary. Loans can be made to local educational agencies or public libraries for project costs. A local educational agency or public library can apply for a loan from an infrastructure bank to cover the cost of a renovation project. The application must include a description of the deficiencies to be addressed with the loan funds and the priorities for correction. The application for a loan from an infrastructure bank must include a description of deficiencies to be addressed, priorities for correction, criteria for determining corrective action, improvements to be made with cost estimates, promotion of energy conservation, and any other required information. An infrastructure bank must make a final decision on loan applications within 90 days. Criteria for loans include assessing fiscal capacity and the need for project funding. The eligibility criteria for projects seeking loans from an infrastructure bank include the need for construction, reconstruction, or renovation of schools to address safety concerns, enrollment growth, and aging facilities. The eligibility criteria for projects seeking loans from an infrastructure bank include repair or upgrading of classrooms, increasing physical safety, enhancing access for individuals with disabilities, addressing environmental hazards, and providing basic infrastructure at educational facilities. The provision of basic infrastructure at educational facilities includes facilities for educational technology and bringing facilities into compliance with environmental and safety regulations. The Solid Waste Disposal Act and Davis-Bacon wage requirements apply to projects for energy efficiency, asbestos hazard detection, and public library construction or upgrades. Loans from an infrastructure bank should supplement, not replace, other funds for school or library construction. The infrastructure bank provides funds for school or library construction, with limitations on repayments and specific requirements set by the Secretary. Federal funds contributed to the bank do not imply any obligation. The infrastructure bank does not create obligations for the United States towards third parties. Income from interest is exempt from federal taxation. Federal fund management regulations do not apply to funds contributed. States can use up to 2% of grant funds for infrastructure bank administration. The infrastructure bank established by a State or States pays for administering costs. The Secretary reviews each bank's financial condition and reports to Congress within 90 days. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"elementary school\", \"free public education\", \"secondary school\", \"local educational agency\", and \"outlying area\". These definitions align with those in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"public library\" refers to a library that serves all residents of a community, district, or region free of charge and receives financial support from public funds. It includes a research library with extensive collections for scholarly research not available in public libraries. This definition is part of the Act that also defines terms like \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\". A public library serves the community through various activities like disseminating humanistic knowledge, providing services, fellowships, and cultural programs. It is not part of a higher education institution. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and outlying areas."
