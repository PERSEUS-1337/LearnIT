    "content": "H.Res. 5 added a new rule requiring Members to include a statement citing constitutional powers when introducing a bill. The rule also allows committee chairs to submit similar statements for Senate bills. The requirement for committee reports to cite specific constitutional powers was eliminated. Members introducing legislation must attach a signed form stating Congress's authority to enact the proposed bill. The House Clerk will not accept bills without this statement, which is not evaluated at the time of introduction. The constitutional authority statement attached to legislation is not evaluated at the time of introduction, and its presence does not indicate a decision by the House on the constitutionality of the bill. The House Clerk only checks for the presence of the statement, without making any judgment on its content. The new Rule does not provide a formal process for Members to object to a bill based on its constitutional authority statement. The question of constitutionality is typically addressed when the House votes on the bill. When a measure is called up on the House floor, a Member can raise the question of consideration if they believe it is unconstitutional. The House will then vote on whether to consider the measure. Most measures are called up under a motion to suspend the rules or a special rule, where the question of constitutionality is not raised. In those cases, the House is considered to have addressed the constitutionality when it passed the bill. The new requirement for Members to submit a constitutional authority statement aims to focus on the constitutionality of legislative proposals. House leadership may allow up to 20 minutes for debating the constitutionality of a measure under special rules if requested by 50 or more Members. H.Res. 5 added a new clause 11 to House Rule XXI, requiring unreported bills and joint resolutions to be available for at least three calendar days before being considered on the House floor. This rule excludes weekends and legal holidays, unless the House is in session on those days. When unreported measures are considered on the House floor, they are typically done under the suspension of the rules procedure or a special rule. Other methods require the bill to be reported from committee. The suspension of the rules procedure waives any Rule that would delay the consideration of the measure, needing two-thirds support to pass. Special rules require a majority support and waive any potential points of order. Changes in House practice in the 112th Congress have led to unreported measures being made available online for three days on the Rules Committee website, even before formal introduction. This practice does not fully comply with the new Rule, but it has increased the availability of draft bills for consideration on the House floor. The new House Rule allows for unreported measures to be posted online for access by Members, staff, and the public. This provides an additional means of accessing these documents before formal introduction. The new House Rule allows for documents to be made available online on a designated website by the House Administration Committee. The document must be formally filed, introduced, or submitted to meet the requirement. Previously, committee reports were only considered available after being prepared by the Government Printing Office. The new House Rule allows for documents to be made available online on a designated website by the House Administration Committee, anticipating faster access to measures for consideration on the House floor. The Speaker and majority party leadership indicated changes in House operations for the 112th Congress. In the 112th Congress, the House Rules regarding public availability of legislative proposals have changed. The Rules Committee now posts legislative text online for bills with amendments under consideration, allowing for easier access for members and staff. The House Rules in the 112th Congress have been updated to allow for easier access to legislative proposals online. H.Res. 5 also amended House Rule XVIII to reduce the minimum time for a vote on amendments in the Committee of the Whole from five minutes to two minutes. The chair of the Committee of the Whole can postpone recorded votes on amendments and resume proceedings at any time. The chair can now set the length of votes in the Committee of the Whole, with the first vote being at least 15 minutes long and subsequent votes not less than two minutes. This change allows for more flexibility in voting times compared to the previous minimum of 15 or 5 minutes. H.Res. 5 modified clause 5 of Rule XVII to prohibit the use of a mobile electronic device on the floor \"that impairs decorum.\" The change aims to keep the Rule current with technology advancements and prevent outdated device restrictions. The Speaker has the authority to determine what constitutes a \"personal computer\" to maintain order and decorum. The Speaker allowed Members to use electronic devices like BlackBerrys and tablets on the House floor, but prohibited talking on smartphones or using laptops. The policy for the 112th Congress also banned telephones and headsets, and required Members to turn off audible rings before entering the chamber. Personal computers were explicitly prohibited, but electronic tablet devices were allowed. H.Res. 5 eliminated the authority for Delegates and the Resident Commissioner to vote in and preside over the Committee of the Whole. The Committee of the Whole is used for debating and amending legislation more efficiently than in the full House. The Committee of the Whole in the House considers major legislation with amendments, reports to the House when done, and the House votes on passing the bill. Amendments recommended by the Committee are usually approved en gros without a separate vote. If Delegates' votes affect an amendment outcome, another vote is taken. In the past, the Committee of the Whole in the House automatically rose for a vote on an amendment in the full House where Delegates and Resident Commissioner could not vote. The constitutionality of their voting was upheld in federal court based on reconsideration procedures. The Committee rose four times in previous Congresses due to the impact of Delegates' and Resident Commissioner's votes on the outcome."
