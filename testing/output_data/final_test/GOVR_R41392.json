    "content": "President Obama proposed to extend most of the income tax cuts at the end of 2010, but to let the top two rates of 33% and 35% expire for high-income taxpayers. This would have raised $369 billion over FY2011-FY2020. However, P.L. 111-312 extended all tax cuts for two years, keeping the issue of extending tax cuts alive in the 112th Congress. The focus of this report is on the impact on small business owners and potential effects on employment. Some critics express concerns about the potential negative effects on small business owners' hiring and job creation if tax rates rise. The argument is supported by the belief that small businesses are major job creators. The issue may be short-term, addressed temporarily with an extension, but could re-emerge if high unemployment persists. The report focuses on the impact of changes in top tax rates on small businesses. The report examines the impact of changes in top tax rates on small businesses. It suggests that only a small fraction of small businesses, around 2% to 3%, will be affected by the rate changes. Additionally, 80% of the reduced taxes are likely to benefit non-business income, and about 90% will benefit non-business income or businesses without employees. Recent research challenges the perception that small businesses are the primary job creators, indicating that they contribute only slightly more jobs than other firms relative to their employment share, mainly through startups. The section discusses issues raised by researchers about job quality in small businesses, the impact of taxes on entrepreneurship, and the limited effectiveness of tax cuts for job creation. It also touches on the benefits and penalties for small businesses in the tax code. The text briefly summarizes the current benefits and penalties for small businesses in the tax code and justifications for preferential tax treatment. It questions how well retaining the top two current tax rates would target small businesses, focusing on the fraction of small businesses affected and the share of tax benefits falling on non-targeted activities. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the types of business income on individual tax returns. Pass-through entities, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and Subchapter S corporations, are taxed as if they were not incorporated. These businesses have owners' income subject to individual income tax. Sole proprietorships have one owner, partnerships have two or more owners, and some partnerships have attributes of corporations like limited liability. Subchapter S corporations are incorporated but treated as unincorporated businesses for tax purposes. In 2007, there were 32.1 million businesses, with most being sole proprietorships. Pass-through entities like sole proprietorships, partnerships, and Subchapter S corporations are treated as unincorporated businesses for tax purposes. In 2007, there were 32.1 million businesses, including 23.1 million sole proprietors. Flow-through businesses are used as a proxy for small businesses in tax analysis. Some high-income taxpayers may not be affected by rate changes due to the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) will affect high-income taxpayers at the 36% or 39.6% rates, who receive passive income. Businesses with losses may not have income subject to tax. Most small businesses, around 80%, do not have employees. Small business owners, especially those in higher income brackets, are more likely to be affected by tax rate changes. Business returns are more concentrated in higher income classes, particularly for partnership and Subchapter S firms. The $200,000 and above adjusted gross income class includes some high-income taxpayers potentially subject to top tax rates. Small business owners in higher income brackets are more likely to be affected by tax rate changes. The $200,000 and above adjusted gross income class includes some taxpayers who would not be affected by the President's proposals, indicating less than 9.6% of small businesses would be affected. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 3% of taxpayers with net positive small business income would be subject to the top two marginal tax rates under the President's proposal. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that about 50% of business income, totaling approximately $1 trillion, would be subject to the top two marginal tax rates under the President's proposal. This study focused on high-income taxpayers with business income and did not adjust for the alternative minimum tax. The study focused on high-income taxpayers with business income, including ordinary income and capital gains from various sources. It highlighted the impact of passive versus active income and the share of returns with significant income relative to wages. The analysis in Table 2 showed that a significant portion of returns and income are passive, which overstates the share subject to the top tax rates. A significant portion of income for high-income taxpayers comes from passive sources, which slightly reduces the share subject to top tax rates. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center's findings align with the Joint Committee on Taxation, showing that most returns and income fall into the top bracket. The Tax Policy Center reports that high-income business taxpayers, including sole proprietors, partnerships, and Subchapter S firms, are responsible for larger shares of income subject to top tax rates. Among taxpayers in the top brackets, 22% are sole proprietors, 38% are partners, and 40% are shareholders of Subchapter S corporations. Sole proprietorship returns make up about 74% of all returns with business income. Table 4 adjusts the data from Table 1 to examine the share of businesses subject to top tax rates, focusing on taxable returns. Adjusting for the AMT is crucial in determining the fraction of businesses affected, with estimates varying between 3% and 9%. Sole proprietorship returns account for 74% of all returns with business income, while partnerships and Subchapter S make up the rest. The analysis includes taxpayers with positive income and distinguishes between those with gains and losses. Adjustments were made to examine the share of businesses subject to top tax rates, focusing on taxable returns. The numerator was confined to taxable returns, adjustments were made for including only returns with positive income and for the AMT. Including only returns with positive income in the numerator lowered the share measurably, and in combination with the AMT, reduced the share from 3.5% to 2.6%. Corporate returns were added to the denominator to account for the universe of small businesses. According to Census data, there are approximately 1.3 million corporations, with the remaining 0.6 million likely non-employer businesses. Many sources use firms with less than 500 employees as a standard for a small business. Adjusting the figures would reduce the percentages, with small corporations totaling 1.6 million if firms with nine or fewer employees were considered small. Additionally, small businesses not filing tax returns were also mentioned. The analysis shows that only a small fraction of small businesses, ranging from 2.6% to 3.5%, are affected by the top tax rates. The Tax Policy Center estimates that 33% of the tax cut benefits business income, but this may be overstated as some of this income is passive rather than from active business operations. Based on Table 2, the estimate of passive income would be reduced from 36% to 21%. A significant number of businesses have no employees, making it unlikely that a tax cut would lead to hiring. The fraction of the benefit going to small businesses with workers would be less than 5%. There is limited information on the characteristics of high income returns relative to the general population. The popular belief that small businesses create most new jobs is based on a study by Birch in 1981, which found that firms with less than 100 employees created 8 out of 10 jobs. However, recent data suggests a reduction to around 12% of job creation by small businesses. The methodology used in the Birch study has been questioned, with some studies showing that small businesses with less than 500 employees, accounting for half of workers, created 90% of net job creation from 1993 to 2006. The Birch study in 1981 found that firms with less than 100 employees created 8 out of 10 jobs, but recent data suggests a reduction to around 12% of job creation by small businesses. Armington and Odle addressed the establishment versus firm issue, suggesting that Birch may have counted outlets of larger firms as small businesses. Brown, Hamilton, and Medoff found that Birch numbers overstated job creation, with small firms accounting for 56% of new jobs according to a study by the Small Business Administration. Small firms with less than 100 employees accounted for about half of jobs created from 1976 to 1986, exceeding their share in the labor force. Firms with less than 500 employees created about 60% of net new jobs during the same period. Despite small businesses creating jobs beyond their labor force share, growth was partly due to industries dominated by small firms experiencing growth. Small firms with less than 100 employees created a significant number of jobs from 1976 to 1986, with growth attributed to industries where small firms operated. Most jobs were generated by new firms, which are typically small, but many of these firms are expected to fail within the first few years. Economists are also concerned about \"regression to the mean\" when classifying firms by size for employment changes. Milton Friedman criticized researchers in 1992 for not recognizing the problem of firms being classified by size based on employment changes due to shocks, leading to misleading results in small business job creation research. This criticism prompted further research by Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh using longitudinal data on manufacturing firms. Following the criticism by Milton Friedman in 1992, Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh conducted research using longitudinal data on manufacturing firms. They found that all firm sizes were declining, with the smallest declines in the largest firms. Contrary to Birch's method, which showed positive growth rates in smaller firms and negative growth in larger firms, their research highlighted the importance of regression-to-the-mean quantitatively and reversed previous findings. Neumark, Wall, and Zhang later examined this issue with a different dataset covering all industries in California from 1992-2004, finding regression-to-the-mean correction to be significant but not altering the direction of changes. After correcting for regression-to-the-mean, Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda found differences in job growth rates across firm sizes, with smaller firms growing slightly faster. Job growth rates do not continually decline as firm size increases. Job growth rates vary across firm sizes, with smaller businesses experiencing higher growth rates. The relationship disappears with controls for age, indicating that new firms, rather than mature small firms, are growing faster. Firms with less than 500 employees account for 65% of employment growth, a contrast from the 90% figure cited without controlling for effects. The share of new jobs attributed to small businesses depends on how small business is defined. Recent research on small businesses and job growth shows that the definition of small businesses greatly impacts their contribution to new jobs. Different definitions, such as less than 100 employees or less than 500 employees, result in varying statistics. For example, businesses with less than 20 employees were responsible for 22% of net new jobs. Overall, the data does not strongly support the idea that small businesses create a significantly larger share of new jobs compared to their employment numbers. The quality of jobs in small businesses is questioned due to lower wages, fewer benefits, and less job security compared to larger firms. Research shows high turnover rates in small firms, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Despite these drawbacks, small businesses cater to individuals with lower educational qualifications and minorities who may struggle to find better job opportunities elsewhere. The federal income tax code provides deductions for labor pay, benefits, and capital expenses for small businesses, reducing their overall tax burden and compliance costs. Section 179 expensing allowances allow immediate deduction of qualified depreciable assets, aiding in business expansion. The federal government supports small businesses by reducing tax burden, compliance costs, and providing ways to attract capital. Tax incentives totaling over $15 billion annually are aimed at small businesses. Despite tax rate levels, hiring decisions are based on the potential contribution of new workers. Increases in after-tax income do not necessarily lead to increased hiring, as demand for products or services drives production. Job growth is more likely to come from new firms, making evidence on self-employment choices crucial. The empirical literature on the effects of taxes on self-employment is mixed, with higher tax rates more likely to encourage self-employment. Schuetze and Bruce reviewed 21 studies on this issue, finding that 11 studies showed higher tax rates increased self-employment, 2 showed a decrease, and 7 found no significant relationship. One study focused on tax progressivity and found it discouraged self-employment. The literature on the effects of taxes on self-employment is mixed. Studies show that higher tax rates can encourage self-employment, while others find no significant relationship. Panel studies are recommended to address limitations in cross-sectional studies. Additional research on state tax rates also shows mixed results, with some studies finding no effect and others finding a positive effect for higher taxes. Bruce and Deskins found no effect of state income tax rates on state entrepreneurship rates, but higher rates slightly reduce the state's share of entrepreneurs. Bruce and Mohsin found negative but small effects on entrepreneurship rates. Gurley-Calvez and Bruce discovered that cuts in the wage tax would increase exits from self-employment, while cuts in self-employment rates would decrease exits. Overall, these studies did not find significant positive effects of taxes on self-employment. The research suggests that higher tax rates may not decrease self-employment and could actually increase it. Two reasons for this are that self-employment offers opportunities to avoid taxes, and higher tax rates reduce earnings variance. There is limited research on the effects of tax changes on investments. The study by Carroll, Holtz-Eakin, Rider, and Rosen analyzed the effects of tax changes on small firms' hiring decisions after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. They found that retaining top tax rates would increase workers hired by 0.6% and either workers or wages of existing firms by 0.9% within four years. The study analyzed the effects of tax changes on small firms' hiring decisions after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Results show a potential increase in workers hired by 0.6% and workers or wages of existing firms by 0.9% within four years. However, there are limitations to the study, and the estimates may be overstated. The study did not find a direct effect on the incentive to hire workers from changes in the owner's tax rate. Further analysis is needed to determine the true impact of tax changes on small business hiring. The empirical evidence from a study on the effects of tax changes on small firms' hiring decisions suggests that tax rates have small, uncertain, and possibly unexpected effects on small business formation. It is premature to conclude that raising taxes on owners would decrease hiring in existing firms. The central question is whether lowering taxes for small businesses is justified for job creation objectives. Economic theory suggests that general job creation is not affected in the long run by tax cuts for small businesses. Economic theory suggests that general job creation is not a long-term objective of government policies. Employment tends to grow steadily, while the unemployment rate fluctuates. Long-term job policies should focus on reducing structural or frictional unemployment, not increasing jobs which can lead to inflation at full employment. Federal policies may be needed to smooth out short-term business cycles, with the aggregate stance of fiscal policy evaluated for job creation. The short-term policy issue is choosing the most effective stimulus type for the economy, with research suggesting direct spending, tax cuts, or transfers to lower-income individuals are most effective. Tax cuts aim to increase demand in an underemployed economy, but effectiveness depends on the money being spent. High-income taxpayers and businesses are less likely to spend, making tax cuts for them relatively ineffective. This effectiveness does not depend on where jobs were lost or evidence from past recessions. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of past recessions on small businesses and the need for targeted provisions to stimulate the economy effectively. It highlights the importance of designing provisions that will increase spending in sectors that have contracted the most, rather than across-the-board tax cuts for high-income individuals. Small businesses, especially high-income ones, currently receive tax advantages compared to large corporations. They benefit from pass-through operations, graduated corporate rates, and immediate deduction of equipment investment costs. However, they may face burdens such as payroll taxes on all business income. The imposition of payroll taxes on all business income affects lower- and middle-income small businesses more significantly due to the capped tax base. Tax compliance costs are a smaller share of income for large firms compared to small ones. Small businesses are favored over large ones, with justifications including their contribution to economic innovation. Small businesses are seen as important contributors to economic innovation and technological advance, undertaking greater risks and facing challenges in raising capital. Economists question the justification for general tax benefits favoring small businesses, suggesting that if such treatment is not justified, it could distort the allocation of resources. Suggestions include targeting specific issues like research and development subsidies for innovation or expanding small business loan guarantees for capital market failures. Encouraging risk could be addressed through provisions aimed at that goal. The report examines the justification for retaining lower tax rates for the top two tax brackets to support job creation by small businesses. However, lowering the top tax rates primarily benefits a small percentage of businesses, with most of the tax cut's benefits not going to businesses. Evidence suggests that small business policies should address market failures rather than focusing solely on tax cuts. The formulation of small business policies should consider market failures. The appendix discusses reducing the share of tax cuts going to businesses. High-income taxpayers may have different business ownership characteristics. Business composition varies for high-tax rate recipients of business income. The distribution of business composition by organizational form differs for high-tax rate recipients of business income compared to the general population. Tables A-1 to A-4 provide industry distribution and number of partners and shareholders for non-employer firms, sole proprietorships, partnerships, and subchapter S firms. Proprietorships have a similar industry distribution to non-employer firms, while partnerships show significant differences, especially in finance and real estate. High-income recipients of pass-through income have a distribution closer to non-employer firms than partnerships, with a larger share in finance and real estate. 36% of these recipients receive passive income, mostly likely from partnerships in finance, insurance, and real estate. Limited partnerships and limited liability companies, which provide passive income, account for 85% of partners. Limited partnerships and limited liability companies, which provide passive income, account for 85% of partners. High-income pass-through owners are allocated 23% to proprietorships, 38% to partners, and 39% to Subchapter S shareholders. Adjusting for single-owner firms, the distribution of active business owners across the three types is 36%, 9%, and 55%. Taxing 56% of the difference between 21% and 5%, is 9%, suggesting that the 21% share accruing to active businesses should be reduced to 12% to account for non-employer owners."
