    "content": "The Act titled \"Heroin and Opioid Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 2016\" introduces an excise tax on opioids under section 4192 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An excise tax is imposed on manufacturers, producers, or importers of taxable active opioids at a rate of 1 cent per milligram. Taxable active opioids include controlled substances like opium, opiates, or their derivatives, excluding narcotic drugs for maintenance treatment. The excise tax excludes narcotic drugs for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment if a separate registration is required under the Controlled Substances Act. Clerical amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code regarding medical products. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section for prevention and treatment of opioid abuse. The effective date for these amendments is for calendar years after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will provide grants to States for research on opioids and grants for opioid abuse prevention and treatment, including establishing addiction treatment facilities, sober living facilities, recruiting mental health providers, expanding access to residential treatment programs, and support programs. The Secretary will provide grants to States for various opioid abuse prevention and treatment programs, including employment services, housing, care for babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome, controlled opioid take-back programs, and other programs as determined appropriate. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer taxes collected under section 4192 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for opioid abuse prevention and treatment programs. The amounts transferred are designated as an emergency requirement."
