    "content": "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care services to eligible veterans, including primary care, specialized care, and social support services. The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) was established in 1973 to provide health care services to dependents and survivors of certain veterans. Total disability individuals are deserving of substantial compensation and assistance, as recognized in title 38 programs. CHAMPVA is a health insurance program for eligible dependents and survivors of veterans rated permanently and totally disabled. Beneficiaries pay 25% of medical care costs up to $3,000 annually, with CHAMPVA covering the remaining 75%. CHAMPVA, a health insurance program for eligible dependents and survivors of veterans, covers 75% of medical care costs. Enrollment has grown significantly, with expansions in eligibility contributing to the increase. The CHAMPVA program has seen an increase in sponsorship for aging Vietnam-era veterans with service-connected disabilities. Legislative changes have expanded eligibility to include non-veterans like primary family caregivers of seriously injured veterans. The number of unique CHAMPVA users has grown by 485% from FY2001 to FY2017. The CHAMPVA program has seen a significant increase in unique users from 61,900 in FY2001 to 361,900 in FY2017. Funding for CHAMPVA comes from the VHA's Medical Services account, with spending increasing by 945% between FY2001 and FY2017. The average cost per patient has also risen from $2,349 to $4,200 during this period. Reasons for the increase in expenditures include a demographic shift towards more expensive aging beneficiaries and the extension of benefits to those over 65. The CHAMPVA program provides answers to frequently asked questions about eligibility, benefits, payments, and other programs. Eligibility requires being a spouse or child of a veteran with a service-connected disability, a surviving spouse or child of a veteran who died from a service-connected disability, or a primary family caregiver of a seriously injured individual. CHAMPVA eligibility is based on being a spouse or child of a veteran with a service-connected disability, a surviving spouse or child of a veteran who died from a service-connected disability, or a primary family caregiver of a seriously injured individual. Specific rules apply to widows, with eligibility terminated upon remarriage before age 55. Widows who remarry at age 55 or older remain eligible. Child eligibility is terminated if not enrolled as a full-time student at age 18. If a child is enrolled in an accredited school as a full-time student, they lose eligibility at age 18 or at age 23 if they are still a full-time student. The child also loses eligibility if they marry, no longer live in the sponsor's household as a stepchild, or incur a disabling injury or illness between the ages of 18 and 23 while being a full-time student. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires group health plans to provide dependent coverage for children. The ACA requires group health plans to offer dependent coverage for children up to age 26. However, this requirement does not apply to the CHAMPVA program, which covers most necessary health care services. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to extend coverage for children under CHAMPVA until age 26, but none have been enacted into law yet. In late 2008, CHAMPVA benefits were expanded to include non-dental prostheses and remove the exclusion of enuretic devices. Certain care requires preauthorization. Providers can accept assignment, billing the VA directly for covered services. If not accepted, the provider cannot collect more than the CHAMPVA deductible and copay amounts from the beneficiary. The CHAMPVA program covers certain medical expenses for beneficiaries. If providers accept assignment, they bill the VA directly. Otherwise, beneficiaries are responsible for deductible, cost share, and any excess charges. Some services require preauthorization, and certain treatments like dental care, cosmetic procedures, and abortion are not covered. CHAMPVA covers certain abortion procedures such as spontaneous, missed, or threatened abortions, ectopic pregnancies, fetal death due to natural causes, D&E, and D&C surgeries for gynecological diagnoses. It is a cost-sharing program with a $50 per person and $100 per family outpatient deductible per year. After the deductible, CHAMPVA pays 75% of the allowable amount, and the beneficiary pays 25%. CHAMPVA is generally the secondary payer for beneficiaries with other health insurance, paying 75% of the allowable amount after deductible or the rest of the billed charges. There is a $3,000 cap on cost sharing per family. Exceptions exist for medical services rendered through VA facilities participating in the CHAMPVA In-house Treatment Initiative. CHAMPVA is generally the secondary payer for beneficiaries with other health insurance, paying 75% of the allowable amount after deductible or the rest of the billed charges. Exceptions exist for beneficiaries with Medicaid, State Victims of Crime Compensation Program, Indian Health Service care, or CHAMPVA supplementary insurance. All claims are processed through the Chief Business Office Purchased Care in Denver, CO, and must be filed within one year of service. Inpatient care claims must be filed within one year of discharge, with payments made to the hospital. Claims submitted after the deadline will be denied, but appeals must be made within one year from the initial determination date. TRICARE and CHAMPVA are healthcare programs for military families. TRICARE has no disability criteria for eligibility, while CHAMPVA is for family members of disabled veterans. The sponsoring veteran does not receive services through CHAMPVA. The reimbursement ceiling for durable medical equipment under TRICARE was raised to $2,000 in 2009. CHAMPVA is the secondary payer for beneficiaries with Medicare coverage. CHAMPVA benefits were expanded to those over the age of 65 under the Veterans' Survivors Benefits Improvement Act of 2001. Beneficiaries must be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B to be eligible for CHAMPVA. To be eligible for CHAMPVA, individuals must be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. Medicare Part D enrollment is not required. Those aged 65 or older without Medicare Part A can still qualify for CHAMPVA. The CITI program offers medical care at VA facilities on a space-available basis for CHAMPVA beneficiaries, with no deductible or cost sharing. Participation in the CITI program does not require extra enrollment; beneficiaries need to check if their local VA is a participating facility. Most VA facilities participate in CITI, but care availability is based on space. Beneficiaries with Medicare or HMO primary insurance are not eligible for CITI. Under the ACA, individuals must have minimum essential coverage to avoid a penalty. CHAMPVA enrollees are exempt from the penalty as they have minimum essential coverage. The penalty was in effect until 2018, but starting in 2019, noncompliance no longer incurs a penalty. CHAMPVA enrollees cannot receive premium credits or subsidies if they purchase additional health insurance from the marketplace. CHAMPVA enrollees are exempt from ACA penalty and cannot receive premium credits or subsidies if they purchase private health insurance."
