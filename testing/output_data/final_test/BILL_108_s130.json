    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truth in Tuna Labeling Act of 2003\". Congress finds that consumers have the right to know if the tuna they buy was caught using methods that harm dolphins, porpoises, and whales. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act's \"dolphin safe\" labeling has helped reduce dolphin mortalities significantly since 1990. However, in 1997, Congress started to weaken the \"dolphin safe\" label by allowing exceptions for destructive fishing practices. The Secretary of Commerce's decision to allow tuna caught using destructive fishing practices to be labeled as \"dolphin safe\" will mislead the public and lead to an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 dolphin deaths annually. Amendments to the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act are being proposed. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act is amended to prohibit the use of the term 'Dolphin Safe' on tuna products harvested in ways harmful to dolphins. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act is amended to require a written statement certifying that no harm was done to dolphins during the catching of tuna in fisheries where dolphins and tuna have a significant association. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act now requires a written statement certifying no harm to dolphins during tuna catching in specific fisheries, with penalties for non-compliance. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act mandates certification that no dolphins were harmed during tuna catching in certain fisheries, with penalties for non-compliance. Tuna products from the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean using purse seine nets can be labeled as 'Dolphin Safe' if specific requirements are met. The Secretary has determined that tuna products can be labeled as 'Dolphin Safe' if accompanied by a written statement certifying no harm to dolphins during harvesting, with penalties for non-compliance. The Secretary has established criteria for labeling tuna products as 'Dolphin Safe', requiring a written statement certifying no harm to dolphins during harvesting, with oversight by authorized representatives. The Secretary has set criteria for labeling tuna products as 'Dolphin Safe', requiring written endorsement from authorized observers and all involved parties. The amendments made by section 3 will be effective on December 30, 2002."
