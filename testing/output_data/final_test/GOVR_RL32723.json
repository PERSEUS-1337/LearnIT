    "content": "On September 15, 2008, Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing agreement to resolve a political standoff in Zimbabwe. The Global Political Agreement (GPA) established a transitional government with Tsvangirai as prime minister. Despite challenges in implementing reforms, the coalition government has struggled with development priorities and donor funding. The establishment of the government of the Republic of Zimbabwe in 1979 followed years of economic sanctions and civil war. One of the major challenges faced by the new government was the demand for greater equity in land distribution due to the white minority owning the majority of arable land. In the 1990s, dissatisfaction with the slow pace of land reform in Zimbabwe led to violent farm invasions. The government then implemented aggressive land expropriation policies, causing donors to withdraw financial support. In 2000, a referendum approved changes to the constitution allowing land seizures without compensation. The referendum in 2000 to approve changes to the constitution allowing land seizures without compensation was rejected by 55% of voters, seen as a victory for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Following the vote, war veterans and ruling party supporters occupied white-owned farms, leading to violence and human rights violations. International condemnation followed the 2008 elections due to government-orchestrated abuses. Zimbabwe faced political difficulties and a sharp decline in living standards, with over 80% of the population living on less than $1 per day by 2009. The country's status as a potential \"breadbasket of Africa\" was tarnished as many became reliant on food aid. HIV/AIDS infection rates were high, and life expectancy dropped from 56 years in 1990 to 44 in 2008. Foreign Policy magazine ranked Zimbabwe as the second failed state in 2009, improving to fourth in 2010 and sixth in 2011. Concerns were raised about the impact on neighboring countries and the deterrence of investors. Zimbabwe has been ruled by the ZANU-PF party, facing scrutiny for corruption, political violence, and restrictions on freedoms. Elections have been criticized as not free and fair, with the main opposition party splitting in 2005. The party blames propaganda from Western countries for calls for regime change. The MDC opposition party split in 2005, with Tsvangirai's faction dominant. Internal competition within ZANU-PF has also increased, raising concerns about Mugabe's succession. Analysts fear a violent struggle or military coup upon Mugabe's death. The president has not designated a successor from his vice presidents, leading to power struggles within the party. Mugabe, turning 90 in 2014, shows no signs of stepping down. Mugabe's reluctance to relinquish power has caused internal party divisions within ZANU-PF. Before the 2004 party conference, Emmerson Mnangagwa campaigned for the position of second vice president but was surprised when Mugabe chose Joice Mujuru instead. Mujuru, a veteran of the liberation war, was elected as Zimbabwe's second vice president. According to reports, neither the Mnangagwa nor Mujuru camps initially supported Mugabe's proposal in 2007 to extend his term to 2010. Retired General Solomon \"Rex\" Mujuru, Joice's husband, was vocal in his disapproval and rumored to have blocked the proposal at the national conference. Some suggested Mujuru covertly backed Simba Makoni as a potential successor to Mugabe. Makoni, considered a compromise candidate, was untainted by corruption scandals. Mnangagwa reconciled with Mugabe, leading the party's 2008 election efforts and guiding the country's security forces. He currently leads the Ministry of Defense in the transitional government. The outcome of succession struggle within ZANU-PF may be influenced by ethnic and clan divisions in Zimbabwe. Mugabe and key party officials are from the Zezuru clan of the Shona people. Solomon Mujuru, a close advisor to Mugabe, was from the same clan and his suspicious death in 2011 raised questions. Emmerson Mnangagwa, representing the Karanga clan, is seen as a presidential contender but faces accusations of leading a purge in the 1980s resulting in civilian deaths. These events help explain tensions in Zimbabwe's political landscape. In the 1980s, events in Zimbabwe led to Bulawayo being a center of opposition to the government. Vice President Joseph Msika died in 2009, and Mnangagwa tried to replace Joice Mujuru as vice president but failed. Mujuru was re-elected as vice president in 2009, and John Nkomo replaced Msika. The MDC party emerged from the Zimbabwe labor movement amidst deepening poverty and corruption allegations against regime leaders. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) organized strikes and protests, leading to the formation of the MDC in 1999. MDC's success in the 2000 referendum and parliamentary election resulted in repressive actions against the party. MDC leaders, including Morgan Tsvangirai, were arrested and charged with treason. By 2004, the MDC became divided in challenging ZANU-PF dominance. The MDC initially decided not to participate in the 2005 parliamentary race unless free and fair elections were assured. Tsvangirai supported a boycott, but the party ultimately participated \"under protest.\" As the 2005 Senate elections approached, the MDC was divided on whether to participate, with Tsvangirai arguing against it. In October, the MDC's national council voted to participate in the election, but Tsvangirai overruled the vote and expelled 26 senior officials. The Ncube faction fielded candidates in the Senate race and gained only seven seats. Tsvangirai was confirmed as the leader of one faction, while Ncube ceded control to Arthur Mutambara. The factions attacked each other in the press, with allegations of violence. In February 2007, the Zimbabwe government imposed a three-month ban on political rallies and public demonstrations in Harare due to the volatile situation in the country. Despite a High Court decision allowing Morgan Tsvangirai to launch his presidential campaign at a rally in Harare, police used force to break up the event. The ban led to the dispersal of opposition rallies and the arrest of numerous supporters. Police also arrested hundreds of civic activists, and later broke up a prayer meeting attended by Tsvangirai and Mutambara, resulting in the arrest of around 50 opposition members. In March 2007, the Zimbabwean government cracked down on the opposition, arresting around 50 members, including MDC leaders. Police shot and killed an opposition supporter during a protest, and reports indicated that Tsvangirai was severely beaten while in custody. The government accused the MDC of inciting violence, leading to international media attention. In March 2007, the Zimbabwean government arrested around 50 opposition members, including MDC leaders, sparking international criticism. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice condemned the regime of Robert Mugabe as ruthless and repressive. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized the reported beatings in police custody, while neighboring countries like South Africa and Zambia expressed concern. Ghanaian President John Kufuor called the incident \"very embarrassing.\" Legislative actions by Zimbabwe's parliament raised human rights concerns. The Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) in Zimbabwe has been criticized for stifling dissent and controlling the media. The government closed The Daily News in 2003, the only independent daily at the time, citing AIPPA. The African Commission on Human and People's Rights ruled in 2009 that two sections of AIPPA should be repealed. The Public Order and Security Act (POSA) and the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act in Zimbabwe have been used to suppress dissent and arrest political opponents. POSA prohibits statements deemed abusive towards the president or security forces, while the Criminal Law Code criminalizes conduct likely to cause a breach of peace. The Miscellaneous Offences Act (MOA) is often used in conjunction with POSA against activists. Police are authorized to use necessary force to stop unlawful gatherings. The 2002 PVO Act in Zimbabwe has been criticized for limiting the activities of domestic NGOs, requiring them to register with the government. A \"probe team\" with wide powers can investigate groups and demand related documents. The 2005 Constitution Amendment Act allowed the government to restrict freedom of movement and the right to leave Zimbabwe. Critics argue that these amendments breach international human rights standards. The 2005 Constitution Amendment Act in Zimbabwe restricts the right to leave the country and revokes passports of journalists, MDC officials, and union leaders. It also prevents land owners from challenging the acquisition of agricultural land by the state, leading to the passage of the Gazetted Land Act in 2006. This act made it illegal for former farm owners to occupy nationalized land without compensation. Additionally, the amendment revived the upper house of parliament and allowed the government to pass legislation like the Interception of Communications Bill, which would monitor all Internet, email, and telephone communications. The Communications Bill in Zimbabwe, allowing government monitoring of Internet, email, and telephone communications for national security threats, was initially delayed by the Parliamentary Legal Committee but later approved in June 2007. Amendments to AIPPA and POSA were made during negotiations before the 2008 elections, criticized for not fully addressing human rights concerns. Despite some political space opening up, police still occasionally used POSA to arrest civil society members. In Zimbabwe, the coalition government was formed, but police continued to use POSA to arrest civil society leaders. The MDC passed legislation to amend POSA in December 2010, but it has not been approved by the ZANU-PF Senate. Human rights groups have documented political violence in Zimbabwe, with reports of state-sanctioned abuse and excessive force. Amnesty International and the State Department have criticized Zimbabwe for pervasive human rights abuses. The State Department's 2011 human rights report on Zimbabwe highlights ongoing abuses by security forces, police, and ZANU-PF elements, including torture, beatings, and intimidation of political activists. Despite no politically motivated killings, citizens' rights to change government were effectively negated. Security forces also failed to document political violence by ZANU-PF loyalists, with an increase in harassment and intimidation ahead of projected elections. The government of Zimbabwe, led by President Mugabe, continued to suppress freedom of speech, assembly, and movement through repressive laws and executive interference in the judiciary. Security forces acted with impunity, arresting activists, journalists, and civil society members not affiliated with ZANU-PF. High-ranking officials made public threats of violence against non-ZANU-PF political activists, with Mugabe himself condoning police and military brutality against citizens. President Mugabe sanctioned a violent crackdown on protesters, warning that security forces would use force. The UN expressed dismay over his comments condoning violence, with calls for investigation into torture allegations. The UN expressed dismay over President Mugabe's violent crackdown on protesters, leading to calls for investigation into torture allegations. In Zimbabwe, acts of political violence escalated after 2007, with reports of abductions and beatings of opposition supporters becoming more systematic. Despite promises of a \"zero tolerance\" approach to violence, attacks on opposition supporters increased dramatically after the 2008 elections. The State Department's human rights report on Zimbabwe documented over 289 deaths from violence targeting individuals. The report on Zimbabwe reveals that over 289 people died from violence targeting the opposition in 2008. A non-governmental organization reported that 22,000 victims sought treatment for political violence that year. Despite this, there have been no prosecutions or convictions for the politically related killings. The State Department highlighted the involvement of party youth militia, war veterans, and the police in perpetrating political violence. The International Commission of Jurists expressed shock at the police's role in attacks on lawyers in 2007. Multiple reports documented police using excessive force. The State Department has documented reports of police using excessive force and inhumane treatment in Zimbabwe. International criticism of the political situation in the country increased after opposition arrests in March 2007. African leaders, including Zambia's President and South Africa's Foreign Ministry, expressed concern and disapproval of the security forces' actions during political protests. SADC leaders held an emergency summit in response to the situation. During an emergency summit, SADC leaders resolved to promote dialogue in Zimbabwe, urging Western countries to lift sanctions and Britain to aid in land reform. South African President Thabo Mbeki was tasked with mediating between the government and opposition, advocating for elections to facilitate discussions despite concerns over their fairness. Talks between the Mugabe Administration and MDC factions in Pretoria in June 2007 aimed to ensure free and fair elections. Despite negotiations, political violence against opposition leaders continued, with the government accusing them of bombings. Harassment of university students by police also increased. In November 2007, members of a pro-democracy group were severely beaten during a peaceful protest coinciding with President Mbeki's visit to Harare. The South African negotiations resulted in agreements between the parties. Despite agreements reached in South African negotiations to amend laws restricting press freedom and political activity, talks were abandoned after Mugabe announced elections on March 29, 2008. Tsvangirai criticized the lack of change in dictatorship behavior despite mediation efforts. Pre-election irregularities were reported, with critics citing the Zimbabwe Election Commission's lack of independence and administrative challenges. Registration processes were inconsistent, and alleged inaccuracies were not addressed by the ZEC. The 2008 elections in Zimbabwe were marred by inconsistencies and allegations of inaccuracies in the voters' roll. Civic groups criticized the lack of voter education efforts by the Zimbabwe Election Commission (ZEC) and claimed that independent NGOs were not allowed to conduct voter education programs. The Zimbabwe Election Support Network (ZESN) accused the ruling party of manipulating constituencies to maintain power and highlighted a lack of polling stations in urban areas where the opposition had strong support. The ruling party in Zimbabwe allegedly manipulated state resources for campaign purposes, limited the opposition's ability to campaign, and used public resources to buy votes. President Mugabe announced salary increases for the military and civil servants before the elections, and signed a law requiring foreign-owned firms to transfer shares to domestic investors. The government in Zimbabwe under President Mugabe manipulated state resources for campaign purposes, limited opposition campaigning, and distributed vehicles and agricultural equipment to ZANU-PF supporters. Domestic groups reported opposition supporters being denied access to state food supplies, while NGOs faced bans on distributing aid. Human rights groups noted a rise in politically motivated violence before the 2008 elections, with riot police deployed to break up demonstrations. In January 2008, riot police in Zimbabwe tear-gassed and assaulted protestors in Harare. Members of the Progressive Teachers Union reported being abducted and beaten by ZANU-PF supporters, with security service chiefs publicly stating they would only recognize Mugabe's electoral victory. In speeches and statements, public officials in Zimbabwe labeled opposition leaders as traitors or puppets of the West. The International Bar Association criticized Zimbabwe's police for being partisan and hindering democracy. Despite banning police from polling stations to prevent intimidation, President Mugabe later allowed their presence under the guise of assisting disabled voters. Zimbabwe invited election observers from over 40 countries but excluded some. The SADC and AU observed Zimbabwe's elections, with the AU deeming them generally free and fair, while the SADC noted concerns about opposition access to media and delays in voter roll publication. Two South African delegates criticized the elections as chaotic and deeply flawed. CNN and Western media were denied coverage permission. The opposition party refused to sign the report on Zimbabwe's elections, citing them as \"chaotic\" and \"deeply flawed.\" Other observer groups, including the World Council of Churches and the African Council of Churches, reported bias in favor of the incumbent, media bias, violence, intimidation, and arrests of journalists. Two international journalists were arrested and later acquitted, while others were also detained. The editor of The Standard was arrested for printing an editorial by opposition leader Arthur Mutambara. Mutambara was later arrested as well. The MDC split into two factions in 2005, known as MDC-T and MDC-M. The ZEC was criticized for delayed release of electoral results. MDC factions won a majority in the National Assembly with 109 seats. The National Assembly has 109 seats, with the opposition winning a majority over ZANU-PF's 97. The ruling party retained its majority in the Senate, with ZANU-PF winning 30 out of 60 directly elected seats. Several senior ruling party members lost their parliamentary seats, including Ministers of Justice, Agriculture, Mines, Energy, and Transport. The MDC's decision to contest the election while divided may have impacted the outcome. In February 2008, Simba Makoni announced his intention to run against President Mugabe. Senior member Simba Makoni announced his intention to run against President Mugabe in the upcoming elections, leading to his expulsion from the party. He ran as an independent with rumored support from senior ruling party officials. MDC faction leader Arthur Mutambara withdrew as a presidential candidate and backed Makoni. The main MDC faction claimed victory for Tsvangirai with over 50% of the votes, but there were doubts about whether he had reached the necessary threshold to avoid a runoff. ZESN reported that results were not posted in three constituency tabulation centers despite a legal requirement to do so. The opposition called for a nationwide strike on April 14 to protest the delayed release of results, resulting in arrests of opposition supporters. The strike was deemed unsuccessful due to low participation. The ZEC declared that Tsvangirai received 47.9% of the votes, while Mugabe received 43.2%, leading to a runoff election. The ZEC declared Tsvangirai received 47.9% of votes, Mugabe 43.2%, and Makoni 8.3%. International community questioned government's delay in releasing results. MDC appealed unsuccessfully for earlier release. Opposition accused government of manipulating results. Tsvangirai agreed to runoff against Mugabe. ZESN questioned validity of results due to lack of ballot material custody. The delayed announcement of presidential results in Zimbabwe raised concerns about the impartiality of the ZEC, with the United States and others echoing these concerns. Zimbabweans faced a significant delay before the second round of elections, scheduled for June 27, three months after the first round. Analysts questioned the government's ability to afford another election, estimated to cost up to $60 million, due to high government borrowing. The MDC called for the immediate deployment of election observers from outside Africa. The MDC called for the immediate deployment of election observers from outside Africa, as well as an increased presence of SADC and AU observers during the runoff. The opposition also demanded the repeal of restrictions on their campaigning and an end to political violence. Tsvangirai returned to Zimbabwe amidst concerns for his safety, facing accusations of treason from government officials. The International Crisis Group warned of a potential military coup if Tsvangirai won the runoff election in Zimbabwe. Reports of government-orchestrated violence against opposition supporters increased, with security forces and militias targeting MDC organizers and citizens. President Mugabe's inner circle was reportedly divided on the violent campaign. Mugabe refuses to give up power in Zimbabwe, questioning the effectiveness of a ballot against guns. Tsvangirai faced police detention and sought refuge in the Dutch Embassy. MDC's Tendai Biti was arrested for treason but later released on bail. Kofi Annan and African leaders called for an end to violence and fair elections. ZANU-PF supporters blocked an MDC rally with weapons before the runoff election. Despite high levels of violence and lack of a fair election environment, Mugabe was declared the winner of the runoff election in Zimbabwe in 2008. SADC observers noted politically motivated violence, disruption of opposition campaigning, and harassment of their observers. The SADC and Pan-African Parliament observer missions criticized the 2008 Zimbabwe runoff election for not conforming to democratic principles, citing harassment of observers and lack of political tolerance. The PAP delegation reported witnessing voter intimidation and questioned the impartiality of the ZEC, stating that the election did not reflect the will of the people. The African Union team also criticized the 2008 Zimbabwe election for not meeting AU standards. Reports of post-election violence increased significantly, with hundreds of victims treated for assault and torture. Nearly 300 people died as a result of political violence, with the ruling party implicated in orchestrating the attacks. The 2008 Zimbabwe election was criticized for not meeting AU standards. Post-election violence ensued, with hundreds of victims treated for assault and torture. The ruling party was implicated in orchestrating the attacks, despite denials from ZANU-PF and the Zimbabwean military. Key players like the army, police, intelligence service, \"war veterans,\" and the National Youth Service were all involved. There were fears of a white takeover post-election, with reports of white farmers threatening resettled black farmers in anticipation of an \"incoming MDC government.\" The post-election violence in Zimbabwe included farm invasions targeting white farmers, with over 100 forced off their lands by April 16. The government's use of military-style campaigns for various programs, such as Operation Reduce Prices and Operation Murambatsvina, continued with Operation Mavhoterapapi after the election. Critics highlight the government's history of violent tactics against political opponents, including Operation Gukurahundi. Gukurahundi, a violent campaign in the 1980s by the 5th Brigade against alleged dissidents and ZAPU supporters, resulted in over 10,000 civilian deaths, mostly from the Ndebele ethnic group. Led by Lt. Col. Perence Shiri, other officials involved were later promoted to senior government positions, including Sydney Sekeremayi and Emerson Mnangagwa. Mnangagwa, rumored to lead the Joint Operations Command, once threatened to burn down villages with dissidents. Zimbabwe's rural areas were severely affected by post-election violence, with thousands fleeing to urban areas. Medical clinics in Harare were overwhelmed during the violence. Over 40,000 farm workers were displaced by militias, with reports of burned homes and torture of MDC supporters. Victims often faced denial of medical access and humanitarian aid. Amnesty International reported victims denied medical access, humanitarian organizations targeted by militias. UN representative in Zimbabwe noted political violence mainly on MDC followers. SADC mission confirmed violence level, with victims tortured and houses destroyed. Police raided MDC and ZESN offices, arresting hundreds seeking refuge. Leaders were arrested on May 9. On May 9, leaders of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and the Progressive Teacher's Union were arrested for subversive activities. More than 50 people were beaten by riot police during a protest in Bulawayo on May 5. The MDC was accused of rigging and inciting violence by Zimbabwean officials. Newly elected MDC legislators and election officers were also arrested. Negotiations overseen by Thabo Mbeki led to a signing between Mugabe and Tsvangirai on September 15. After weeks of negotiations overseen by Thabo Mbeki, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed the Global Political Agreement (GPA) in September 15. The agreement faced delays over police oversight, leading to SADC pressure for implementation in January 2009. Tsvangirai joined a coalition government on January 31, with new MDC ministers sworn in by early February 2009. In May 2005, Zimbabwe initiated Operation Murambatsvina, a demolition program targeting illegal urban structures. Operation Murambatsvina in May 2005 targeted illegal urban structures in Zimbabwe, leading to the displacement of 700,000 urban residents and affecting 2.1 million people. Security forces arrested thousands and advised those left homeless to return to rural areas, causing severe economic impact and loss of livelihood for many. As a result of the 2000 land reform program and political violence surrounding the 2002 elections, hundreds of thousands of black laborers on commercial farms were forcibly removed from their homes. In 2004, an estimated 500,000 people who settled on farms during the 2000 invasions were evicted. Prior to Operation Murambatsvina in 2005, many of the displaced individuals were informally employed, with 70% involved in informal trading in towns and cities. Operation Murambatsvina in 2005 aimed to restore Harare's image by demolishing illegal structures and curbing criminal activity. Launched after the 2005 elections, it was seen as a political move to prevent protests over the economic crisis or punish the MDC's urban support base. The Harare Commission, established to bypass the elected city council, led the campaign. The Harare Commission, appointed by the Minister of Local Government, was challenged in court for firing the mayor without authority. A new election was supposed to be held within 90 days, but when it didn't happen, the commission was reappointed. MDC councilors resigned in protest, and other areas affected by Murambatsvina were not informed of the demolitions beforehand. United Nations noted the operation was carried out in a polarized political climate with a lack of dialogue between Government and local authorities. International reaction to Murambatsvina was highly critical. U.N. Secretary-General appointed Tanzanian Anna Tibaijuka as the U.N. Special Envoy to investigate the demolitions. Her report concluded that Operation Restore Order was carried out indiscriminately, with indifference to human suffering and disregard for legal frameworks. Police also prevented assistance from civil society and humanitarian organizations. The U.N. envoy's report on Operation Murambatsvina criticized the government of Zimbabwe for preventing assistance from civil society and humanitarian organizations. The presentation of the report to the U.N. Security Council sparked controversy, with some members objecting to its discussion. Secretary-General Annan condemned the evictions and called for unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance. The U.N. envoy criticized Zimbabwe's government for unjustly evicting 700,000 citizens, urging immediate action to hold those responsible accountable. Despite recommendations, forced evictions continued, with homeless individuals taken to police-run camps in late 2006. In late 2006, homeless individuals were taken to police-run \"transit camps\" with dire conditions, lacking shelter, water, and basic facilities. The government rejected aid from the United Nations, leading to international criticism. Only 2,300 shelters were erected out of a target of 40,000. Operation Garikai, a new housing scheme, was announced in response to the criticism. In 2005, under Garakai, new housing was planned for those left homeless, but due to material shortages and budget issues, the target of 5,275 homes was likely not met. Reports suggest houses were occupied by soldiers and ruling party members instead of victims. Amnesty International and a local group criticized the government's re-housing efforts, stating many victims still lived in poor conditions five years after Murambatsvina. According to 2010 Housing Ministry estimates, over 500,000 people were on the waiting list for housing in Harare alone, with a national backlog possibly exceeding 1 million in urban areas. Human rights organizations raised concerns about the government's response to the housing crisis following Murambatsvina, questioning whether it constituted \"crimes against humanity\" and if there was a \"responsibility to protect\" those affected. The U.N. envoy recommended addressing the serious suffering caused by the government to its population. The Government of Zimbabwe caused serious suffering to its population, requiring assistance from the United Nations and the international community. The international community should urge the Government to prosecute those responsible for the catastrophe and address human rights concerns through political forums. The report found the Government collectively responsible for the events of Murambatsvina. The Government of Zimbabwe is collectively responsible for the events of Murambatsvina, with evidence suggesting improper advice by a few architects of the operation. Calls have been made for President Mugabe's government to be brought before the ICC for violations and alleged support of political violence. Mugabe's comments supporting the beating of trade union leaders in 2006 add to the evidence of torture and serious human rights abuses. The urgent need for international and regional action to hold the Zimbabwean Government accountable for torture and other serious violations of international law, including crimes against humanity, is emphasized by Mugabe's statements. The call for an ICC investigation of President Mugabe for crimes against humanity has been reiterated, with the government of Zimbabwe failing to prosecute those responsible for crimes related to Murambatsvina. Victims often lack the financial resources to seek justice in court. Several cases in Zimbabwe involving land reform and evictions are pending before the African Commission on Human and People's Rights. The SADC regional tribunal ruled against the Zimbabwe government between 2008 and 2010 for undermining the rule of law by refusing to compensate victims of state-sponsored violence and torture. Victims often lack the financial resources to seek redress in court. Zimbabwe's Justice Minister claims the tribunal has no jurisdiction over Zimbabwe, leading to the government refusing to enforce judgments. SADC heads of state ordered a review of the tribunal's role, suspending its operations. Civic activists argue that Zimbabwe's judicial system's failure to protect citizens suggests a breakdown in the rule of law. Chronic food insecurity in Southern African countries is attributed to weather-related and man-made factors, with Zimbabwe being particularly affected by severe crop failure. Experts attribute Zimbabwe's chronic food insecurity to severe crop failure and government policies like Murambatsvina. Aid organizations estimated that 7 million Zimbabweans needed food assistance in late 2008 to early 2009, but this number has decreased. USAID reports that food production has slightly increased, but factors like localized food insecurity and political violence continue to contribute to the ongoing need for food aid. Drought and disruptions to the farming sector from land seizures also play a role in the country's food shortages. The land seizure program in Zimbabwe led to disruptions in the farming sector and reduced food production. Most white-owned commercial farms have been taken over, with only a few remaining in operation. Land reform programs funded by the British transferred millions of hectares of farmland, but inefficiencies and lack of active farming on redistributed land have been criticized. Experienced farm workers were forced to flee seized farms, and food insecurity persists due to factors like drought and political violence. Operation Taguta (or \"Eat Well\") was established by the Zimbabwe government in late 2005 as a response to the failure of farm resettlement policies. The program involved the military taking control of food distribution and production, leading to reports of illegal seizure of farm equipment, destruction of crops, and army brutality against farmers. Critics suggest that Operation Taguta was a controversial move by the government. The Zimbabwe government's Operation Taguta involved military control of food distribution and production, leading to reports of army brutality against farmers. Critics suggest it was used to deploy military forces to control the population. President Mugabe denied the need for food aid despite assessments indicating otherwise. In 2005, the Zimbabwe government acknowledged food shortages but delayed aid until December. They tightly controlled food distribution and banned NGOs from providing aid before the 2008 runoff. Critics accused the government of using food to influence votes and only distributing in ZANU-PF supportive areas. Reports also mentioned instances of ZANU-PF holding rallies during food distributions and requiring recipients to show party cards. In Zimbabwe, food distribution was politicized, with MDC supporters being turned away. Court rulings in 2005 found that ZANU-PF candidates used violence during distributions. The country is also facing a severe HIV/AIDS epidemic, with high prevalence rates and a large number of orphaned children. The healthcare system is strained, with most hospital admissions being AIDS-related. The economic crisis has led to a shortage of medical professionals, further exacerbating the situation. Zimbabwe's struggling economy is further impacted by infected agricultural workers unable to contribute to food production. HIV prevalence rates have declined in the country, with changes in sexual behavior and prevention programs credited for the decrease. The government has shown resolve in fighting the disease, introducing a tax to finance HIV/AIDS programs and committing to universal access to antiretroviral therapy. However, access to treatment remains relatively low, with a significant number of cholera cases reported from August 2008 to June 2009. The 2008/2009 cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe resulted in over 98,500 suspected cases and almost 4,300 deaths. The case fatality rate peaked at almost 6% in January 2009 but has since decreased with international intervention. The collapse of healthcare, water, and sanitation systems contributed to the severity of the outbreak. From January to May 2011, there were almost 880 cases reported with 38 deaths. In the late 2000s, Zimbabwe experienced a decline in healthcare delivery and basic social services like trash collection, leading to health risks. Public healthcare providers lacked supplies and medical equipment, with many hospitals closing due to understaffing. Despite some water infrastructure improvements, a third of rural Zimbabweans still lacked clean drinking water in 2011. The economic turmoil caused a drop in living standards and a significant exodus of Zimbabweans in search of work, with over three million living outside the country by 2004. Many Zimbabweans fled the country due to economic hardship, with 25%-30% of the population living abroad by 2004. The economy declined significantly, leading to a suspension of World Bank and IMF lending in 2000. In 2009, the government adopted multiple currencies to stabilize prices, but the cost of living remains high. In December 2003, Mugabe appointed Gideon Gono as governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Gono devalued the Zimbabwe dollar in June 2006 to combat inflation, introducing new currency known as \"little heroes\" under \"Operation Sunrise\" to fight corruption and money laundering. Zimbabweans had 21 days to exchange their old currency. In late September 2008, Zimbabwe began trading in foreign currency to lower prices. In February 2009, civil servant salaries were issued in $100 U.S. dollar vouchers. Officials aimed to encourage Zimbabweans to return to work by paying salaries in foreign currency. Zimbabwe officials are struggling to increase salaries due to a lack of foreign currency. The country owes significant debts to international organizations like the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, and European Investment Bank, totaling $8.8 billion. Mugabe has criticized the IMF as a tool for regime change. The IMF has urged Zimbabwe to discuss policy reforms and show commitment to a new direction, noting positive steps towards fiscal discipline. However, IMF funding will not be renewed until debts are repaid and sound policies are implemented. The World Bank has offered technical assistance but also requires debt repayment. Mugabe has criticized the IMF as a tool for regime change. The IMF has conditioned major support on Zimbabwe's payment of arrears. The government introduced long-term leases to provide security for farmers, aiming to revive the agriculture industry. Distribution of 99-year leases began in 2006, including to white farmers, surprising many. Mugabe declared in 2005 that his land reform program would only be complete when there were no white farmers left. Zimbabwe faces electricity shortages, with internal power generation meeting only half of the demand. The mining industry has provided much-needed income. The government introduced long-term leases for farmers, but some banks are hesitant to accept them as collateral. Periodic electricity shortages have impacted manufacturing and mining sectors. The energy infrastructure needs up to $1 billion for repairs. Zimbabwe's mining industry has been a significant source of income, accounting for almost half of the country's foreign currency revenues. The government initially planned to take a majority share of foreign-owned mines for local investors, but after industry officials raised concerns about deterring foreign investment, the proposal was modified to allow firms investing in community projects to keep their majority share. Similar plans were approved for all foreign-owned businesses in 2007, becoming law in March 2008. The government assured that it would not expropriate foreign-owned companies. The government introduced indigenization regulations for the mining sector, sparking debate over foreign investment. Under the coalition government, gold miners can now market their own gold and receive payment in foreign currency, with reduced export taxes. The Zimbabwe government has cracked down on illegal mining, arresting thousands of miners and confiscating precious minerals. Security forces have been accused of human rights abuses during these operations. Unemployment has led many to turn to illegal mining, selling their goods on the black market. The World Diamond Council raised concerns about illegal diamond exports from Zimbabwe. In December 2008, reports surfaced of illegal export of rough diamonds from Zimbabwe, bypassing the Kimberly Process. Zimbabwean soldiers in Marange diamond fields forced villagers to mine and smuggled the stones. The EU called for an investigation into Zimbabwe's compliance with KP obligations. Despite concerns, Zimbabwe was not suspended from the scheme. In November 2009, KP urged stringent export controls on Marange diamonds. In response to reports of illegal diamond exports from Marange, the Kimberly Process urged stringent export controls. The Zimbabwe government later reported security forces withdrawing from the area, with diamonds held by the Reserve Bank pending legal resolution. Calls were made for Zimbabwe's suspension from the Process if controls were not implemented, leading to protests when exports from Marange were allowed to resume in June 2011. Allegations of smuggling \"blood diamonds\" from the DRC into South Africa alongside Zimbabwean rough stones were dismissed by the Mugabe government as a Western ploy for regime change. Zimbabwe has a history of involvement in conflict diamonds, with senior officials implicated in profiting from illicit trade during military operations in the DRC. President Mugabe blamed Western governments for the country's economic crisis and sought investment from Asia, particularly China, through the \"Look East\" policy. Criticized by his party for not adequately addressing the economic decline, the central bank governor was accused of worsening inflation in December 2006. The ZANU-PF MP accused the central bank governor of exacerbating inflation with \"quasi-fiscal activities\" and emphasized the importance of not neglecting the traditional market of the West while expanding relations with the Far East. China has provided loans to support Zimbabwe's economic recovery in exchange for mining concessions. Critics claim President Mugabe maintains loyalty of security forces through patronage and bribery, potentially harming the economy. Speculation surrounds how the government funded military purchases from China, including $240 million in fighter jets. Allegations of land and housing handouts to security personnel also persist. Critics of the government point out the appointment of military officers to senior civilian positions, including control of key ministries and agencies. As the economy contracted in the mid-2000s, concerns arose about funding for security forces, with reports of low salaries and food shortages among soldiers. In mid-2000s, concerns about low salaries and food shortages among security forces arose. Zimbabwean intelligence uncovered a coup plot involving senior military officials aiming to remove Mugabe and install Mnangagwa as president. Soldiers looted stores in late 2008 due to paycheck access issues. The international community is divided on how to respond to Zimbabwe's economic and political crises. Western nations oppose Mugabe's rule and pressure the government for reforms, while African leaders are starting to see the need for political and economic changes. Mugabe has support in Africa but some leaders believe reforms are necessary. Zimbabwe received support from African countries to chair the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in 2007. The African Union deferred to SADC's mediation role on Zimbabwe's political situation in 2008, following the AU, SADC, and Pan-African Parliament's findings that the June runoff was not free or fair. The international donor community has expressed support for Zimbabwe's new coalition government, but assistance is contingent on improvements in various areas. The United States government has criticized Robert Mugabe and ZANU-PF for their poor human rights record and lack of respect for the rule of law. U.S. policy towards Zimbabwe includes targeted sanctions, support for African efforts to restore democracy, and assistance for the country's poor and civil society. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice labeled Zimbabwe as one of six \"outposts of tyranny\" worldwide. Mugabe responded angrily to these remarks. The United States government, under the leadership of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, has welcomed the transitional government in Zimbabwe but has warned that additional development assistance and easing of sanctions will not be considered until effective governance is seen. Despite the Mugabe administration blaming its economic crisis on sanctions, the US does not have trade sanctions against Zimbabwe except for a ban on defense transfers. Zimbabwe is not eligible for trade benefits under AGOA due to poor economic management and human rights abuses. The White House has frozen government-to-government aid to Zimbabwe. The White House has annually renewed U.S. sanctions against ZANU-PF leaders in Zimbabwe since 2003, targeting those responsible for economic difficulties and human rights abuses. Sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes for high-ranking officials and their spouses, as well as individuals benefiting financially from dealings with them. President Bush initially imposed sanctions in 2003, with further expansions in subsequent years. The executive order in 2004 expanded sanctions on companies and commercial farms in Zimbabwe. President Obama renewed the sanctions in March 2011, citing the lack of progress in fundamental reforms for democratic governance in the country. The United States has expressed concerns about politically motivated violence and intimidation in Zimbabwe, as well as the undermining of power-sharing agreements. Legislation such as the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 criticized economic mismanagement and undemocratic practices, calling for consultations on economic sanctions and a travel ban. In 2005, the House of Representatives condemned Operation Murambatsvina as a humanitarian disaster exacerbating food and economic crises, urging the United Nations and African regional bodies to investigate the demolitions. In response to the Zimbabwe government's actions, the US Congress passed legislation to support democracy and human rights in the country. This included providing funding for governance activities and condemning the government's treatment of opposition and civil society activists. Former Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton introduced a bill authorizing up to $10 million for democracy and human rights programs in Zimbabwe. The US Congress authorized up to $10 million to support democracy and human rights programs in Zimbabwe. Members of Congress criticized the Mugabe Administration for the 2008 elections and political violence, passing resolutions calling for the release of presidential results, an end to violence, and sanctions against the regime. The House also condemned the violence. The 111th Congress, including the Congressional Black Caucus, passed resolutions condemning violence in Zimbabwe and calling for peaceful resolution. Legislation was introduced for an international arms embargo and urging UN involvement. There were calls to postpone elections and sever diplomatic ties with Zimbabwe. The Congress monitored the transitional government and reviewed US policy towards Zimbabwe. Representative Ros-Lehtinen introduced a resolution declaring the crisis in Zimbabwe a threat. H.Res. 238 declared the crisis in Zimbabwe a threat to international security. The Senate Foreign Relations Africa Subcommittee discussed U.S. policy options towards Zimbabwe's transition, with Senator Feingold emphasizing the need to support reformers in the transitional government. In response, Senators Feingold, Kerry, and Isakson introduced S. 3297, aiming to update U.S. policy towards Zimbabwe. S. 3297 aimed to update U.S. policy towards Zimbabwe, supporting democracy and economic recovery. Other legislation included H.R. 5971 for debt forgiveness and S. 3722 to repeal ZDERA. President Bush praised Thabo Mbeki's role in seeking a Zimbabwe solution during his visit to South Africa in 2003. The Obama Administration supported South African President Jacob Zuma's role as the SADC facilitator on Zimbabwe issues. The United States has been a leader in providing humanitarian relief aid to Zimbabwe, supplying around $1 billion in assistance since 2002. In FY2008, U.S. assistance included $271 million in food aid and $22 million in other forms of aid. In FY2008, U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe included $271 million in food aid, $22 million in humanitarian assistance, $22 million in health programs, and $10 million for democracy and governance support. President Obama pledged $73 million in new assistance in 2009. The U.S. government obligated over $292 million in foreign aid in FY2009, including $7.3 million for cholera outbreak and $8.6 million for water and sanitation programs. Assistance in FY2010 totaled over $168 million, with almost $80 million in humanitarian aid. The Obama Administration requested almost $110 million in non-humanitarian aid for Zimbabwe in FY2012. In FY2008, U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe included $271 million in food aid, $22 million in humanitarian assistance, $22 million for health programs, $10 million for democracy and governance support, and over $16 million for economic growth initiatives. The U.S. government provides technical assistance to reform-minded ministries and parliament, but Zimbabwe is not eligible for certain aid programs. USAID supports local democracy advocates, media freedom, civil society, and human rights protection in Zimbabwe. Legal restrictions have limited journalists and independent newspapers in Zimbabwe, with the government controlling all domestic radio and television stations. Despite some reforms allowing for independent media, reports indicate ongoing restrictions on free speech. USAID funds Voice of America's Studio 7 program, but broadcasts have been disrupted by the government using Chinese jamming equipment. The U.S. State Department lifted its travel warning for Americans in Zimbabwe in 2009. In 2009, Americans traveling to Zimbabwe were warned about the unpredictable and deteriorating situation in the country. The U.S. Coalition of Black Trade Unionists delegation was expelled in 2006, leading to criticism from then-U.S. Ambassador Christopher Dell towards the Zimbabwean government's repression and fear of the truth. In 2002, the British Parliament imposed sanctions on members of the ZANU-PF regime in Zimbabwe. The UK has travel bans on over 100 ZANU-PF members and affiliates. They continue to provide humanitarian aid but may release funds for land redistribution only if Mugabe retires. Mugabe has been hostile towards former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. At his 81st birthday celebration, Mugabe threatened to bury Mr. Blair and the Union Jack. Prime Minister [author name scrubbed] boycotted the 2007 EU-Africa Summit over Mugabe's attendance. Brown called for an arms embargo against Zimbabwe in 2008. Queen Elizabeth stripped Mugabe of his Knighthood. Mugabe allies do not view David Cameron with the same hostility. The European Union imposed targeted sanctions on members of Zimbabwe's elite in the early 2000s, including a travel ban, arms embargo, and asset freeze. Mugabe defied the travel ban in 2005. The Commonwealth of Nations sent observers to the 2002 presidential election in Zimbabwe. In response to concerns about the lack of free expression in Zimbabwe's elections, a committee from Australia, South Africa, and Nigeria suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth for one year. This was the first public action against Mugabe by influential African countries. In December 2003, the Commonwealth, along with 19 other African members, voted to suspend Zimbabwe indefinitely. President Thabo Mbeki criticized this decision, as he was committed to quiet diplomacy. Mugabe then withdrew Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth, cutting off any possibility of return. Some believed this move backfired, as it placed Zimbabwe completely outside the Commonwealth's influence. China's increased involvement in Zimbabwe's economy, particularly in platinum concessions and various industries, has strengthened its position as the country's second-largest trading partner and largest investor. This move has been seen as a strategic shift towards Africa for natural resources to meet China's growing population's needs. China's investment in Zimbabwe spans various industries, including the cell phone industry, television, radio, and power generation. Critics raise concerns about the lack of conditions on China's investments, unlike Western governments that may require commitments to human rights and anti-corruption. Arms agreements between China and Zimbabwe have drawn attention, with questions raised about the need for fighter jets and other military equipment. The source of funding for these purchases, given Zimbabwe's economic challenges, remains a subject of speculation. The Defense Ministry officials in Zimbabwe are in arrears for 2005 arms purchases from China, which some suspect are covered by China's economic role in the country. Zimbabwe also received aid from Iran, including commitments for assistance in energy, agriculture, and mining industries. There are reports of technical assistance from Iran or Gulf countries to revive Zimbabwe's oil refinery. Additionally, Zimbabwe's Asian partners have provided diplomatic support to President Mugabe. China and Iran have provided diplomatic support to Zimbabwe, with China opposing foreign interference in land issues and vetoing proposed sanctions against the Mugabe Administration. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has expressed similar support for Zimbabwe's land redistribution program. Nigeria endorsed the 2002 presidential election in Zimbabwe. Nigeria's former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, endorsed the 2002 presidential election in Zimbabwe and attempted to mediate the country's crisis. Concerned about the Zimbabwe situation's impact on NEPAD's credibility, Obasanjo supported Zimbabwe's suspension from the Commonwealth. He met with Tsvangirai and an MDC delegation in 2004, even taking them on a personal farm tour. After the 2005 elections, Obasanjo was accused of funding the MDC by the government-owned Herald newspaper. His successor, Umaru Yar'Adua, also expressed concern with the situation. Former Nigerian Presidents Obasanjo and Yar'Adua expressed concerns about the situation in Zimbabwe, with Yar'Adua stating that developments were not in line with the rule of law. Current President Goodluck Jonathan assured support for peaceful elections in Zimbabwe. Thabo Mbeki's approach to Zimbabwe faced criticism for being slow, but he played a crucial role in the 2008 power-sharing agreement. Mugabe's support for the ANC during the liberation struggles of Southern Africa is seen as a factor in Mbeki's reluctance to openly confront him. The ANC's bond of gratitude with Mugabe stems from their shared struggle against white minority rule in South Africa. Despite Mugabe's popularity for seizing land from white farmers, dissatisfaction remains over South Africa's lack of proactive involvement in resolving Zimbabwe's political disputes. South Africa's significant influence as Zimbabwe's largest trading partner raises expectations for more assertive action, but potential unintended consequences, such as state collapse and increased illegal migration, must be considered. In May 2008, economic collapse and election violence in Zimbabwe led to a sharp increase in illegal migration to South Africa, resulting in xenophobic violence against Zimbabwean and other African immigrants. Former President Mbeki attempted to mediate discussions between the Zimbabwean government and the MDC, offering economic incentives and an exit strategy for Mugabe in exchange for negotiations and free elections, but these efforts were unsuccessful. Zimbabwe requested a loan from South Africa to address debt payment arrears and IMF threats of expulsion. Rumors circulated that South Africa might make the loan conditional on economic reforms. In early 2006, negotiations between South Africa and Zimbabwe stalled over loan conditions. Mugabe warned Mbeki to stay out of Zimbabwe's affairs. Mbeki's policies faced criticism from Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Tony Leon, and COSATU. COSATU, a labor confederation, opposed Mbeki's quiet diplomacy and showed support for the MDC. COSATU delegations were expelled from Zimbabwe in 2004 and 2006. In late 2006, COSATU members supported the ZCTU in Harare, criticizing the Mbeki government's response to arrests of activists in March 2007. Some defended Mbeki's mediation efforts with Mugabe, while others hoped for progress after a meeting with Tsvangirai in October 2004. After meeting with Tsvangirai in October 2004, President Mbeki's stance on Zimbabwe's elections raised doubts about the effectiveness of his diplomacy. Mbeki's successor will determine South Africa's future policy towards Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is now under the leadership of Mbeki's successor, Jacob Zuma, who became South Africa's fourth post-apartheid president in May 2009. Zuma has taken on the role of SADC facilitator on the Zimbabwe situation since December 2009. The African Union (AU) and its predecessor, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), have previously supported Mugabe, with an OAU observer team in 2002 labeling Mugabe's election victory as legitimate, free, and fair. In 2004, the AU allowed a critical report on the Mugabe government to be circulated at its summit, indicating a possible change in approach. The report criticized Zimbabwe for police abuses, press censorship, and compromising the judiciary. The AU tabled the report and kept its contents secret until Zimbabwe could respond. The Zimbabwean government used procedural regulations to prevent its release. The ACHPR passed a resolution in 2005 calling on Zimbabwe to respect fundamental rights and freedoms of expression. The ACHPR resolution called on Zimbabwe to respect fundamental rights and freedoms of expression. Human rights advocates praised the resolution, but the AU's Council of Ministers rejected the second fact-finding mission's findings due to \"irregularities and procedural flaws.\" This repeated rejection tarnished the AU's integrity, with concerns raised about the body's credibility in addressing human rights violations. The AU's failure to act on ACHPR resolutions regarding human rights abuses in Zimbabwe damages the credibility of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) initiative. President Mugabe has consistently ignored criticism and denied access to those critical of his regime. In 2005, the Zimbabwean government prevented an envoy from conducting an assessment, accusing him of \"western collusion.\" In 2008, the government rejected visa applications of Elders group members, including Kofi Annan and Jimmy Carter. SADC approved electoral principles in 2004, hoping for democratic reforms in Zimbabwe. The organization was hesitant to criticize Mugabe until recently. The SADC observer delegation's report on Zimbabwe's 2005 elections was criticized for being disappointing. Neighboring leaders, except Botswana, have expressed concerns about Zimbabwe's crisis impacting their countries. Southern African leaders blamed Zimbabwe and Swaziland for hindering economic growth in the region. Botswana has previously spoken out against Mugabe's policies, including the strain of Zimbabwe's refugees on the country. Tanzanian President Kikwete visited Harare in 2007 after the arrest of opposition members, and President Mbeki was nominated as mediator after a SADC summit in 2008. President Mbeki was nominated as mediator by SADC. The election observer mission found the 2008 runoff in Zimbabwe did not reflect the people's will. Botswana refused to recognize Mugabe as president. Pressure from SADC led to the formation of a transitional government, but the willingness to enforce the deal remains uncertain. In 2011, the SADC Troika met to discuss the Zimbabwe situation, with President Zuma briefing on the latest developments. President Zuma briefed SADC counterparts on Prime Minister Tsvangirai's appeal for intervention in resolving political disputes in Zimbabwe. Zambian President Banda warned of uprisings in North Africa as a cautionary tale. The SADC Troika expressed disappointment in the lack of progress in implementing the GPA in Zimbabwe and called for an end to violence and intimidation, urging SADC to assist in preparing for free and fair elections. Zimbabwe is preparing guidelines for peaceful, free, and fair elections. President Mugabe and his party are displeased with the Troika's findings. SADC Summit in June 2011 reiterated the need to end violence and harassment in Zimbabwe. ZANU-PF opposes SADC's involvement, while the MDC pushes for security sector reforms. The Obama Administration supports SADC's efforts in Zimbabwe. Despite the Obama Administration's support for SADC efforts in Zimbabwe, there are disagreements on lifting sanctions against Mugabe and ZANU-PF officials. Life for many Zimbabweans remains challenging with high unemployment, low salaries, and ongoing issues with property rights and land reform. The younger generation faces poor prospects, with many teachers returning to work but struggling with low salaries. Families continue to struggle to afford basic necessities like food and medicine. Analysts attribute Zimbabwe's economic challenges to various factors. Zimbabwe's economic problems in the past decade are attributed to recurrent drought, difficulties in implementing reforms, and competition from South African imports. The government's policies since 1997 are also blamed for the country's issues. Despite some fiscal measures, hyperinflation persisted, and the effectiveness of the MDC's economic policies remains uncertain without significant donor financing. Zimbabwe is in debt distress, requiring up to $8 billion for recovery plans. Many donor governments and institutions have been hesitant to provide support. The MDC and ZANU-PF must show willingness to work together to revive Zimbabwe's economy, needing up to $8 billion for recovery plans. Donor funds are on hold pending changes in government policies that led to sanctions."
