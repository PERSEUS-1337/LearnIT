High school coaches must foster a college-bound culture for students, working with a cohort of 25-50 students to guide them in enrolling in college-prep courses, understanding the college application process, and accessing financial aid information. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid and scholarships are key in helping students select, enroll, and persist in higher education institutions that meet their needs. Coaches also assist students in completing multiple college applications and connecting them with summer academic enrichment programs. The program offers tutoring, test preparation, academic opportunities, summer internships, and community service for college-bound students. It also monitors students' academic performance and social adjustment in their freshman year of higher education. The Corporation will contract an independent agency to evaluate the program's impact on student achievement, comparing participating high-achieving low-income and middle-income students to non-participating students. The evaluation of the program will compare academic achievement, graduation rates, attendance rates, and student participation in high schools participating in the program to similar high schools not participating. The evaluation of the program will assess rates of students taking SAT or ACT tests, completing honors/AP/IB courses, enrollment in higher education, and success in academic factors determined by the Corporation. The evaluation of the program showed improvement in student achievement. The Corporation will work with the agency to include as many students as possible in the program. SEC. 4. EDUCATIONAL AWARDS.
