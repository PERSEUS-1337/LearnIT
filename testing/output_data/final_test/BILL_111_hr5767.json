    "content": "The \"Innovative Technologies Investment Incentive Act of 2010\" provides a credit for investments in high technology and biotechnology business concerns developing innovative technologies. This Act aims to encourage investment in these sectors by amending the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include a new section for such investments. The \"Innovative Technologies Investment Incentive Act of 2010\" offers a tax credit of 25% for qualified equity investments made by taxpayers. There is a national limitation of $500,000,000 for this credit, with allocations and certificates issued by the Small Business Administration. The national innovative technology investment credit has limitations for qualified small businesses, with a maximum allocation of 50% under the SBIR program. A certificate is required for credit eligibility based on the allocated investment amount. The innovative technology investment credit certificate certifies the amount of qualified equity investment related to an award under the SBIR program. It contains necessary information for credit eligibility. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, determines necessary information for the Small Business Innovation Research program. The amount of an award related to a qualified equity investment cannot be used for this section. The credit allowed to the taxpayer for a qualified equity investment in a technology small business is zero if the taxpayer owns 50 percent or more of the business after the investment. The term 'qualified equity investment' refers to any equity investment in a qualified technology small business made during the investment period, acquired by the taxpayer at its original issue solely in exchange for cash. The term 'qualified technology small business concern' refers to a small business engaged in high technology or biotechnology with fewer than 500 employees during the investment period. The investment period for a qualified technology small business concern begins when it receives funds under the SBIR program and ends 18 months after the funding agreement expires. The business credit is part of the general business credit for taxable years. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart A for such year, with limitations based on the amount of tax. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the sum of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under subpart A and section 27. If the credit exceeds the limitation imposed by section 26(a)(1) or subparagraph (B), the excess can be carried forward to the next taxable year. The excess credit for a taxable year can be carried forward for up to 20 years if not fully utilized. Related parties are treated as one person for credit purposes. The basis of any investment eligible for a credit is determined for tax purposes. The credit allowable for investments is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. Regulations provide for recapturing credits for investments held less than 3 years, with exceptions for certain transfers. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement this section. Regulations will be implemented to prevent abuse and impose reporting requirements for the qualified equity investment credit. Section 38 of the Code is amended to include the qualified equity investment credit as part of the general business credit. Conforming amendments are made to Section 1016(a) of the Code. The Code is amended to include the qualified equity investment credit in various sections such as 24(b)(3)(B), 25(e)(1)(C)(ii), 25A(i)(5)(B), 25A(i)(5), 25B(g)(2), 26(a)(1), and 30(c)(2)(B)(ii). The Code is amended to include the qualified equity investment credit in various sections such as 24(b)(3)(B), 25(e)(1)(C)(ii), 25A(i)(5)(B), 25A(i)(5), 25B(g)(2), 26(a)(1), 30(c)(2)(B)(ii), 30D, and 30E. The amendments made by section 30E apply to investments in high technology and biotechnology businesses developing innovative technologies after December 31, 2009, in taxable years ending after that date."
