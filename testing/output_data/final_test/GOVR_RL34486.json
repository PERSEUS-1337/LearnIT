    "content": "Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows financially troubled businesses to reorganize and stay in business. In chapter 11, the debtor usually remains in control without a trustee, allowing them to manage the business. Debtors can choose to assume or reject contracts, including collective bargaining agreements, with court approval required for rejection. The Bankruptcy Code allows businesses to reorganize in Chapter 11. Debtors can assume or reject contracts, including collective bargaining agreements, with a higher standard for rejection. Legislation like H.R. 3652 aims to modify the Bankruptcy Code, specifically Section 1113, to protect employees and retirees during business bankruptcies. The bill addresses concerns about executive compensation overshadowing worker and retiree benefits. H.R. 3652 aims to address the disproportionate burden on workers and retirees in business bankruptcies by advocating for comprehensive reform in the bankruptcy process. The bill highlights the unique investment made by employees and retirees in their employers' business through labor. Additionally, it mentions the addition of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 to the Bankruptcy Code, which sets requirements for rejecting collective bargaining agreements in chapter 11 bankruptcies. The addition of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 to the Bankruptcy Code followed the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Bildisco and Bildisco. Congress added this section in response to Bildisco, which resolved a split between circuits on the rejection of collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) in bankruptcy. The Court held that rejection required the agreement to be burdensome to the debtor company and favored rejection after balancing the equities of the case. Congress provided a procedure and standard for rejecting CBAs through \u00a7 1113, clarifying that they could not be rejected under 11. H.R. 3652 proposes changes to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 regarding collective bargaining agreements in bankruptcy. The bill aims to clarify existing subsections and add new ones, potentially making significant changes to the Bankruptcy Code. The language in the bill may serve to clarify the Code, resolve legal disputes, or overrule existing case law. However, without committee reports, the sponsors' intent is uncertain. The proposed changes to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 will be discussed in detail, including ambiguities in the current law and differences between the current text and the proposed text. The removal of the words \"assume or\" in subsection (a) is the only change indicated in H.R. 3652. The proposed bill H.R. 3652 aims to limit modifications to existing CBAs that can be proposed by the debtor, aligning assumptions of CBAs with 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365. This would ensure fair treatment to all creditors and affected parties during reorganization. The bill H.R. 3652 aims to limit modifications to existing CBAs proposed by the debtor to ensure fair treatment to all creditors and affected parties. The bill would restrict the duration and impact of labor group concessions, requiring them to be necessary for reorganization and not overly burdensome compared to other groups. If a court deems the proposal fair and equitable, it may grant rejection of the CBA. Limiting modifications to existing CBAs proposed by the debtor under H.R. 3652 would ensure fair treatment to all parties involved. The proposal aims to restrict concessions to labor groups to a maximum of two years to prevent unfair rejection of CBAs by the court. However, this limitation may hinder the debtor's ability to successfully reorganize in a short timeframe. The bill's requirement for debtors' proposals is to provide minimal savings necessary for survival without causing excessive burden on employees. This may lead to conflicts over the definition of \"necessary\" modifications in employee benefits. The bill requires debtors to propose modifications in employee benefits that are necessary for survival without burdening employees excessively. Courts differ on interpreting \"necessary,\" with some requiring the minimum to avoid liquidation and others focusing on ensuring the debtor's ability to reorganize. The bill's language may suggest a lenient standard, but strict interpretation could put debtors in a difficult position. The bill requires debtors to propose necessary modifications in employee benefits for survival without burdening employees excessively. Courts differ on interpreting \"necessary,\" with some focusing on reorganization ability. Strict interpretation could put debtors in a difficult position. The proposed change in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 focuses on burdens placed on groups in continuing relationships with the debtor, including management personnel. Courts historically considered management personnel in determining fair treatment, looking at the overall fairness rather than just comparing burdens. For example, a proposal to reduce union wages while increasing management pay was deemed fair if supervisors were previously earning less than their subordinates. The proposed change in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 focuses on requiring cuts in wages and benefits for employees to be matched by similar cuts for management employees. Current law requires specific conditions to be met before a court can grant a motion to reject a collective bargaining agreement. Proposed subsection (c) of H.R. 3652 introduces complex provisions, including a presumption that would prevent rejection of a CBA if not effectively rebutted. This change may be a response to current bankruptcy practices and recent court decisions, such as Bildisco. One key change is the requirement for parties to reach an impasse before a court can approve rejection of a CBA. The inclusion of \"impasse\" in H.R. 3652 regarding rejection of CBAs is uncertain if it aims to address a long-standing issue or respond to recent court decisions in the airline industry. Recent court rulings have enforced the obligation for labor groups under the Railroad Labor Act to make every effort to reach an agreement even after a CBA rejection is approved under 11 U.S.C. The proposed bill includes the phrase \"further negotiations are not likely to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement,\" which may lead courts to use a \"more likely than not\" standard to determine if an impasse has been reached. This could potentially impact the rejection of CBAs under 11 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1113, possibly reducing rejections through continued bargaining. The proposed bill aims to reduce rejections of collective bargaining agreements by encouraging continued negotiations before considering parties at an impasse, whether before or after a bankruptcy filing. Supporters argue it promotes reaching mutually acceptable modifications to preserve jobs, while opponents fear it may hinder chapter 11's purpose and job protection. The proposed bill aims to reduce rejections of collective bargaining agreements by encouraging continued negotiations before considering parties at an impasse, whether before or after a bankruptcy filing. It requires the debtor to fulfill certain requirements before approval for rejection, including providing information to the representative and bargaining in good faith. The court must also consider alternative proposals before approving rejection. The proposed bill aims to reduce rejections of collective bargaining agreements by encouraging continued negotiations before considering parties at an impasse. It requires the debtor to fulfill certain requirements before approval for rejection, including providing information to the representative and bargaining in good faith. There is ambiguity in the wording regarding the court's evaluation of representative's proposals as alternatives to the current CBA or simply to determine if they meet requirements. The bill does not explicitly give the court discretion to substitute a counterproposal for the existing CBA, but courts have exercised similar powers in the past. Courts have the power to approve rejection of collective bargaining agreements, but inconsistencies in applying the law have led to the introduction of H.R. 3652. Allowing courts more discretion may increase inconsistencies and lead to \"forum shopping\" in bankruptcy filings. Proposed subsection (c)(1) could be seen as setting prerequisites for CBA rejection, potentially constraining negotiations by the representative. The burden on employees could be too great if economic relief to the employer is concentrated in a two-year period, prompting the need for concessions to lessen the immediate impact on employees' paychecks. To mitigate the impact on employees' paychecks, a representative may propose spreading financial concessions over three years instead of two. However, there may be reluctance to make such a proposal due to the risk of court approval of rejection. This creates a conflict between the labor group's interest in avoiding rejection of the CBA and preserving jobs through concessions for successful reorganization. Current law focuses on the representative's good cause for rejecting debtor proposals, with rejection serving as a tool to encourage negotiations. The proposed provisions under section 1113 may create an imbalance in motivation for negotiations between parties. The court can only approve rejection if further negotiations are unlikely to produce a mutually satisfactory agreement. Bankruptcy courts do not currently assess the prospects for an eventual agreement between parties. The court must consider the impact of rejecting a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) on the labor group, including the possibility of a strike that could put the company out of business. Reorganization in bankruptcy aims to keep the company operating rather than liquidating, but if the company cannot survive under the existing CBA, liquidation may be necessary, potentially leaving all creditors in a worse position. The court must consider the impact on all subsidiaries and affiliates of the debtor company, including foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, when evaluating the debtor's proposed modifications. The court is also required to examine the history of financial concessions made by the labor group within twenty-four months prior to the bankruptcy filing. This aggregation of concessions may not affect whether the proposed modifications meet the requirements of the law, but it will impact the evaluation process. H.R. 3652 proposes restrictions on the court's discretion in approving rejection of labor group burdens during bankruptcy proceedings. If the debtor has provided incentives to insiders or senior management before the case, there is a presumption of burdening the labor group. Failure to rebut this presumption may result in rejection of the debtor's proposal. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 restricted key employee retention plans, leading to a shift towards incentive payments for managers. Some incentive pay schemes have been rejected as retention bonuses, while others have been upheld. In 2006, bills were introduced to limit incentive bonuses similar to retention pay restrictions, but were not passed by Congress. These provisions are included in H.R. 3652. The provisions of bills introduced in the 109th Congress to restrict incentive bonuses similar to retention pay were not passed, but are included in H.R. 3652. This bill aims to extend restrictions on retention pay to incentive and performance bonuses, potentially limiting court flexibility in approving rejection of a collective bargaining agreement with incentive pay. The bill aims to extend restrictions on incentive and performance bonuses, potentially limiting court flexibility in approving rejection of a collective bargaining agreement with incentive pay, which could impact a debtor company's ability to successfully reorganize. The provision raises concerns about the debtor's ability to retain essential employees and the risk of liquidation instead of reorganization. H.R. 3652 proposes extending the notice period for a hearing on rejecting a collective bargaining agreement from fourteen to twenty-one days. This change may unintentionally remove the requirement for an early hearing, allowing more time for consideration. The bill proposes extending the notice period for a rejection hearing on a collective bargaining agreement, limiting participation to only the debtor and authorized representative. It aims to streamline the hearing process by eliminating consideration of other parties' concerns and encourages continuing negotiations without a statutory deadline. The bill proposes no changes to the current section allowing courts to approve interim modifications to a collective bargaining agreement. However, the addition of a new provision may lead to reduced court approval of modifications, potentially resulting in liquidations instead of reorganizations. H.R. 3652 also includes a provision regarding allowed administrative claims. The bill proposes adding a provision regarding allowed administrative claims, requiring full payment of claims under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113. It also defines rejection of a collective bargaining agreement as a breach, addressing money damages and the right to strike for affected employees. This could impact court-approved modifications to CBAs and potentially lead to liquidations over reorganizations. In Northwest Airlines Corporation v. Association of Flight Attendants, rejection of a collective bargaining agreement was characterized as an abrogation under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113, terminating the CBA provisions and allowing court-approved substitutions. This differs from a breach, which would have a remedy. The court contrasted rejection effects under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365 and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113, suggesting a potential legislative impact on rejection outcomes. The court in Northwest Airlines case distinguished between contract rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365 and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113, stating that the latter allows more than non-performance. It implies that rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 is an abrogation without liability for damages. Rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(g) is treated as a breach with the same effect as any other contract, but damages are excluded from limitations under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(7). The bankruptcy code distinguishes between contract rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365 and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113. Rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 implies abrogation without liability for damages, while rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(g) is treated as a breach with excluded damages. Section 502(b)(7) limits damages for termination of employment contracts, and H.R. 3652 excludes damages for rejected CBAs from this limitation. The proposed bill aims to define administrative expenses to include payments required under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113 before the reorganization plan is confirmed. Proposed subsection (g) does not mandate payment of breach damages before the confirmation date, raising questions about their treatment as administrative expenses or nonpriority claims in bankruptcy. If treated as unsecured claims, the reorganization plan could provide for partial payment, offering some economic benefit to the company. Labor groups' self-help in bankruptcy can include strikes, but the right to strike depends on whether they are covered by the RLA or NLRA. NLRA-covered groups can strike even if the CBA had a \"no strike\" clause, as it becomes void after rejection. RLA-covered airline workers must continue negotiating even after rejection, leading to injunctions against strikes in recent cases. H.R. 3652 proposes changes to current bankruptcy laws regarding labor groups' right to strike after rejection of a CBA. The bill would allow all labor groups, including those under the RLA, to strike when a CBA is rejected or interim modifications are approved by the court. This could potentially harm distressed companies as strikes could be detrimental to their economic situation. The proposed subsection in H.R. 3652 would preempt all other laws regarding labor groups' right to strike after court-approved interim modifications. It would allow representatives to request modifications to CBAs if the debtor's financial condition improves, ensuring that changes can be made based on new circumstances. H.R. 3652 proposes adding a subsection to allow arbitration instead of a court hearing for rejection of a CBA, if requested by the authorized representative. This could help parties reach a mutually satisfying agreement and reduce the demand on court resources. Only the authorized representative can make the arbitration request. The bill proposes arbitration as an alternative to court hearings for rejecting a CBA, if requested by the authorized representative. This could facilitate reaching a compromise and lessen the burden on court resources. The debtor cannot request arbitration, and the court cannot order it without a request. However, using arbitration may prolong the resolution process. The proposed changes eliminate current deadlines for court hearings on rejection requests. The bill does not specify who will bear the cost of arbitration. The bill proposes adding subsection (j) to allow reimbursement of costs and fees for the authorized representative in arbitration proceedings. These reimbursable costs would be considered administrative expenses and must be paid in full in the reorganization plan. This provision aims to expedite negotiations and make proposals more flexible for debtors. The bill aims to expedite negotiations and make proposals more flexible for debtors, potentially leading to shorter negotiations or more liquidations if administrative expenses increase. It requires the debtor and authorized representative to meet to determine the effects on the labor group in cases involving selling or ceasing business operations. Accrued obligations not assumed in a sale transaction would be treated as administrative expenses. The bill aims to revise the process for rejection of CBAs in bankruptcy cases to address inequities faced by employees and retirees. It proposes to treat assumption of CBAs like other executory contracts and modify expenses for employees to aid successful reorganization. Section 1113 currently provides labor groups with protection. The proposed revisions to section 1113 in bankruptcy cases aim to give labor groups a greater role in determining the feasibility of reorganization. Labor groups can request arbitration instead of a court hearing to approve rejection of a CBA, and may obtain future relief without bargaining with the company. The bill also extends the right to strike to all labor groups when a CBA is modified or rejected. The bill proposes changes to chapter 11 in bankruptcy cases, giving labor groups more say in reorganization feasibility. It allows labor groups to request arbitration for CBA rejection and extends the right to strike in such cases. Companies in financial distress may find the proposed changes too rigid, leading them to seek alternatives to bankruptcy."
