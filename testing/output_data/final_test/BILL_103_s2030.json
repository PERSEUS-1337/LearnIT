    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business Investment and Growth Act\" and includes a provision for the maximum small business tax rate. The \"Small Business Investment and Growth Act\" includes a provision for a maximum small business tax rate, limiting the tax imposed on taxable small business income to a maximum of 31 percent. The \"Small Business Investment and Growth Act\" sets a maximum tax rate of 31 percent on taxable small business income, defined as the least of the taxpayer's taxable income from active business participation, net earnings from self-employment, or a specified dollar amount. The tax law allows for a maximum tax rate of 31 percent on taxable small business income, which is determined by the taxpayer's taxable income from active business participation, net earnings from self-employment, or a specified dollar amount. An S corporation is treated as a partnership for determining net earnings from self-employment, and a qualified retained earnings account is established by a trade or business for cash additions. Qualified retained earnings account distributions must be qualified distributions used for business expenses or tax payments. Nonqualified distributions are subject to additional tax. Nonqualified distributions from a qualified retained earnings account are subject to additional tax. The tax imposed for the taxable year will be increased if a nonqualified distribution is made. The additional tax on nonqualified distributions is calculated based on the taxpayer's share of the distribution and the difference between the highest tax rate and 31 percent. The taxpayer's pro rata share of previous distributions from additions to the account for the same taxable year exceeding $135,000 triggers the tax imposed by section 1401(b). Distributions from the qualified retained earnings account are treated on a first-in, first-out basis. The tax described in subparagraph (B)(ii) is treated as a tax imposed by section 1401(b) for health insurance. The term 'eligible small business' refers to a sole proprietorship, partnership, or S corporation that qualifies as a small business concern. The taxpayer can elect to determine eligibility based on the average number of employees or gross receipts over the previous three taxable years. The subsection applies to taxable years with a tax rate exceeding 31 percent. The Secretary will create regulations to prevent mischaracterization of distributions. Section 3121(a) is amended to exclude certain small business income from HI tax. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992, and includes a new paragraph (22) for taxable small business income exceeding $135,000."
