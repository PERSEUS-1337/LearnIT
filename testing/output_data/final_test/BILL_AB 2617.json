    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3.8 of the Water Code aims to promote water-resilient communities by identifying cost-effective water conservation measures that can achieve significant reductions in water use while producing net environmental benefits. Adverse environmental impacts, including those related to climate change and stormwater runoff, are considered in this chapter. Evapotranspiration is defined as the loss of water from the soil due to evaporation and transpiration from plants. By December 1, 2017, the department, in consultation with various experts, shall develop a report on efficient consumer appliances, landscape systems, and turfgrass definitions. The department will analyze costs and benefits of water efficiency incentives for measures like turfgrass replacement, conservation-based irrigation technology, graywater infrastructure, and rebates for efficient appliances and landscape systems. The department will issue a final report by July 1, 2018, containing recommendations for public entities to achieve water-resilient communities through cost-effective water efficiency measures. This includes incentives like rebates for efficient appliances and landscape systems. The Public Resources Code aims to identify and recommend cost-effective water efficiency measures to reduce water use and provide net environmental benefits. Definitions include evapotranspiration, highly efficient consumer appliances and landscape systems, public entities, and turfgrass. The Public Resources Code requires the commission to develop a report analyzing the costs and benefits of water efficiency measures, including impacts on climate change and stormwater runoff, in consultation with experts and water agencies by December 1, 2017. The Public Resources Code mandates the commission to analyze water efficiency measures' costs and benefits, including impacts on climate change and stormwater runoff. The commission must issue a final report by July 1, 2018, identifying cost-effective incentives for water efficiency measures and potential adverse environmental impacts. The report will also outline recommendations for voluntary water efficiency measures. Recommendations for public entities to prioritize cost-effective incentives for water efficiency measures, analysis of potential adverse environmental impacts, and projected benefits of voluntary water efficiency measures."
