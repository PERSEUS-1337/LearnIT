    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coordinate to Educate Act.\" The Congress finds that many children face social and economic challenges that hinder their academic success, including inadequate nutrition, health care, and living conditions, as well as exposure to violence and abuse. Additionally, a significant number of children come from single-parent or dual-working parent households. Services for at-risk students are often fragmented, inconvenient, expensive, overregulated, ineffective, and duplicative, lacking coordination and accessibility for families and children in need. Service providers like teachers and social workers face bureaucratic obstacles in providing necessary support. Coordination and integration of services for at-risk students, including health care and child care providers, juvenile justice workers, and others, offer cost-effective solutions by reducing duplication, improving service quality, and emphasizing prevention and early intervention to break the cycle of academic failure and low income. The Act aims to establish a grant program for local education agencies to enhance students' educational performance by removing barriers to learning, coordinating support services, increasing parental involvement, and focusing on prevention. The Act aims to establish a grant program for local education agencies to enhance students' educational performance by focusing on prevention and early intervention strategies to address student needs and ensure they are ready to learn in the classroom. The Secretary of Education is authorized to provide grants to local education agencies for coordinated service programs. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a local educational agency must plan to collaborate with health and social service agencies to develop a program of school-linked integrated services or demonstrate a need for expanding coordinated services. Grants can be up to 3 years in duration, contingent on showing progress towards a self-sufficient coordinated service program. Applications must identify the need for coordinated services among students. The curr_chunk discusses the formation of a collaborative group involving representatives from various sectors to provide coordinated services for students. The objectives of the collaboration and performance measurements are also highlighted. Grants awarded under this section are to be used for regular meetings, identifying barriers to learning, and addressing external factors affecting students. The curr_chunk focuses on assessing barriers to learning such as abuse, poor nutrition, and inadequate housing. It also aims to evaluate existing social service programs, funding sources, and the feasibility of a sliding scale fee for services. Additionally, it aims to develop an interagency service delivery plan to coordinate resources at federal, state, and local levels. The curr_chunk outlines a plan for coordinating regulations, eligibility requirements, and service delivery at federal, state, and local levels. It also includes a case management system and a goal of achieving self-sufficiency within 2 years without using funds from the Act. The curr_chunk focuses on implementation grants.
