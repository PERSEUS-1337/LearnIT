    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1269 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to allow automatic eligibility for benefits if training is authorized by specific federal acts. The individual is a participant in the CalWORKs program and has a contract with the county welfare department for education or training. The individual must be enrolled in a certified training program or be a public school teacher in a credential preparation program approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing for additional certification in specific subjects. The changes to this provision will take effect on January 1, 2014. The individual must be enrolled in a certified training program or be a public school teacher in a credential preparation program approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing for additional certification in specific subjects. Any unemployed individual receiving unemployment compensation benefits who applies for potential eligibility for benefits under this article by the 16th week of receiving benefits is entitled to a training extension if necessary to complete approved training. The training extension provides the claimant with up to 52 times the weekly benefit of the parent unemployment compensation claim, subject to reductions including the maximum benefit award on the parent claim and benefits from other unemployment claims or state/federal laws. This applies to individuals enrolled in approved training programs or credential preparation programs for teachers. The parent unemployment compensation claim is the claim in existence when the claimant is determined eligible for benefits. Benefits under this section have limitations, including remaining eligible for all potentially payable weeks and filing any entitled claims to maintain eligibility. Section 1272 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended. Section 1272 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to allow unemployed individuals in training or retraining to receive benefits if they are potentially eligible and enrolled in a course. The director is required to report annually on the department's fraud deterrence and detection activities to specific committees. Additionally, a report must be submitted every even-numbered year to various entities detailing the department's activities as per the Unemployment Insurance Code. The department must provide a 10-year strategic information technology plan outlining long-term goals and strategies to support its business mission and improve business processes using IT. Provide a tactical information plan for specific automation and infrastructure projects to be completed within three years. Include project descriptions, scope, alignment with the strategic plan, relationship to other projects, development priority, estimated costs and benefits, service improvements, personnel and operating cost reductions for automation projects, and plans for utilizing savings. This plan does not replace existing reports submitted to the California Department of Technology. Section 4903 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to require the director to submit the report to the California Department of Technology for review and comments 30 days before its release. The Department will assess if the report meets requirements, aligns with the strategic plan, and if costs and benefits are consistent with approved projects or annual plans."
