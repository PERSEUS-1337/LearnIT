    "content": "The \"Farm, Fishing, and Ranch Risk Management Act\" is cited as the short title of the Act. It includes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, introducing Farm, Fishing, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts under section 468C. In eligible farming businesses or commercial fishing, individuals can deduct cash payments made to a FFARRM Account. Contributions are limited to 20% of taxable income, and distributions cannot be used for new fishing purchases. The Secretary of Commerce will enforce regulations to prevent the use of FFARRM Account funds for purchasing new fishing vessels or adding capacity to fisheries. Eligible farming businesses and commercial fishing activities can deduct cash payments to a FFARRM Account, with restrictions on usage for new fishing purchases. The FFARRM Account is a trust created for the exclusive benefit of the taxpayer, with restrictions on contributions and trustee requirements. The FFARRM Account trust must meet specific requirements, including having assets of cash or interest-bearing obligations, distributing all income to the grantor, and not commingling assets with other property. The grantor is treated as the owner of the account for tax purposes. In general, any amount distributed from a FFARRM Account during the taxable year is included in the taxpayer's gross income. This includes deemed distributions under specific circumstances outlined in the subsections. Special rules apply to distributions from a FFARRM Account, with exceptions for certain types of distributions and limitations on contributions. Additionally, there is a tax on deposits not distributed within 5 years. If there is a nonqualified balance in any FFARRM Account at the end of a taxable year, an amount equal to the balance is deemed distributed and the taxpayer's tax is increased by 10 percent of the deemed distribution. This does not apply if the nonqualified balance is distributed to the taxpayer before the tax return filing deadline for that year. The chapter imposes rules for nonqualified balances in FFARRM Accounts, defining them as balances from deposits made before the 4th preceding taxable year. Distributions are made in the order of deposit, with a 10 percent tax increase for nonqualified balances not distributed before the tax return deadline. The taxpayer will be deemed to have distributed the balance in the FFARRM Account if not engaged in farming or fishing for 2 consecutive taxable years. Rules similar to those for treatment on death and loss of exemption apply. For FFARRM Accounts, payments are deemed made on the last day of the taxable year if made on or before the tax return filing due date. The term 'individual' excludes estates and trusts. The definition of 'individual' excludes estates and trusts. The deduction for self-employment tax cannot be taken into account for determining net earnings from self-employment. Trustees of FFARRM Accounts must report contributions, distributions, and other matters to the Secretary and the account beneficiary. Excess contributions may be subject to a tax under section 4973. The amendment to section 4973 includes the addition of a FFARRM Account as a type of account subject to excess contribution tax. Excess contributions to FFARRM Accounts are defined as contributions exceeding the allowable amount under section 468C(b). The amendment to section 4973 adds the FFARRM Account as subject to excess contribution tax, with contributions exceeding the allowable amount under section 468C(b) treated as not contributed. The amendment to section 4973 adds the FFARRM Account to excess contribution tax, with contributions exceeding the allowable amount under section 468C(b) treated as not contributed. The table of sections for chapter 43 is amended by striking the item relating to section 4973 and inserting a new item. The amendment to section 4973 exempts FFARRM Accounts from the tax on prohibited transactions under section 4975 if the account ceases to be a FFARRM Account as per section 468C(f)(3)(A). The amendment to section 4975 exempts FFARRM Accounts from prohibited transaction taxes. Section 6693(a)(2) is also amended to include reporting requirements for FFARRM Accounts. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendments to section 468C establish Farm, Fishing, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts. These changes will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001."
