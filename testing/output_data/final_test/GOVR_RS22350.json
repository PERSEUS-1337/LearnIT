    "content": "The Railroad Retirement Board administers retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness insurance for railroad workers and their families. Lifelong railroad workers receive railroad retirement benefits instead of Social Security benefits. The number of railroad workers has been declining since the 1950s, with recent increases in employment after reaching a low in 2010. Railroad employment peaked in April 2015 at 253,000 workers, then declined to 221,000 workers by FY2017. The total beneficiaries under RRA and RUIA decreased from 623,000 in FY2008 to 574,000 in FY2017. Benefit payments increased from $10.1 billion to $12.6 billion during the same period. In FY2017, the RRB paid $12.5 billion in benefits to 548,000 beneficiaries. Additionally, $105.4 million in unemployment and sickness benefits were paid to 28,000 claimants. This report explains the programs under RRA and RUIA, including financing, eligibility rules, benefits available, and how railroad retirement relates to the Social Security system. The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families. In December 2017, there were 526,100 beneficiaries receiving an average monthly benefit of $1,986, funded mainly by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). This program has seen a decline in beneficiaries from 672,400 in 2001, possibly due to the decrease in railroad employment over the past five decades. The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) provides retirement, survivor, and disability benefits for railroad workers and their families, funded mainly by payroll taxes, financial interchanges from Social Security, and transfers from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). In FY2017, payroll taxes provided 47.0% of gross RRA funding, with Tier I and Tier II taxes being the main sources. Tier I tax is the same as the Social Security payroll tax, while Tier II tax varies annually based on system balances and costs. The Tier II tax rates are 13.1% for employers and 4.9% for employees on earnings up to $98,700. These taxes finance Tier II benefits and supplemental annuities. Tier I payroll taxes are deposited in the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account (SSEBA) and contribute to the financial interchange transfers between the railroad retirement and Social Security systems. The financial interchange with Social Security provided 32.6% of gross RRA funding in FY2017. The National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT) holds Tier II tax revenues not needed for current benefits, investing in government securities and private equities. NRRIT transfers contribute 14.3% of gross RRA funding. The Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001 established NRRIT to manage assets similar to private-sector pension plans. The Railroad Retirement System's assets are invested in government securities and private equities. Tier II tax rates adjust automatically to maintain a balance for benefits and expenses. Workers need 10 years of covered railroad work or 5 years after 1995 for insurance. Family members of insured railroad workers may receive benefits. An insured railroad worker's family may receive railroad retirement benefits, with payments distributed in various annuities categories. Tier I annuities are similar to Social Security benefits but can be more generous in certain situations, such as for workers with 30 years of covered railroad work at age 60. At age 60, railroad workers with 30 years of covered railroad work may receive unreduced retirement annuities. Full retirement age (FRA) is gradually increasing from 65 to 67 for Social Security and railroad retirement beneficiaries. Workers with fewer than 30 years of service may receive reduced annuities starting at age 62. Tier I benefit reductions for early retirement are similar to Social Security. Delaying retirement past FRA increases Tier I annuities by a certain percentage each month up to age 70. The Social Security system provides an increase through Delayed Retirement Credits. Social Security benefits are subtracted from Tier I annuities, and beneficiaries insured by both systems receive a single check from the RRB. Railroad retirement annuities may be reduced for certain pensions earned through government work not covered by Social Security. Tier I benefits are reduced for early retirees who continue to work for a nonrailroad employer. Tier I benefits increase annually with a cost-of-living adjustment. Tier II retirement annuities are paid to railroad workers based on their covered railroad service. The annuities are calculated as seven-tenths of 1% of the employee's average monthly earnings in the 60 highest-earning months, multiplied by the total years of railroad service. These annuities increase annually by 32.5% of the Social Security COLA and are not reduced if the worker receives Social Security benefits or a non-Social Security government pension. However, if a retiree works for a nonrailroad employer while receiving benefits, Tier II annuities are reduced by $1 for every $2 earned. Tier II annuities are reduced by $1 for every $2 earned while receiving retirement benefits, capped at 50% of the Tier II annuity. There is no cap to the earnings-related reduction in railroad Tier I or Social Security benefits. The reduction applies to all Tier II beneficiaries regardless of age, unlike railroad Tier I and Social Security benefits which only apply until the beneficiary reaches FRA. Tier II payroll taxes also fund a supplemental annuity program for certain eligible employees. In 1974, the two-tier railroad retirement benefit structure was established, affecting both railroad retirement and Social Security. Supplemental annuities and vested dual benefits are not adjusted for cost of living changes during retirement. Disability annuities are available for disabled railroad workers, determined by medical evidence. Totally and permanently disabled workers with at least 10 years of service may be eligible for Tier I benefits at any age. Disabled workers may also receive Tier II benefits at age 62 with 10 or more years of service. Workers can receive Tier II benefits at age 62 with 10 or more years of service. Occupational disability annuities are payable to permanently disabled workers aged 60 with 10 years of service (or any age with 20 years of service) in the railroad industry. A five-month waiting period is required for disability annuities. Benefits are suspended if the worker is employed in a covered railroad job or earns above a certain amount. Spouses may also be eligible for benefits when the worker collects a railroad retirement or disability annuity. A spouse of a worker collecting a railroad retirement or disability annuity may be eligible for a spousal annuity equal to or greater than what they would have received if the worker's railroad work was covered by Social Security. The spouse must reach the same minimum age as the worker, which is either 60 or 62 depending on years of service. They can also qualify if they care for the worker's child under 18. The marriage must have lasted at least one year before applying for the spousal annuity. The spouse receives 50% of the worker's Tier I benefit or a Social Security benefit based on their own earnings. Spouses of retired or disabled railroad workers may be eligible for spousal annuities, receiving 50% of the worker's Tier I benefit before reductions. Divorced spouses must have been married for at least 10 years, be at least 62 years old, and not currently married. Spousal annuities may be reduced for government pension earnings and are subject to reductions based on the worker's and spouse's earnings. After the worker's death, surviving spouses, former spouses, children, and other dependents may be eligible to receive survivor annuities, which are paid in addition to any private life insurance offered by railroad employers. Railroad survivor annuities are generally higher than comparable Social Security benefits because railroad workers' families may be entitled to Tier II annuities as well as Tier I annuities. In cases where no monthly survivor annuities are paid, a lump-sum payment may be made. Surviving spouses of deceased railroad workers may be eligible for survivor annuities, including 100% of the worker's Tier I annuity and up to 100% of the worker's Tier II annuity. Widows and widowers as young as 60 (or 50 if disabled) can receive reduced survivor annuities. A widow(er) must have been married to the deceased worker for at least nine months to qualify. Those caring for a deceased worker's child under 18 may receive a survivor annuity equal to 75% of the worker's Tier I annuity. Survivor annuities may be payable to surviving divorced spouses or remarried widow(er)s who meet specific requirements, such as being married to the deceased worker for at least 10 years. Benefits are limited to Social Security amounts and are available to unmarried surviving divorced spouses caring for the deceased worker's child under 16 or disabled. Railroad workers' children may also receive survivor annuities if they are unmarried and under 18 (or 19 if still in high school), or disabled before the age of 22. Disabled adult children may qualify for railroad retirement benefits if their disability began before the age of 22. They can receive a percentage of the worker's Tier I and Tier II annuity. Additionally, if a worker's parent was dependent on them for at least half of their support, the parent may receive a higher percentage of the worker's annuity after reaching age 60. Survivor benefits are subject to reductions based on the survivor's own railroad retirement benefits and other government pensions. A family maximum applies to survivor benefits when three or more survivors receive benefits on a worker's record. Table 1 provides data on railroad retirement, survivor, and disability annuities as of June 2018. Railroad workers may qualify for daily unemployment and sickness benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Sickness benefits are for temporary periods and workers cannot earn money while receiving them. Figure 3 shows the monthly number of beneficiaries with unemployment and sickness benefits from January 2002 to July 2018, with an increase in unemployment insurance beneficiaries over time. The number of unemployment insurance beneficiaries increased significantly during and after the 2007-2009 economic recession. Railroad unemployment and sickness benefits are funded by railroad employers' payroll taxes based on employees' earnings. Employer tax rates vary depending on past unemployment rates and sickness claims. The employer tax rate for 2018 ranges from 2.2% to 12.0% on the first $1,560 of each employee's monthly earnings, with excess funds deposited in the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account. During FY2017, payroll tax contributions from railroad employers totaled $126.4 million, with interest income of about $4 million. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account receives interest from deposits in U.S. government securities. Employers may pay a surcharge if the account falls below a certain threshold, which is added to their tax rate. The maximum tax rate is 12.0%, but can increase to 12.5% with a 3.5% surcharge. Surcharge rates have varied from 1.5% to 2.5% in recent years. Eligibility for benefits is based on recent railroad service and earnings. Railroad workers are eligible for sickness benefits based on recent railroad service and earnings. The annual benefit year starts on July 1, with a requirement of $3,862.50 in base year earnings in calendar year 2017. New workers need at least five months of covered railroad work in the base year. Unemployment benefits require readiness to work, with a maximum daily benefit of $77 and biweekly claim of $770. However, due to sequestration, these amounts are reduced by 6.2% until September 30, 2019. Railroad workers may receive benefits under the RUIA, Social Security Act, or other public programs. Unemployment and sickness beneficiaries can receive benefits for up to 26 weeks or until their earnings are exhausted. Those with 10 years of covered railroad service may qualify for extended benefits. RUIA benefits were $722.26 in June 2018. Workers applying for unemployment benefits are enrolled in a job placement service."
