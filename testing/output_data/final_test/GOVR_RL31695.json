    "content": "The publication of scientific research results that could be exploited by terrorist groups has prompted a reevaluation of the method used to control such information. Policymakers are considering changes to current government policies on the dissemination of federally funded research to balance national security concerns with the needs of the scientific community. Examples of research results that raised security concerns are discussed, along with current federal policies on information control mechanisms. Control mechanisms and federal policy on dissemination of research results are discussed, including recent policy actions and responses from professional societies and publishers. The advantages and disadvantages of potential policy actions on classification and controls over federally funded research publication are described. The US has a policy of identifying research areas requiring information controls, especially related to weapon systems or nuclear technologies. In the 1970s, controls were developed on the export of advanced technologies, but basic science remained exempt. In the 1980s, efforts were made to restrict foreign access to potentially controlled technological information. In 1985, President Reagan emphasized the importance of openness in science for long-term security. President Reagan issued NSDD-189 to control dissemination of fundamental research results, impacting international science collaboration and export control regulations. Concerns about negative impacts on domestic business prosperity have led to attempts to lower trade barriers. The presence of foreign students and scientists in the US has increased education and training opportunities in basic skills. Since 2001, the United States has increased education and training opportunities in basic skills for foreign individuals, which may be transferred to their home countries. Concerns about scientific openness potentially aiding other nations or terrorist groups in developing weapons of mass destruction have resurfaced, particularly in areas like aerospace engineering, computer technology, and biology research related to biological weapons. The potential relevance of scientific openness to biological weapons of mass destruction has raised concerns. The effectiveness of using classification to limit research dissemination for national security is uncertain. In 2002, government agencies were instructed to assess inappropriate disclosure of information on weapons of mass destruction. The Department of Defense also proposed expanding information controls to basic and applied science research. In 2003, scientific societies developed self-regulatory mechanisms to address national security concerns regarding research publication. The National Academy of Sciences discussed potential inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information in life sciences publications. In 2004, the National Research Council recommended oversight structures for biotechnology research in select areas of concern. The Department of Health and Human Services established the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to provide guidance on biosecurity oversight of dual-use research. Competing proposals for controlling federally funded research range from strict information control to self-regulation by scientists or government oversight. Some suggest a new category of \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information to protect potentially contentious research results. The potential impact of creating a new category of \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information to protect research results raises concerns and debate. There is a trade-off between scientific progress and security concerns, as openness in the scientific enterprise allows for collaboration but also poses risks to national security. The balance between economic prosperity from technological advances and the need for security has become more critical since September 11, 2001. The publication of scientific advances raises concerns about national security post-9/11. Policymakers debate the level of risk and potential mechanisms to control federally funded research results. Examples like the genetically modified mousepox virus highlight the potential risks of information aiding terrorist groups in developing weapons of mass destruction. The publication of scientific advances post-9/11 raises concerns about national security. Examples like the genetically modified mousepox virus and the assembly of functional poliovirus from chemical sequences highlight the potential risks of information aiding terrorist groups in developing weapons of mass destruction. In October 2001, the full genomes of Yersinia pestis, Coxiella burnetii, and Bacillus anthracis were published in scientific journals, raising concerns about the potential risks of releasing genomic information for virulent diseases. Researchers have identified key proteins in Variola major, the virus causing smallpox, that contribute to its high virulence. Studies on Bacillus anthracis strains have revealed potential causes of enhanced virulence and antibiotic resistance. Concerns have been raised about openly publishing information that could threaten national security. Bioethicist Arthur Caplan and Stewart Simonson express concerns about the potential misuse of knowledge in medicine and biology. Caplan warns that information could be used for terror, while Simonson regrets the publication of a paper on vulnerabilities in the milk supply chain. The Academy's decision on research publication could have serious consequences, with historical examples showing how restrictions were placed on scientific information during times of war, such as in the case of nuclear fission research during World War II. The federal government has restricted the transfer of scientific information in various fields, including nuclear power and genetic engineering. Prior to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, nuclear energy activities were protected by security and secrecy programs. Information related to atomic weapons and special nuclear material is considered classified, even if developed privately. Genetic engineering faced calls for regulation in the 1970s due to concerns over manipulating DNA and genetically engineered species. In 1975, a voluntary moratorium on genetically engineered species research was established at the Asilomar conference center in California. This led to a consensus statement on self-regulation, increased security measures, and containment requirements. The statement served as a basis for research rules by the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. The United States supported a policy of not restricting publication of federally supported research results, except for national security reasons. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan restated the policy that research results should remain unrestricted, except for national security reasons. Federal government agencies are responsible for determining if classification is necessary for research grants and contracts. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan reaffirmed the policy that research results should be unrestricted, except for national security reasons. Federal agencies are tasked with assessing the need for classification in research grants and contracts. NSDD-189 defines fundamental research as basic and applied research in science and engineering that is widely shared within the scientific community. This policy remains in effect for federally funded research. In response to the 2001 terrorist attacks, Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed the policy on export control affecting basic research. Executive branch agencies require prompt publication of agency-funded research results. For example, the National Science Foundation expects significant findings to be submitted for publication accurately reflecting contributors. The policy on authorship and data sharing for research funded by government agencies like the National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense emphasizes accurate authorship attribution and sharing of research results with the public and industry for commercialization. The policy of Naval Research encourages publication of research results in professional journals, especially for federally funded projects. Classified research is not openly published but shared only with those with clearance. Federal agencies control publication through classification, export regulations, and contract specifications. The policy of Naval Research encourages publication of research results in professional journals for federally funded projects. Universities debate conducting classified research on campus, with some choosing not to accept funding for such projects. For example, Duke University prohibits research involving classified information or results. Universities conducting classified research typically establish off-campus research facilities to handle classified materials. Examples include MIT and Johns Hopkins University. Some universities allow classified research on a case-by-case basis. Federal controls for private research include export control regulations by the Department of Commerce and arms trafficking regulations by the Department of State. Export control laws, such as ITAR and EAR, regulate the transfer of technology and technical information from the United States to other nations. ITAR focuses on armaments and military technologies, while EAR covers dual-use commercial goods. Private researchers may unknowingly fall under these regulations when conducting research in areas like aerospace technology or cryptography. Universities conducting basic research sometimes struggle to determine if their work is subject to EAR or ITAR restrictions. The research being performed at the institution falls under EAR or ITAR restrictions, with exemptions for \"fundamental research\" defined as basic and applied research in science and engineering that is published and shared broadly within the scientific community. University research may not be considered fundamental if there are restrictions on publication or if the research is funded by the U.S. Government with specific access controls. Universities often rely on the fundamental research exclusion to exempt their research. Universities often rely on the fundamental research exclusion to exempt their research from export control regulations. If research is not exempt, export licensing is required, and controls on information sharing with foreigners must be implemented. Failure to obtain a license can lead to prosecution and fines. The concept of a \"deemed export,\" where information is shared with foreign nationals without a license, poses challenges for universities. This can be problematic for foreign students and researchers who may be exposed to controlled technology. In some cases, export control regulations have intersected with scientific research. In the 1980s, research papers were removed from a scientific convention due to restrictions on foreign nationals attending. Some universities face challenges in collaborating with foreign researchers, such as transferring technologies developed by foreign graduate students to industry. The Export Administration Act of 1979 has not been reauthorized, leading President George W. Bush to invoke the International Economic Emergency Powers Act for export regulation. Penalties for violating this act are less severe compared to the Export Administration Act. The USA PATRIOT Act imposes penalties for violating restrictions on certain foreign nationals accessing select agent information. Universities are required to enhance security measures for select agents, and sites with select agents must maintain an inventory and register with relevant government departments. Universities navigate dual roles of education and compliance with export regulations by relying on the fundamental research exclusion. Some federal funding agencies impose publication restrictions on research contracts with potential defense applications or sensitive material. These restrictions are not applied to entire research fields but are specific to certain projects. University administrators have expressed unease about prepublication review clauses in research contracts, with Duke University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology renegotiating or rejecting contracts with such clauses. Concerns have been raised within the academic community about potential violations of NSDD-189, although the Director of OSTP has defended the Department of Defense's use of prepublication clauses. The Department of Defense's use of prepublication clauses in contracts has been defended by Dr. Marburger. The academic community submitted a report to OSTP documenting 103 prepublication clauses presented to 20 universities. Concerns exist that these clauses could impact the fundamental research exemption and export control regulations. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted a reevaluation of government-owned information, leading to many agencies reassessing public access to information. Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, government agencies reevaluated public access to information. A memorandum known as the \"Card memo\" cautioned against disclosing information that could aid in weapons of mass destruction development. It also emphasized the protection of \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information related to homeland security. The extent of this category was not clearly defined in the memo. The memo provides guidance on protecting \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information, emphasizing the need to balance protection with the exchange of scientific and technical information. Different agencies have varying definitions of this category, with criteria for exemption from public disclosure under certain laws. The Department of Defense maintains controlled, unclassified information related to national security and government interests, including defense, foreign relations, and various governmental matters. The Department of State's \"sensitive, but unclassified\" category is similar to For Official Use Only, with the same criteria for access. The Department of Defense defines For Official Use Only as unclassified information exempt from public release under FOIA. Scientists debate balancing scientific openness with national security, some prioritizing research publication over risks, while others advocate for selective publication and security assessment by stakeholders. The American Society for Microbiology requires all information necessary for experiment reproduction to be included in submissions for publication, despite authors' requests to omit certain details. The American Society for Microbiology emphasizes the importance of including all materials and methods in scientific publications to ensure independent reproducibility and prevent errors. They have established policy guidelines for reviewers and editors to address concerns about inappropriate use of scientific information. The American Society of Microbiology's guidelines for publishing potentially contentious research were tested with a manuscript in March 2003. Editors requested modifications to address security concerns. The National Academies recommended maintaining current classification practices for sensitive research results to preserve scientific creativity and national security. The National Academy of Sciences held a meeting on \"Scientific Openness and National Security\" in 2003 to discuss the debate on scientific publication and national security. Dr. Marburger emphasized the importance of clear distinctions in open publication and suggested classifying research before awarding federal grants. Dr. Penrose Albright, from the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Homeland Security, emphasized the need for clear criteria to distinguish dangerous research in the field of bioterrorism. Following a meeting by the National Academies, stakeholders called for increased vigilance in reviewing potentially risky research for publication. The joint statement emphasized vigilance and personal responsibility in handling potentially dangerous research for publication in scientific journals like Science, Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, and Nature. It aimed to address security issues while maintaining the integrity of the publishing process. The American Association for the Advancement of Science has also implemented a formal policy on dealing with risky reports. Consensus was not reached on potential solutions at the National Academies' meeting. At the National Academies' meeting, attendees discussed the need for dialogue between the scientific and security communities to address concerns. A two-year Roundtable on Scientific Communication and National Security was convened to develop solutions, leading to the formation of a Commission on Scientific Communication and National Security. The Commission recommended maintaining NSDD-189 and establishing mechanisms for compliance with regulations on scientific dissemination. The National Academies are exploring research with homeland security impact and have released reports recommending continued policies like NSDD-189. They suggest reviewing proposed research in seven security-sensitive areas before conducting it. The National Academies recommend reviewing research in security-sensitive areas before conducting it, with the institutional biosafety committee overseeing research. Response to the proposal has been mixed, with some supporting the balance of self-regulation and federal oversight, while others criticize it for not being legally binding. Critics point out limitations, such as informal dissemination of research results. The creation of an independent advisory body is suggested to analyze science and technology for future biological threats. Scientists are urged to adopt a culture of responsibility to prevent misuse of research results. The Homeland Security Act established the Department of Homeland Security to oversee research and development for homeland security. The Science and Technology directorate under the Department of Homeland Security is responsible for researching, developing, and deploying countermeasures for biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological threats. The Homeland Security Act outlines how homeland security information should be handled, including the classification of research results. The President is tasked with implementing procedures to safeguard sensitive but unclassified homeland security information across all federal agencies. Congress conducts oversight through hearings on homeland security. The Department of Homeland Security is facing issues with finalizing policies related to extramural scientific research. There is a need for an explicit policy on the publication of sensitive but unclassified information. Secretary Ridge mentioned upholding NSDD-189 but did not have a plan for handling contentious research results. The Department of Homeland Security is grappling with finalizing policies for extramural scientific research, particularly regarding the publication of sensitive but unclassified information. Under Secretary McQueary suggested that scientific organizations establish their own criteria for prepublication review, while the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency follows a Department of Defense model for announcements. The Department of Homeland Security is working on policies for extramural scientific research, including the publication of sensitive information. The National Science Advisory Board for Biodefense was established by the Department of Health and Human Services to provide guidance on biosecurity oversight of dual-use research. The NSABB advises the Secretary of HHS, the Director of NIH, and other federal agencies involved in life sciences research. The National Science Advisory Board for Biodefense (NSABB) is composed of non-federal members appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide guidance on biosecurity oversight of dual-use research in life sciences. The NSABB is developing guidelines for federally funded research with security challenges and has advised on dual-use research and publication of scientific results. In October 2005, a research article was published in Science magazine reconstructing an influenza virus with gene sequences from the 1918 virus. The NSABB recommended publication with an editorial on biosecurity implications. Some praised the NSABB's role, while others criticized the review process. The NSABB's role in advising policymakers on publication of federally-funded research raises questions about regulation, national security, and the balance between scientific advancement and security. Key questions include whether there should be publication controls, how policy should be applied across federal agencies, and the government's authority over research results from private funding. The discussion revolves around the government's authority over research results from private funding, potential conflicts with the First Amendment, national security concerns in a global context, encouraging scientists to self-regulate, and oversight by Congress on extramural research funded by the Department of Homeland Security. Some advocate for maintaining the current system of using classification to block publication of federally-funded research results. Advocates of maintaining the current system of using classification for federally-funded research results argue that it should remain the federal government's policy to control research. They believe that adding key officials to the list of those authorized to classify information enhances the government's ability to identify what should be classified. They also emphasize the importance of clearly defining areas of restricted research and protecting them with strong barriers like classification. Advocates of maintaining the current system of using classification for research results argue that it is crucial to protect restricted research areas with strong barriers. Concerns include the impact of publication controls on science, potential migration of scientists to less contentious areas, and the importance of unimpeded flow of scientific information for national security. Dr. Paul Keim from Northern Arizona University highlighted the significance of releasing the Bacillus anthracis genome for developing high-resolution systems. Advocates for changing the current system argue that classification is insufficient to prevent dissemination of information that could harm national security. They believe that federally funded research results should be more closely monitored to avoid potential threats from terrorist groups. Some policymakers suggest changes in the classification system for federally funded research, especially in the field of microbiology. They argue that classifying basic biological research could enhance homeland security but may also restrict future applied research. Advocates believe that information published in scientific journals could undermine biodefense efforts. The interaction between the scientific and export communities regarding changes to export control regulations may influence policy approaches on the publication of potentially dangerous research results. Implementing export control regulations poses challenges to researchers, with concerns raised about deemed export provisions and their impact on the research process. Scientists have varying opinions on addressing concerns about inappropriate use of information in scientific journals. Some advocate for self-regulation through ethical agreements and oversight, citing the need for scientists to determine responsible science thresholds. The experience of the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee shows the need for adjusting regulations as science evolves. Possible mechanisms within self-regulation include institutional review boards to assess research results, especially in studies involving human subjects. Research involving human subjects is overseen by local institutional review boards, which have the authority to approve, modify, or disapprove research projects. These boards are not federal entities but play a crucial role in ensuring ethical standards are met. Additionally, there is a suggestion to establish review boards within research facilities to screen manuscripts before publication or to hold a conference to develop codes of conduct for the scientific community. A framework could be developed to identify sensitive research results and provide alternate dissemination routes. NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci supports the establishment of an oversight panel to determine the appropriateness of certain types of biomedical research. Dr. Stephen Morse endorses the idea of an Asilomar-like committee to address security concerns in research publication. Dr. Stephen Morse supports the idea of an Asilomar-like conference to address moral implications in scientific research. International cooperation is essential for a self-regulatory framework to be effective in controlling contentious research results. The scientific community faces challenges in reaching international consensus on issues like genetically modified foods and stem cell research. The National Research Council suggests self-regulatory measures for potentially controversial experiments. The National Research Council recommends self-regulatory measures for potentially controversial experiments, including review by institutional biosafety committees and referral to higher authorities if needed. The establishment of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is seen as fulfilling this role, but issues regarding its authority and scope remain unresolved. Journal editors' actions in handling sensitive research results could serve as models for publishing houses facing potential legislation or regulation. Advocates propose empowering journal editors to screen and reject research papers based on weapons potential to avoid new laws or regulations. Some success has been seen in modifying papers for ethical concerns, but there is debate within the publishing community about the effectiveness of editor-based oversight. Uncertainty remains on whether domestic publishers can develop a consensus protocol to prevent sensitive information from entering the public domain. The competitive nature of scientific publishing may allow foreign journals to legally publish prohibited material. The effectiveness of publisher-based policies in restricting contentious research dissemination is questioned. The National Research Council recommends a voluntary approach for journal editors to assess and publish potentially contentious manuscripts. The credibility of a system for biodefense research relies on sensitive, unclassified status and prepublication review of federally sponsored research. This standard would control access to research results, potentially through secure websites or professional societies. Opponents of disseminating sensitive, unclassified research material through secure websites or professional societies raise concerns about logistical difficulties in determining access eligibility, implementing labeling, and disseminating the information. The categorization of sensitive, unclassified information is not uniformly codified across federal scientific funding agencies, and some scientists or universities may choose not to participate in access eligibility determinations. Security reviews are criticized as potentially arbitrary, and the effectiveness of such a system is questioned. If prepublication review is federally based, concerns arise about the effectiveness and potential arbitrariness. The federal government funds a significant portion of research and development in the US, with 62% for basic research and 38% for applied research. There is a sentiment in the scientific community that all unclassified scientific results should be widely shared, including research materials and information for experiment reproduction. The Board on Life Sciences recommends unrestricted access to data and supporting materials for scientific papers. Universities are concerned that federal prepublication review could impact research exemptions under export control regulations. One suggestion is to categorize research with security implications at the funding stage rather than the publication stage. Potential remedies for federally funded research or new funding opportunities include prepublication review. Some universities have policies against federal funding requiring prepublication review, which may deter scientists from working in restricted research areas. This could decrease the pool of eligible scientists competing for funding, potentially lowering research quality. Determining sensitive results at the funding stage is suggested to address concerns about restricted access to research results. Determining sensitive results at the funding stage is challenging, as seen in the mousepox experiments. Suggestions include expanding the federal government's role in research oversight, with select researchers at specific facilities conducting potentially sensitive research. Dr. John Steinbruner proposed a Biological Research Security System with a national authority licensing qualified researchers and facilities. Some scientists argue that licensing researchers, facilities, or experiments could hinder scientific productivity. However, the registration of life scientists working with select agents shows some willingness for licensed research. Congress may oversee policies on publishing extramural research funded by the Department of Homeland Security. Further direction may be needed on whether to adopt an existing policy or create a new one, how to implement it, and potential security concerns. Additional oversight may focus on activities in the Department of Health. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) in the Department of Health and Human Services may impact federally funded research with broad recommendations. Congressional interest may focus on the impact, comprehensiveness, and enforcement of policies for manuscript submissions and national security concerns. The concerns of security officials and scientists regarding national security and scientific openness in reviewing research articles need to be addressed through a policy involving cooperation between the scientific and security communities. The success of a program controlling scientific research results may be measured by factors like economic costs and blocking terrorist group access to information."
