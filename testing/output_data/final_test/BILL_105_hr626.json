The Native Hawaiian Housing Assistance Act of 1997 aims to address unsafe housing conditions and the shortage of decent dwellings for lower-income families. It recognizes the unique historical and political relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians, affirming their right to local autonomy and self-governance. The authority of Congress under the Constitution of the United States includes legislating in matters affecting Native Hawaiians, as seen in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 and the admission of Hawaii into the Union in 1959. In 1959, the United States reaffirmed its special relationship with Native Hawaiians by transferring trust responsibility for Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawaii while retaining federal superintendence. The US also ceded title to public lands to the State of Hawaii. Congress has mandated that public lands formerly held by the United States be held \"in public trust\" for the betterment of Native Hawaiians, with Federal superintendence to enforce this trust. Native Hawaiians have been granted rights and privileges similar to American Indians and Alaska Natives under various acts. The special relationship between the United States and Native Hawaiians has been recognized and reaffirmed by Congress through various acts, including the authorization of mortgage loans for homes on Hawaiian Home Lands, Native Hawaiian representation on housing commissions, and inclusion in housing programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives.

The Native Hawaiian Housing and Infrastructure Assistance Program aims to address the housing needs of Native Hawaiians by providing them with Federal housing assistance similar to that available to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Native Hawaiians have the highest percentage of housing problems in the nation at 49%, compared to 44% for American Indian and Alaska Native households in tribal areas. Native Hawaiians have the worst housing conditions in Hawaii, with over 30% representing the state's homeless population. Among Native Hawaiians eligible for Hawaiian homelands, 95% are in need of housing.
