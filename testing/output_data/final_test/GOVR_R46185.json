    "content": "The U.S. Constitution assigns the House the duty to impeach federal officers for high crimes and misdemeanors, while the Senate conducts the trial and can convict with a two-thirds majority. The Senate has the sole power to try impeachments, with specific requirements such as an oath for Senators and limitations on punishments. In a presidential impeachment trial, the Chief Justice presides over the proceedings. The Senate has the sole power to conduct impeachment trials, with the Vice President or a Senator presiding. The Supreme Court ruled that the Senate determines its own trial procedures, with past precedent guiding decisions but allowing for unique processes in each trial. In the last 80 years, 5 full trials were conducted, with 4 involving federal judges. Trial committees, composed of an equal number of Senators from each party, were appointed by the Senate to hear evidence. The Senate lacks robust precedents for modern trials, especially without a committee. The only trial without a committee since 1936 was President Clinton's impeachment, showing tailored procedural decisions. This report summarizes Senate rules and past practices for federal impeachment trials. The Senate adopted impeachment rules in 1868 in anticipation of President Andrew Johnson's trial. The information in the report is based on congressional rules and precedents, providing an overview of procedures but should not be cited as an authority on congressional proceedings. Consultation with the Senate Parliamentarian is advised for the application of rules and precedents. The Senate adopted impeachment rules in 1868 in anticipation of President Andrew Johnson's trial. These rules were not the first regarding impeachment in the Senate, as previous rules were applied to specific individuals. The 1868 select committee recommended 25 rules for all impeachments, similar to those used in previous trials. The Senate adopted 25 rules for impeachment trials in 1868, focusing on preparation rather than trial proceedings. Some Senators believed decisions should be made during the trial. The lack of detail in the rules reflected the Senate's procedural nature in the 19th century. The Senate adopted rules for impeachment trials in 1868, with few changes since. In 1935, Rule XI was added to allow for trial committees. In 1974, rules were reviewed in anticipation of President Nixon's impeachment. The Senate rules for impeachment trials were last reviewed in 1974 in anticipation of President Nixon's impeachment. The Committee on Rules and Administration examined the rules and proposed adjustments to clarify meanings and codify past practices. The Majority Leader suggested significant changes, leading to the proposal of adjustments to 13 of the 26 rules in S.Res. 390, 93rd Congress. No major changes were recommended by the Committee. The Senate rules for impeachment trials were last reviewed in 1974, with no major changes recommended. The Rules Committee in 1986 proposed changes that had been approved in 1974, which the Senate agreed to. No further changes have been made to the impeachment rules. The Senate rules for impeachment trials were last reviewed in 1974, with no major changes recommended. In a 1986 Senate document, procedures and guidelines for impeachment trials are outlined, distinct from legislative and executive sessions. Precedent dictates that if impeachment rules are silent, regular Senate rules may guide proceedings. The impeachment rules prescribe steps for the trial's start, with the Senate organizing itself and requesting written statements from the impeached officer and the House. The Senate rules for impeachment trials were last reviewed in 1974, with no major changes recommended. In a 1986 Senate document, procedures and guidelines for impeachment trials are outlined, distinct from legislative and executive sessions. The next stage involves the receipt and presentation of evidence, with little guidance provided by the impeachment rules. Arguments are made on the Senate floor by House managers and counsel for the impeached officer. The Senate could request documents and hear testimony from witnesses, with Senators expected to attend the trial but their individual participation in open session is limited. They can submit questions in writing, which are read by the Presiding Officer of the trial. During an impeachment trial, the Senate follows specific rules for debate and voting. Senators are not allowed to debate unless the Senate goes into closed session by majority vote. Votes can be held in open or closed session on procedural questions, with the final vote on conviction always occurring in open session. Conviction requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present. The Senate follows specific rules for debate and voting during an impeachment trial. Conviction requires a two-thirds majority of Senators present. Impeachment managers are selected by the House to argue the case for impeachment before the Senate. The House managers will argue the case for impeachment before the Senate and have authority to prepare and conduct the trial. A message will be sent to the Senate to inform them of the appointed managers. The Senate establishes a time for the House managers to present the articles of impeachment, following a unanimous consent agreement. The House managers present the articles of impeachment before the Senate at a scheduled time, following a unanimous consent agreement. They are announced and escorted to their seats in front of the Senate rostrum by the Sergeant at Arms. The Presiding Officer then directs the Sergeant at Arms to make a required proclamation. The House managers present the articles of impeachment before the Senate at a scheduled time. The Sergeant at Arms makes a required proclamation for silence. A House Manager reads the articles in full and reserves the right to amend them. The Senate will \"take proper order on the subject of impeachment\" and notify the House. The Senate will consider the articles the next day at 1 o'clock. After the House managers present the articles of impeachment, the Senate organizes for a trial by swearing in the presiding officer and all Senators. The Chief Justice presides over a presidential impeachment trial and is administered the oath. Impeachment Rule IV requires notice to the Chief Justice of the trial's time and place. The Chief Justice is administered the oath by the Presiding Officer of the Senate during a presidential impeachment trial. In the Clinton trial, the oath was administered by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. Senators are also administered the oath of office by the Presiding Officer of the Trial. During an impeachment trial, Senators are required to take an oath of impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. The Chief Justice administers the oath, and Senators raise their right hands and respond \"I do.\" Senators sign an official oath book as a record. Senators must inform the presiding officer if they are absent during the oath, and can request to be excused from the trial. The Senate issues a summons and requests an answer from the impeached official. The Senate issues a \"summons\" and requests an \"answer\" from the impeached official as an early step in an impeachment trial. Impeachment Rule VIII states that a writ of summons shall be issued to the person impeached, including the articles of impeachment. The accused official is directed to file a written answer by a specified date. The Senate sets a deadline for the impeached officer to file an answer and for the House Managers to file a replication. The length of time given for this process can vary. The order or resolution regarding the summons and replication is not up for debate but can be amended and requires a majority vote. The trial is convened at 12:30 p.m. on the designated day for the return of the summons. The Sergeant at Arms swears an oath under Impeachment Rule VI, administered by the Secretary of the Senate. Impeachment Rule VII states that the Presiding Officer of the Senate directs necessary preparations in the Senate Chamber. The Senate makes decisions on staff access, furniture placement, and equipment for trial presentations. These actions can be taken before or shortly after the trial convenes. In the Clinton impeachment trial, guidelines were agreed upon for Senate staff with official impeachment duties. The Senate agreed to guidelines for staff access and privileges during the impeachment trial by unanimous consent. They also established procedures for allocating tickets to the Senate gallery. These actions are part of the process for organizing impeachment trial procedures, which can be done through unanimous consent agreements or Senate votes on propositions. The Senate's procedural agreements, known as \"orders,\" are voted on without debate during impeachment trials. Debate can occur in closed session with each Senator limited to speaking once for a maximum of 10 minutes. Impeachment Rule XXI allows for arguments on procedural proposals for up to two hours in some cases. During an impeachment trial in the Senate, there are limits on debate, allowing decisions to be made without filibusters. Most questions can be approved with a majority vote, except for conviction which requires two-thirds support. During an impeachment trial in the Senate, decisions can be made with a majority vote, except for conviction which requires two-thirds support. Senators can propose orders subject to amendments, as seen in past trials like the Belknap and Clinton impeachment cases. Amendments can be offered but not debated openly in session. During an impeachment trial in the Senate, Senators can propose orders subject to amendments. Past trials have shown that amendments can be divided and voted on separately. However, there is little guidance on what constitutes a proper \"order\" eligible for expedited majority vote during an impeachment trial. Impeachment rules in the Senate allow for the House Managers and counsel to argue propositions, determine the number of people for opening and closing arguments, and designate who may serve a summons. The Senate can adopt non-debatable orders to schedule consideration of articles, even if a meeting was missed. Additional orders can be agreed upon during impeachment trials, as seen in past proceedings. The Senate can adopt non-debatable orders to schedule consideration of articles, even if a meeting was missed. These orders can affect many procedures beyond those specified in the impeachment rules, but Senate precedents may limit their scope. Ultimately, a Senate majority will decide on the inclusion of specific provisions in an order, with Senators consulting precedents for guidance. The Senate majority will decide on questions using the process for interpreting procedures. The necessary majority for approval is 51 Senators, with tie votes failing. The quorum required for an impeachment trial is 51 Senators, and party leaders urge attendance at all sessions. Committee meetings are unlikely during trial times to ensure Senators are present for arguments before voting. The Senate majority will decide on questions using the process for interpreting procedures. The necessary majority for approval is 51 Senators, with tie votes failing. The quorum required for an impeachment trial is 51 Senators, and party leaders urge attendance at all sessions. Committee meetings are unlikely during trial times to ensure Senators are present for arguments before voting. The actions taken by the Senate to consider and collect evidence in each trial have varied considerably. Impeachment rules provide guidance on a few particulars, requiring the Senate to determine the manner of proceeding for each trial. This section reviews impeachment rules related to the trial stage, how they have been interpreted, and how their terms have been modified in past practice. In modern trials, the Senate has relied on trial committees to consider and collect evidence, describing how these committees are established and some of their practices. During an impeachment trial, Senators spend most of the time listening. During an impeachment trial in the Senate, Senators listen to arguments presented by House Managers and counsel for the impeached officer. Impeachment Rule XV allows counsel for the parties to appear and be heard. Rule XXII dictates the order of opening and closing arguments, with the House providing opening remarks first. Closing arguments are made by House Managers last, with two House Managers and two individuals for the impeached officer permitted to speak. The Senate allows House Managers and counsel for the impeached officer to present arguments during an impeachment trial. Closing arguments are made by two House Managers and two individuals for the impeached officer. The Senate can modify the number of individuals allowed for closing arguments. Impeachment Rule XXI sets a one-hour time limit for arguments on any questions or motions during the trial, unless ordered otherwise by the Senate. Rule XVI requires all motions to be addressed to the Presiding Officer in writing if demanded. The Senate controls what propositions can be voted on during an impeachment trial, with rules allowing for arguments and motions to be presented in writing if demanded. Past trials have seen motions for postponement and striking of articles, with the side proposing the motion speaking first and reserving time for rebuttal. Time limits for arguments can be altered by unanimous consent or Senate order. During an impeachment trial, the Senate controls motions proposed by parties, determining responses and methods of voting. In past trials, motions for postponement and striking of articles have been presented, with the side proposing the motion speaking first and reserving time for rebuttal. During an impeachment trial, the Senate controls motions proposed by parties, determining responses and methods of voting. In past trials, motions for postponement and striking of articles have been presented. The Senate heard arguments on various motions filed by the defense, including a motion to dismiss Article 1, a motion to dismiss Article 2, and a motion to dismiss all articles aggregating multiple charges. The Majority Leader's motion to hold preliminary votes on individual allegations within the articles was defeated 94-0. Rule XI, allowing the creation of a trial committee, was deemed unconstitutional. The Senate decided not to hear additional witnesses in the impeachment case, with a motion agreed to 61-32. Impeachment Rule XXIV refers to Senate orders and decisions proposed by Senators, not parties involved in the case. Impeachment Rule XIX and XXIV outline the procedures for Senate motions and orders. Written motions must be put by the Presiding Officer, and debate on orders can be limited in open session. Orders can be agreed to by unanimous consent or by a roll call vote. The exception is the motion to adjourn, which can be voted on by voice vote or division. The rules do not reference proposals offered by Senators. In modern impeachment trials, Senators have proposed motions not explicitly allowed under previous orders, but presumably permitted by standing rules and precedents. For example, in the 1999 trial of President Clinton, motions to dismiss articles and proceed to closing arguments were allowed under specific resolutions. During impeachment trials, Senators have proposed motions not explicitly allowed under previous orders but presumably permitted by standing rules and precedents. For example, in the trial of President Clinton, a Senator moved to insert statements made in closed sessions into the Congressional Record. In another instance, during Judge Harry Claiborne's trial in 1986, a Senator moved to postpone decisions on motions filed by the defendant. The impeachment rules and precedents do not provide explicit guidance on propositions Senators can offer during trials, nor do they specify precedence among motions. In impeachment trials, Senators have proposed motions not explicitly allowed under previous orders but presumably permitted by standing rules and precedents. In 1999, Senators moved to suspend certain impeachment rules, requiring one day's notice and a two-thirds vote for adoption. The impeachment rules offer little guidance on the calling and questioning of witnesses. Impeachment Rule XVII outlines the process for examining witnesses, including who conducts the examination and cross-examination. Witnesses must be sworn in by the Secretary of the Senate or authorized person. Impeachment Rule VI allows the Senate to compel witness attendance and enforce orders essential to justice. In modern practice, the Senate relies on other branches of government to enforce its subpoenas. For example, in the 1989 trial of Judge Alcee Hastings, the Senate approved a resolution directing the Senate Legal Counsel to bring a civil action to enforce a subpoena when a key witness refused to testify. The Senate determines which witnesses will be heard in impeachment trials, and parties do not have the right to select witnesses. In impeachment trials, the Senate decides which witnesses to hear and possibly subpoena based on requests from the House Managers and counsel for the impeached. Witnesses are examined in trial committees, not on the Senate floor. In the Clinton trial in 1999, depositions were taken from three witnesses, but no witness testified on the floor. The Senate allows witnesses to testify on the floor during impeachment trials, with Senators able to question them by submitting written questions to the Presiding Officer. This practice has not been used since the 1936 trial of Judge Ritter. In impeachment trials, Senators can submit questions for witnesses without the need for written questions. In past trials, Senators have directed questions to House managers and counsel for the impeached, with specific procedures established for questioning periods. During impeachment trials, Senators can submit questions for witnesses without written questions. In past trials, Senators directed questions to House managers and counsel for the impeached, with specific procedures for questioning periods. The Chief Justice suggested five minutes for each answer, with efforts to balance time between sides. Over 100 questions were asked by Senators over two days, with structured alternating questions between Republican and Democratic Senators. In other trials, Senators asked questions without a formal Senate order. For example, in the 2010 trial of Judge Porteous, time limits were set by unanimous consent for arguments. In the 2010 trial of Judge Porteous, time limits were set by unanimous consent for arguments, with one hour for each side and one and a half hours for final arguments on all four articles of impeachment. Senators could submit questions in writing to the Presiding Officer, who would read them at an appropriate time. Impeachment Rule XI allows for the appointment of a trial committee of Senators to receive evidence and take testimony, with the 1974 Rules and Administration Committee report stating that full Senate action on all aspects of a presidential impeachment was necessary. The Senate has chosen to appoint trial committees for modern impeachments since the 1980s to streamline the process. Transcripts and evidence are sent to the full Senate for final deliberation on guilt. Trial committees are created by a simple resolution authorizing Senators to recommend members. The Senate appoints trial committees for impeachments since the 1980s to streamline the process. These committees are bipartisan and consist of 12 members recommended by the majority and minority leaders. They have the authority to receive evidence, make decisions on pre-trial motions, question witnesses, and process motions filed by House Managers. The committees operate similarly to the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment. The trial committees appointed by the Senate for impeachments operate similarly to the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment. They hold hearings, receive oral arguments, question witnesses, deliberate in closed session, and ultimately vote on a determination. Modern trial committees have declined motions to dismiss articles of impeachment, examined witnesses called by House managers and counsel to the accused, and issued a report to the Senate upon completion of their work. The trial committee will issue a report to the Senate compiling evidence and witness testimony for a final vote on impeachment articles. The Senate can still call additional witnesses or hear further testimony. Closed-door deliberations are allowed under Impeachment Rules XX and XXIV. During closed-door deliberations for an impeachment trial, the Senate can enter closed session with a motion and majority vote. Each Senator can speak once on each question, with time limits of 10 minutes for \"interlocutory\" questions and 15 minutes for the final question of guilt or innocence. During closed-door deliberations for an impeachment trial, the Senate can enter closed session with a motion and majority vote. Each Senator has one opportunity to speak for no more than 15 minutes, following specific procedures guided by the Senate's standing rules. The chamber is cleared of everyone except Senators and designated staff who are sworn to secrecy. Access is provided to specific Senate officials and individuals deemed necessary by the Presiding Officer. During impeachment trials, the Senate extends floor privileges in closed session to designated staff by unanimous consent. Closed session deliberations are recorded under secrecy, with possible expulsion for divulging information. Senators can insert their remarks into the Congressional Record. During impeachment trials, the Senate allows designated staff floor privileges in closed sessions. Deliberations are recorded under secrecy, with possible expulsion for leaking information. Senators can insert their remarks into the Congressional Record. Conviction in an impeachment trial requires a guilty vote on at least one article by two-thirds of Senators present. The support of 67 Senators is needed to convict. A \"present\" response effectively supports acquittal. After closed-door deliberations, the Senate reconvenes in open session to vote on articles of impeachment. Each article is voted on separately by roll call, with Senators required to answer \"guilty\" or \"not guilty.\" Voting continues without interruption unless the trial is adjourned. Adjournments can only be for one day or indefinitely. Under Senate Standing Rule XII, Senators must vote unless excused or due to a conflict of interest. Excused Senators are decided after the roll call but before the result is announced. Officers convicted by two-thirds of Senators present are immediately removed from office. The Senate may then move to disqualify the convicted individual. The Senate can choose to disqualify a convicted officer from holding further office with a simple majority vote. The Presiding Officer in an impeachment trial has no more control than in regular Senate deliberations. Any ruling by the Presiding Officer can be challenged by a Senator, and the full Senate decides on the challenge. Impeachment Rule VII outlines the process for challenging a ruling. Impeachment Rule VII outlines the process for challenging a ruling during an impeachment trial. The Presiding Officer can rule on questions of evidence, but a single Senator can request a full Senate vote on the question, which is not debatable and requires a majority vote. Impeachment Rule VII allows for challenging a ruling during an impeachment trial. The Presiding Officer can make rulings on evidence, but a Senator can request a Senate vote on the admissibility of evidence. The Senate would vote on procedural issues, with the phrasing of the question varying based on the issue. The Senate is the final arbiter on procedural questions during an impeachment trial. A Senator can request a vote on evidence admissibility, with the Senate deciding by a vote. Impeachment Rule VII states that the vote must follow Senate rules and can be settled by a roll call vote if supported by 1/5 of a quorum. The Senate recently voted, with 1/5 of the Senators who voted. Impeachment rules reference the Presiding Officer, who is required to be the Chief Justice of the United States when the President is impeached. The Presiding Officer administers oaths, executes Senate decisions, maintains order, and is addressed by the parties involved in the case. Managers, impeached officer, and counsel address the Presiding Officer for motions, objections, or requests in the trial. Rule XIX requires reading written questions aloud. The Presiding Officer votes on impeachment articles. In a tie, the Vice President may vote, except in presidential trials. The Chief Justice, if presiding, does not vote. A tie vote results in a negative decision. When the Senate convenes as a Court of Impeachment, it operates in a distinct procedural mode separate from legislative and executive sessions. It has its own rules and keeps a separate Journal. Business in these modes is kept separate, with limitations on introducing bills and resolutions during impeachment trials. Some legislative actions may require unanimous consent. The Senate must reach unanimous consent agreements for various actions to occur during legislative sessions, including the introduction of legislation and filing committee reports. Impeachment rules require the Senate to convene for a trial at noon every day except Sunday, with the possibility of arranging alternative methods for actions to occur on non-legislative session days. In modern practice, the Senate can modify the schedule for an impeachment trial by order, adjusting meeting days and times through unanimous consent or majority vote. Impeachment Rule XIII allows for the Senate to resume legislative business when the trial adjourns. The Senate can convene for legislative or executive business during an impeachment trial, as the adjournment of the trial does not affect the Senate's ability to conduct other business. This flexibility was seen during the Clinton trial, where the Senate conducted legislative business alongside the impeachment proceedings. During an impeachment trial, the Senate's ability to approve legislation may be affected by factors such as bipartisan support, contentious proceedings, and attention directed towards the trial. It is unclear how Senate procedures for considering legislation are impacted during an impeachment trial, such as the timing of cloture votes. During an impeachment trial, the Senate's consideration of legislation may be affected by factors like bipartisan support and the timing of cloture votes. It is unclear how expedited procedure statutes, such as the Congressional Review Act, War Powers Resolution, or Trade Act, could be impacted by a Senate trial."
