    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment to facilitate travel for sales of agricultural and medical goods to Cuba. The House approved an amendment to prohibit the use of funds to enforce a Treasury regulation on payment for U.S. agricultural products to Cuba. The provision clarifies the term \"payment of cash in advance\" for exports to Cuba, requiring payment before goods are shipped from the U.S. port. This was previously included in the FY2006 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill but was dropped due to a veto threat. In the late 1990s, falling agricultural exports led to calls to exempt food from U.S. economic sanctions against certain countries. The Clinton Administration announced the lifting of prohibitions on U.S. commercial sales of most agricultural commodities and food on April 28, 1999. The US lifted prohibitions on commercial sales of agricultural commodities and food products to Iran, Libya, and Sudan. This decision aimed to separate food from foreign policy tools and address the negative impact of sanctions on the US farm economy. Specific export licensing regulations were issued by the US Department of Treasury to allow sales to these countries. Additionally, regulations implemented in 2000 permitted agricultural sales to North Korea without an export license. The US allowed commercial sales of agricultural products to Iran, Libya, and Sudan, separating food from foreign policy tools. Sales to North Korea were also permitted without an export license. Congressional efforts led to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA) lifted U.S. sanctions on commercial sales of food, agricultural commodities, and medical products to Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Cuba. Congress now has veto power over unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions proposed by the President. Farm organizations and agribusiness firms have long advocated for exempting agricultural exports from broad economic sanctions. Opposition to broad economic sanctions is growing, with concerns that they mainly harm U.S. farmers and businesses, damage the country's reputation as a reliable supplier, and fail to change targeted countries' behavior. Calls for a comprehensive review of the economic impact of sanctions and limits on the executive branch's use of sanctions have been made by various groups, including those in the pharmaceutical and manufacturing sectors. Some oppose exempting sales of agricultural commodities and food products from U.S. sanctions, citing concerns about misuse by foreign governments or lack of availability to those in need. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 loosened trade restrictions with certain countries like Cuba, allowing commercial sales of agricultural and medical products while prohibiting Cuba's access to U.S. financing for these products. This act also applies to five other countries and sets the terms for exemptions in U.S. sanctions policy. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 expanded exemptions for commercial sales of agricultural and medical products to certain sanctioned countries. It prohibited U.S. government financial assistance for these sales and streamlined the licensing process for exporters. The act also requires congressional approval for future restrictions on sales of these products for foreign policy or national security reasons. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for the sale of agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries, with limitations on the duration of sanctions. Interagency differences were resolved in 2001, leading to almost $1.6 billion in agricultural exports to Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Sudan under the act's provisions. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for the sale of agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries. The $60 million in agricultural exports to North Korea and Sudan were likely food donations. The policy change reflects the law's requirement to terminate unilateral agricultural and medical sanctions. This supersedes provisions in the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, which imposed an embargo on Cuba. Commercial sales of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba were generally prohibited under the embargo. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for the sale of agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries, including Cuba. The Act imposed conditions and restrictions similar to those for other sanctioned countries. U.S. exporters must follow an export licensing process before selling any products to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for the sale of agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries, including Cuba. U.S. exporters must follow an export licensing process before any product can be shipped. Permanent prohibition is in place against using U.S. government export programs or financing from U.S. private banks for licensed sales. BIS's interim rules require medical product exports to Cuba to be licensed and establish an expedited process for agricultural product sales. TSRA enacts the principle that commercial sales of food, agricultural products, medicine, and medical products should not be used for foreign policy or national security objectives. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for the sale of agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries, including Cuba. It requires the President to justify to Congress any limitations on sales to sanctioned countries and obtain congressional approval. Limits on agricultural sales include any restrictions on export sales of agricultural commodities or using USDA programs. For medical products, limits include any restrictions on exports of medicine or medical devices. TSRA codified earlier decisions to allow such sales. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA) allows sales of agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries, including Cuba. It codified earlier decisions to allow such sales and provides exceptions for sanctions imposed by the U.S. under certain circumstances. President Bush used exception authority under the Arms Export Control Act to issue Executive Order 13224, prohibiting transactions with designated terrorists. TSRA allows exports of agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries with approved export licenses. The Secretary of State determines countries requiring export licensing due to support for terrorism. The Secretary of State has determined that certain countries support international terrorism, requiring export licenses for sales of eligible products to them. This includes Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. North Korea and Syria are also designated as sponsors of terrorism, but the license requirement does not apply to sales to them. The licensing requirement for Iran, Libya, and Sudan may be dropped if they no longer support terrorism, but it is permanent for Cuba. The act aims to simplify export procedures. The act aims to streamline export licensing for sales to sanctioned countries like Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Sudan. The Treasury regulations for agricultural sales to these countries were seen as cumbersome and time-consuming. The new provisions modify the pre-2001 licensing rules, offering general and specific export licenses based on product nature, end user, sales contract details, and date. The act aims to streamline export licensing for sales to sanctioned countries like Cuba, Iran, Libya, and Sudan by offering general and specific export licenses based on product nature, end user, sales contract details, and date of contract performance. OFAC's food exemption regulations set up procedures for obtaining licenses, with conditions varying based on the procedure followed. An expedited licensing process applies to prospective sales of specified bulk agricultural commodities. OFAC established regulations for export licensing to sanctioned countries, requiring a two-step process for sales of food products, medicines, and medical equipment. Exporters needed a general license to enter into a contract and a specific license for contract performance. These regulations were issued under the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Administration Act of 1979 established regulations for export licensing to sanctioned countries, requiring a two-step process for sales of food products, medicines, and medical equipment. Through July 2001, Commerce's BIS administered different licensing rules for Cuba applicable to U.S. shipments of eligible food and agricultural commodities, farm inputs, and medical products. TSRA now allows for the commercial sale of agricultural and medical products to Cuba under prescribed terms, superseding previous provisions. Section 906(a) of TSRA allows sales of exempted agricultural and medical products to sanctioned countries on less restrictive terms. The law stipulates that exports to sanctioned countries must be made under one-year licenses for contracts entered into and shipped within a 12-month period. The aim is to streamline the approval process for exporters, moving away from a complex and time-consuming case-by-case basis. TSRA removes executive branch discretion in determining the time period for exports. The TSRA law streamlines export approval process by setting defined time parameters for transactions covered by export licenses. It ensures that licensing conditions cover multiple transactions and denies licenses for exports to entities promoting terrorism. BXA and OFAC drafted licensing rules with some differences for countries like Cuba, North Korea, and Syria. The TSRA law streamlines export approval process by setting defined time parameters for transactions covered by export licenses. BXA and OFAC proposed different licensing rules for countries like Cuba, North Korea, and Syria, including a two-step licensing process and end-use verification. The TSRA law set time parameters for export licenses, leading to conflicting views on interpreting regulations. BIS allows sale of agricultural products to Cuba without a license if other agencies don't object within 11 days. OFAC requires a one-year license for sales to Iran and Sudan, with a review process if objections are raised. Under the Bush Administration's Libyan sanctions policy change, most U.S. exports to Libya no longer require a license. Some agricultural exporters are concerned about delays in the licensing process due to OFAC checks for end users in Iran and Sudan. U.S. policy aims to prevent sanctioned countries from benefiting financially from permitted transactions and accessing assets in the U.S. TSRA did not alter current policy on trade financing by U.S. banks. TSRA did not change current policy on trade financing by U.S. banks for sanctioned countries like Iran, Sudan, and Cuba. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S. banks from extending financing to countries under U.S. unilateral economic sanctions, requiring cash in advance for licensed sales of agricultural and medical products. OFAC regulations allow for payment of cash in advance to U.S. sellers for sanctioned countries' purchase of exempted products. Trade financing terms include sales on open account with limitations and financing by third country banks. U.S. banks can advise or confirm letters of credit but cannot provide trade financing. Exporters need a general license from OFAC for payment or credit terms. U.S. banks can apply for a specific license on a case-by-case basis for financing sales, subject to overall compliance with U.S. sanctions. Section 908(b) of TSRA prohibits financing agricultural sales to Cuba. The TSRA prohibits financing agricultural sales to Cuba by U.S. entities, requiring cash in advance or financing through a third-country bank. This restriction limits the Executive Branch's ability to adjust financing rules based on changing U.S.-Cuban relations. The TSRA prohibits U.S. private financing of agricultural exports to Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. OFAC regulations continue to prohibit U.S. private financing of licensed sales to these countries. TSRA does not explicitly address allowing these countries to access U.S. private financing. The TSRA prohibits U.S. private financing of agricultural exports to Cuba, Iran, and Sudan. OFAC regulations also prohibit U.S. private financing of licensed sales to these countries. Section 908(a) of TSRA prohibits U.S. government assistance for exports to Cuba or commercial exports to Iran, Libya, North Korea, or Sudan, with the President having the authority to waive this prohibition for humanitarian reasons or national interest. The TSRA prohibits U.S. private financing of agricultural exports to Cuba, Iran, and Sudan, with the President having the authority to waive this prohibition for humanitarian reasons or national interest. However, the waiver authority does not extend to Cuba. The U.S. government assistance prohibition on exports to Cuba does not affect provisions of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996. The Bush Administration chose not to exercise Presidential waiver in the regulations issued. The Bush Administration did not use Presidential waiver authority in the regulations issued regarding credit guarantees for agricultural sales to Iran. U.S. policy prohibits government assistance for commercial sales to sanctioned countries sponsoring terrorism, as reaffirmed by TSRA. TSRA expands the exemption for agricultural products to include a wide range of items such as livestock, food, and feed. The definition of agricultural commodities includes livestock, food, feed, and other designated animals, as well as insects. An amendment added fertilizer to the definition. Medicine and medical devices are defined in terms used by the FDA. Regulations implemented a policy governing sales to certain countries, allowing exports of specified products. OFAC's list did not include non-food commodities like cotton and tobacco. The Treasury's regulations excluded non-food commodities like cotton, tobacco, and wood products due to military use concerns. Exporters needed a license to sell certain products, including fertilizer and agri-chemicals, which were restricted for military purposes. Both Commerce's BIS and Treasury's OFAC agreed on definitions for agricultural and medical products in new export licensing rules. The rules define agricultural commodities to include various food items, beverages, livestock, fibers, tobacco, wood products, seeds, vitamins, and minerals. Excluded are furniture, clothing, agricultural equipment, pesticides, and cosmetics. Export control rules apply to fertilizer, western red cedar, and live horses. TSRA grants Congress veto power over exports. TSRA grants Congress veto power over a President's proposal to impose unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions. The President must seek congressional approval before restricting sales to a targeted country for foreign policy or national security reasons. Reporting to Congress is required 60 days before imposing a sanction, except during wartime or when the product is controlled under export laws. Section 905 of TSRA allows Congress to veto unilateral agricultural or medical sanctions imposed for national security reasons. Sanctions automatically end after two years, with the option for the President to request an extension. U.S. farmers saw Cuba as a potential market due to limited sales to Iran, Libya, and Sudan. They advocated for exempting food from Cuban sanctions to regain market share lost to foreign competitors. Cuba's average agricultural imports were around $800 million. Cuba's agricultural imports averaged about $800 million annually in the early 2000s, with top suppliers including Canada, the United States, France, China, and Brazil. The tourism industry also imported an additional $100 to $250 million in food products. U.S. agricultural interests argued for exempting agricultural exports from the embargo to increase sales opportunities. Various studies projected annual sales of $100 million to over $1 billion from liberalizing U.S.-Cuban trade. U.S. exporters, especially of rice and wheat, could gain a competitive edge if Cuba buys from its nearest supplier to save on transportation costs. Cuba could save up to $100 million in transportation costs by buying primarily from U.S. agricultural exporters. However, immediate large U.S. sales to the island were seen as unrealistic due to Cuba's limited financial resources and reliance on barter and credit transactions for agricultural imports. Cuba's reliance on barter and credit transactions for agricultural imports may hinder potential U.S. sales, as well as its denial of access to U.S. government programs and financing. Cuban officials initially rejected the idea of liberalizing trade with the U.S., criticizing the restrictions as unworkable and insulting. There are concerns that Cuba may prefer to maintain trade ties with socialist partners for key commodities like rice, rather than rely on a single supplier. The Cuban government initially criticized the tightening of the embargo as insulting, but later expressed interest in buying U.S. agricultural commodities to rebuild food reserves after Hurricane Michelle. Negotiations between U.S. agribusiness firms and Cuba's food import agency led to the signing of contracts in late 2001. Agribusiness firms and Alimport, Cuba's food import agency, signed contracts to sell U.S. food products worth $35 million, including wheat, corn, soybeans, poultry, and rice. The first shipment arrived in Havana in December 2001, marking a significant shift in the relationship between the two countries. Despite initial skepticism from Cuban officials, ongoing export sales to Cuba have totaled $1.25 billion from December 2001 to April 2006. Members introduced bills and amendments in 2001 and 2002 to revise U.S. policy on food products in sanctions regimes, seeking to repeal export financing and travel prohibitions on Cuba. The Bush Administration warned of vetoing any bills relaxing the Cuban trade embargo. Various proposals were made, including compromise language in anti-terrorism legislation. Several proposals were introduced to revise U.S. policy on agricultural sales to Cuba. Some bills aimed to repeal the prohibition on private U.S. financing of agricultural sales to Cuba, while others sought to drop provisions in the TSRA, including requirements for advance licensing of exports to Cuba, prohibitions on U.S. government assistance/financing of food and medical product sales, and the prohibition on tourist travel to Cuba. The proposed changes to U.S. policy on agricultural sales to Cuba include exemptions for agricultural and medical product exports, allowing ships to transport these goods to Cuba without the current six-month restriction on entering U.S. ports. Some bills also aim to retain restrictions on exports for broader export control and national security reasons. The bipartisan House Cuba Working Group suggested allowing private financing for these transactions. The bipartisan House Cuba Working Group proposed allowing private financing for U.S. agricultural and medical exports to Cuba, as well as repealing the ban on ships visiting Cuba from entering American ports for 180 days. The Bush Administration strongly opposed the Senate-passed provision to repeal the ban, citing Cuba's denial of civil rights and support for terrorism. Senator Bob Smith proposed an amendment requiring the President to certify Cuba's non-involvement in terrorism before lifting the prohibition. The Senate provision to repeal the ban on ships visiting Cuba was a contentious issue during the farm bill conference. The House leadership ultimately made the final decision, with House conferees accepting the Senate position after a motion to instruct by Representative Dooley. Senate conferees eventually receded to the House position. On April 23, Senate conferees agreed with the House position to maintain the private financing prohibition. Representative Jerry Moran proposed an amendment to ease restrictions on private commercial agricultural and medical sales to Cuba, which was accepted but not finalized before Congress adjourned. In the 108th Congress, House and Senate leadership removed the OFAC provision in the omnibus spending bill that funded Treasury operations in FY2003. President Bush opposed any repeal of the prohibition on private financing of agricultural sales to Cuba, stating it would benefit the current regime. He threatened to veto any legislation that relaxed the embargo until specified reforms were introduced by the Cuban government. Secretary of State Powell and Treasury Secretary O'Neill also warned against easing restrictions on trade and travel to Cuba. In the 108th Congress, there were discussions about restrictions on trade and travel to Cuba. One proposed measure aimed to broaden the countries covered by the TSRA, including Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Sudan. There were also legislative initiatives to exempt agricultural exports from export controls or sanctions, with a specific focus on agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical supplies. This exemption did not apply to items subject to national security export controls or listed on the U.S. Munitions List. During the 108th Congress, discussions were held regarding trade and travel restrictions to Cuba. Proposed measures aimed to expand the countries covered by the TSRA, including Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Sudan. Legislative initiatives sought to exempt agricultural exports from sanctions, focusing on commodities, medicine, and medical supplies. Senator Roberts addressed concerns about potential misuse of broad authorities in the bill, ensuring that food and medical products were exempt from unilateral sanctions. Section 603 of the bill clarified that export controls on food for national security purposes were not authorized, and restrictions on food exports for foreign policy reasons required Congressional approval. The package of anti-terrorism measures (P.L. 107-56) was also discussed. The package of anti-terrorism measures (P.L. 107-56; H.R. 3162) signed into law on October 26, 2001 amended some TSRA provisions. It modified circumstances under which TSRA's food/medical exemption would not apply, subjecting agricultural and medical product sales to the Taliban-controlled area of Afghanistan to TSRA's export licensing requirements. Eligible export sales can also be made to entities in Syria or North Korea without a license. No TSRA provision limits penalties for unlawful exports to designated foreign entities. The TSRA provisions were modified by anti-terrorism measures in 2001, affecting the export of agricultural and medical products to certain areas. In the 2003-2004 period, measures were introduced to relax TSRA's restrictions on Cuba, but none were enacted. H.R. 187 proposed repealing the prohibition on private financing for exports to Cuba, while H.R. 188 and S. 403 aimed to end the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba by repealing various provisions. H.R. 1698 and H.R. 3422 sought to repeal or supersede all TSRA provisions applicable to Cuba. H.R. 1698, H.R. 3422, H.R. 4457, and S. 2449 proposed changes to TSRA provisions regarding Cuba, including repealing restrictions and terminating the embargo unless renewed by Congress. H.R. 3670 aimed to penalize U.S. exporters for lobbying to remove trade restrictions on Cuba. Members planned to introduce related bills to allow farm machinery sales to Cuba. In mid-November 2003, conferees on the FY2004 agriculture appropriations measure dropped a Senate amendment that would have facilitated travel to Cuba under TSRA to promote U.S. agricultural and medical products. Senator Dorgan's intent was to address OFAC's decision to deny a license application for a food and agribusiness exhibition in Havana. The White House opposed a provision to organize a food and agribusiness exhibition in Havana in January 2004, arguing it would weaken current sanctions against Cuba. The provision aimed to ensure legal travel to Cuba and required the Treasury's OFAC to give \"general licenses\" for eligible business travelers, instead of requiring a \"specific license\" for each trip. The Bush Administration opposed a provision requiring a \"specific license\" for each trip to Cuba, arguing it could delay or refuse travel licenses for farm sales. They stated that the current licensing process ensures travel to Cuba serves appropriate purposes and sales are within the law. The Administration threatened to veto any bill weakening sanctions against Cuba, including restrictions on commercial exports of agricultural and medical goods. An amendment to the FY2005 transportation/treasury spending bill aimed to prohibit U.S.-imposed sanctions on private commercial sales of agricultural commodities to Cuba. Representative Waters argued that financing restrictions on these sales make trade unnecessarily complicated and expensive, hindering small businesses from increasing their market share. Opponents noted that U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba are legal, and allowing financing for such sales would only reward exporters. The FY2005 omnibus spending package considered during the November 2004 lame duck session dropped a provision to allow financing for private commercial sales of agricultural commodities to Cuba. Concerns were raised about late payments from Cuba possibly violating financing prohibitions, leading Treasury's OFAC to instruct U.S. banks to halt transfers. The Bush Administration planned to announce new rules on the payment issue by late December 2004, prompting some Members of Congress to question or oppose the plans. Some Members of Congress and agricultural groups opposed the Administration's plans to require payment before shipment to Cuba, citing concerns about impeding agricultural sales and violating international trade norms. Some Members of Congress and agricultural groups opposed the Administration's plans to require payment before shipment to Cuba. In response, measures were introduced to clarify that \"payment of cash in advance\" means payment by the purchaser before the product's title and control are transferred. Treasury's rule to require payment before shipment from a U.S. port was met with opposition, with Members exploring options to change this. Some Members opposed Treasury's rule requiring payment before shipment to Cuba, exploring options to change this policy. Legislative initiatives in Senate consideration aim to block significant Treasury nominees and prohibit funds for implementing OFAC's rule. Despite White House threats to veto, conferees dropped the provision from the enacted measure after House members urged its retention. Five Senate conferees opposed dropping the Cuba trade language. Identical language was added as an amendment to the FY2007 bill on June 14, 2006. On June 14, 2006, an amendment was added to the FY2007 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, allowing for the shipment of goods to Cuba once payment is received. Farm groups and agribusiness firms presented data on the decline in U.S. agricultural sales due to the OFAC rule, highlighting the loss of sales to countries like Vietnam and China. Some analysts believe this change could make it easier for U.S. sellers, while opponents of the rule are working with Congress to overturn it. Opponents of the rule are working with Congress to overturn it. Senator Baucus lifted his hold on six Treasury nominees after a policy shift. Exports have increased since August 2005, possibly due to OFAC's rule modification. Alimport is reportedly willing to work with U.S. exporters under new payment procedures."
