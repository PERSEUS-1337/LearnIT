In fiscal year 1994, funding is allocated for aviation projects and activities, including $34,887,000 solely for human factors and aviation medicine projects and activities, $6,515,000 for environment and energy projects and activities, and $5,718,000 for innovative/cooperative research projects and activities. At least 15 percent of the appropriated amount will be for long-term research projects, and at least 3 percent will be available for grants under section 312(g) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. SEC. 3. JOINT AVIATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Administrator and heads of Federal agencies establish a program for aviation technology research to enhance US competitiveness. This includes next-gen satellite communications, airport security, environmentally friendly technologies, aviation safety, and airport capacity improvements. Contracts and grants will be administered according to jointly developed procedures. The program established under subsection (a) includes selected programs for public and private aviation technology development, involvement of private contractors in research and development, and transfer of Government-developed technologies to the private sector for economic strength and competitiveness. Authorization of Appropriations for fiscal years 1994-1996 under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 is authorized to carry out selected programs for aviation technology development and transfer of technologies to enhance economic competitiveness. SEC. 4. AIRCRAFT CABIN AIR QUALITY RESEARCH PROGRAM. The Administrator and heads of Federal agencies will establish a research program to determine harmful aircraft cabin air conditions and infectious disease risks for airline passengers and crew. They will contract with an independent research organization to conduct the program. The research program established by the Administrator and heads of Federal agencies aims to determine harmful cabin air conditions on domestic aircraft and assess the risk of infection for passengers and crew. This includes investigating symptoms like headaches, nausea, and fatigue, as well as evaluating the impact of changes in air pressure, temperature, circulation, and humidity on reducing health risks. The research program aims to examine potential health problems related to cabin air quality for airline passengers and crew on domestic flights within the United States. The Administrator will encourage participation from various stakeholders and submit a plan for implementation within six months of enactment. The Administrator will submit an annual progress report to Congress on meeting goals set forth in subsection (c). Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996 is provided to carry out this section. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON APPROPRIATIONS. No funds authorized after fiscal year 1996 for programs in this Act. SEC. 6. USE OF DOMESTIC PRODUCTS.

Violators may be ineligible for contracts and subject to debarment or suspension. The Buy American Act requires procurements to comply with specific regulations, including reporting on non-domestic products before 1995. A domestic product is defined as one manufactured in the US with at least 50% of its cost sourced domestically. SEC. 7. PURCHASE OF AMERICAN MADE EQUIPMENT AND PRODUCTS.\n\nIt is recommended that grant recipients prioritize purchasing American-made equipment and products with grant funds. The Secretary must notify recipients of this recommendation when allocating grants."
