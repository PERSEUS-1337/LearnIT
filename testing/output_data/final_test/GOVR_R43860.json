    "content": "Methane, with the chemical formula CH4, is a simple hydrocarbon released into the atmosphere by natural sources and human activities. It can be used as a fuel or chemical feedstock, offering advantages over other hydrocarbons like coal and oil. Methane is a cleaner-burning fuel that emits less carbon dioxide than coal and oil. Its production has increased due to improved technologies, making it a significant component in the US energy supply. Methane is also used as a chemical feedstock for various household and industrial products. Methane is advocated for increased production as a cost-effective bridge to a cleaner economy, benefiting the U.S. petrochemical sector and creating domestic jobs. However, vented and fugitive emissions of methane have adverse impacts on health, safety, and the environment. The U.S. EPA and OSHA classify methane as an asphyxiant and explosive, with adverse effects on worker safety and the environment. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with a greater impact on climate change than CO2. Increased emissions could negate the environmental benefits of switching to natural gas. Stakeholders, including some Members of Congress, are calling for increased controls on methane emissions in various sectors of the economy. Efforts are being made to control methane emissions in various sectors of the economy, including oil and gas production, coal mining, industrial processes, and agriculture. The dual nature of methane as both a commodity and a pollutant creates unique incentives for capturing and selling fugitive methane. However, capturing methane emissions is challenging as it is not emitted in a concentrated stream like other pollutants. Methane emissions, similar to volatile organic compounds, are released into the atmosphere through dispersion, leaks, vents, accidents, and ruptures. Capturing or abating these emissions is difficult and costly, with profitability depending on factors like release nature, capture technology, and market prices. The cost-benefit consideration of methane capture is akin to energy efficiency efforts, with high upfront investments potentially offset over time. This report explores methane from commodity to coproduct. This report examines past and present efforts by Congress and the executive branch to address methane emissions for energy policy and pollution control. It provides an overview of methane sources, emission data, current practices, challenges, and recent initiatives proposed by Congress and the Administration. Federal policies aim to control methane emissions for economic, environmental, and public health reasons, including promoting domestic energy production and protecting property rights. Efforts to capture methane emissions were initially motivated by the need for energy independence and security. Policies aimed to promote domestic energy production, protect property rights, ensure employee safety, and safeguard the public from air pollution. Various funding programs were proposed by Congress and the Administration to incentivize the use of methane as an alternative fuel source. In the 2000s, innovative proposals for methane reduction became prevalent, including methane capture as a key strategy. In the U.S. economy, innovative proposals for methane reduction have become prevalent, with suggestions for methane capture as an \"offset\" credit for higher GHG-emitting industries. Recent events, such as the rise in domestic oil and natural gas production, have led to calls for more enforceable standards. States like Colorado, Wyoming, Ohio, California, and Pennsylvania have implemented or proposed rules to control methane emissions from oil and gas sectors, as well as coal mining and landfill operations. Some regulations focus on methane's potential as an energy source. Some regulations focus on methane's potential as an energy source and classify it as a renewable energy source. EPA has the authority to regulate methane emissions as an ozone precursor and a GHG under the Clean Air Act. EPA has regulated methane as a GHG since 1996, and its authority was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007. The agency issued rules primarily focused on CO2 following a determination that six GHGs, including methane, endanger public health and welfare. The Obama Administration's 2014 \"Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions\" has led to the proposal of voluntary and regulatory programs by EPA and other departments to address methane emissions in various industrial sectors. Some stakeholders have raised concerns over federal proposals for more stringent controls on methane emissions. Some industries oppose federal proposals for stricter methane emission controls, arguing that state and local authorities are better suited to oversee and enforce regulations. Efforts to incentivize methane reduction, capture, and reuse are outlined in the Obama Administration's Strategy, with legislative and administrative initiatives detailed in the following sections. Congressional proposals both supporting and opposing increased methane controls are listed in Table A-1 of Appendix A. Congress has a history of supporting methane emissions reduction dating back to the 1970s, with legislation promoting methane capture from various sources. This includes efforts to use methane as an alternative fuel source and address its role as a greenhouse gas pollutant. Senator Al Gore analyzed the contribution of methane to global climate change, sources and sinks of methane, and methods of controlling emissions. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required EPA to report on activities that could reduce methane emissions. Recent congressional interest focuses on methane's role as a greenhouse gas, with legislative efforts supporting EPA's authority to regulate methane emissions. Proposed strategies for reduction include providing economic incentives for capturing and using methane. Several legislative proposals have been introduced to address methane emissions, including economic incentives, regulatory authority for investigating emissions, and market-based mechanisms for reduction. Conversely, some bills aim to limit the executive branch's authority to regulate methane emissions for reasons related to economic growth and employment. Historically, federal government initiatives on methane control have focused on research funding and public-private partnerships with industry. Funding has supported the development of technologies for cost-effective emission reductions in various sectors. Offices like USDA and Department of Energy have provided financial and technical assistance for these efforts. The federal government has various programs and partnerships aimed at assisting the private sector in overcoming economic barriers to methane capture. These include the EPA's Natural Gas STAR Program, Coalbed Methane Outreach Program, AgSTAR Program, Landfill Methane Outreach Program, and Global Methane Initiative. The goal is to support cost-effective emission reductions in different sectors. The Global Methane Initiative aims to raise awareness of emission levels, provide information on new technologies, and address barriers to reducing methane emissions. President Obama's Climate Action Plan highlighted the importance of curbing methane emissions to combat global climate change. The U.S. commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rely heavily on methane controls. A comprehensive interagency methane strategy was developed in 2014, focusing on key initiatives in agriculture and petroleum/natural gas sectors. The strategy includes a \"Biogas Roadmap\" to reduce dairy sector emissions by 25% by 2020 and EPA standards to address methane emissions from new and modified activities. The U.S. has implemented various measures to reduce methane emissions, including guidelines for oil and gas sources, updates to reduce venting and flaring on public lands, and proposals for natural gas pipeline safety standards. Additionally, efforts have been made to identify methane reduction opportunities in coal mines. The U.S. has implemented measures to reduce methane emissions, including guidelines for oil and gas sources, updates to reduce venting and flaring on public lands, and proposals for natural gas pipeline safety standards. A BLM ANPRM was released to gather public input on waste mine methane capture and sale. EPA standards aim to reduce methane from municipal solid waste landfills. Initiatives are in place to improve methane measurement technologies and data quality. Methane is a precursor to ground-level ozone formation and a potent greenhouse gas. Methane is a precursor to ground-level ozone formation and a potent greenhouse gas. It reacts with nitrogen oxides in sunlight to form smog. Despite being less reactive than other hydrocarbons, it contributes significantly to global warming. Methane concentrations in the atmosphere exceeded preindustrial levels by 150% in 2011 and contributed about 16% to global warming from anthropogenic sources. Methane is the second-most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted by the United States, accounting for 10.6% of domestically produced emissions in 2014. Over 44% of methane emissions came from the energy production sector, over 30% from the agricultural sector, and over 20% from the waste management sector. Between 1990 and 2014, methane emissions in the United States decreased by a little over 5%, with fluctuations in trends over the past decade. Emissions from agricultural activities have increased, while emissions from waste management and energy/industrial processes have decreased. Landfills and coal mining have seen significant reductions, while manure management and petroleum systems have shown notable increases in methane emissions. The sources of methane emissions can be categorized into agriculture, energy/industrial processes, and waste management. The curr_chunk discusses methane emissions from agricultural sources, including enteric fermentation and manure management. Methane is produced during normal digestive processes in animals, particularly ruminant livestock, and from manure management systems. Methane is produced from manure management systems, rice cultivation, and field burning of agricultural residues. Field burning is regulated in the United States and internationally, with the agriculture sector contributing to 33% of U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions in 2014. In 2014, agricultural sources contributed to approximately 33% of U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions. Enteric fermentation and livestock manure management are the main sources of agricultural methane emissions. While reducing methane from enteric fermentation is challenging, anaerobic digestion systems for manure management offer practical solutions. The Obama Administration's Strategy aims to reduce agricultural methane emissions from manure management by supporting the adoption of anaerobic digestion (AD) systems. These systems have been supported by USDA, DOE, and EPA for the past 20 years through programs like EPA/USDA's AgSTAR Program. The Strategy includes a Biogas Roadmap to accelerate the adoption of AD systems and other technologies, as well as continuing voluntary efforts to reduce methane emissions. The Administration's Strategy supports voluntary efforts for methane emission reduction in the agricultural sector, focusing on manure management through AD systems. The omission of enteric fermentation as a major emission source raises questions about the overall impact. However, addressing manure management may be the most cost-effective option currently. The effectiveness of past and ongoing federal support for AD systems is unclear, as an emissions baseline has not been established. The Strategy aims to improve documentation of the impact of AD systems receiving federal support, which currently lack a clear emissions baseline. Economic factors may hinder the adoption of best practices in the agricultural sector, suggesting the need for a carbon market, government payment programs, and voluntary contracts to reduce costs. The development of voluntary mitigation contracts could reduce costs and drive innovation. Challenges in expanding mitigation technologies like anaerobic digestion systems include national infrastructure and cooperation with utilities. Methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems are primarily associated with production, transportation, and refining operations. The fossil energy sector, including wells, processing facilities, and pipelines, contributes to nearly 45% of U.S. methane emissions. Coal mining activities also release methane, with underground mines being the largest source. Methane emissions from fossil energy sources have been a significant concern since 1990. Methane emissions from fossil energy sources in the United States have decreased by approximately 10% from 1990 to 2014. Natural gas systems are the primary source of emissions, with the petroleum and natural gas industry contributing over 33% of U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions in 2014. Coal mining emissions have fluctuated but currently account for about 10% of man-made emissions. EPA reported a 9% increase in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry since 2010. Emissions from the oil and gas sector increased by 9% since 2010 and remained unchanged since 1990. Sources of emissions include upstream production, midstream processing and transmission, and downstream distribution. Methane may be emitted during various stages such as drilling, well development, and field treatment equipment. Leaking valves, transmission lines, and pump stations also contribute to emissions in this sector. In the downstream distribution sector, emissions from leaking pipelines, particularly older ones, are a concern. Some companies in the oil and gas industries have voluntarily reduced methane emissions through various technologies and practices, such as green completions, leak detection, and repair technologies, and replacing high-emitting devices. EPA's public-private partnerships have supported these efforts. In 2012, EPA established emission standards for conventional pollutants in the oil and gas sector, aiming to reduce methane emissions from new sources. Some states have also implemented regulations addressing methane emissions from the industry. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has issued rulemakings under the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) to address methane emissions on federal lands. The MLA allows the leasing of onshore lands containing fossil fuel deposits, giving flexibility to use federal lands for energy needs while protecting the environment. Existing BLM rules include the 1980 \"Notice to Lessees and Operators of Onshore Federal and Indian Oil and Gas Leases (NTL-4A)\" outlining payment terms for oil and gas losses. The Obama Administration's Strategy targets methane control in the fossil energy sector through various agencies, including the EPA rule to set standards for methane and VOC emissions from oil and gas production sources. The new standards include controls for methane emissions from hydraulically fractured oil wells, compressor stations, and leak detection and repair at wells. The EPA's final rule aims to reduce methane emissions from new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry, with an estimated reduction of 510,000 short tons of methane in 2025. The rule also includes an Information Collection Request for comprehensive regulations on existing sources. EPA guidelines for VOC reduction requirements in ozone nonattainment areas were published on October 20, 2016. Control Techniques Guidelines are proposed by the EPA to help reduce emissions from covered processes and equipment in the oil and natural gas sector. States can use different technology and approaches, as long as they achieve the same level of emissions reductions as outlined in the guidelines. Additionally, the EPA has clarified definitions for \"major source\" categories in the sector for permitting purposes and is expanding voluntary efforts under the Natural Gas STAR program for methane reduction. The EPA and BLM have implemented rules to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas production. The Department of Transportation has proposed safety standards for natural gas pipelines. The President's budget includes funding for developing technologies to detect and reduce gas losses. The Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing measures to enhance emissions quantification from natural gas infrastructure, including energy efficiency standards, research on leak detection cost reduction, modernization of infrastructure, and partnership with distribution companies for pipeline repair and replacement. These proposals are part of the Administration's plan to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40%-45% from 2012 levels by 2025. The oil and natural gas industry opposes additional standards for methane emissions, citing historical decline, state requirements, and existing efforts. Health and environmental advocates support proposed rules but urge for more action on existing emissions sources. EPA may propose performance standards for existing sources in the future. The legal question surrounding certain pollutants triggering the Section 111(d) program for existing sources is crucial in the litigation over EPA's Clean Power Plan. The courts' decision could impact EPA's regulation of methane emissions from oil and natural gas waste management sources like landfills, where landfill gas, containing methane and CO2, is released into the atmosphere if not captured. Waste management activities, including landfill operations, wastewater treatment, and composting, contribute to methane emissions in the United States. Organic waste in landfills with high moisture levels leads to increased gas production, while wastewater treatment processes can accidentally produce methane under anaerobic conditions. Composting organic waste also generates methane in anaerobic sections, but this is usually mitigated by oxygenation in aerobic sections. In 2014, waste management and treatment activities accounted for approximately 23% of U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions. Landfills in the United States emitted 148.0 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents in 2014, accounting for just over 20% of anthropogenic methane emissions. Methane emissions from landfills have decreased by 18.5% since 1991. Landfill gas is captured at the nation's largest landfills using a system of vertical wells and horizontal collectors. Additionally, wastewater treatment and composting contribute to methane emissions, with wastewater treatment accounting for 2.0% and composting less than 0.3% of U.S. methane emissions. The \"Landfill Gas Rule\" requires landfills with a 2.5 MMT design capacity to capture and burn gas for energy production. EPA stated that the regulations would reduce methane emissions by 37% at new landfills and 39% at existing facilities. There were 648 operational methane capture projects at landfills as of March 2016, representing one-third of municipal solid waste landfills. The EPA faces challenges in capturing landfill gas, even with regulations and incentives in place. Methane emissions continue, especially at smaller landfills and those closed before 1987. The production of landfill gas decreases over time, making it difficult to implement methane collection systems. EPA is reviewing the 1996 Landfill Gas Rule in response to the Administration's strategy to reduce methane emissions. The EPA revised the NSPS for new and modified landfills in 2016, lowering the emission threshold for gas collection systems to 34 metric tons of NMOC per year. Few landfills are expected to be affected by this change due to limited new constructions. The EPA revised standards for landfills in 2016, requiring emission control for 115 new or modified landfills by 2025. Methane emissions will be reduced by 44,000 metric tons annually, equivalent to 1.1 MMT of CO2. Landfills emitting over 34 metric tons of NMOC per year must install gas collection systems. Closed landfills remain subject to the 1996 threshold of 50 metric tons per year. EPA estimates lower emissions due to the new guidelines. The EPA estimates that emission control requirements will apply to 731 existing open and closed landfills, reducing methane emissions by 290,000 metric tons annually starting in 2025. This would result in a 5% reduction from current levels, with methane emissions primarily coming from fugitive releases such as leaks in infrastructure and vapors from landfills. One of the challenges in understanding methane emissions is obtaining consistent observational data. There are two main approaches to measuring these emissions: \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down.\" Bottom-up methods involve directly measuring emissions from various sources to calculate average emission factors, which are then multiplied by activity levels to estimate industry-wide emissions. The difference in data acquisition and analysis between these approaches has led to conflicting emission estimates. The inventory of methane emissions is based on statistical averages derived through computation, which may not reflect actual emissions in the field. Bottom-up approaches involve direct measurements, leading to considerable uncertainty due to variable data quality. In contrast, top-down methodologies use satellite observations and atmospheric measurements to infer emissions from industry sectors. Top-down methodologies for estimating methane emissions involve capturing emissions from natural, agricultural, and industrial activities. These studies are less common than bottom-up approaches and have shown higher emission estimates due to uncertainties in source attribution at the national level. Researchers may inaccurately attribute emissions from one sector to another, leading to discrepancies in reported emission rates. Researchers have identified inaccuracies in attributing emissions between man-made sectors, capturing unaccounted emissions like leakage from abandoned gas wells. Atmospheric measurements provide a more comprehensive view compared to component measurements, which use averaged emission factors. Current methane emission data in the US relies on EPA's Inventory, using a bottom-up approach based on IPCC guidelines supplemented with domestic information. Current inventories in the US, based on IPCC guidelines, use bottom-up methodologies for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Various stakeholders, including state and local agencies, have commissioned inventories leading to a range of emission estimates. Discrepancies in emission factors and industry reporting have resulted in periodic revisions to the EPA's Inventory, causing significant fluctuations in reporting, such as in natural gas systems emissions. The EPA's Inventory of greenhouse gas emissions in the US has fluctuated significantly over the past years due to changes in reporting methodology, making it challenging to analyze trends. Academic studies have criticized the Inventory for both over- and under-reporting methane releases from man-made sources, with examples showing discrepancies in methane emissions from landfills, gas-producing areas, and oil and gas figures. The White House Strategy aims to improve U.S. methane measurement by enhancing emission data and advancing monitoring technology. Actions include enhancing EPA's Inventory, funding for cost-effective measurement technologies at DOE, and maintaining a nationwide methane monitoring network. The White House Strategy aims to further develop a nationwide methane monitoring network through funding at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and improve emission modeling at EPA and DOE. EPA is working on a comprehensive strategy to enhance its methodology for estimating emissions from the oil and natural gas sector in response to recommendations from an inspector general report. The Strategy will address harmonizing reporting differences, reducing annual fluctuations in estimates, and providing transparent source data for credibility and fairness in rulemaking. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is used to assess the net costs and benefits of actions, considering both economic and human health impacts. Challenges arise when quantifying costs and benefits in monetary terms, and criticisms stem from benefits accruing to different parties than those bearing the costs. EPA and BLM considered costs and benefits in rulemakings related to the Administration's Methane Strategy, as required by statutes and executive orders. The Administration encourages agencies to consider cost-benefit analysis (CBA) when proposing regulations, aiming for options that yield net benefits to society. Regulatory agencies are required to develop CBA, Regulatory Impact Analysis, and other administrative addenda, as per executive orders. Compliance costs for industries include initial capital costs and annualized expenses. The agencies calculated compliance costs for the affected industry, including initial capital costs and annualized engineering costs. These costs were adjusted for estimated revenues generated from recovered natural gas and other products. Regulatory benefits were calculated in monetized and non-monetized terms, with monetized benefits from reductions in methane emissions valued using the social cost of methane (SC-CH4). Non-monetized benefits included improvements in ambient air quality and reductions in negative health effects from exposure to hazardous air pollutants. The agencies reported net monetized benefits of various regulations, including the final oil and gas NSPS, final landfill NSPS, and emissions guidelines. The estimated benefits were $180 million, $452 million, and $43-48 million in 2025, respectively. Some stakeholders questioned the agencies' assumptions regarding discount rates, product volumes, and the validity of metrics. Various stakeholders have sought policies to reduce, capture, and reuse methane emissions for economic, environmental, and public health reasons. Methane emissions are difficult to measure and control due to their natural presence, varied sources, and fugitive nature. Despite challenges, methane is a valuable resource with potential for control and recovery strategies. The effectiveness and cost-efficiency of control strategies depend on factors such as emission nature and extent. The economics of methane emissions capture depend on factors like emission nature, technology availability, and market prices. Industry and state regulators have made efforts to address methane emissions, with federal government support for research, technology development, and emission reduction initiatives. Recent data shows a 5% decrease in domestic methane emissions, mainly from landfills, coal mines, and natural gas systems. Some industries have made progress in reducing methane emissions through best practices and co-benefits from air pollution standards. However, other sources face challenges with control technologies and cost-effective solutions. Certain sources have seen increased emissions, while others have lacked viable technology solutions for decades. There is continued interest in addressing methane emissions, as shown by recent government strategies and proposals. The continued interest in addressing methane emissions is evident through recent government strategies and proposals. Key questions to consider include the adequacy of current measurement methodologies, the impact of rising domestic fossil fuel production, the trend in observed emissions, and the influence of market fluctuations on industry efforts to mitigate methane emissions. The text chunk discusses questions related to methane emissions in the natural gas industry, including the impact of industry changes on emissions, rulemaking for air pollutants, and strategies for reducing emissions from new and existing sources. It also raises the question of whether further reductions should be addressed by the government, state governments, industries, or the market. The text chunk raises questions about the distribution of GHG reduction burdens among different sources, the consideration of methane's environmental benefits, and recent legislative and executive initiatives related to methane emissions."
