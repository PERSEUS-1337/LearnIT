The Middle Rio Grande Emergency Water Supply Stabilization Act of 2003 amends the Flood Control Act of 1948 by making studies to reduce nonbeneficial water consumption in the Rio Grande flood plain. It is also known as Subtitle B and aims to stabilize emergency water supply. The Middle Rio Grande Emergency Water Supply Stabilization Act of 2003 aims to address wasteful water depletion, promote water conservation measures, and improve irrigation efficiencies in the Middle Rio Grande River in New Mexico. The Middle Rio Grande Emergency Water Supply Stabilization Act of 2003 aims to improve irrigation efficiencies within six years of enactment, confirming Congress' original intentions in the Colorado River Storage Project Act. The Middle Rio Grande Emergency Water Supply Stabilization Act of 2003 aims to improve irrigation efficiencies and authorize the initial stage of the San Juan-Chama Project for water supplies in the Rio Grande Basin, municipal, domestic, and industrial uses, as well as recreation and wildlife benefits. The Middle Rio Grande Emergency Water Supply Stabilization Act of 2003 defines key terms such as eligible entities, program, Secretary, and State. Eligible entities include organizations, municipalities, Indian Tribes, individuals, or other entities using water from the Rio Grande River in New Mexico. The program refers to the Middle Rio Grande Water Supply Stabilization Program, and the Secretary is the Secretary of the Interior. The Middle Rio Grande Water Supply Stabilization Program is established by the Secretary in cooperation with the State and the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program to promote water conservation measures in the Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico. The Secretary will enter into agreements and contribute up to 75 percent of the program's costs. The Middle Rio Grande Water Supply Stabilization Program, in cooperation with the State and the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program, aims to provide water conservation technical assistance, irrigation efficiency improvements, incentives for crop conversions, and municipal water measures in the Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico. The curr_chunk discusses measures to improve municipal and industrial water conservation programs, incentives for water rights dedication, establishment of a State program to enforce water rights, and designation of a State agency to administer the Program. The curr_chunk outlines the responsibilities of administering the Program, establishing guidelines for water conservation projects, and ensuring compliance with State water law. It also includes procedures to incorporate input from the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program. The curr_chunk discusses eligible agricultural water conservation projects under the Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program, including converting to less water-intensive crops and implementing irrigation efficiency infrastructure. Eligible irrigation efficiency infrastructure and measures include lining of canals, insulation of piping, installation of ditch portals, tail water return systems, low-energy precision applications, low-flow irrigation systems like drip irrigation. The eligible irrigation efficiency infrastructure and measures include low-flow irrigation systems such as drip and trickle systems, micro-sprinkler systems, spray jets, surge valves, conversion to low-flow sprinkler or drip systems, intake screens, fish passages, water measuring devices, and other measures determined by the Secretary. Additionally, control of phreatic vegetation is addressed. The Secretary will cooperate with New Mexico, water user organizations, and landowners to develop a program to remove phreatic vegetation in the Rio Grande River floodplain. State-of-the-art methods will be used to control and dispose of the vegetation, and native vegetation will be replanted. The Secretary will work with local communities and Pueblos to implement the program, and will enter into cost-sharing agreements with the State of New Mexico. Permission from private landowners is required before removing vegetation, and cooperation with various entities will be needed to quantify water in the Rio Grande River floodplain. The Secretary in New Mexico can quantify water salvaged by controlling phreatic vegetation and enter agreements for its long-term lease or purchase to meet the purposes of the Act. SEC. 225. COST SHARING. Non-Federal Share for water conservation programs and projects must be at least 25 percent and can be paid by the State, farm/ranch owners, nonprofit organizations, or other entities determined by the State. If a farm/ranch owner pays 50 percent or more for converting to a less water-intensive crop, the non-Federal share increases. When converting to a less water-intensive crop or implementing irrigation efficiency measures, the owner can use 50% of the water saved, as determined by the State. The Secretary is authorized to establish a permanent conservation pool for Rio Grande or San Juan-Chama water storage and release salvaged water for the Rio Grande River. Additionally, there is a collaborative program for the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act. The Secretary and the Secretary of the Army will participate in the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program as outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding. Additionally, there are provisions for water rights of Indian tribes and pueblos. The Secretary will provide financial assistance to Indian Tribes and Pueblos in the Middle Rio Grande Basin in New Mexico for determining water rights and conducting water resource studies. This assistance is not subject to cost-sharing requirements or reimbursable under Federal reclamation laws. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is reauthorized until 2008. The Secretary will collaborate with the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program for water supply projects in the Middle Rio Grande Basin. State water law and other requirements are also addressed. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is reauthorized until 2008. State water law and other requirements are addressed, including the protection of private property rights. The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is reauthorized until 2008, addressing state water law and private property rights protection. The Secretary can only sell or lease water to willing sellers or lessors, and private property cannot be condemned under this subtitle. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the provisions of the Water Desalination Act of 1996 until 2008. Federal costs for studies and water supply stabilization programs are not reimbursable under Federal reclamation laws."
