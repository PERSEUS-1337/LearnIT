    "content": "Despite international naval efforts to counter piracy in the waters off Somalia, attacks by Somali pirates have become more sophisticated and violent. Hostages are held longer for ransom payments averaging over $5 million per ship. While military presence in the Gulf of Aden has reduced attacks, pirates have adapted tactics to strike over 1,000 nautical miles off the Somali coast. The number of attacks in the region peaked in 2010 at 219 reported incidents. In 2010, there were 219 reported attacks by Somali pirates, with a decline in the Gulf of Aden but an increase east and south of Somalia. Pirate activity is affected by monsoon seasons, with a spike in attacks in the spring of 2011. Over 1,016 crew members were taken hostage in 2010, with some injured and killed. In the first three months of 2011, almost 100 vessels in the region reported being attacked, with 15 successful hijackings and approximately 300 hostages. Somali pirates were holding over 26 ships and 530 crew hostage while seeking ransoms. U.S. ships represent a small but high-profile percentage of those attacked by Somali pirates, with the Maersk Alabama deterring pirates with defensive maneuvers. In 2010, Somali pirates attacked two U.S. warships. The deaths of four Americans occurred during a pirate attack on the sailboat Quest in 2011. The Quest was hijacked near Oman and intercepted by U.S. Navy vessels. Pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a destroyer during negotiations with the FBI. In 2011, American hostages aboard the Quest were fatally shot during a rescue attempt by Navy SEALs. Somali pirates were killed during the raid, and 13 Somalis and 1 Yemeni were captured and indicted in Norfolk, VA. Mohammad Saaili Shibin, a pirate negotiator, was apprehended in Somalia and is the first piracy suspect captured onshore in Somalia to be tried in the United States. Several Somali pirates have been tried in the United States for various hijacking incidents. Ali Mohamed Ali was arrested in relation to the 2008 hijacking of a Danish vessel. In 2010, five Somalis involved in the attack on the USS Nicholas were convicted of piracy and given life sentences. Abduwali Abdiqadir Muse, involved in the 2009 Maersk Alabama hijacking, received a 34-year prison sentence. Six Somalis implicated in the 2010 attack were not convicted of piracy. In August 2010, a judge dismissed piracy charges against six Somalis involved in the attack on the USS Ashland. One defendant, Jama Idle Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to piracy conspiracy in a 2008 Danish ship attack and is serving a 30-year sentence. The remaining five defendants face other charges, with prosecutors appealing the piracy charge dismissal. Efforts are being made by the U.S. government and international community to prevent pirate attacks in the Horn of Africa waters. The U.S. Coast Guard has issued a warning advising against passage in high-risk waters due to piracy threats. U.S. registered yachts and sailing vessels are particularly vulnerable. Best Management Practices (BMPs) have been provided for mariners. Counter-piracy operations are ongoing in the region by the U.S. Navy, Combined Task Force 151, and NATO's Operation Ocean Shield. The European Union, NATO, China, and Russia have extended their counter-piracy missions through 2012. International coordination has improved, with China assisting EU forces in escorting relief shipments. The African Union has extended the mandate of their peacekeeping force in Somalia. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1964 approved AMISOM's mandate through September 2011. The United States has provided significant support to AMISOM and the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) security forces. AMISOM and TFG forces are facing attacks from Al Shabaab, with efforts focused on stabilizing Mogadishu. There are concerns about the TFG's legitimacy as its mandate nears expiration in August 2011. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported on piracy off Somalia to the Security Council in October 2010. The Secretary-General reported on piracy off Somalia to the Security Council in October 2010, emphasizing the importance of following best practices to reduce the risk of hijacking. He also highlighted the request for support from the TFG president to develop Somalia's security forces and address piracy. The African Union urged a holistic approach to the piracy issue, emphasizing the need to address underlying causes. The Security Council discussed the situation in Somalia and piracy threat in March 2011, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive strategy. In March 2011, the Security Council emphasized the need for a comprehensive strategy to promote peace and stability in Somalia and to address piracy. The Council discussed a report recommending the creation of specialized piracy courts in Somalia to overcome obstacles in prosecuting Somali pirates. Resolution 1976, passed in April, called for increased efforts to establish governance and the rule of law in Somalia, expressing concern about suspected pirates being released without trial. Piracy has reemerged as a global security threat in various regions, including the Horn of Africa, West Africa, India, South China Sea, Strait of Malacca, and the Caribbean. Pirates operate in areas with large coastal regions, high commercial activity, weak naval forces, and limited security cooperation. Worldwide piracy rates peaked in the early 2000s but declined by 2005. In 2007, almost half of reported pirate attacks occurred in African waters, particularly near Nigeria and Somalia. The increase in pirate attacks off Somalia has brought renewed international attention to piracy in African waters. In 2009, 217 out of 406 worldwide attacks occurred off the coast of Somalia, and in 2010, 219 out of 445 reported attacks took place in the waters off the Horn. The U.S. National Maritime Security Strategy highlighted pirates as threats to global maritime security. The increase in pirate attacks off Somalia has brought renewed international attention to piracy in African waters. In 2009, 217 out of 406 worldwide attacks occurred off the coast of Somalia, and in 2010, 219 out of 445 reported attacks took place in the waters off the Horn. The U.S. National Maritime Security Strategy highlighted pirates as threats to global maritime security. The bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 and the French oil tanker MV Limburg in 2002 illustrated the threat of potential maritime terrorism in the region. The United States established Combined Task Force 150 to combat terrorism and increased military assistance to regional navies. In 2009, Combined Task Force 151 was established to perform anti-piracy operations in the Horn of Africa region. The international community responded to piracy off Somalia with the launch of EU NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA in December 2008. The European Union launched EU NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA in December 2008 as the first naval operation under the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia. NATO also initiated Operation Ocean Shield, and regional navies deployed ships to secure vessels. The collaborative regional response in East Africa mirrored successful efforts in Southeast Asia, but eradicating piracy in the Horn of Africa remains challenging due to the vast, remote areas where pirates operate and Somalia's governance issues. Several pirate groups operate in Somali waters, with 7 to 10 distinct gangs financed by \"instigators\" organizing funding and operations. These groups are based in various locations along the Somali coast, making it challenging to respond effectively. Somalia's transitional government lacks the capacity to prosecute pirates, and few countries are willing to prosecute those apprehended in international operations. Pirate groups operate along the Somali coast from Hobyo to Kismayo, with concerns raised about attacks in the region. The groups claim to have maritime security training but are now attracting young Somali men to piracy. Pirate groups in Somalia, particularly in the northern region of Puntland, continue to recruit young men for piracy activities. Local officials in Puntland have been accused of facilitating and profiting from piracy, despite some efforts to crack down on the activity. The UN Monitoring Group reported that key leaders in Puntland have received proceeds from piracy and provided protection to pirate militias, leading to political protests from Puntland authorities. The TFG and Puntland authorities collaborated on anti-piracy efforts, with some success in pushing pirates out of Eyl to Garacad. Puntland developed a basic coast guard, but its capabilities remain limited. Relations between Puntland and the TFG soured in 2011 due to perceived lack of consultation. The government has enlisted a private security company to train and equip its maritime force in Somalia, where poverty and lack of employment contribute to the rise of piracy. Pirate activity and ransom revenues have increased significantly in the past three years. Somalia's economy and population are increasingly dependent on piracy, with an average ransom of over $5.4 million in 2010. U.N. officials argue that piracy deprives northern Somalia of job-creating investments, linked to illegal fishing and dumping in Somali waters. Somali pirates attribute their activities to these trends, as the country has lost its ability to patrol its waters over time. Piracy in Somalia has led to disruptions in the coastal economy, with estimates suggesting annual losses of $95 million due to illegal fishing. The Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia highlighted the connection between piracy, illegal fishing, and toxic waste dumping, which harm the Somali economy and marine environment. The regional fishing industry has also suffered due to the piracy threat. The threat of piracy has significantly damaged the tuna fishing industry in the Indian Ocean, leading to a 30% decrease in catches in 2008. This has had a major impact on countries like the Seychelles and Yemen, with Somali pirate groups becoming well-equipped and effective in their operations. Somali pirates use small arms and fishing skiffs with outboard motors to target larger vessels like tankers, cargo ships, and cruise ships. Somali pirates initially targeted ships in the west Indian Ocean but shifted focus to the Gulf of Aden due to a concentration of merchant ships. With international naval patrols in the Gulf of Aden, pirates have now moved back to the Indian Ocean, operating over 1,000 nautical miles from the Somali coastline. Somali pirates operate over 1,000 nautical miles from the Somali coastline with the help of \"mother ships,\" larger fishing vessels commandeered through piracy. There are suspicions of financing and supply support from Somali businessmen and international networks in exchange for ransom shares. The IMB disputes claims of intelligence support for targeting vessels. Somali piracy off the Horn of Africa involves pirates randomly selecting vessels for boarding, refueling in Yemen, and taking hostages for ransom. Unlike piracy in other regions, Somali pirates often hold the crew hostage in exchange for payments due to their sanctuary on land in Somalia. Pirates in Somalia have a sanctuary on land and in territorial waters to launch attacks and hold hijacked ships during ransom negotiations. Maritime security forces face challenges due to the quick boarding of ships by pirates, leaving little time for naval intervention. Naval ships need to arrive within 15 to 30 minutes to prevent a ship's capture, but their speed may cause delays in reaching the scene. Pirates in Somalia often move hijacked ships to an anchorage off the coast for ransom negotiations. Hostages may be kept on their own vessel or transferred to a larger one. Ransom negotiations involve satellite phones, intermediaries, and public relations efforts. The length of negotiations has increased, with hostages facing three to four months of captivity on average. The average length of captivity for hostages held by Somali pirates doubled from 2009 to 2010, with some hostages, like the British couple Paul and Rachel Chandler, being held for over a year. While most pirate groups have not wantonly harmed captives, there is an increasing willingness to use violence to capture ships. The number of vessels fired upon by Somali pirates tripled from 2008 to 2010, indicating a worsening situation according to the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence. Pirates have adapted to mariners' self-defense measures, using RPGs to breach ships' safe rooms. Navies avoid risky rescue operations, opting for negotiations or ransom. High-profile rescue attempts have led to threats of revenge and hostage killings. In 2009, a French citizen died during a rescue operation off the Somali coast. In January 2011, South Korean commandos rescued the crew of the tanker Samho Jewelry from pirates, but the captain was shot. The deaths of four Americans on the Quest in February 2011 highlight the dangers of hostage situations. The difficulty in distinguishing pirate vessels from legitimate ships poses challenges for naval forces. In November 2008, the Indian navy mistakenly attacked an innocent Thai commercial trawler, thinking it was a pirate ship. Ransom payments to pirates are controversial as they can encourage further attacks. Pirates in the Horn of Africa continue attacks, investing ransom earnings in weaponry and fortifying bases. Local authorities lack resources to combat piracy, with revenues estimated at $80 million in 2009. The strategic location of the region increases its importance for international security and commerce. In 2009, a significant amount of oil passed through the Bab el Mandeb strait, a busy shipping lane connecting the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The region is crucial for trade between Asia and East Africa, with ships heading to the Kenyan port of Mombasa being particularly vulnerable to security disruptions. U.S. commercial vessels, including those carrying Department of Defense and humanitarian cargo, transit the area daily. The threat of piracy in the region inflicts direct and secondary economic costs on the international community, estimated between $7 billion and $12 billion per year. These costs include insurance, ransoms, self-protection measures, rerouting, naval operations, and piracy prosecutions. Piracy also impacts regional trade, tourism, fishing industries, and food prices. The shipping industry incurs economic costs such as ransom payments, damage to ships and cargoes, delays in cargo deliveries, increased maritime insurance rates, and expenses to protect merchant ships. Some of these costs are passed on to consumers. In May 2008, the Gulf of Aden was designated a \"war-risk\" zone by Lloyd's of London, leading to increased insurance premiums for ships passing through the area. War risk insurance premiums for vessels in the Indian Ocean have risen significantly, with some reaching up to $150,000 per ship, per voyage. American shipping companies are not affected by these cost pressures due to piracy being excluded from their hull clauses. The U.S. Maritime War Risk Insurance Program excludes piracy from hull clauses, keeping rates stable. American insurers have not paid ransom for piracy, keeping insurance rates steady for vessels leaving the United States. London-based firms are willing to pay ransom for lower amounts compared to the value of ships and cargo. Hull insurance policies issued in London used to cover ransom payments before 2009. Some London-based marine underwriters shifted from covering piracy under hull policies to war risk policies in 2009 due to increased vessel seizures and ransom demands in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. This change aimed to address ambiguity in coverage for piracy, including marine kidnap and ransom. War risk policies now cover these perils, eliminating the need for separate marine kidnap and ransom insurance. The payment of occasional ransoms in the event of vessel seizure has kept the level of violence associated with piracy relatively low. Ship operators and governments may view this as a regrettable but necessary cost compared to rerouting ships or arming them. The United States actively discourages paying ransoms to pirates, as it only encourages more kidnappings. Piracy also hinders the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Horn of Africa, where millions of people require food assistance. The US has provided significant aid to Ethiopia and Somalia to address these needs. In 2011, one-third of the population in Somalia may need food aid due to crop failure and poor livestock conditions. The delivery of U.S. aid is hindered by security issues. High food and fuel prices worsen food insecurity in the region. Al Shabaab militants have disrupted food assistance operations. In January 2010, operations in southern Somalia were suspended due to threats and intimidation. Canada, NATO, and the European Union escorted WFP shipments since late 2008. China's navy offered assistance to EU forces in March 2010. Piracy threats to relief efforts were highlighted in April 2009 when U.S.-flagged vessels were hijacked by Somali pirates. In April 2009, a U.S.-flagged vessel delivering food aid to Djibouti was seized by Somali pirates en route to Mombasa, Kenya. The crew of U.S. citizens attempted to free the ship's captain, Richard Phillips, who was held hostage. The USS Bainbridge and FBI conducted hostage negotiations, leading to a rescue operation by U.S. Special Forces authorized by President Obama. Three pirates were killed, and one, Abdiwali Abdiqadir Muse, was transferred to the U.S. for trial. Abdiqadir Muse was convicted and sentenced to 34 years in prison in the U.S. for piracy-related charges. Concerns were raised about potential retaliation from pirates after a rescue operation. A pirate leader threatened revenge against American citizens, leading to an attack on the U.S.-flagged vessel Liberty Sun in April 2009. The Liberty Sun was attacked by pirates in retaliation for the killing of their friends. The Maersk Alabama successfully defended against pirate attacks using armed security teams and evasive maneuvers. The Horn of Africa faces ongoing armed conflicts and armed banditry, with concerns about the small arms trade fueling instability despite a U.N. arms embargo on Somalia. The lack of enforcement of the arms embargo in Somalia has allowed easy access to weapons for pirates, leading to a growth in piracy. There are concerns that ransom money is being used to finance weapons for pirates. Boats used for piracy are also used for smuggling refugees and arms. US Navy officials found no financial ties between Al Shabaab fighters and Somali pirates in 2009. The Canadian intelligence assessment in December 2009 described an \"Islamist extremism-piracy nexus\" where Al Shabaab personnel provided weapons and training to pirates in exchange for a share of the spoils. Recent U.N. reports suggest that while no formal alliances exist, there are local agreements allowing pirate gangs to operate in Somalia with the approval of some Al Shabaab leaders in exchange for a cut of the ransom money. Al Shabaab militants have reportedly demanded a 20% share of ransom payments from a pirate gang in Harardhere. Piracy off the Horn of Africa is linked to wider instability in Somalia since the 1990s. The Transitional Federal Government has struggled to establish a functional government and security forces. The U.S. has supported reconciliation efforts and coordinated responses to piracy and terrorism in the region. Al Shabaab militants have demanded a 20% share of ransom payments from a pirate gang in Harardhere. The international community, led by the United Nations Security Council, is actively coordinating diplomatic and military responses to piracy threats in Somalia. International donors are providing funds to support the development of security forces by the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to combat pirates on land. Efforts are also being made to prosecute and imprison pirates in the region. The U.N. Security Council has authorized third-party governments to conduct anti-piracy operations in Somali territorial waters to address the immediate threat to international navigation. The international community, led by the United Nations Security Council, is actively coordinating diplomatic and military responses to piracy threats in Somalia. Third-party governments are authorized to conduct anti-piracy operations in Somali territorial waters with coordination from the TFG. Roughly 3 dozen combatant ships are patrolling the region, with attacks continuing in the west Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. Regional bodies have issued policy statements condemning piracy and providing guidance for coordinated responses. The U.S. National Maritime Security Strategy emphasizes the safety and economic security of the United States. The Bush Administration's strategy in 2005 emphasized the importance of secure oceans and identified pirates and criminals as threats to maritime security. In 2007, a policy was adopted to repress piracy and violence at sea, urging international cooperation. An implementation plan in 2008 focused on addressing piracy threats in the Horn of Africa region. The NSC's \"Countering Piracy off the Horn of Africa: Partnership and Action Plan\" aimed to repress piracy in the region. The \"Horn of Africa: Partnership and Action Plan\" aimed to repress piracy in the region by preventing attacks, disrupting piracy acts, and holding pirates accountable. The Bush Administration formed an interagency Counter-Piracy Steering Group to address anti- and counter-piracy efforts. The Counter-Piracy Steering Group, led by the State Department and Defense Department, coordinates U.S. efforts in anti-piracy initiatives since 2008. This includes supporting international initiatives like the Contact Group on Piracy and regional coordination centers. The Obama Administration continued the efforts initiated by the Bush Administration. The Obama Administration endorsed the Bush Administration's strategic approach to piracy threats, providing material assistance to the Somali Transitional Federal Government and engaging with leaders from Puntland and Somaliland. The U.S. remains active in the multilateral CGPCS and supports the \"New York Declaration\" initiative for maritime security best practices. The Obama Administration supports regional states in anti-piracy efforts through bilateral assistance programs and trust funds. They aim to establish governance, rule of law, security, and economic development in Somalia. The Maritime Security Sector Reform guide provides a framework for interagency assistance programs in the maritime security domain. The 2010 GAO assessment of the Obama Administration's counter-piracy strategy found that the effectiveness of U.S. resources in combating piracy was unclear due to a lack of cost tracking and evaluation. Progress on key efforts like strategic communications, disrupting pirate finances, and holding pirates accountable was lacking. These efforts were identified as priorities by the U.S. and its international partners in 2010. President Obama signed Executive Order 13536 on April 12, 2010, declaring acts of piracy off the coast of Somalia as a threat to national security. The order allows the Treasury Department to block property of individuals supporting piracy in Somalia. Notable individuals identified include Abshir Abdullahi \"Boyah\" and Mohamed Abdi Garaad. The UN Security Council has issued resolutions to combat Somali piracy, authorizing states to enter Somalia's territorial waters to repress piracy. Notable individuals involved in piracy activities include a maritime militia commander and a principal organizer and financier named Mohamed Abdi Garaad. Garaad has taken responsibility for attacks on vessels like the Maersk Alabama and the Liberty Sun. Resolution 1851, adopted in December 2008, expanded the mandate to combat piracy in Somalia by authorizing states and regional organizations to take necessary measures at the request of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG). The resolution emphasizes the importance of conducting these measures in accordance with humanitarian and human rights laws. Resolutions 1897 and 1950 later extended the mandates. Resolution 1846, 1851, 1897, and 1950 extended mandates for combating piracy in Somalia and authorized technical assistance and weapons supply to enhance coastal security. The U.N. sanctions committee required prior notification for assistance to Somali security institutions. The African Union and TFG sought to lift the U.N. arms embargo to bolster forces fighting Islamist groups. The U.N. Security Council adopted resolutions to combat piracy in Somalia, including Resolution 1897 which encouraged states to allow law enforcement officials on anti-piracy vessels for prosecution. Resolution 1918 required the Secretary-General to report on options for prosecuting piracy suspects. The Secretary-General's report in July 2010 identified options for prosecuting piracy suspects off the coast of Somalia, emphasizing the need for capacity building assistance for regional governments. Jack Lang was appointed as the Special Advisor on legal issues related to piracy, and the Security Council expressed support for establishing governance and the rule of law in Somalia. The Security Council expressed support for establishing governance and the rule of law in Somalia in Resolution 1976, considering the formation of specialized Somali courts. The Bush Administration led the creation of a multilateral Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) to address piracy issues, focusing on operational support, coordination, judicial frameworks, shipping capabilities, diplomatic efforts, and tracking financial flows related to piracy. The Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) focuses on improving operational coordination, information sharing, and legal enforcement activities among international actors combating piracy in the region. The CGPCS has approximately 60 member governments and 7 regional organizations, with meetings in 2010 discussing updates on working group efforts and making appeals for donations to counter-piracy trust funds and additional maritime resources. The Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) has requested more robust global efforts to combat piracy, improve interagency coordination, and track and freeze piracy-related funds. The group's recent meeting in March 2011 in New York focused on developing a strategy to address the financial aspects of piracy, with U.S. officials leading efforts to enhance self-defense practices in the shipping and insurance industries. Since May 2009, the United States and other governments have committed to best management practices to prevent piracy in the shipping industry. The International Maritime Organization has been leading international anti-piracy efforts since the late 1990s, with a focus on improving cooperation in regions like the Horn of Africa. Consultation meetings and a draft cooperative framework agreement have been developed to enhance security in the region. In early 2008, a framework agreement was established. In January 2009, 17 regional governments adopted a Code of Conduct on piracy in the western Indian Ocean and Gulf of Aden. Most governments have signed the Code, with support from regional facilities in Kenya, Tanzania, and Yemen. Japan contributed $14 million to a trust fund for training and capacity building related to the agreement. The IMO is supporting Djibouti Code-related training and capacity building operations to align national anti-piracy legislation with the Code. The Djibouti Code of Conduct discussions have led to greater cooperation between Somali TFG, Somaliland, and Puntland, forming a technical committee in 2010. They agreed on an anti-piracy law, laws on prisoner transfer, and signed a memorandum of understanding in April 2010 for cooperation on counter-piracy issues. Puntland and Somaliland have arrested suspected pirates for trial. The Regional Co-operation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against ships in Asia (ReCAAP) was established in 2006 to coordinate responses to piracy in the Strait of Malacca region. The ReCAAP Information Sharing Center in Singapore serves as the main piracy reporting and response coordination hub. This, along with other regional agreements between Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, has successfully reduced piracy in the area. The Malacca region highlighted issues of sovereignty, territorial water rights, and foreign military presence in regional waters. Responses to piracy in the Horn of Africa include changes in shipping navigation patterns, use of countermeasures like water cannons and fire hoses, and development of best practices to resist pirate attacks. The use of safe rooms, or \"citadels\" by crew during attacks has proven successful in avoiding capture. Debates about armed guards continue among industry representatives, government officials, and observers worldwide. The IMO and other bodies have developed detailed guidance known as \"Best Management Practices\" to prevent pirate attacks on commercial vessels. The IMB manages a 24-hour piracy reporting center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, serving as a global hub for piracy reporting and information distribution for commercial vessels. They work with regional centers to collect and disseminate threat reporting. U.S. Naval Forces Central Command commands Combined Maritime Forces operating in various regions, including establishing Combined Task Force 151 in 2009. In January 2009, Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151) was established to conduct anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somali coast in the Indian Ocean. CTF-150 continues to focus on counterterrorism and maritime security operations. The Maritime Security Patrol Area (MSPA) in the Gulf of Aden has helped reduce Somali pirate activity by creating Internationally Recommended Transit Corridors (IRTC) for commercial vessels. Combined Task Force 151 (CTF-151) was established in January 2009 to conduct anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somali coast. U.S.-flagged vessels transiting the Gulf of Aden are directed to use the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridors (IRTC) for their voyages. CTF-151 consists of personnel and ships from 25 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and others. The task force is currently under the command of the Singapore Navy and operates from the TCG Gokceada, with coordination from the NAVCENT command center in Bahrain. U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) are also involved in operations. Other countries like Russia, China, and India have deployed naval forces to the region for monitoring and anti-piracy operations. While not fully coordinated with CTF-151, ongoing communication efforts exist through the military coordination mechanism known as Shared Awareness and De-confliction (SHADE). China agreed to assign a naval vessel to patrol the IRTC in coordination with CTF-151 and other coalition forces in January 2010. China's engagement in the Horn of Africa region, particularly in anti-piracy efforts, has drawn interest from naval observers and officials in the United States. Recent incidents involving Chinese sailors being captured by Somali pirates have highlighted China's willingness to protect international shipping lanes far from its shores. China's offer to assist European Union naval forces with escort operations for the World Food Program indicates a potential expansion of its naval deployment in the region. In October 2008, NATO deployed Standing NATO Maritime Groups to combat piracy in the Horn of Africa region. Operation Allied Provider protected World Food Program shipments, later transitioning responsibilities to the European Union's Operation ATALANTA. In March 2009, NATO launched Operation Allied Protector to deter pirate activities in the Arabian Sea. In April 2009, NATO cancelled planned visits to Singapore and Australia for the Maritime Group, extending Operation Allied Protector until June 20, 2009. In August 2009, Operation Allied Protector was replaced by Operation Ocean Shield under SNMG2. NATO extended the operation through 2012, focusing on deterring piracy and capacity building with regional governments. The Group flagship hosted officials from Puntland and visited the Somali port of Bossaso. In January 2011, the Dutch commander of Operation Ocean Shield met with his Chinese counterpart at sea for consultations. Ships involved in the operation included HNLMS Tromp, USS Bainbridge, HDMS Esbern Snare, USS Stephen W Groves, and TCG Giresun. In December 2008, the European Union launched EU NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA to protect WFP and merchant vessels. EU NAVFOR Operation ATALANTA was launched by the European Union in December 2008 to protect merchant vessels from acts of piracy and armed robbery in specific areas. The operation was extended through December 2012, involving up to 20 ships and over 1,800 personnel. Several EU member states and Norway have made contributions to the operation, with Finland joining in February 2011. EU NAVFOR established the Maritime Security Center-Horn of Africa for ships to report movements and receive threat information. Around 17 countries have prosecuted over 800 pirates, but prosecutions have not deterred young Somalis from joining pirate gangs due to perceived lack of punishment. Experts highlight the challenge of prosecuting pirates due to jurisdictional issues and a \"catch and release\" practice by international naval forces. Only a small percentage of pirates captured are prosecuted, with limited success in holding them accountable. The CGPCS approved an anti-piracy trust fund in 2010, managed by UNODC, to improve prosecution and detention in countries like Seychelles, Kenya, and Somalia. Kenya has taken on the most pirate prosecutions but faces limitations in continuing to do so. The Seychelles and Kenya face limitations in prosecuting and imprisoning pirate suspects captured by international navies. In 2010, Seychelles sentenced nine pirates to 22 years each, and Kenya's prisons have received improvements funded by a trust. The UN report by Jack Lang suggests 25 proposals for countries to prosecute and imprison pirates, urging universal jurisdiction for piracy crimes. Several countries are working towards incorporating piracy as a crime in their domestic laws. The report by Lang proposes universal jurisdiction for piracy acts and suggests creating specialized piracy courts in Somaliland and Puntland. It also recommends establishing a Somali extraterritorial court in Arusha to handle prosecutions. Under the proposal, specialized piracy courts would be established in Somaliland and Puntland, with universal jurisdiction for piracy acts. UNODC aims to have the Puntland and extraterritorial court operational within 8 months, following efforts to improve correctional capacity. Recent rehabilitation of a prison and training of staff in Hargeisa are crucial for addressing concerns about harsh prison conditions. UNODC, under Resolution 1851, is implementing a project to enhance regional law enforcement participation in anti-piracy efforts. The project aims to enhance regional law enforcement participation in anti-piracy efforts off the coast of Somalia by providing judicial capacity building assistance and facilitating \"shiprider\" arrangements. Shiprider agreements help address logistical and legal challenges in multilateral naval enforcement efforts in remote areas. The UNODC is assisting regional governments in anti-piracy efforts by providing judicial capacity building assistance and coordinating with donors. Somali piracy poses a global threat to free navigation in the Gulf of Aden and the west Indian Ocean, with limited attacks on U.S. vessels. The U.S. government is involved in addressing this issue. The U.S. government, along with other foreign governments, views piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the west Indian Ocean as a direct threat to national security interests. Policies to address this threat have been revisited and enhanced by the Obama Administration, with ongoing funding and oversight from Congress. Despite naval patrols deterring some attacks, the risk of piracy in the region is unlikely to disappear in the near term. The U.S. government and other foreign governments consider piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the west Indian Ocean a national security threat. Despite naval patrols deterring some attacks, the risk of piracy remains. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concerns about the effectiveness of international counter-piracy patrols and the ongoing payment of ransoms exacerbating the problem. The State Department, in collaboration with the Department of Defense, is developing a comprehensive approach to address acts of piracy in African waters, which pose a transnational security threat. The unstable regional context in Somalia and Yemen highlights the need for improved maritime capabilities and regional coordination. International partners are using various policy tools to address the complex security circumstances. Partners have utilized policy tools in addressing complex security situations in various regions, including ongoing U.S. and international security operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Colombia. Military intervention and foreign assistance require political consensus, will, local partnership, and coordination for success. Maritime security efforts in the Persian Gulf, the Caribbean, West Africa waters, and the Strait of Malacca have similar requirements. While short-term results in containing transnational threats are achievable, long-term elimination without committed regional and local actors is uncertain. Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of targeting land-based ports in resolving security challenges. The problem of Somali piracy will not be solved militarily, as it stems from Somalia's state failure. Despite international efforts, piracy continues to increase due to economic incentives. Most captured pirates are released due to lack of evidence or political will for prosecution. Addressing these concerns requires additional international efforts, including using force against pirate strongholds in coastal towns. Addressing Somali piracy in coastal towns would require significant military planning and resources to minimize civilian casualties. Estimates suggest that up to 60 naval ships may be needed to fully suppress piracy in the Gulf of Aden alone. The Indian Ocean off Somalia's eastern coast, a much larger area, would likely require an even larger number of ships. The 111th Congress explored options for protecting maritime traffic in the Horn of Africa region and globally through H.R. 3376, the U.S. Mariner and Vessel Protection Act of 2009. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2010 aimed to eliminate liability for monetary damages in cases of self-defense against piracy at sea. This bill also directed the Coast Guard to work with the IMO to promote anti-piracy action and ensure similar limitations on liability. These provisions were incorporated into the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2010 aimed to eliminate liability for monetary damages in cases of self-defense against piracy at sea. Section 3506 of the Act required vessels in high-risk piracy areas to have non-lethal defense measures. Congress emphasized the need to address piracy both at sea and on land. The 111th Congress expressed concern about safe havens for Somali pirates and the lack of a strategy to deal with them. Resolutions commended efforts to combat piracy and called for a comprehensive strategy to address the issue. The 112th Congress is addressing the issue of piracy, particularly Somali pirate attacks. There is a debate on U.S. efforts to combat piracy, including tracking ransom payments and analyzing pirate finances to identify leaders and financiers. The GAO found that agencies are not systematically analyzing pirate finances. Legislation has not been introduced yet. The 112th Congress has not introduced legislation related to maritime piracy in the waters off Somalia. U.S. military engagement in the region is divided between U.S. Central Command and U.S. Africa Command. The U.S. military's anti-piracy response has been mainly at sea, with AFRICOM providing security assistance to regional maritime security forces. The U.S. military's anti-piracy operations in the waters off Somalia involve Navy forces associated with CTF-151 and NATO's Operation Ocean Shield. U.S. Navy ships support these operations, with additional ships affecting the Navy's global mission capabilities. The U.S. has also conducted anti-terrorism activities in the Horn of Africa and Yemen for over a decade, with a significant military presence in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier since 2003. The command authority for CJTF-HOA has been transferred to AFRICOM, focusing on countering violent extremism and building regional military capacity. CJTF-HOA personnel provide training on counter-terrorism, maritime security, disaster response, and peacekeeping in East Africa and Yemen. The U.S. conducts maritime security assistance programs in Kenya to address various threats. The U.S. supports regional Maritime Center of Excellence in Mombasa and installs radar systems in African countries for maritime domain awareness. Congress expanded Section 1206 authority to include assistance for civilian maritime security forces for counterterrorism operations. Several programs in FY2009 aim to increase maritime capacity to address terrorist threats in waters affected by Somali piracy. AFRICOM collaborates with Seychelles government on maritime security. In August 2009, AFRICOM and the Seychelles government announced an agreement for Operation Ocean Look, allowing the U.S. military to conduct maritime surveillance using aircraft and drones from the Seychelles. The Obama Administration may expand assistance programs for regional and Somali actors to combat piracy, subject to congressional approval and in line with U.N. Security Council resolutions. Peacekeeping Operations funding has been allocated for equipment and logistical support. The Obama Administration has allocated Peacekeeping Operations funding to support the African Union Mission in Somalia and Somali security sector reform. The funding aims to enhance Somali capacity to counter threats from insurgents and terrorists, potentially improving government forces' ability to assert security control and benefit anti-piracy operations in the future. The Administration is requesting $51 million in FY2012 PKO funding for these programs. Although there were reports in 2009 about potential U.S. military attacks against pirate strongholds, U.S. defense officials clarified that the focus is on supporting anti-piracy efforts through Security Council Resolution 1851. The Obama Administration has allocated funding to support anti-piracy operations in Somalia, but there are no U.S. military plans for land operations. The U.S. government is encouraging Somali authorities to take action against pirate safe havens. Legal issues, due process for pirate suspects, and the role of foreign military forces complicate anti-piracy efforts in the Horn of Africa region. Legal jurisdictional issues arise in anti-piracy operations in the Horn of Africa region, with multiple governments potentially asserting jurisdiction based on various factors. However, many governments lack the laws and capacity to prosecute suspected pirates effectively. The prosecution of juvenile pirates is also a developing legal concern. Some Somali pirates are teenage minors, potentially invoking a defense of infancy in certain jurisdictions. Bilateral agreements have been established by the US, UK, EU, and others with governments in the Horn of Africa region, particularly Kenya, for the detention, transfer, and prosecution of captured pirate suspects. Kenya was the first country in the region to exercise universal jurisdiction in 2006. In 2009, Kenya sentenced 50 Somalis for piracy crimes. However, in March 2010, they suspended accepting new pirate suspects for prosecution. Kenya's courts ruled they lacked jurisdiction to try pirates captured outside their territorial waters. Kenya held over 120 piracy suspects in early 2011. The Seychelles and Tanzania also agreed to prosecute pirates. The US DOJ conducted piracy workshops for foreign prosecutors. The U.S. Department of Justice has conducted piracy workshops for foreign prosecutors, police, and maritime security personnel. International donors, including the UNODC and the European Commission, are providing capacity building assistance to combat piracy. Efforts are being made to enhance the law enforcement and judicial capacities of neighboring states to prosecute Somali pirates. However, a significant challenge remains in determining where to incarcerate apprehended pirates. Efforts are being made to enhance the law enforcement and judicial capacities of neighboring states to prosecute Somali pirates. However, a significant challenge remains in determining where to incarcerate apprehended pirates. International navies have apprehended hundreds of suspected pirates in recent years, but many countries in the region lack prison capacity. The United Nations and international Contact Group are exploring new mechanisms to expand options for incarceration in Somalia and the broader region. UNODC is working to improve corrections facilities in Puntland and Somaliland. U.S. MARAD issues guidance to ensure safety for vessels in the Horn of Africa region. Current guidance for U.S.-flagged vessels seeking escort support from the U.S. Navy and Combined Maritime Forces in coalition naval security operations in the region has been updated by international bodies like the International Maritime Organization and the International Maritime Bureau. Recommendations include measures to reduce the risk of pirate attacks, such as rerouting ships to avoid known pirate waters and implementing effective watch procedures during transit to detect and prevent attacks. These measures aim to enhance safety and security for merchant ships and their crews. Implementing measures to reduce the risk of pirate attacks, such as higher ship speeds, evasive maneuvers, denial systems, crew training, and arming merchant ships with armed security teams or crew members, is crucial for enhancing safety and security at sea. Some advocate for on-ship security to serve as a deterrent or respond to attacks due to limited naval assets' responsiveness to piracy incidents. Some argue that arming merchant ships with trained crew members to handle weapons is not a financial burden. However, some ship owners oppose arming ships due to practical and financial reasons. US officials are concerned about security risks posed by armed merchant ships visiting US ports. Private gun battles with pirates can increase violence in piracy off Somalia, putting all merchant mariners at risk. Untrained crews may not effectively use firearms against pirates, increasing the likelihood of crew casualties. Arming merchant ships with lighter firearms may not effectively counter pirates with heavier weapons, like rocket-propelled grenades. Financial concerns and liability risks may discourage arming ships, as hiring armed security teams could be more expensive than paying ransoms. Restrictions on weapons at ports could make it difficult for commercial ships to operate along certain routes. Private companies and shipping companies are facing challenges operating along certain routes due to restrictions on carrying firearms. Security firms are putting in significant effort to ensure legal compliance. The IMO advises against seafarers carrying firearms for personal protection, leaving the decision to use unarmed security personnel to individual shipowners. The use of armed security personnel or law enforcement officers authorized by the flag State should be subject to flag State regulations. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 required a report on facilitating armed private security teams on U.S. flagged commercial vessels in high-risk areas, including eliminating restrictions, negotiating bilateral agreements, and developing common training standards. The report was delivered to Congress in February 2010. The report delivered to Congress in February 2010 details U.S. efforts to coordinate with foreign port authorities on armed security teams for U.S. flagged commercial vessels. Ship owners considering arming their vessels against piracy should be aware of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (ACEA). ITAR requires U.S. persons to obtain a license for exporting or importing defense articles and services. ITAR requires U.S. persons to obtain a license for exporting or importing defense articles listed on the United States Munitions List, including firearms and ammunition for vessel defense. Ship owners must obtain a license for temporary export of covered armaments. The ITAR regulation requires U.S. persons to obtain a license for exporting firearms and ammunition for vessel defense. An exception allows temporary export of a limited number of firearms and cartridges without a license, as long as certain conditions are met. This exception may be used by owners to arm their vessels, as \"U.S. person\" includes entities like corporations and partnerships. Individual crew members may also be able to temporarily export firearms. The ITAR regulation allows temporary export of firearms for vessel defense under certain conditions. However, using privately owned weapons to defend corporate property can lead to legal liability issues. The exception does not override prohibitions on exports to certain countries, and obtaining a license or exemption does not address foreign countries' laws on carrying weapons in their territorial waters. Vessel owners are responsible for complying with foreign laws. Some suggest that U.S. and international naval vessels should provide convoy. Some argue for U.S. and international naval vessels to protect ships in the Horn of Africa, specifically the Gulf of Aden, through convoy services. Supporters believe this would reduce risks of attacks by decreasing response times. However, merchant ship operators may be hesitant due to potential delays and costs associated with waiting for convoys. Establishing and maintaining a convoy system without addressing root causes of piracy could lead to high costs. The current MARAD advisory allows U.S.-flagged vessels to request escort services from U.S. military headquarters in Bahrain for protection in the Gulf of Aden. This could involve Navy or Coast Guard vessels escorting commercial ships, similar to past operations in the Persian Gulf. If Navy ships in the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf region were redirected to escort U.S.-flagged ships in the Gulf of Aden, there would be additional financial costs. The potential advantages of escorting U.S.-flagged commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden need to be weighed against the opportunity cost of Navy ships not performing their currently assigned missions in the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf region. These missions include engagement activities, humanitarian assistance, intelligence operations, counterterrorism, deterrence, and crisis response. Policymakers must consider the trade-off between escorting ships and maintaining Navy capacity for other missions in the region. If Navy ships deployed to other regions like the Mediterranean or Western Pacific were diverted to escort U.S.-flagged commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden, there would be additional fuel costs. However, this cost would be relatively small compared to annual Navy ship operation costs. The opportunity cost of not performing their current missions in other regions, such as engagement activities, HADR operations, ISR operations, counterterrorism, deterrence, and crisis response, must also be considered by policymakers. Policymakers may need to consider the trade-offs of using U.S. Navy ships to escort commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden versus maintaining Navy capacity in other regions. An alternative proposed by a retired U.S. Navy vice admiral is to provide armed security teams on U.S.-flagged ships during transit through high-risk areas. France has also deployed military personnel in similar situations. According to 2009 news reports, France and Belgium offered military personnel aboard tuna fishing boats in the Indian Ocean. Some U.S. corporate officers suggest military teams protect U.S.-flagged vessels to avoid regulatory issues. Legislation proposed embarking U.S. military personnel on U.S.-flagged vessels in high-risk areas to deter pirate attacks. War Risk insurance provides special coverage for ships exposed to piracy risks on a per transit basis. Federal law authorizes the government to administer a maritime war risk insurance program for ocean-going commerce in high-risk areas. Despite increased piracy off the coast of Somalia, the insurance industry's financial resources are adequate, and there is ample coverage for ocean-going vessels. Despite increased piracy off the coast of Somalia and higher premiums for cargo shipments through the Gulf of Aden, some argue against amending federal insurance laws. Suggestions include arming ship crews or using armed security, but many ship owners and insurers are hesitant due to potential liabilities. In a notable incident in March 2010, private security guards aboard the Almezaan killed a Somali pirate. Ocean marine insurers are divided on the use of armed crews, with some preferring traditional ransom negotiations after pirate attacks. Some insurers believe traditional ransom negotiations are the best approach to piracy, as arming ship crews may increase violence. Members of Congress urge a comprehensive approach to Somalia to address piracy and stabilize the country. The Obama Administration, along with U.S. officials, supports a holistic approach to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa by improving security, governance, rule of law, and economic opportunities in Somalia. A more robust anti-piracy policy has been developed in response to attacks on U.S. vessels, focusing on building regional capacity, supporting multilateral initiatives, and enhancing coordination among government agencies. The interagency Counter-Piracy Steering Group leads efforts involving over 75 bureaus and offices. The Counter-Piracy Steering Group, led by the State and Defence Departments, coordinates efforts of over 75 bureaus, offices, and embassies in anti-piracy operations. The international community responds to piracy threats with naval patrols, diplomatic coordination, and self-protection measures. US assistance to Somali institutions aims to enhance security and combat piracy in the region. The U.S. government's action plan to address piracy includes prevention, disruption, and prosecution of pirates. Challenges in prosecuting pirates persist despite regional capacity building efforts. Strengthening regional security capabilities, intelligence gathering, law enforcement, and multilateral coordination are seen as long-term solutions. Pirates are likely to continue finding sanctuary in Somalia until governance and security conditions improve."
