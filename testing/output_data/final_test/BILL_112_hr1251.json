    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"More Water for Our Valley Act, 2011\" and it ensures compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The San Joaquin Valley in California relies on irrigated agriculture supported by the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. Water restrictions due to the Endangered Species Act have significantly reduced water availability for agriculture in the region. The San Joaquin Valley in California, one of the most productive agricultural regions globally, produces over 250 different crops worth $17 billion annually. It supplies 8% of US agricultural production and 40% of the nation's fruits and vegetables on less than 1% of US farmland. Water supply shortages, exacerbated by regulatory restrictions on water projects, have led to an economic crisis in the region. In the San Joaquin Valley, over 400,000 acres of farmland were fallowed in 2009, leading to high unemployment rates in rural communities. Food banks are facing increased demand from unemployed residents. Water shortages impact irrigated agriculture and communities in the Central Valley of California. Snowpack and rainfall levels are currently above average in the state. Deliveries to water agencies in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are expected to remain at reduced levels this year due to pumping restrictions. Groundwater reliance has increased, leading to unsustainable withdrawals and infrastructure risks. Native fish habitats in the California Bay-Delta are also at risk. The ecosystem of the California Bay-Delta has been significantly impaired by pollutants and invasive species, leading to reduced access to spawning grounds. Large-scale habitat restoration and fish passage improvements are crucial to restore the unique ecosystem and recover native species in the area. Federal and State agencies, along with interested parties, are developing a conservation plan to establish habitat restoration for ecosystem recovery. The conservation plan aims to provide ecosystem restoration, contribute to native species recovery, and restore and protect water supplies for the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project. Compliance with the Endangered Species Act requirements for the Projects is deemed satisfied with the biological opinions issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The biological opinions dated December 15, 2008, and June 4, 2009, require implementation of reasonable and prudent alternatives and specific actions to ensure flows in Old and Middle Rivers during certain months. During April 1 to May 31, export rates cannot be reduced except to comply with California State Water Resources Control Board decisions. From September 1 to November 30, X2 levels must not exceed 74 km eastward from the Golden Gate. The Secretary of the Interior may modify flow and pumping mandates in the California Bay-Delta upon recommendations from the National Research Council Committee, if it benefits species and does not reduce water delivery capability of the Central Valley Project or California State Water Project. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce will establish a fish hatchery program or refuge to preserve and restore the delta smelt in collaboration with the Governor of California. They will also implement a habitat program to prioritize ecosystem restoration and fish passage projects in the California Bay-Delta to ensure the viability of at-risk species and threatened species. The legislation aims to protect species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act and mandates the installation of the Head of Old River Barrier during specific flow periods. It includes a savings clause to ensure no reduction in water supply deliveries and no shifting of obligations to other water projects. The legislation prohibits sharing biological opinions with unauthorized parties and ensures the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act is not affected. States cannot impose stricter requirements on project operations than outlined in the Act, with any such laws being preempted. Termination of section and mandates on March 1, 2015."
