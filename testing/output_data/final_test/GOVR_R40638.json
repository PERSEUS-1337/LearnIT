    "content": "The federal government's influence in policy areas traditionally managed by state and local governments has increased through the use of federal grants, mandates, and preemption. In FY2019, approximately $750 billion in federal grants will be provided to state and local governments, covering various public policy areas. Federal grants make up nearly one-third of total state government funding and over half of funding for health care and public assistance. Congress plays a key role in shaping federal grant programs. Congress plays a central role in determining federal grant programs, selecting grant mechanisms, and overseeing implementation to ensure accountability. Federalism scholars agree that congressional decisions are influenced by internal and external factors. The scope and nature of the federal grants-in-aid system are influenced by internal factors such as congressional party leadership, committee system, individual Members' backgrounds and preferences, and congressional norms. External factors include input from voter constituencies, interest groups, the President, and the Supreme Court's rulings on federalism issues. The evolving nature of cultural norms and expectations influences congressional decisions on federal grant-in-aid programs. The American public has become more accepting of government activism in domestic affairs, attributed to societal changes like industrialization, urbanization, and technological innovations. This report provides a historical overview of the federal grants-in-aid system, focusing on Congress's role. The federal grants-in-aid system has evolved over time, with Congress playing a key role in defining its scope. Different federal departments and agencies use varying definitions for grant-in-aid programs, but there are general characteristics associated with each. Congressional consideration is needed to enhance oversight of the system. The three general types of federal grants to state and local governments are categorical grants, block grants, and general revenue sharing. Categorical grants are limited to specific programs, block grants are for a set of programs with more flexibility, and general revenue sharing can be used for any purpose not prohibited by law. Categorical grants have four types: project, formula, formula-project, and open-end reimbursement grants. Categorical grants are allocated based on factors specified in enabling legislation or regulations. Formula-project categorical grants use a formula to allocate funds to states, followed by a competitive application process among local governments. Open-end reimbursement grants provide reimbursement for a portion of recipient program costs. Project categorical grants have a high degree of federal control over recipients, with funds used for specific purposes and strict administrative conditions attached. General revenue sharing grants impose the least restraint on recipients. General revenue sharing grants have a low degree of federal control over recipients, with funding allocated automatically by a specified formula. Recipients have broad discretion in how the funds are used, with minimal federal administrative conditions attached. Block grants fall in the middle, with some discretion for recipients in aided activities. Federal grants to state and local governments have increased over the years, with a significant boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This act provided $274.7 billion in grants, contracts, and loans to state and local governments. In FY2009-FY2014, federal grants to state and local governments totaled $111.9 billion, $68.8 billion, $25.6 billion, $11.8 billion, and $1.6 billion respectively, aiding in their recovery from the \"Great Recession\". Outlays for these grants decreased after FY2010 due to ARRA funding expiration but have since increased, with health care expected to account for over half of total outlays in FY2019. In FY2019, federal grants to state and local governments totaled $418.7 billion, with Medicaid having the largest budget. Other grants with significant outlays include Federal-Aid Highways, Child Nutrition, and Tenant Based Rental Assistance. Total outlays for federal grants to state and local governments have generally increased since the 1960s, with varying magnitudes of increase over the years. For example, in nominal dollars, outlays increased by 187.3% during the 1960s, 246.4% during the 1970s, 33.4% during the 1980s, and 98.0% in recent years. Federal grants to state and local governments have shifted focus from providing assistance to places to people since the 1980s. This change is attributed to Medicaid, which has seen significant outlay growth over the years. The focus of federal grants to state and local governments has shifted towards individuals, with Medicaid experiencing substantial growth in outlays. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) was previously used to track federal grants, listing 15 categories including formula grants, project grants, and direct payments. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) lists authorized federal grant programs, including grants that have not received an appropriation. It includes various forms of assistance such as direct payments, loans, insurance, property exchange, specialized services, and training. Counting federal grants to state and local governments is complicated due to separate programs for different delivery mechanisms. ACIR published counts of funded federal grants during specific years, and OMB is involved in the process. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided counts of funded federal grants to state and local governments for Fiscal Years 1980-2003. OMB consistently identified fewer grants compared to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR). No recent authoritative count of funded federal grants to state and local governments is available. ACIR included all direct cash grants, grants-in-kind, and payments to nongovernmental entities in their counts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided counts of funded federal grants to state and local governments for Fiscal Years 1980-2003. OMB counted grants for traditional governmental operations, excluding grants that went directly to individuals, fellowships, most grants to nongovernmental entities, and technical research grants. The definition covered grants that support state or local programs of government operations or provision of services to the public. State, local, U.S. territories, and tribal governments are eligible for 1,616 federal grants. 141 grants are unfunded, 160 are research programs not limited to public institutions, and 41 have broad eligibility. This leaves 1,274 funded federal grants for state and local governments. The count may vary due to differing methodologies. The number of federal grants to state and local governments increased slowly from 1902 to 1930. In the 1930s, Congress doubled the grants in response to the Great Depression. The number continued to rise in the 1940s and 1950s. In the mid-1960s, there was an exponential increase in grants due to national social movements. Congress added 9 grants in 1961, 17 in 1962, 20 in 1963, 40 in 1964, 109 in 1965, 53 in 1966, 3 in 1967, and 4 in 1968. The trend of increasing grants continued into the 1970s. During the 1970s, federal grants to state and local governments increased slowly due to budget constraints from the Vietnam conflict. In 1981, President Reagan led the largest reduction in federal grants by creating 9 block grants and eliminating funding for 62 categorical grants. The number of federal grants continued to increase slowly in the 1980s due to budget constraints from demographic changes and escalating costs for federal entitlement programs. During the 1990s, federal grants to state and local governments increased, albeit at a slower pace. The influence of internal and external factors on congressional decisions regarding federal grants-in-aid varied over time and in different policy areas. Prior to the Civil War, cultural norms and expectations limited congressional options for enacting federal grant-in-aid programs. America was predominantly rural during this period. During the 1990s, federal grants to state and local governments increased, albeit at a slower pace. America was primarily a rural nation of farmers with primitive travel conditions. Personal allegiance was directed more towards individual home states than the nation. Dual federalism was prevalent, with states expected to govern domestic affairs. The federal government provided assistance to state and local governments to pursue national policy objectives even before the Constitution's ratification. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress lacked the power to collect taxes and relied on state donations for funding. To address this issue, the Land Ordinance of 1785 was adopted, generating revenue by selling land acquired from Great Britain after the Revolutionary War. New townships in the Ohio Country were required to set aside Lot 16 for public schools. The Land Ordinance of 1785 required new townships in the Ohio Country to set aside Lot 16 for public schools. These land grants for public education were reauthorized by Congress in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, with similar legislation adopted for states admitted to the union from 1802 to 1910. The continental dollar was unstable due to large debts from the Revolutionary War, leading to issues with the navy and army. Congress was granted powers in the U.S. Constitution in 1789, including the power to coin money, establish post offices, regulate copyright laws, declare war, and collect taxes, allowing for expansion of the federal government's role in domestic affairs. Chief Justice John Marshall's rulings on congressional authority to regulate interstate commerce paved the way for congressional activism in domestic policy. During the 1800s, congressional efforts to provide federal cash assistance for internal improvement projects failed due to sectional divisions, despite some representatives pushing for legislation to encourage western migration and promote interstate commerce. The prevailing view in Congress was that governmental police powers should be a state or local responsibility, with any power not explicitly granted in the Constitution considered excluded. Most congressional efforts to provide federal cash assistance for internal improvement projects during the 1800s failed due to sectional divisions and opposition from Members of Congress prioritizing reducing the national debt from the American Revolutionary War. Some viewed federal interventions as a violation of states' rights, as articulated in the Tenth Amendment. During the 1800s, Congress preferred federal land grants over direct cash assistance for internal improvements. States like Ohio received land grants for road projects, and in 1841, nine states were designated land grant states, guaranteeing them federal land for transportation projects. By 1900, over 3.2 million acres of federal land were donated to states for wagon road construction, canal construction, river navigation, railroad improvements, and flood control. States had wide latitude in project selection with minimal federal oversight. Land grants faced opposition on constitutional grounds, with Congress authorizing legislation in 1854. President Franklin Pierce vetoed legislation in 1854 authorizing the donation of 10 million acres of federal land to states for the indigent insane, citing constitutional concerns about the federal government's role in charity. Pierce argued that such actions would go against the Constitution's principles and could lead to states relying on federal aid instead of using their own resources for social needs. The federal government provided cash grants to states in 1837 using proceeds from western land sales to retire the federal debt. The Deposit Act of 1836 distributed about $30 million to states based on their representation in Congress, with no restrictions on how the funds were to be used. The funds were labeled as a deposit subject to recall to avoid a veto from President Andrew Jackson. Before the Civil War, domestic policy in the United States was largely controlled by the states, with broad authority over taxation, police power, and eminent domain. The Union's victory in the Civil War marked a shift in American federalism, ending the idea that the Constitution was a compact among sovereign states. The Civil War marked a shift in American federalism, ending the idea that the Constitution was a compact among sovereign states. The victory of the northern states' commercialism over the southern states' agrarianism led to comprehensive changes by the Republican coalition, including assistance for business, industry, and farming through policies like protective tariffs and national banks. After the Civil War, the defeated South had to accept significant changes in government policy and economic institutions, known as the Second American Revolution. Constitutional amendments abolished slavery and ensured equal protection and voting rights. Despite federal intervention in the South, the concept of dual federalism and state deference continued in American culture. During the post-Civil War period, American culture saw the continuation of dual federalism and state deference. Supreme Court rulings limited congressional efforts on civil and voting rights, as well as interstate commerce regulation. The first federal cash grant to states was adopted in 1879 for the education of the blind, marking the beginning of the federal grants-in-aid system. The federal cash grants to states continued with the Hatch Act of 1887, providing funds for agricultural experiment stations and care for disabled veterans in state hospitals. In 1890, funding was allocated for resident instruction in land grant colleges established by the Morrill Act of 1862. In 1902, federal grants were given to states and local governments for various purposes, including teaching materials for the blind, agricultural experiment stations, care for disabled veterans, resident instruction in land grant colleges, and funding for the District of Columbia. The total outlays for these grants were about $7 million, which was approximately 1% of total federal outlays at that time. This demonstrated the limited federal involvement in domestic policy during that period. In the early 1900s, federal grants to states came with increasing administrative requirements to ensure proper use of funds. Conditions included matching federal funding, audits, inspections, and advance approval of state plans. Congress attached more requirements to grant programs over time. The Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 gave Congress the power to collect income taxes, leading to the shift from land grants to cash grants for state and local governments. New federal grant-in-aid programs were adopted between 1913 and 1923, increasing federal grants to $118 million in FY1922. Massachusetts sued the Secretary of the Treasury in 1923 over the constitutionality of maternal care grants authorized by the Sheppard-Towner Act of 1921. The Supreme Court dismissed the case challenging the constitutionality of maternal care grants under the Sheppard-Towner Act of 1921, citing lack of jurisdiction. Justice George Sutherland stated that federal grants to state and local governments were optional and not coercive. This decision paved the way for Congress to use grants as a means to encourage pursuit of national goals. Political scientists suggest that partisan realignments occur about once per generation, often becoming evident during critical presidential elections. Critical elections, occurring about once per generation, lead to significant and lasting changes in Congress and state governments. These elections signal the rise of a new dominant partisan coalition, as seen in the elections of 1896 and 1932 which solidified Republican and Democratic Party dominance respectively. However, over time, partisan attachments weakened, leading to increased competition between the two major parties without a permanent majority status. The 1932-1960 period saw the emergence of the \"congressional conservative coalition,\" a shifting political alliance of southern, conservative Democrats and Republican Members. This coalition advocated balanced budgets, states' rights, and used filibusters to influence legislation in Congress. They benefited from the seniority system for committee chairmanships. During the 1932-1960 period, the congressional conservative coalition, comprised of southern Democrats and Republicans, held committee chairmanships based on seniority. This coalition influenced policymaking, particularly in preventing civil rights legislation, while also expanding federal government presence in domestic policy. They prioritized state rights in new federal programs, focusing on areas like education, healthcare, and highways. During the 1932-1960 period, state and local governments were active in areas like education, healthcare, and highway construction. Federal assistance was welcomed for job creation. The era was characterized by \"cooperative federalism,\" with minimal intergovernmental tensions. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt advocated for an expansion of federal grant-in-aid programs to combat poverty and create jobs during his presidency. During 1933-1938, Congress approved federal grants to state and local governments, increasing funding from $214 million to $790 million. Emergency relief programs provided nearly $1.9 billion to create jobs and assist the unemployed. This established a precedent for extensive federal involvement in combating poverty and creating jobs. The Social Security Act of 1935 was a significant legislative enactment of the New Deal period, establishing federal involvement in social welfare policy. It created new federal grant-in-aid programs for various social assistance programs and increased federal oversight of grants to state and local governments. Additionally, in 1939, state employees administering SSA programs were required to be selected by merit system procedures, advancing the professional development of state and local government. The Hatch Act of 1940 restricted political activities of state and local government employees paid with federal funds, signaling a decline in influence of state and local party bosses. New Deal legislation expanded congressional authority through grant-in-aid programs, impacting areas traditionally under state jurisdiction. Critics argued that these programs limited state action in social welfare and other functional areas. The New Deal grant programs challenged state authority in traditional areas, leading to Supreme Court cases. Initially, the Court rejected federal expansion but later upheld laws like the Social Security Act. This marked a shift in judicial interpretation and broadened the commerce power. The broad interpretation of commerce power and expansion of Federal taxing power led to the abandonment of the direct and indirect effects distinction. The Supreme Court upheld the Social Security Act, viewing it as a legitimate use of the tax power and an example of Federal-state collaboration. These decisions marked the end of judicial dual federalism. During World War II, federal grants to state and local governments decreased due to Congress focusing on defense-related issues. After the war, the number and amount of federal grants increased significantly, with a focus on urban areas. Notable programs included grants for airport construction, urban renewal, and urban planning. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of the 1950s was a significant $25 billion program aimed at improving highways over 13 years. The 1950s saw the enactment of the $25 billion Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, authorizing the construction of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. The 1960s were marked by political and social upheaval, including the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and Senator Robert Kennedy. The civil rights movement faced violent resistance, with notable events like the march on Washington. The civil rights movement in the 1960s saw significant progress with the adoption of key legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Despite these advancements, race riots occurred in urban areas in 1965 and 1967. The civil rights movement was also joined by the hippie movement, where young people rebelled against conservative norms. The counterculture movement of the 1960s rebelled against conservative norms and mainstream liberalism, sparking a social revolution in the Western world. It began as a reaction to the conservatism of the 1950s and government intervention in Vietnam, advocating for more freedom and rights for women, gays, and minorities, as well as environmental protection and poverty awareness. This movement influenced Congress to address civil rights, poverty, and the environment, leading to the enlargement of the House Rules Committee in 1961. The enlargement of the House Rules Committee in 1961 weakened the conservative coalition's influence in Congress, allowing for the passage of civil rights legislation and expansion of federal grants-in-aid focusing on environmental protection and poverty alleviation. President Lyndon Baines Johnson supported legislative efforts in the 1960s to address poverty and racial injustice through grants for environmental protection, public assistance, job training, education, housing, nutrition, and health care programs. He announced the establishment of working groups to revitalize urban America and improve educational opportunities, aiming to set the course towards \"The Great Society\" which demanded an end to poverty and racial injustice. During the 1960s, President Johnson's Great Society initiatives led to a significant increase in federal grants to state and local governments, with the number nearly tripling from 132 in 1960 to 387 in 1968. This included the adoption of 109 federal grants in 1965 alone, such as Medicaid, which now has the largest budget of any federal grant-in-aid program. Outlays for federal grants also rose from $7 billion in FY1960 to $20 billion in FY1969, with substantial increases in funding for health care, income security, education, training, employment, social services, transportation, and community development. These efforts were largely unopposed. During the 1960s, federal grants to state and local governments increased significantly from $7 billion to $20 billion. The legislative efforts to create new grants were generally supported by government officials and public interest groups. These grants had innovative features and aimed to encourage state and local governments to address new policy areas and national priorities. During the 1960s, federal grants to state and local governments increased significantly from $7 billion to $20 billion. The new grants aimed to encourage state and local governments to address national priorities, such as environmental protection, education, public assistance, and urban renewal. There was a focus on narrowly focused project grants with low matching requirements to promote government participation. Incentive grants encouraged states to move into new policy areas and diversify eligible grant recipients. Grants to urban areas also increased, with federal grants targeted at metropolitan areas more than tripling during the decade. During the 1960s, federal grants to state and local governments increased significantly, with a shift towards more narrowly focused project grants. The era saw the introduction of block grants, such as the Comprehensive Health Planning and Public Health Services Amendments of 1966 and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration's Grants for Law Enforcement program in 1968. These block grants replaced formula categorical grants and marked a new approach to federal grant-in-aid funding. The Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 was created de novo without consolidating existing categorical grants. The expansion of federal grants in the 1960s raised concerns about the dysfunctional grant-in-aid system, with state and local officials facing challenges due to inflexible fiscal and administrative requirements. Improved coordination among programs was also highlighted as necessary. Between 1962 and 1965, new regional offices were established due to grants-in-aid legislation, increasing the total number of regional systems to 12. This led to administrative difficulties for state and local officials dealing with federal agencies. President Nixon and President Ford in the 1970s argued for a reevaluation of the grant-in-aid system, citing dysfunctionality and the need to clarify governmental responsibilities. The federal government advocated for sorting out governmental responsibilities, shifting towards block grants and revenue sharing to provide state and local governments with flexibility and promote program efficiency. They believed in giving state and local governments more autonomy to promote community responsibility and self-reliance. State and local governments are better positioned to adapt public programs to local needs, encourage civic participation, promote innovation in policy design, reduce administrative workload on the federal government, and decrease political turmoil. Opponents argue that Congress has the right to determine how federal funding is spent and that many state and local governments lack fiscal resources. State and local governments often lack fiscal resources to provide essential services to the poor and disadvantaged, leading to competition for business and taxpaying residents. This results in a focus on attracting investments rather than meeting basic needs. Congress must ensure uniform levels of essential services nationwide. Congress must ensure uniform levels of essential governmental services throughout the nation, using grant-in-aid programs and federal requirements to achieve national goals such as civil rights, equal employment opportunities, environmental protection, and care for the poor and aged. This is necessary because dealing with 50 state governments and over 79,000 local governments makes it difficult to enact change, especially when some services have costs or benefits that affect multiple localities or states. Opponents argue that federal programs with spillover effects are often underfunded by state and local governments, leading to the need for Congress to ensure logical funding levels. Critics claim that proposals for block grants and revenue sharing are a disguise to redirect federal resources to specific constituencies. In the past, federal grant-in-aid funding favored metropolitan areas, seen as Democratic strongholds. Shifting from project categorical grants to block grants or revenue sharing would redistribute funding from metropolitan areas to suburban and rural areas, which are more likely to be Republican. This change is due to the competitive nature of project grants versus the formula-based allocation of block grants and revenue sharing. Congressional debates on grant mechanisms often had partisan undertones, with some suggesting that Congress prefers geographically dispersed funding. Some federalism scholars argue that Congress favors categorical grants over block grants and revenue sharing because Members value the ability to sponsor specific programs and receive political credit from constituents. Members are more likely to be recognized for sponsoring narrowly focused categorical grants than for supporting general block grants or revenue sharing. In his 1971 State of the Union speech, President Nixon proposed consolidating 129 federal grant programs into six \"special revenue sharing\" programs, aiming to shift from categorical grants to block grants and revenue sharing. The block grants proposed by President Nixon aimed to consolidate federal grant programs into fewer, more flexible programs. Despite opposition from interest groups, three block grants were approved, including the Comprehensive Employment and Training Assistance Block Grant and the Community Development Block Grant. These grants had fewer auditing requirements and were distributed automatically without prior federal approval. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 consolidated six existing community and economic development grant programs. Title XX social services, later renamed the Social Services Block Grant program, was created in 1975. General revenue sharing was approved by Congress in 1972. By 1980, there were 534 categorical grant programs, 5 block grant programs, and 1 general revenue sharing program. Overall, categorical grants accounted for 79.3% of the $91.3 billion in federal grants to state and local governments in 1972. President Nixon's proposals aimed to give state and local governments more decision-making power in functional areas, but faced resistance in Congress. Despite the Family Assistance Plan not being adopted, Congress nationalized several adult-age public assistance grant programs in 1972. During the 1960s and 1970s, Congress imposed federal mandates on state and local governments, including adult-age public assistance grant programs in 1972. These mandates encompassed a range of policy actions with centralizing effects on the intergovernmental system. Crosscutting requirements were widely recognized as a condition of federal assistance that applied across-the-board. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 established crosscutting requirements for federal grants to prevent discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. In 1980, there were 59 crosscutting requirements aimed at advancing national social or economic goals in various areas such as education and the environment. Additional mandates, like the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, extended anti-discrimination laws to state and local governments. During the 1960s and 1970s, federal regulations expanded to include state and local government employment, age discrimination prohibitions, and pricing regulations for electricity and natural gas. This shift fundamentally changed intergovernmental relations in the United States, bringing state and local governments under extensive federal controls in various public functions and services. The 1960s and 1970s saw a shift towards \"coercive federalism\" as federal regulations expanded, bringing state and local governments under extensive federal controls in various public functions and services. Congressional deference to state and local government prerogatives decreased, with an increased reliance on federal mandates rather than incentives for compliance. In the 1980s, the United States and Western world saw a revival of conservative politics, emphasis on free market solutions, and societal changes like women in the workplace, gay rights activism, and environmental concerns. Rock concerts were televised to raise funds for social causes. During the 1980s and 1990s, American society experienced a mix of self-promotion and altruism. Public opinion polls showed growing hostility towards government intrusion and performance, despite support for specific programs. The era saw a trend of electing a President from one party and a Congress from another, with the Republican Party gaining strength and winning the presidency from 1981 to 1993. The Republican Party's resurgence in the 1980s was marked by winning the presidency from 1981 to 1993 and achieving majority status in the Senate from 1981 to 1987, and in both houses of Congress from 1995 to 2001. President Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 signaled the potential for a \"devolution revolution\" in American federalism, with a focus on reducing the federal budget deficit through tax reduction and regulatory relief. President Reagan focused on encouraging economic growth through tax reduction and regulatory relief, trusting state and local governments to provide essential services. He advocated reducing the federal government's role in domestic affairs, increasing block grants for flexibility in funding, and imposing fiscal restraint on grant programs. For example, he proposed consolidating 84 categorical grants into 6 block grants and reducing funding for income maintenance programs like housing assistance and food stamps. In 1981, Congress approved the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, consolidating 77 categorical grants into nine new block grants, including education, health services, community services, and energy assistance. In 1981, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act consolidated 77 categorical grants into nine new block grants, reducing funding for categorical grants by 12%. President Reagan argued that the funding reductions would not impact services due to administrative efficiencies. Additionally, 62 categorical grants were eliminated, signaling a potential devolution revolution. Federal grants to state and local governments decreased from $94.7 billion in FY1981 to $88.1 billion in FY1982. The 1981 block grants were seen as more of historical accidents than intentional restructuring of programs. The Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1981 led to the creation of 12 block grants by 1984, accounting for 15% of total grants-in-aid funding during President Reagan's presidency. President Ronald Reagan had success in getting congressional approval for block grants in 1981, but subsequent proposals faced opposition from organizations fearing reduced funding for programs. Only one block grant, the Federal Transit Capital and Operating Assistance Block Grant, was added in 1982. Reagan's proposal for a $20 billion \"swap\" in federal funding was not approved by Congress. President Ronald Reagan proposed a $20 billion \"swap\" in federal funding, which was not approved by Congress. The swap would have shifted full responsibility for funding Aid to Families With Dependent Children and food stamps to states in exchange for federal assumption of state contributions for Medicaid. Additionally, Reagan suggested a temporary $28 billion trust fund to replace 43 other federal grant programs, with the trust fund phasing out after four years. States would then have the option to replace federal tax support with their own funds to continue the programs. The proposed devolution of federal grants to states, including a swap proposal to shift funding responsibilities, failed to gain congressional approval due to opposition from organizations and Members concerned about potential funding cuts to programs. The National Governors Association supported federal takeover of Medicaid but objected to assuming costs for other programs. Governors feared they would not have the fiscal capacity to support programs without federal assistance. Despite talks of devolution revolution, federal grants to state and local programs continued to increase in FY1983. Outlays for federal grants to state and local governments saw a lower rate of increase in the 2000s compared to the previous two decades. Medicaid was a significant contributor to this revenue growth, with outlays for health care and income security also increasing. Education, training, employment, social services, transportation, and community development also received federal grant increases during this period. During the 1980s, federal grants to state and local governments fluctuated, with a low of 405 grants in 1984 and a high of 664 grants in 1998. The number of intergovernmental mandates also increased during this era, with 63 significant federal mandates identified in 1990 compared to 36 in 1980. Despite efforts to constrain regulatory growth, the 1980s saw an expansion of federal mandates. During the 1980s, federal regulations continued to grow due to various reasons. Many regulations addressed important issues like pollution, healthcare, and civil rights, with goals that were popular among the public and government officials. The scarcity of federal funds led to an increase in federal mandates as an alternative to new aid programs. The potential for a devolution revolution was anticipated after the 1994 congressional elections, with the Republican Party gaining majority status. The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 aimed to limit federal mandates. The Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) aimed to limit federal government's ability to impose costs on state and local governments or the private sector through unfunded mandates. Congressional committees identify federal mandates in measures under consideration, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the costs. CBO provides full quantitative estimates for measures with mandate costs over pre-determined thresholds in the first five fiscal years. Cost estimates for federal mandates in legislation are based on direct costs and federal funding authorized to cover these costs. The thresholds for a full CBO cost estimate are adjusted annually for inflation, with current thresholds set at $82 million for intergovernmental mandates and $164 million for private sector mandates. If a mandate's cost estimate falls below these thresholds, CBO prepares brief statements. Members can raise a point of order if a CBO cost estimate is missing due to committee failure or infeasibility of cost estimation. UMRA's impact on unfunded mandates is limited, with only a few points of order raised in Congress. It primarily covers statutory direct orders, excluding most grant conditions and preemptions with fiscal effects below the threshold. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) primarily covers statutory direct orders, excluding certain types of legislation like those dealing with constitutional rights, discrimination, national security, and Social Security. It does not apply to appropriations bills, floor amendments, or conference reports. The 104th Congress, despite expectations of decentralization, maintained a status quo in federalism relationships and defeated proposed devolutionary bills, including a Medicaid block grant with significant funding cuts. During the 104th Congress, several key proposals were scuttled, including a big regulatory reform measure limiting the Federal government's power. The Clean Water Act extension, consolidation of manpower training programs, and revised Endangered Species Act were successfully resisted. Affirmative action rollback, conservative shift in Superfund program, and Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996 were also scuttled. Reasons for failure varied from Senate rejection to presidential veto threats. The devolution revolution did not fully materialize during this era. During the 1980s and 1990s, there was some decentralization of decision-making authority in the federal government, with an increase in block grants from four to 24. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, funded at $16.7 billion annually, rivaled the Surface Transportation Program as the largest block grant. Congress also authorized state waivers for Medicaid in 1981 and child welfare assistance programs in 1994. The era saw contradictory trends of centralization and decentralization in the federal intergovernmental system. The decentralization in the federal intergovernmental system during the 1980s and 1990s reflected contradictory societal trends in America. Public dissatisfaction with government performance, especially at the federal level, led to a desire for more flexibility in federal grant-in-aid programs for state and local governments. However, there was also strong support for individual federal programs and Members of Congress, indicating a desire to maintain certain aspects of federal involvement. During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a push for decentralization in the federal intergovernmental system. Public dissatisfaction with government performance led to a desire for more flexibility in federal grant-in-aid programs for state and local governments. However, there was also strong support for individual federal programs and Members of Congress, indicating a desire to maintain certain aspects of federal involvement. President Reagan's commitment to strengthening federalism through program decentralization and devolution was notable, but conflicting goals often hindered devolutionary policies during his administration. During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a push for decentralization in the federal intergovernmental system, with competing goals of reducing the federal deficit, deregulating the private sector, and advancing the conservative social agenda. President Reagan opposed the expansion of General Revenue Sharing, advocated for eliminating deductibility of state and local taxes, and supported efforts to require states to establish workfare programs for public assistance recipients. Some observers believed federal grants to state and local governments might decrease during George W. Bush's presidency due to budgetary pressures from the \"war on.\" During George W. Bush's presidency (2001-2009), federal budgetary pressures from the \"war on terror\" post-9/11 led to efforts to reduce the annual budget deficit and address the federal debt. Despite Republican Party's majority in Congress, federal grants to state and local governments increased. President Bush granted state waivers for Medicaid fund flexibility. President Bush granted waivers for state flexibility in Medicaid funds and No Child Left Behind compliance. He proposed grant consolidations, state control of Head Start, and waivers in low-income programs. However, federalism scholars argue that centralization of authority continued during his presidency, with his support for federal goals in education, sales tax collection, emergency management, and other areas. He also backed restrictions on partial-birth abortions, new work requirements for TANF recipients, and secure driver's licenses. President Bush supported legislative efforts to prohibit same-sex marriage and backed restrictions on partial-birth abortions, new work requirements for TANF recipients, and secure driver's licenses. The federal grants-in-aid system expanded and centralized under President Barack Obama and continued under President Trump, with outlays for federal grants to state and local governments increasing in recent years, particularly in Medicaid. The number of federal grants to state and local governments also increased over the years. The number of federal grants to state and local governments has increased over the years, with a focus on categorical grants. Despite UMRA, unfunded federal mandates have continued to be issued, with hundreds of laws affecting state and local government budgets. UMRA's definition of a federal mandate includes grant conditions and the use of federal control over state and local government actions to promote national goals. Examples include the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which increased federal influence on education and election processes. President Obama did not issue a formal federalism plan during his presidency. President Obama did not issue a formal federalism plan but focused on a place-based approach to support communities based on their specific assets and challenges. The expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the ACA increased health care's federal assistance to state and local governments, enhancing the role of categorical grants in intergovernmental relations. The Obama Administration did not advocate a major shift in funding priorities from categorical grants to block grants. The number of funded block grants declined somewhat during this time. However, they did support temporary block grants for public education and energy efficiency programs. Additional funding was also provided for TANF, Child Care and Development Block Grant, Community Development Block Grant, Community Services Block Grant, and Native American programs. The Obama Administration advocated for new competitive categorical grant programs over expanding existing block grants. They supported consolidating categorical grant programs to reduce duplication and promote efficiency, such as in surface transportation and Department of Homeland Security programs. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request aims to refocus federal grants on high priority areas, involve state and local governments more, slow grant spending growth, and cap federal funding for Medicaid. It also proposes a 25% non-federal cost match for FEMA and other reductions to achieve a balanced federal budget by 2027. The Trump Administration's budget proposal includes a 25% non-federal cost match for FEMA grants, a Federal Emergency Response Fund for public health outbreaks, a $500 million block grant for the CDC, and $200 billion for infrastructure. The proposal aims to streamline grant programs to reduce complexity and improve oversight. The 2019 Budget aims to limit the Federal role and reduce spending by slowing the growth of grant spending. It provides $749 billion in outlays for aid to State and local governments, with an increase of 3% from 2018. The increase is mainly for the Administration's infrastructure initiative, while all other grant spending except for Medicaid and infrastructure will decline by 11% in 2019. The Trump Administration intends to slow the growth of federal spending. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request aims to slow the growth of federal aid to state and local governments. It proposes converting Medicaid to a block grant or implementing a per capita spending cap indexed to the Consumer Price Index to encourage states to pursue cost-cutting measures in healthcare programs. The budget provides $751 billion in outlays for aid to State and local governments in 2020, a slight increase from 2019. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget aims to give states flexibility over Medicaid programs to reduce costs. Funding will be cut for lower priority grant programs like Sea Grant and Community Development Block Grants. The Administration's goal is to improve efficiency in delivering federal grants to intended recipients. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget aims to give states flexibility over Medicaid programs to reduce costs. Funding will be cut for lower priority grant programs like Sea Grant and Community Development Block Grants. The Administration also included proposals to require able-bodied adults participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to enter and re-enter the job market. Federal grants to state and local governments have increased since the mid-1980s, posing challenges for effective congressional oversight. Congress is well positioned to provide oversight, but the decentralized nature of the committee system may complicate this task. The decentralized nature of the congressional committee system may hinder effective oversight of federal grants to state and local governments. The defunct ACIR previously provided authoritative reports on intergovernmental grants, filling an informational void now addressed by GAO reports. Congress may consider reestablishing a similar body to focus on the overall intergovernmental system. A potential organization focusing on the intergovernmental system could offer valuable insights for Congress overseeing federal grants to state and local governments. It could establish a standardized method for tracking these grants and provide regular assessments of the grant system's performance. There is a possibility that the recent increase in federal grants may slow down due to potential cuts in federal discretionary spending to address the deficit. Congress has historically used these grants to stimulate job creation and support the national economy. The upward trend in federal grant outlays to state and local governments is expected to continue, albeit at a slower pace. President Trump's FY2020 budget projects an increase in total outlays from $696.5 billion in FY2018 to $750.7 billion in FY2020. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have seen growth in federal grant funding and mandates, with the Republican Party taking a more aggressive stance against unfunded mandates. The Republican Party has been more aggressive in advocating for federal mandates, including the Contract With America and UMRA. They support devolution of grant-in-aid programs to state and local governments, while the Democratic Party generally opposes devolution. Republicans also push for decentralization of grants-in-aid decision-making to state and local governments through block grants and administrative relief. The prevailing trend suggests that federalism principles are often overshadowed by other policy goals for most Members of both political parties. Despite public support for specific government programs, there is little indication that the historical trends of increasing federal grants to state and local governments, emphasis on categorical grants, and enactment of federal mandates will change."
