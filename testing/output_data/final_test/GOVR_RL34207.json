The federal government covers a portion of the premium, with various insurance products available including crop-specific revenue insurance. The program covers over 100 crops, with the majority of policy premiums and federal subsidies going towards corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton. The federal crop insurance program, focused on corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton, has seen three major legislative enhancements in the past 25 years. Federal subsidies have increased significantly, with two-thirds of spending going towards insurance policy premiums. The federal crop insurance program has expanded over the past 25 years, with the government reimbursing private insurance companies for losses and expenses. Despite the program's growth, the goal of replacing disaster payments has not been met. Congress has consistently provided ad hoc disaster payments to farmers for weather-related crop losses, even for those without active insurance policies. An exception was the FY2007 supplemental appropriations act, which allocated $2.4 billion in crop disaster payments for 2005-2007 losses to producers with active insurance policies. The federal crop insurance program has expanded over the past 25 years, with the government reimbursing private insurance companies for losses and expenses. Congress has consistently provided ad hoc disaster payments to farmers for weather-related crop losses. Disaster payments have totaled over $20 billion since FY1989, averaging $4.5 billion per year from FY2001-FY2006. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) includes major crop insurance and disaster assistance provisions. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) includes revisions to the crop insurance program to reduce costs, with estimated savings of $3.9 billion over 5 years and $5.6 billion over 10 years. Policymakers targeted the program for spending reductions to fund new initiatives in other areas of the bill. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions to reduce costs in the crop insurance program, with estimated savings of $2.8 billion over five years. Changes in premium receipts timing and payments to insurance companies will allow for the collection of two crop years of premiums in 2012 and delay reimbursements to the next fiscal year. The federal government absorbs a large portion of program losses and reimburses insurance companies for their expenses. The 2008 farm bill reduces A&O reimbursements for crop insurance expenses, with potential restoration based on loss ratios. The bill also lowers the reimbursement rate to 12% for area-wide loss plans, saving an estimated $618 million over five years. The final bill does not include a provision for insurance companies to share more underwriting gains with the government. The final version of the 2008 farm bill does not include a provision for insurance companies to share more underwriting gains with the federal government. However, a provision was adopted that allows USDA to renegotiate the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) every five years starting from the 2010-2011 reinsurance year. There are concerns about the increasing A&O reimbursements to insurance companies, which have doubled over the last seven years due to higher levels of insurance coverage purchased by farmers. The Administration argues that companies are being overcompensated for their expenses. The Administration argues that crop insurance companies are overcompensated for their expenses, while the companies claim that reducing A&O reimbursements will harm the industry. Farmers receive subsidized CAT coverage and can purchase higher levels of coverage with government subsidies. Non-covered crops have CAT equivalent coverage under the NAP with an administrative fee. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for farmers to share more program costs. The 2008 farm bill requires farmers to share more program costs, including increasing fees for catastrophic coverage and NAP to $300 per crop per county and reducing premium subsidies by 4 percentage points. USDA must operate the crop insurance program with an anticipated loss ratio of 1.0, which may result in higher premiums for farmers. Additionally, the bill prohibits cultivating native sod greater than 5 acres for crop production after May 22, 2008.

USDA must operate the crop insurance program with an anticipated loss ratio of 1.0, which may result in higher premiums for farmers. The bill also prohibits cultivating native sod greater than 5 acres for crop production after May 22, 2008. Governors in the Prairie Pothole National Priority Area have the discretion to decide if this provision applies to their state. Policymakers have long been concerned about fraud and abuse in the federal crop insurance program, leading to the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 containing provisions to address compliance and integrity issues. USDA utilized \"data mining\" techniques to identify producers with high loss ratios, frequency and severity of losses, or suspected poor farming practices in response to ARPA requirements. The USDA has implemented measures to prevent improper payments in the crop insurance program, with estimates of $70-110 million saved annually. Funding for data mining and program integrity activities expired in FY2005, but provisions in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act allowed for up to $11.166 million in mandatory funds to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. The 2008 farm bill authorizes funding for data mining activities and technology upgrades for crop insurance. The 2008 farm bill authorized funding for data mining activities and technology upgrades to improve USDA's computer technology for crop insurance. Policymakers debated making permanent disaster payments to supplement the crop insurance program, with concerns about funding, participation in the program, and production on high-risk lands. Title XV of the farm bill established new disaster programs, including a supplemental revenue assistance payment program for crop. The SURE program compensates eligible crop producers for a portion of crop losses not covered by insurance. Payments are based on target revenue levels and coverage selected by the farmer. Eligibility requires being in or near a declared disaster area. The SURE program compensates crop producers for crop losses in disaster areas. Payments are limited to 90% of expected income and require minimum crop insurance coverage. Concerns have been raised about delayed payments due to the need for market price data. The SURE program compensates crop producers for crop losses in disaster areas based on national average market prices. Some farm groups have requested advance payments until final payment levels can be determined. The 2008 farm bill also authorizes smaller disaster programs for livestock indemnity and forage assistance. The 2008 farm bill includes disaster programs for livestock, honey bees, farm-raised fish, and tree assistance. These programs will be funded through the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund, receiving 3.08% of U.S. Customs receipts collected on certain goods. The total estimated cost over four years is $3.8 billion. The 2008 farm bill includes disaster programs for livestock, honey bees, farm-raised fish, and tree assistance funded through the Agricultural Disaster Relief Trust Fund. The total estimated cost over four years is $3.8 billion, with supplemental crop revenue assistance costing $1.7 billion, increased crop insurance and NAP costs at $1.6 billion, and $500 million for other disaster programs. The Trust Fund has the authority to borrow from the Treasury if needed to meet its obligations."
