The Digital Coast Act of 2014 finds that partnerships with various entities are crucial for accessing geospatial information for the US coastal region, where a significant population resides. Coastal counties have a higher population density compared to the national average. High-resolution remote sensing and geospatial data are essential for managing the coastal zone and economy, including flood prediction, hazard assessment, emergency planning, climate change resilience, and decision-making for permits and zoning. The use of high-resolution remote sensing and geospatial data is crucial for managing the coastal zone and economy, including flood prediction, hazard assessment, emergency planning, climate change resilience, permitting and zoning decision-making, habitat and ecosystem health assessments, and landscape change detection. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"coastal region\" as the area from the shoreline to the territorial sea, and \"coastal state\" as a state bordering the Atlantic, Pacific, or Arctic Ocean, among others, including certain territories. The Digital Coast is a constituent-driven effort led by the Secretary to provide geospatial data and tools for coastal management in designated coastal zones. The Federal Geographic Data Committee promotes coordinated development and sharing of geospatial data. The Federal Geographic Data Committee promotes the coordinated development, use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data on a national basis. This includes remote sensing and other geospatial activities such as collecting, storing, and retrieving data depicting natural or manmade features of the Earth. The Secretary of Commerce oversees these efforts through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Building the Digital Coast is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary will establish Digital Coast to provide data integration, tool development, training, documentation, dissemination, and archive. This includes making data accessible on various websites, developing decision-support tools, documenting data to standards, and archiving raw data. The Secretary will coordinate activities to maximize data collection, sharing, and integration, consulting with coastal managers, decision-makers, coastal States, local governments, and nongovernmental entities. Additionally, they will consult with other Federal agencies on relevant activities. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act, and Hydrographic Services Improvement Act require participation in establishing standards for data interoperability among NOAA, federal agencies, state/local governments, and the private sector. In carrying out the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act, the Secretary shall coordinate with the private sector, seek assistance from the Federal Geographic Data Committee, and focus on filling data needs for critical coastal management issues. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act aims to improve coordination for acquiring and integrating key data sets for coastal management, including coastal elevation, land use, socioeconomic, infrastructure, structures, living resources, cadastral, and aerial imagery data. Financial agreements will be entered into to support the implementation of the Act. The Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act allows for financial agreements to support its implementation, including program support, agreements with various entities, and registration fees for training. Additionally, contracts with private sector entities may be entered into for necessary products and services related to data collection. Contracts for remote sensing and geospatial data collection are considered \"surveying and mapping\" services under the Ocean and Coastal Mapping Integration Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary for fiscal years 2015 through 2020 to carry out the provisions of this section."
