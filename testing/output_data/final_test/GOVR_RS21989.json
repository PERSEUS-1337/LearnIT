    "content": "C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a West African country, faced a political-military crisis after a disputed presidential election in 2010 between Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara. The conflict escalated into a civil war in March 2011. The international community supported Ouattara as the legitimate president. The international community, including key multilateral institutions like ECOWAS, AU, and the U.N. Security Council, pressured Gbagbo to step down through various measures such as sanctions. The armed conflict in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire reached a critical point on April 11 when troops supporting Ouattara seized the presidential compound in Abidjan, leading to Gbagbo's arrest. Detainees, including Gbagbo and his wife Simone, were initially held at the Golf Hotel in Abidjan under UNOCI protection. Gbagbo was later transferred to Korhogo for house arrest, while Simone was moved to Odienne. Some members of Gbagbo's cabinet and family remain under house arrest at a seaside residence near Abidjan. Around 70 of the initial 120 detainees were released in mid-April. Gbagbo's capture by pro-Ouattara forces, known as the Republican Forces of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, was coordinated. The capture of Gbagbo by pro-Ouattara forces in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was coordinated with French and UNOCI peacekeepers. Prior to his arrest, forces attacked his compound to neutralize heavy weapons. The operation aimed to protect civilians, U.N. personnel, and foreign diplomats. The U.N. Security Council authorized such actions in Resolution 1975. Gbagbo's detention followed heavy combat in Abidjan and failed attempts to negotiate his surrender. The FRCI forces in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire seized control of key areas including Yamoussoukro and San Pedro before entering Abidjan. Urban combat ensued in the city for a week and a half, resulting in civilian casualties and attacks on foreign diplomats. The FRCI campaign faced little resistance due to desertions. The FRCI campaign in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire encountered little resistance, with desertions, top military leadership defections, and looting among pro-Gbagbo forces. FRCI troops patrolled Abidjan, engaging in limited fighting to disarm pro-Gbagbo forces in the Yopougon section. Despite warnings, FRCI forces engaged in looting, posing a threat to order and security. The deputy FRCI commander acknowledged the threat posed by looting to security and order. Negotiations with pro-Gbagbo fighters in Yopougon led to the surrender of 50 fighters, but combat with die-hard fighters, including Liberian mercenaries, continued. Intra-FRCI tensions over looting also contributed to ongoing armed clashes. During the post-electoral crisis, intra-FRCI tensions over looting and factional rivalries led to armed clashes in San Pedro and Abidjan. The Invisible Commandos, led by Ibrahim Coulibaly, acted as a self-defense force before carrying out offensive attacks against pro-Gbagbo forces. Coulibaly and his supporters were anti-Gbagbo. Ibrahim Coulibaly and his supporters, who were anti-Gbagbo, played a key role in fighting pro-Gbagbo forces and facilitating Ouattara's rise to power. Coulibaly was seen as a potential political interest group that could challenge Ouattara's authority or demand political power within the new government. Despite dismissing differences with other FRCI elements, Coulibaly expressed loyalty to Ouattara but hinted at disagreements with Soro. Ouattara ordered Coulibaly and other militia leaders to disarm voluntarily or face forcible disarmament due to the threat posed by Coulibaly. Despite agreeing to disarm, Coulibaly failed to attend meetings on disarming and sought a meeting with Ouattara. The Defense Minister ordered Invisible Commando forces to join the FRCI, leading to an attack on Coulibaly's group by pro-Soro FRCI elements. The UNOCI unit contradicted claims of voluntary disarmament by Coulibaly's group. Coulibaly died during fighting, with conflicting accounts of the cause. His passing removed a potential source of instability. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's AU membership was reinstated on April 21. President Ouattara announced his formal inauguration as president on May 21, 2011, and plans to form an inclusive government that includes ministers from Gbagbo's FPI party, contingent on FPI recognizing his election. The cabinet will have 32-36 posts, with nominees being negotiated between Ouattara and the Gbagbo camp, in line with AU recommendations for a unity government. On April 28, the U.N. Security Council renewed an arms embargo and import ban on rough diamonds from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, along with targeted restrictions on eight individuals. The resolution allowed for technical training support for Ivorian Security Sector Reform efforts under U.N. monitoring. It emphasized disarmament efforts, regional security coordination, and monitoring of sanctions violations. President Ouattara called for social order and calm after Gbagbo's detention. President Ouattara emphasized the need for social order and security, urging against revenge and reprisal attacks. He set a two-month timeline for achieving peace through disarming militiamen and collecting weapons, with support from France's Force Licorne and UNOCI peacekeepers. President Ouattara emphasized the need for social order and security, urging against revenge and reprisal attacks. Gbagbo forces began surrendering arms, with calls for peace from Gbagbo and his supporters. Despite looting and limited combat, some areas saw a return to normalcy with functioning gas stations and public transport. By April 13, most areas of the city had restored services that were previously disrupted by fighting. Several Gbagbo-allied generals and security service leaders, including the CECOS special forces unit, switched allegiance to Ouattara. Humanitarian conditions are slowly improving, with 850,000 internally displaced persons and over 165,778 refugees in neighboring countries. U.N. agencies issued a revised emergency humanitarian action plan for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire on April 8. The agencies issued a revised Regional Emergency Humanitarian Action Plan for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, increasing the donor appeal to $160.4 million. U.N. agencies also appealed for $146.5 million for humanitarian responses in Liberia. Non-EHAP humanitarian aid of $26 million was given to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and over $25 million to Liberia. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization provided aid to farming households affected by displacement. U.S. assistance totaled $34.48 million as of late-April. As of late-April, $34.48 million in U.S. assistance was provided to address emergency humanitarian needs in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Liberia. The assistance was channeled through U.N. and other international agencies, with a portion going to NGOs in Liberia. OFDA and FFP provided aid for food and disaster relief, while PRM allocated funds for refugees. The Obama Administration welcomed Gbagbo's capture in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, stating it was a victory for democracy. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton emphasized that dictators must respect the voice of their people in free and fair elections. President Obama and Secretary Clinton praised France, the U.N., and other international entities for their role in resolving the crisis in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Obama called Ouattara to offer U.S. support for his efforts in uniting the country, restarting the economy, and reforming security forces. The House Subcommittee on Africa held a hearing on the crisis and considered a resolution supporting democratic aspirations in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. During a markup session on H.Res. 85, the House Subcommittee on Africa accepted an amendment offered by Representative Payne regarding the political crisis in Cote d'Ivoire. Another bill, H.Res. 212, introduced by Representative Timothy V. Johnson, was not considered. The sole witness at the hearing, William Fitzgerald from the State Department, discussed current developments in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and U.S. policy towards the country. State Department officials are working to lift U.S. restrictions on non-humanitarian aid to Cote d'Ivoire since 1999. They are finalizing a policy paper on U.S. support for the Ouattara government, including disarmament, demobilization, and security sector reform programs. Field assessments are being conducted, with the policy paper pending finalization after FY2011 country-level allocations are determined. Gbagbo's capture led to a rapid decrease in the crisis. Gbagbo's capture resulted in a decrease in combat and casualties, with sporadic fighting continuing in some areas of Abidjan. The FRCI focused on mopping-up operations against pro-Gbagbo fighters, criticized for brutal reprisals and extrajudicial killings. Prior violence by both FRCI and pro-Gbagbo forces had led to civilian deaths, human rights abuses, and displacements. The violence in Ivory Coast, perpetrated by FRCI and pro-Gbagbo forces, included abuses and killings during post-election operations to suppress protests and raids on opposition strongholds. Attacks on civilians by security forces and militias, as well as inter-communal violence, drew criticism from international observers and governments. Ethnicity was used as a basis for attacks on civilians by supporters of the presidential claimants. The post-electoral violence in Ivory Coast raised concerns from international human rights observers and governments due to war crimes and violations of human rights law. The death toll from political violence is estimated to be in the thousands, with at least 462 deaths reported by March 25. Fighting in late March and early April, particularly in Duekoue, resulted in many more deaths, with most attributed to pro-Ouattara forces. The Ouattara government's immediate priorities include restoring security and resuming cocoa exports. The Ouattara government's key immediate priorities are to resume cocoa exports, banking operations, and jump-start post-conflict economic development in Ivory Coast. Infrastructure and public services, especially in the north, require substantial new investment due to neglect during the country's decade of conflict. The U.N. Secretary General's Special Representative stated that the economy will recover quickly as there was minimal damage to infrastructure, with the airport, seaport, bridges, and roads all intact and operational. The government of Ouattara, led by a PhD economist and former IMF official, has received international economic assistance. France is providing $578 million in aid, including loans for budget support and debt repayment. The EU has offered a $260 million grant for social spending and debt clearance in Ivory Coast. Infrastructure and public services in the country, including electricity and water supply, are undamaged and operational. The international economic assistance to Ivory Coast includes support for health, water, sanitation, agriculture, and clearing debt arrears. The World Bank and AfDB are considering aid packages, with the World Bank potentially reactivating programs worth $100 million. Focus areas include emergency infrastructure, water services, trash pickup, schools, clinics, and targeted assistance for victims of sexual violence. Donor governments may write off $3 billion of Ivory Coast's $14 billion debt. Donor governments are considering a $3 billion write-off of Ivory Coast's $14 billion debt. President Ouattara signed a decree to reinitiate cocoa exports by asserting control over the port of Abidjan and lifting a ban on cocoa and coffee exports. The port reopened on April 18, with plans to load ships with cocoa exports. The EU lifted sanctions on Gbagbo-controlled entities, allowing for the shipment of 450,000 tonnes of cocoa soon. Tonnes of cocoa previously held back from export under a ban were expected to be shipped soon, with exporters requesting to pay taxes by check to clear warehoused stocks quickly. Clearance of the stocks, projected to increase during the mid-crop harvest, was expected to take months. French forces handed over control of Abidjan's airport to FRCI on April 17. The national Ivoirian branch of BCEAO opened on April 26 to inject cash liquidity into the banking system. The Ouattara administration sought to airlift supplies into the country the prior week. The Ouattara administration sought to airlift supplies of the regional West African CFA franc into the country. Key private banks resumed operations in late April, signaling market optimism in Ouattara and the prospect of foreign investment. The price of Ivoirian international bonds rose in late March/early April, with a rally in early May after the finance minister declared intention to make up missed payments. The Ouattara government prioritizes transitional justice, including establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address human rights violations. Charles Konan Banny is planned to lead the commission. Ouattara appointed Banny to lead a Commission for Truth, Reconciliation, and Dialogue, drawing from South Africa's TRC experience. Gbagbo, his wife Simone, and supporters face judicial investigation for crimes under the former regime. Justice Minister focuses on \"crimes of blood,\" arms purchase, and embezzlement. The government is conducting a criminal probe against Gbagbo, his wife Simone, and 100 associates for alleged human rights abuses. The Ouattara government assured that their rights would be respected and their safety guaranteed. Ouattara also requested the International Criminal Court to investigate alleged crimes. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor is conducting a preliminary examination in Ivory Coast on alleged crimes committed by different parties to the conflict. The ICC prosecutor plans to request authorization for a formal investigation into post-electoral crimes against humanity and war crimes. The U.N. Human Rights Council is also investigating human rights violations in Ivory Coast. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is investigating recent events, including killings in western Cote d'Ivoire. Civic freedoms and efforts for reconciliation are expected to be a focus, with reports of human rights abuses, suppression of political protests, and restrictions on press freedoms. Retaliation by pro-Ouattara supporters against members of Gbagbo's FPI political party has been reported, along with limitations on pro-Gbagbo news outlets. Pro-Gbagbo news outlets have faced limitations and self-censorship, with some newspapers not being published and facilities destroyed. Journalists and publishers have been threatened despite government commitments to press freedoms. Establishing long-term peace will require DDR, SSR, and integrating the FRCI military forces. Integrating the FRCI military forces with Gbagbo's forces poses challenges similar to past DDR and SSR efforts. Rivalries and controversies may arise, especially with government recruitment of new soldiers from pro-Ouattara youth militia. This recruitment contrasts with previous demobilization efforts under the OPA. The Ouattara administration is demobilizing troops instead of recruiting new ones to ensure loyalty of national security forces, potentially facing charges of ethnic favoritism. Former FN FRCI elements hold significant military political influence, with concerns that Ouattara may be seen as indebted to them. Prime Minister Guillaume Soro's selection may help mitigate claims from the FN, especially after the death of Ibrahim \"IB\" Coulibaly. Ouattara faces challenges in rebuilding state legitimacy and operational capacity, including holding legislative elections, appointing diverse government officials, reunifying the national territory, and centralizing the treasury. National political unification remains a key challenge, especially in countering perceptions among Gbagbo supporters. Despite efforts to counter perceptions of French influence in his rise to power, Gbagbo supporters still pose a divisive political problem in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The 2010 presidential election was held under the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, aimed at reunifying the divided country. The political stalemate in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire between government-controlled southern region and rebel-controlled zone threatened U.S. and international efforts for peace and democratic governance. The country's economic importance in the region and potential negative impacts of sustained armed conflict were key concerns for regional stability and humanitarian welfare. The United States has made significant investments in West Africa to promote political stability, peace, democratic governance, state capacity-building, and economic growth. It has supported peace efforts in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire since 2002, providing funding for military intervention forces and UN missions. In 2010, a presidential election runoff vote was held in the country. In November 2010, a presidential election runoff vote in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire led to a dispute between incumbent president Laurent Gbagbo and former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara. Both claimed victory, forming rival governments and vying for control. Ouattara based his claim on U.N.-certified results showing he won with 54.1% of votes, primarily from the northern electorate. Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9, a former head of state, garnered 45.9% of votes from the predominantly Muslim, northern electorate and some Akan-centered political base. Gbagbo won 45.9% of votes from the south, including Krou and central-east Akan areas. The international community endorsed the IEC poll results, urging Gbagbo to accept and cede the presidency to Ouattara. However, Gbagbo appealed to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's Constitutional Council, which annulled the decision due to voting irregularities and electoral violence. The Constitutional Council nullified poll results in seven northern departments, citing voting irregularities and electoral violence. Gbagbo was proclaimed president with 51.5% of votes, while Ouattara received 48.6%. Gbagbo claimed victory based on the Council's decision, rejecting international calls to step down. The SRSG for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire certified Alassane Ouattara as the winner of the presidential election, rejecting Laurent Gbagbo's claim due to lack of factual basis and partisan bias in the Constitutional Council's decision. The council's decision to reject the IEC's determination was influenced by partisan bias and a coordinated effort by Gbagbo supporters to discredit the runoff poll results. This included a Gbagbo-nominated IEC member tearing up provisional results on live television, causing the IEC to miss its legal deadline for announcing the results. The council's decision was viewed skeptically due to its statistically unlikely outcome. The council's decision to annul 597,010 votes in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was controversial, as it represented 10.4% of all registered voters. Some argue that the council only had the authority to cancel the entire election, not part of it, and order new elections. However, the council's president cited precedent for partial cancellations in the 1995 presidential election. The cancellation of votes in the election had a significant impact on the outcome, leading to political tension and violence. President Gbagbo's refusal to concede was fueled by international pressure and accusations of infringing on national sovereignty. SRSG Choi's certification of the runoff results further escalated the situation. The Gbagbo government's refusal to concede the presidency led to accusations of infringing on national sovereignty and the rule of law. Despite international pressure and UNOCI's support for Ouattara, Gbagbo demanded the immediate departure of UNOCI peacekeepers, which was rejected by the UNSC. Gbagbo's call was deemed irrelevant as he was not recognized as the legitimate leader by the United Nations or most governments. Ouattara, on the other hand, supported the continued role of UNOCI in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Gbagbo's government took a firm stance on his disputed electoral win, attempting to maintain power through various means such as controlling revenue streams, ejecting UNOCI, violent raids, and a public relations campaign. The public relations campaign by Gbagbo supporters included distributing government and pro-Gbagbo press articles and blogs promoting rumors and conspiracy theories, including alleged plans to oust Gbagbo with foreign assistance and military collusion between FN and UNOCI. State-owned media promoted xenophobic messages inciting hatred and violence, religious and ethnic division, and intolerance against international organizations and non-LMP leaders. The Gbagbo camp utilized official Ivorian government websites, foreign lobbyists, and a PR campaign to promote their views. In contrast, the Ouattara government hired U.S. firms for representation and established a TV station at the Golf Hotel in Abidjan. Gbagbo also explored alternative actions to maintain power. Gbagbo explored alternative actions to maintain power, including suggesting negotiations with Ouattara for a power-sharing deal. Ouattara initially rejected the idea but later agreed to form a unity government if Gbagbo recognized him as the legitimate leader of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Gbagbo proposed international mediation to resolve the crisis in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but his suggestion was rejected by the United States and other major governments. In late December, Gbagbo demanded a vote recount and amnesty for any criminal charges he might face. The contested election outcome led to political tension, violence, and international pressure for Gbagbo to concede power to Ouattara. The security situation in Ivory Coast after the election runoff was tense and unpredictable, leading the United Nations to relocate non-essential staff. Armed clashes occurred between security forces supporting Gbagbo and Ouattara, resulting in damage to the U.S. embassy. There were also extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses by state security forces against Ouattara supporters. As of March 24, 2011, U.N. estimates confirmed 462 post-electoral political killings by supporters of both presidential claimants in Ivory Coast. The United Nations attributed most deaths to \"extra-judicial killings committed by elements of the security forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo.\" Killings, rapes, and abductions were on the rise, with some incidents related to communal clashes over unresolved political issues. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ongoing reports of abductions, illegal detention, and attacks against civilians. Continuing reports of abductions, illegal detention, and attacks against civilians in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were described in a report by Pillay on the human rights situation through January 31, 2011. State security forces killed seven unarmed female protesters on March 3, with additional fatalities in follow-up protests. President Obama and other top U.S. officials condemned the violence, while France called for a U.N. inquiry. In late March, a residential area in Abidjan was shelled, resulting in casualties. In late March, a residential area in Abidjan was shelled, resulting in between 25 and 30 deaths. The total number of fatalities and abuses resulting from post-electoral violence was likely higher than documented by the United Nations. Additional killings, detentions, and abuses were reported prior to the U.N. assessment period and continued later. Non-governmental human rights monitoring groups reported a rise in human rights abuses, including politically motivated use of rape as intimidation. The campaign of organized violence in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, led by security forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo and supporting militias, is likely amounting to crimes against humanity. Pro-Ouattara forces have also been reported killing civilians, with potential ethnic or political motivations, risking becoming crimes against humanity as well. Reports of mass graves have emerged, with UNOCI being prevented from investigating by state security forces. The escalating tension and violence led to the evacuation of international personnel and citizens from the country. The deteriorating political and security situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire led to diplomatic missions evacuating personnel and citizens. The State Department warned against travel to the country and ordered the departure of non-emergency embassy personnel. This prompted many Ivoirian citizens to flee as refugees to neighboring countries or become internally displaced. Recent fighting indicated the start of a new civil war in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The deteriorating political and security situation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire led to diplomatic missions evacuating personnel and citizens. The State Department warned against travel to the country and ordered the departure of non-emergency embassy personnel. This prompted many Ivoirian citizens to flee as refugees to neighboring countries or become internally displaced. Recent fighting indicated the start of a new civil war in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. A number of indicators had previously signaled the possibility of this outcome, including reports of pro-Gbagbo troops being assisted by mercenaries from Liberia and a rise in militia recruitment by pro-Gbagbo and pro-Forces Nouvelles elements. The Compagnie des Scorpions Guetteurs, a former pro-Gbagbo militia, has been reactivated for infiltration and reconnaissance missions in preparation for a multi-pronged attack. Pro-Gbagbo youth groups and militias are being armed and coordinated by high-ranking officials. The Young Patriots, an ultra-nationalist group, are working with state security forces to target opposition-affiliated individuals for arrest, abduction, or assassination. Young Patriots armed with weapons set up roadblocks in Abidjan to hunt pro-Ouattara rebels and obstruct U.N. staff. Police and youth gangs looted homes of Ouattara government officials. Pro-Ouattara and pro-Gbagbo supporters carried out attacks based on ethnicity and political affiliation, including burnings of victims. Foreigners were targeted by pro-Gbagbo supporters due to international rejection of Gbagbo's election claim. Supporters of Gbagbo were angered by international rejection of his election claim and financial pressure on his administration. State media propaganda accused UNOCI and foreign governments of collaborating with the FN. Young Patriots rampaged through Abidjan, attacking foreigners and UN staff. Fighting in Abidjan was frequent, initiated by state security forces loyal to Gbagbo. Raids on opposition strongholds led to extralegal detentions and killings, sparking retaliatory violence. A security force conducting a raid in Abidjan was ambushed by counter-assailants, resulting in the deaths of 20-30 team members. The assailants were believed to be affiliated with the Movement for the Liberation of the Peoples of Abobo-Anyama. This clash marked a significant escalation in violence in the area. In early March, a large area of Abobo known as PK-18 was under the control of FN-linked elements supportive of Ouattara. Clashes between Gbagbo and Ouattara forces escalated, spreading to other areas of the city. Pro-Ouattara fighters in Abobo attacked a village populated by pro-Gbagbo Ebrie tribe members, resulting in casualties. Gun battles erupted in Abidjan following a weekend attack by pro-Gbagbo forces on Abobo. In Abidjan, gun battles erupted in neighborhoods south of Abobo and near the central business district. Pro-Gbagbo forces seized villages in western C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, escalating the conflict. The national army chief of staff stated that pro-Gbagbo forces were prepared for war. In the west, FN forces gained control of key towns like Duekoue and Daloa, expanding towards the center and east of the country. Reports of heavy fighting in Du\u00e9kou\u00e9 and near the Ghanaian border led to humanitarian agencies withdrawing their workers. The FN's territorial gains could give them control over the Ivoirian border with Liberia, where ex-combatants from the Liberian civil war were recruited. In late March, reports indicated possible violations of the U.N. arms embargo on C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, with pro-Gbagbo forces repairing attack helicopters and preparing rocket launchers. The threat of renewed armed conflict was fueled by calls for Gbagbo's removal by force and ECOWAS's consideration of military intervention. As of mid-January 2011, the proposal remained the focus of active military planning. Ouattara has called for a peaceful resolution of the crisis, but rebel movement stated force may be necessary to remove Gbagbo from power. Tension and anti-UNOCI sentiment led to physical attacks on peacekeepers hindering their movement and protection of the Ouattara government. Pro-Gbagbo youth abducted and detained two UNOCI peacekeepers before releasing them. The UNOCI peacekeepers were detained at a state Republican Guard base before being released, prompting warnings from UNSG Ban Ki-moon about attacks on UN forces. Any actions obstructing UN operations will not be tolerated, and consequences will be faced for human rights violations or attacks on peacekeepers. The UNSC increased the size of UNOCI in response to the threat. The International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor warned Gbagbo and key Ivorian security services about committing rights violations. The Prosecutor monitored violence against civilians and UNOCI peacekeepers, threatening prosecution for those who cause violence. Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, a leader of Gbagbo's militant supporters, was cited as an example. In response to threats against UNOCI peacekeepers, including from Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, actions obstructing UN operations will not be tolerated. Ban warned of the danger faced by UNOCI peacekeepers, particularly a threat to attack the Golf Hotel. He emphasized that UNOCI is authorized to use all necessary means to protect its personnel and civilians. Rising violence in Abidjan led to around 250,000 urban residents fleeing for safety, with over 60,000 internally displaced in western C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Additionally, nearly 102,000 Ivoirian refugees had fled to neighboring Liberia due to fighting in western C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In western C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, over 102,000 Ivoirian refugees sought shelter in Liberia, with more arriving daily. Additionally, there were over 4,888 refugees in neighboring countries and between 700,000 to 1 million internally displaced persons. The conflict caused negative humanitarian effects, including a week-long power outage in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, affecting water supply and healthcare services. Social workers were also absent in various parts of the country. In Liberia, social workers were absent due to unpaid salaries, causing disruptions in healthcare and education. Prices of consumer goods were rising, and medical drug distribution was hindered. Refugee numbers grew rapidly, with some fluctuating based on conditions in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The UNHCR had to suspend individual registration at times due to the influx of refugees, leading to strains on local communities' food and water supplies. Plans were made to address the emergency needs of 250,000 refugees and identify additional camps and host communities. In Liberia, the influx of refugees and IDPs strained local communities' food and water supplies. Challenges included registration of a mobile population near porous borders and addressing vulnerabilities in an environment with limited access to basic services. The UNHCR, WFP, Liberian authorities, and NGOs were providing refugees with water, sanitation, food, and shelter. Efforts were made to establish a humanitarian corridor for civilians and ensure access for humanitarian agencies. The United States continued to provide aid for emergency humanitarian needs. The United States is providing aid for emergency humanitarian needs in Liberia and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire through collaborative efforts between the State Department, USAID, PRM, OFDA, and FFP. Assistance includes refugee aid, food aid for refugees and host communities, and additional assistance in response to a complex emergency disaster declaration in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The U.S. provided $33.73 million in emergency humanitarian aid for the crisis in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, channeled through international organizations. Following a disaster declaration, $100,000 was allocated to aid Liberian host communities impacted by the refugee influx, with proposals under review for further assistance. The U.S. provided emergency humanitarian aid for the crisis in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, with additional assistance planned pending a needs assessment. President Obama authorized $12.6 million in refugee assistance for Liberia and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. FFP provided support for WFP emergency operations in Liberia for refugees and targeted segments. In early March, the U.S. approved $7.5 million in aid for WFP emergency operations in Liberia and $4.5 million for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The international community rejected Gbagbo's claim of electoral victory and endorsed Ouattara as the president. Efforts were made to force Gbagbo to cede the presidency. The international community took various actions to pressure Gbagbo to accept the election results, including diplomatic isolation, sanctions, and the threat of military intervention. Regional bodies like ECOWAS recognized Ouattara as the President-elect and called on Gbagbo to step down. The AU also suspended C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's participation until further notice. The AU Commission Peace and Security Council endorsed the ECOWAS decision on C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, suspending the country from AU activities until the democratically elected President assumes power. The UNSC also supported ECOWAS and AU decisions, calling on all stakeholders to respect the election outcome. The UN denied Gbagbo's status as president, leading to implicit recognition of Ouattara as President-elect. The United Nations officially recognized Ouattara as the legal president of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, with the U.N. General Assembly accepting his election and appointing Youssouf Bamba as the new Ivorian U.N. ambassador. Several governments also dropped recognition of the Gbagbo government in support of Ouattara. French government pledged to recognize an envoy named by Ouattara and acknowledged his dismissal of the Gbagbo-designated ambassador to France. The French government grounded Gbagbo's plane in response to Ouattara's request and pledged to recognize an envoy named by Ouattara. Several countries, including Canada, the UK, and Belgium, only accepted ambassadors named by Ouattara. Gbagbo retaliated by declaring ambassadors from Canada, France, and the UK persona non-grata. AU and ECOWAS held meetings and sent diplomatic delegations to address the crisis in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The AU dispatched diplomatic delegations to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to diffuse tensions and convince Gbagbo to respect election results. The \"Panel of Five\" led by AU Peace and Security Commissioner Ramtane Lamamra aimed to test AU's credibility in resolving the crisis and ensuring Ouattara's assumption of power. The AU dispatched a panel of presidents to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to consult with opposing parties. The panel's mandate was extended until the end of March to find a political solution. AU chairman Jean Ping traveled to Abidjan to continue consultations. In early March, Ping traveled to Abidjan on behalf of the AU panel to consult with the two presidential claimants. The panel presented conflict resolution findings and recommendations at a March 10 meeting. Ouattara attended, but Gbagbo did not, sending delegates instead. The panel reaffirmed Ouattara's election win, recommended Gbagbo step down, and called for a national unity government to be formed. The AU panel recommended forming a national unity government and a peace process based on the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. It criticized the partisan composition and dysfunction of the IEC and Constitutional Council for the disputed election outcome. The panel particularly questioned the Constitutional Council's decision to cancel nearly 600,000 votes, calling it \"disturbing.\" Former President Gbagbo's tenure was also mentioned. The AU panel recommended a national unity government and peace process based on the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. It criticized the IEC and Constitutional Council for the disputed election outcome, questioning the cancellation of nearly 600,000 votes. Former President Gbagbo's decade-long tenure was highlighted, with efforts to implement recommendations facing challenges due to the intransigence of both parties. Gbagbo's camp rejected the panel's recommendations, leading to a lack of compromise and peace. Some press analyses on March 11 concluded that the AU panel's efforts had failed as the two sides remained entrenched and unwilling to compromise. On March 27, Ouattara rejected the appointment of Jos\u00e9 Brito as the AU High Representative for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, citing Brito's lack of former head of state status and alleged ties to Gbagbo. Ouattara accepted the need for a cross-party government for peace but rejected certain core aspects of the panel's recommendations. Ouattara emphasized his control over the unity government called for by the AU panel, stating that he will select members from various parties and civil society to address the country's economic and social crisis. He mentioned Gbagbo's honorable exit and future discussions. The panel's recommendations were not overtly endorsed by Ouattara, but they were seen as a success in advocating for a unified AU approach to resolving the crisis. South African President Jacob Zuma's agreement to the recommendations was particularly noteworthy, given prior disagreements among AU member states. South Africa's prior stance on the Ivorian crisis was seen as a possible obstacle to resolution. The Zuma government had issued conflicting statements, endorsing ECOWAS's findings for Ouattara but also questioning the election outcome. Discord among AU member states was evident, with Gambia supporting Gbagbo and opposing military intervention, and Ugandan President Museveni rejecting international recognition of Ouattara. Press reports suggested support for a negotiated solution and opposition to regional military intervention in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Angola's support for Gbagbo in the Ivorian crisis was not overt, as they did not officially recognize an election winner or provide funding assistance. South Africa and other countries also did not fully back Gbagbo, casting doubt on claims of widespread support. ECOWAS heads of state urged Gbagbo to peacefully exit the presidency after he failed to heed their demands. ECOWAS urged Gbagbo to peacefully exit the presidency and offered to escort him into exile. If he refused, they would consider using force to achieve the goals of the Ivorian people. After Gbagbo did not comply with the demand, ECOWAS deferred immediate military intervention for further negotiation but planned for a possible deployment. Gbagbo refused to cede power despite negotiations with AU mediator Raila Odinga and ECOWAS President Gbeho. Talks were unsuccessful, with Gbagbo making promises he did not fulfill. ECOWAS military chiefs had plans to forcefully remove him from power. Several member countries' chiefs prepared plans to forcefully take over power from Gbagbo using the ECOWAS standby force of 6,500 troops if diplomatic efforts fail. A logistics meeting was held in Mali to finalize troop deployment details. Ghana declined to participate in the intervention due to other peacekeeping commitments and domestic security concerns. Nigeria also had security concerns that might prevent them from contributing forces. The United Kingdom announced political support for ECOWAS use of force in the UNSC but did not offer troops. Military contingency plans with France were prepared, but details were not public. The Ouattara camp called for a special forces operation to remove Gbagbo quickly. The potential danger to civilians from such an operation was significant. Key Gbagbo supporters warned of war if he was forcibly ousted, with Nigeria's former military head delivering a strong message on behalf of ECOWAS. Despite the tough stance, no progress was made in resolving the crisis. On October 15, 2010, the UNSC renewed arms embargo, financial assets freeze, and travel restrictions on C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In January 2011, USUN Permanent Representative Rice suggested the need to strengthen the U.N. sanctions regime due to the political stalemate. France and Nigeria proposed expanded U.N. sanctions targeting Gbagbo administration members in March 2011. The EU imposed various sanctions on members of the Gbagbo administration in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, including arms embargo, financial asset freeze, travel restrictions, and bans on heavy weapons and rough diamonds. Visa bans were also imposed on former president Laurent Gbagbo and other individuals obstructing the peace process. Additionally, an asset freeze was extended to individuals refusing to recognize the democratically elected president. The EU imposed sanctions on entities supporting Laurent Gbagbo's administration in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, including visa bans on 85 individuals and restrictions on financial dealings with key ports. These measures could impact cocoa exports and the national oil refinery. Multilateral financial institutions also halted credit to weaken Gbagbo's regime. The African Development Bank and the World Bank have stopped lending to Ivory Coast and closed their office in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. They support efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully and have urged President Gbagbo to step down after losing the elections. The AfDB has not issued further statements on the crisis. The AfDB and World Bank have halted operations in Ivory Coast. The IMF has not made any public statements regarding its involvement with the government. UEMOA recognized Ouattara as the legitimate president. As the legitimately elected president of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ouattara was given authority over UEMOA-related activities and BCEAO transactions. UEMOA member countries use the West African CFA franc, backed by the BCEAO and pegged to the Euro. The French treasury indirectly supports the CFA. Following this action, banks in Abidjan initially refused to cash civil servant paychecks, causing lines of impatient civil servants. However, the issue was resolved, and Gbagbo officials claimed access to funding sources including customs, tax, cocoa, and oil revenues. Gbagbo government had access to various funding sources like customs, tax, cocoa, and oil revenues to pay salaries but pressured banks and businesses for credit and payments. Ouattara camp complained about BCEAO channeling cash to Gbagbo despite recognizing Ouattara as the legitimate president. The Ouattara camp attempted to cut funding to Gbagbo by sanctioning Ivorian officials, leading to the resignation of BCEAO's head. In retaliation, the Gbagbo administration seized BCEAO's local offices and assets, the regional stock exchange, and forced foreign banks to suspend operations in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. These actions further paralyzed the country. The Gbagbo administration seized assets of affected banks like Standard Chartered Plc, Citigroup Inc., BNP Paribas SA, and Societe Generale SA, leading to a further paralysis of the banking sector. The government also partially nationalized cocoa, coffee, and possibly gold mining sectors, and may seize unexported cocoa stocks due to EU sanctions compliance. Financial pressures reduced the government's ability to finance operations by early March 2011. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire faced challenges in meeting its sovereign bond repayment, leading to a default on a $29 million coupon payment. Both the Gbagbo and Ouattara governments pledged to make the payment by February 1 to avoid falling into sovereign debt default status. However, accessing international bond markets may prove difficult due to past defaults and national debt restructuring. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire faced challenges meeting bond repayments, leading to a default. Pro-Gbagbo activists suggested dropping the CFA currency for a new national currency, MIR, to symbolically oppose France. The CFA is backed by BCEAO and pegged to the Euro. Todd Moss proposed a declaration of non-transferability to prevent Gbagbo regime from seeking credit elsewhere. Backed by major donor governments, a \"declaration of non-transferability\" regarding new loans to the Gbagbo regime was proposed to prevent illegitimate loans. President Obama congratulated Ouattara on his electoral victory and urged all parties to respect the will of the electorate. The international community would hold accountable those who thwart the democratic process. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other top U.S. officials supported President Alassane Dramane Ouattara as the legitimate leader of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. President Obama condemned the use of deadly force against unarmed protesters and expressed concern about escalating violence and its impact on the region. The United States called for all armed parties to protect civilians from harm. The United States supports President Ouattara as the legitimate leader of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and condemns violence against civilians. The U.S. is committed to holding perpetrators of atrocities accountable. Despite recognizing Ouattara's election, the U.S. views the Gbagbo government as legally responsible for any actions taken. The U.S. accepted the credentials of the new Ivoirian ambassador appointed by Ouattara. Daouda Diabate, appointed by President Ouattara, arrived in early February 2011 to take up his post as the new ambassador of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to the United States. The U.S. recognized Kouame Christophe Kouakou as the interim replacement for the recalled ambassador, Yao Charles Koffi. Efforts to terminate Koffi's status as ambassador began in mid-December, with President Obama attempting to communicate with Gbagbo to urge him to cede power to Ouattara, but his calls were refused. President Obama attempted to communicate with Gbagbo to urge him to cede power to Ouattara, but his calls were refused. He sent a letter outlining the U.S. position and invited Gbagbo to the White House for discussions on advancing democracy. Efforts were made to provide Gbagbo with a \"soft landing\" if he peacefully left power, including the option to move to the United States or receive a position in an international institution. Efforts were made to provide Gbagbo with a \"soft landing\" through offers of asylum from various countries, including the United States, France, and other African nations. The U.S. officials portrayed the assistance as a way to facilitate Gbagbo's exile under international pressure, with conditions requiring a rapid step down and cooperation to prevent further human rights abuses. The proposal offered Gbagbo a chance to prevent human rights abuses, with the possibility of withdrawal if further abuses occur. The US's support for an ECOWAS military intervention in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was uncertain, but discussions with US and UN officials took place regarding potential external support. The U.S. National Security Advisor met with ECOWAS to discuss the peaceful transition of power in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. They expressed support for Ouattara to become President and for Gbagbo to step down. The importance of international unity and coordination in response to the crisis was emphasized. The U.S. imposed travel restrictions on Gbagbo's regime to pressure him to cede power. The U.S. imposed travel restrictions on individuals in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire undermining democracy and reconciliation efforts. The restrictions target affected persons by revoking existing visas and prohibiting new applications. The list of affected individuals was not made public, potentially including Gbagbo's cabinet members. Financial sanctions were also imposed on Gbagbo, his wife, and senior associates under Executive Order 13396. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Gbagbo, his wife, and senior associates for refusing to accept election results and threatening peace in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The move aimed to isolate Gbagbo and his inner circle from the global financial system. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Gbagbo and his associates for rejecting election results in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Representative Donald M. Payne introduced a resolution supporting the democratic aspirations of the Ivoirian people, while Representative Timothy V. Johnson introduced a resolution expressing that the U.S. should not intervene in the civil war. Senator Inhofe supported Gbagbo's electoral claims and opposed accusations of human rights abuses. Senator Inhofe supported Gbagbo's electoral claims and criticized the Obama Administration's response to the Ivoirian crisis, calling the French military mission and UNOCI biased in favor of Ouattara. Representative Donald M. Payne urged Gbagbo to peacefully transfer power to President-elect Ouattara and expressed concern over violent clashes between supporters of the ruling Ivorian Popular Front and the opposition Rally of the Republicans. Representative Payne criticized Gbagbo's efforts to stay in power, urging him to rein in his security forces to prevent further bloodshed. He emphasized the importance of upholding the rule of law and the will of the people to prevent a major crisis. Payne also condemned Gbagbo's regime for waging terror against Ivorians, UN peacekeepers, and foreign residents to maintain political power. Senator Kerry and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman praised the State Department's travel sanctions against members of Laurent Gbagbo's administration in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire for refusing to recognize the legitimate election results. They called for respect for human rights, constructive dialogue, restoration of telecommunications networks, and adherence to international law in the standoff. Berman described Gbagbo as a dictator crippling African countries and supported U.S. and international sanctions on his government. The United States recognized Gbagbo as the de facto leader of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but viewed the 2000 election that brought him to power as operationally \"flawed\" and \"marred by significant violence and irregularities,\" and as illegitimate because it was organized by a government that came to power by undemocratic means. Since the ouster of B\u00e9di\u00e9, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has been subject to a restriction on bilateral aid that prohibits the use of. After the ouster of B\u00e9di\u00e9, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire faced restrictions on bilateral aid due to a military coup. The United States also imposed personal sanctions on individuals threatening peace in the country. The Peace Corps program was suspended and later closed in 2002 and 2003 following the northern rebellion. The US urged parties in the Ivorian conflict to resolve the situation comprehensively. The United States has provided financial and political support to help resolve the Ivorian conflict, including assistance to deploy ECOMICI in 2003 and funding for the UNOCI mission. Additionally, the US has supported limited election activities and provided emergency aid for the humanitarian impact of the post-election crisis. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has also received US food aid and health-related assistance in recent years. The United States has provided financial and political support to help resolve the Ivorian conflict, including assistance to deploy ECOMICI in 2003 and funding for the UNOCI mission. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has also received US food aid and health-related assistance in recent years. The State Department reports that C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children trafficked for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation, with several U.S. anti-trafficking programs in place. If C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's political situation is resolved, the Administration of President Barack Obama would seek to promote credible and peaceful elections, support reconciliation, restore the rule of law, combat impunity, and raise public awareness of corruption. The FY2011 State Department budget request includes $4.2 million in Economic Support Fund assistance for conflict mitigation, reconciliation, good governance, political competition, and civil society support in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The capture of Gbagbo by pro-Ouattara forces has nearly ended the military conflict in the country. The capture of Gbagbo by pro-Ouattara forces has nearly ended the military conflict in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. FRCI forces are working to defeat remaining armed Gbagbo supporters. Many Gbagbo administration figures are in custody for investigation on various charges. The Ouattara government has international support for Transitional Justice, economic recovery, and governance reform efforts. The capture of Gbagbo by pro-Ouattara forces has almost ended the military conflict in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The Ouattara government needs to build legitimacy with the entire population, including Gbagbo supporters, to achieve national reconciliation and unity. Efforts are being made to address root causes of the conflict through various reforms and legislative elections. It is uncertain how closely Ouattara will follow recommendations from the AU mediation panel. If the crisis is resolved, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is poised for successful economic recovery. If the crisis is resolved, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is well-positioned for economic recovery and to reemerge as a regional economic hub. The cocoa economy has performed well despite lack of investment due to political uncertainty. An end to the crisis would boost international confidence in West Africa. The 2010 presidential election was a key part of a peace process to reunify the country, with agreements signed between 2003 and 2007. The 2010 presidential election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was delayed multiple times, allowing President Gbagbo to extend his incumbency for five years after his initial term ended. This delay was seen as a way for Gbagbo to consolidate power and influence the electoral process in his favor. Key challenges in implementing the peace accord in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire included disarmament, voter identification, electoral administration tasks, legal reforms, and disagreements over presidential authority. These issues led to political volatility, protests, and delays in the electoral process. The conflict's root causes included land disputes, migration, national identity, citizenship qualifications, foreign influence, security force abuses, socioeconomic issues, and other aggravating factors. The conduct of the October 31, 2010, first round election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was possible due to progress made in completing election preparation tasks, despite challenges like corruption and crime. However, key provisions of the peace accord, such as disarmament and security sector reform, remained incomplete by polling day, risking the prevention of the elections. In 2009, the government and FN, with UNOCI's help, made progress in citizen identification and voter registration in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Over 6.59 million people were identified and 6.38 million registered to vote, but 2.7 million needed confirmation. Lack of identification papers for millions was a key issue underlying the conflict and political impasse. The voter registration process in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire faced challenges due to administrative capacity issues, lack of access to legal identification rights for second-generation immigrants, and poor management of civil registers post-conflict. Despite eligibility criteria, individuals did not have to prove nationality, leading to disputes over voter list entries and prolonging the registration process. Voter vetting in November 2009 further complicated the situation, jeopardizing the peace process. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) validated a provisional voter list in November 2009, with 5.28 million registrations on the \"white list\" and 1.03 million unconfirmed on the \"grey list\". Challenges were made to half of the unconfirmed registrations, causing delays and postponement of national elections scheduled for November 29, 2009. Despite progress, elections were forecasted for late February or early March 2010, but Prime Minister Soro ordered an indefinite suspension on February 11, 2010. Prime Minister Soro ordered an indefinite suspension of the national voter registration contestation process in February 2010 due to tensions created by validating the provisional voter list. The controversy arose after the IEC chairman distributed voter names erroneously, leading to accusations of voter list rigging and fraud. President Gbagbo dissolved the government and dismissed the Independent Electoral Commission, sparking opposition and protests in multiple Ivoirian cities. The move raised concerns about the delayed presidential election schedule. In subsequent weeks, demonstrations broke out in multiple Ivoirian cities, resulting in around 12 fatalities. After mediation by President Blaise Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso, a new Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) was appointed on February 25, with an opposition member as its chairman. Opposition parties agreed to join a new government, easing political tensions. Processes for producing a final electoral list and distributing identity and voters' cards began in March. At a U.N. Security Council meeting on March 17, the Ivoirian delegate stated that voters at issue in the Mamb\u00e9 controversy had to be removed from the voter list. In May 2010, work towards finalizing the voter rolls continued, with the government insisting on national reunification and disarmament of rebels before elections. Opposition accused the government of delaying voting and called for an expedited election, leading to tensions and a postponed protest march. In May 2010, work towards finalizing the voter rolls continued with the addition of 496,738 persons to the voter roll. The appeals process resulted in 30,293 requests for removal of provisional voters, sparking clashes among party militants and court disputes. The voter roll finalization process in August involved the deletion of 1,273 entries and addition of 7,418 new ones. A separate verification process focused on 1.79 million \"white list\" entries, resulting in the temporary removal of 55,000 persons. After consultations, a final voters list of 5.73 million persons was announced, and national identity cards were ordered to be issued. In July 2008, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1826 certified the final voters list. Progress was made in setting an election timeline, with a first round of presidential elections scheduled for October 31, 2010. Key tasks included distribution of identity and voters cards, establishment of polling sites and stations, recruitment and training of polling staff, coordination of observers, transportation of electoral material, establishment of a results tally centre, and provision of security for the election. The establishment of a results tally centre and provision of security for the election were key tasks in the tight two-month timeline for the electoral process in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Despite smooth progress, a controversy arose when the IEC decided to manually tabulate polling station results due to concerns of bias from the electronic tabulation contractor. The IEC agreed to implement the original electronic tabulation plan, overseen by a committee of experts, to avoid delays in vote counting. Final preparations for poll day were completed just before polling, with UNOCI assisting in distributing voter and national identity cards. By October 19, 83% of voter cards were distributed in Abidjan, but only 40% in other areas. Ballot boxes and polling materials were distributed between October 8 and 11. Distribution of ballot boxes and polling materials occurred between October 8 and 11, with sensitive electoral materials distributed starting on October 23. Polling station workers received training in the days leading up to the vote, mostly within 48 hours of polling. Voter education efforts were primarily handled by external actors, with limited information available to voters on polling day. UNOCI's radio station provided continuous information on the electoral process in multiple languages. The broadcast provided continuous information on the electoral process in multiple languages and gave equal time to all candidates. Voter education efforts were limited, leading to variations in invalid balloting rates across regions. Election security was a key challenge, with the creation of the Integrated Command Centre to provide security during the elections. The ICC was responsible for election security but had limited resources and manpower. Only about 1,000 men were assigned to the ICC, with morale issues among FN elements who were not receiving salaries. UNOCI and French Operation Licorne played a major role in providing security for the elections, with additional police and gendarmes deployed by the government and FN. The UNSC passed Resolution to help ensure a secure election. The UNSC passed Resolution 1942 to increase UNOCI's military and police strength for a secure election. The official electoral campaign began with leading contenders campaigning nationwide, while lesser candidates focused on their political base areas. The campaign was mostly peaceful, with some isolated acts of violence and clashes between party militants reported. Political tensions also arose due to a provocative media environment and heated rhetoric by party supporters. During the official electoral campaign in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, access to state media improved for opposition candidates, although the ruling FPI claimed lack of access to FN-controlled media. Some candidates, including the incumbent, used public media to reach supporters before the campaign period. Foreign delegations monitored the campaign and urged for a peaceful election. During the electoral campaign in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, political parties signed a code of good conduct. The RHDP coalition pledged to support the leading candidate in a run-off against Gbagbo. The first round of voting had a high participation rate of 83.7% and was peaceful, observed by a civil society group. The Civil Society Coalition for Peace and Democratic Development in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (COSOPCI) and affiliated organizations, like the Convention of Civil Society of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (CSCI), monitored the election with international observers. Polling went smoothly with a single ballot system, but faced technical issues. The vote tallying process was transparent, although slow due to transportation issues and staff payment delays. Few irregularities were reported. In the election, there were few tallying irregularities reported, and some observers were barred from monitoring vote counting. The top three candidates were Gbagbo with 38.04% of the votes, Ouattara with 32.07%, and B\u00e9di\u00e9 with 25.24%. A second round was required as no candidate had an absolute majority. The IEC released initial partial results on November 2, with B\u00e9di\u00e9's PDCI party alleging irregularities and calling for a vote recount. The demand for a recount was supported by UDPCI and RHDP coalition, but the Constitutional Council dismissed all allegations and certified the IEC's provisional results. After certifying the first round election results, SRSG Choi approved the runoff vote for November 28, but Prime Minister Soro announced it would be held on November 21 due to technical challenges. President Gbagbo set the date by decree, with the second round campaign scheduled from November 20 to 26. B\u00e9di\u00e9 urged his supporters to vote for Ouattara as per their coalition agreement, and Ouattara promised a union government with B\u00e9di\u00e9 if he won. In the second round of the election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gbagbo ran against Ouattara. The campaign included a live debate focusing on the candidates' views on the conflict and policy differences. Both candidates emphasized peaceful democratic elections and non-violence. Gbagbo and Ouattara had policy differences highlighted during the election campaign, focusing on issues like judicial system deficiencies, military reform, and economic policies. Despite appeals for peace, the runoff poll was tense with negative campaigning and sporadic violence. National identity and land ownership disputes were inflamed by political rhetoric and partisan media. During the runoff election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, there were clashes between youth party militants, resulting in several deaths. State-controlled media provided unbalanced coverage, but both presidential candidates had equal access. Tension rose before the vote, with politically affiliated newspapers spreading rumors and negative portrayals. During the runoff election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, 4,000 troops were deployed by the government and the FN to the integrated command center. President Gbagbo imposed a curfew after 11 PM on the day of the poll. The Carter Center reported improvements in poll worker training and administration for the runoff poll. Voting and counting operations were well-conducted according to monitoring groups. The Carter Center reported that voting and counting operations were largely well-conducted during the runoff election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, with some deficiencies in the supply and distribution of election materials. An IEC order for tabulation results to be publicly displayed was only followed in half of the locations monitored. Voting proceeded peacefully and transparently with a high voter turnout of 81.1%, but there were some incidents of violence, disruptions, and irregularities in a small number of polling places. The European Union observation mission reported witnessing acts of potential voter intimidation in some polling stations during the runoff election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. They also noted serious election day irregularities such as obstruction of ballot box transfer, destruction of election materials, and theft of ballot boxes. Both Gbagbo and Ouattara camps accused each other of electoral irregularities and voter intimidation on polling day. European Union election observers confirmed some of these complaints. The outcome of the election in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was predicted to be controversial due to longstanding difficulties in conducting the poll, Gbagbo supporters' slogan \"we win or we win,\" and statements from both Gbagbo and Ouattara supporters refusing to accept a win by their rival. Observers believed Gbagbo only allowed voting because he believed he would win, due to factors such as opposition disunity, favorable electoral institutions, and potential acceptance of flaws by the international community. The current crisis in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire highlights flaws in the polling process, with Gbagbo contesting the election results due to alleged irregularities. Despite international support for Ouattara and the threat of political violence, the international community has not intervened to alter the outcome. The crisis in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire stemmed from serious irregularities in the election process, leading to Gbagbo being declared the winner by the Constitutional Council despite allegations of fraud and manipulation. Political tensions emerged in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire due to long-term cocoa price and production declines, growing national debt, austerity measures, and pressures on land. These factors contributed to a gradual economic decline and fostered social competition based on ethnic, regional, and religious identity. The resistance faced by immigrant workers and northern Ivoirians in the south led to the 2002 rebellion and years of political impasse. Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 succeeded Houphou\u00ebt as president after his death in 1993. In December 1993, Henri Konan B\u00e9di\u00e9 succeeded Houphou\u00ebt as president of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, despite Alassane Ouattara being seen as the designated successor. Ouattara contested B\u00e9di\u00e9's claim, resigned as prime minister, and formed the Republican Rally party in mid-1994. B\u00e9di\u00e9 consolidated power by replacing Ouattara allies with loyalists and assuming the PDCI chairmanship in 1994. He was seen as less effective than his predecessor, Houphou\u00ebt, and was accused of blaming immigrants for the country's problems, fueling anti-immigrant sentiments, and promoting a nationalist ideology called Ivoirit\u00e9. The 1995 presidential elections in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were held under a controversial electoral law passed by the ruling party, leading to mass protests for electoral transparency. Despite winning 95% of the vote, President B\u00e9di\u00e9 faced opposition criticism over the electoral process and outcome. The electoral law in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was protested by opposition parties for excluding Ouattara due to his foreign residency and alleged mixed descent. Gbagbo also withdrew from the race, citing state manipulation. Despite initial tensions, legislative elections in November were peaceful, with PDCI winning a majority of seats. In the 1995 legislative elections in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the PDCI won 149 out of 175 seats, with the FPI and RDR splitting the remaining seats. The voting patterns showed ethno-regional divisions, with the RDR gaining support in the north and the PDCI losing support. B\u00e9di\u00e9 shuffled the cabinet in January 1996, with General Robert Gu\u00e9\u00ef being demoted in May 1996 due to a planned coup attributed to elements under his former command. During the latter part of B\u00e9di\u00e9's tenure, there were accusations of human rights abuses, security force crackdowns on the opposition, student protests, economic pressures, and corruption allegations. In 1998, the National Assembly passed constitutional changes favoring the incumbent, increasing executive control of elections, extending the presidential term, and setting nationality laws for political candidacy. The military coup of December 1999 occurred when disgruntled soldiers mutinied over pay and living conditions, leading to the government promising to meet their demands. The mutineers demanded General Robert Gu\u00e9\u00ef be reinstated as Chief of Staff, forming a National Committee of Public Salvation and dissolving key government institutions. Gu\u00e9\u00ef pledged to uphold democracy, fight corruption, rewrite the Constitution, and hold fair elections. After negotiations, major political parties, including B\u00e9di\u00e9's PDCI, supported the \"transitional\" CNSP junta established in early 2000. A Consultative Commission on Constitutional and Electoral Matters drafted proposals for a new constitution and electoral code, presented in March 2000 for a later referendum. Gu\u00e9\u00ef, initially perceived as pro-Ouattara, aimed to bridge ethno-regional divisions during his junta leadership. Gu\u00e9\u00ef's administration initially aimed to bridge ethno-regional divisions and transition to civilian rule, but his leadership style became authoritarian and focused on personal ambition. He created a political party in 2000, leading some to label him a narcissist. In April 2000, Gu\u00e9\u00ef created a political party, the Rassemblement pour le Consensus National, to support his candidacy. The government's program to issue national identity cards and resident permits raised concerns about exclusion of certain groups from the political process and threats of deportation or denial of rights based on ethnicity. The rule of law suffered under Gu\u00e9\u00ef's authoritarian leadership. The rule of law suffered under Gu\u00e9\u00ef's authoritarian leadership, with military forces targeting organized gangs in Abidjan and engaging in acts of banditry. Soldiers mutinied over salary demands and non-payment of promised allotments, leading to looting, violence, and paralysis of public services in various cities. In Abidjan and secondary cities like Bouak\u00e9 and Korhogo, a mutiny was violently suppressed by the gendarmerie after a curfew was imposed. Only a fraction of the promised payment was made due to government insolvency, leading to extensive urban infrastructure damage. In July 2000, constitutional changes were approved by a large margin in a referendum, requiring both parents of presidential candidates to be Ivoirian-born citizens. An RDR party event was disrupted by security forces in the same month. In July, an RDR party event was disrupted by security forces. Harassment of Muslims and northerners by security officials reportedly increased. Gu\u00e9\u00ef's failed bid to become the PDCI presidential candidate led to plans to run as a \"people's candidate.\" RDR supporters clashed with opponents after security forces halted a demonstration. Elections scheduled for September were postponed until October. Public security deteriorated as the election approached, with increased harassment of immigrants by security forces. The High Council of Imams and National Islamic Council warned of social unrest due to unfair restrictions on electoral eligibility and condemned official harassment of northerners and Muslims. In September, an attack on Gu\u00e9\u00ef's residence was suppressed, suspected to be a staged event to purge the military of opponents. A state of emergency was declared, political meetings were banned, and northern soldiers were arrested, some reportedly executed or tortured. In October, the Supreme Court, led by Tia Kone, declared 14 out of 19 presidential candidates ineligible, including B\u00e9di\u00e9, Emile Bombet, and Ouattara. Only Gu\u00e9\u00ef, Gbagbo, and three minor candidates were allowed to run. Controversies arose over Gu\u00e9\u00ef's military law violation and Gbagbo's eligibility as a state employee. In October 2000, after electoral controversies, polling was held on October 22, leading to extensive violence due to deep-seated divisions. The FPI claimed the election was rigged by Gu\u00e9\u00ef, sparking protests and clashes between FPI and RDR supporters. Gbagbo's victory was ratified by the Supreme Court, leading to ethnic and religious tensions with attacks on Muslim neighborhoods. After Gbagbo's victory was ratified by the Supreme Court, ethnic and religious tensions escalated with attacks on Muslim neighborhoods. FPI supporters targeted these areas, leading to clashes and human rights abuses. The new government faced immediate challenges following the violence. The new government, led by Gbagbo, had immediate tasks to address after the post-election violence. These included conducting a credible investigation into the election-related deaths, holding a free and fair legislative election, and proving the FPI's legitimacy. Challenges arose, such as Ouattara's disqualification as a parliamentary candidate. Ouattara's disqualification as a parliamentary candidate led to RDR boycotting the polls and mounting protests, causing significant disruptions. International concerns were raised over the poll's validity, leading to a lack of election monitoring missions. Despite obstacles, voting went smoothly nationwide, with low turnout in the south and disruptions in the north. In January 2001, a by-election was held in the north of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire with a low turnout rate of 34%. Despite calls for a boycott by the RDR resulting in an 87% abstention rate, the poll proceeded peacefully with heavy security. In late 2001, a National Reconciliation Forum was organized to address barriers to national unity and governance. However, guarded optimism was undermined by a rebellion in September 2002. In September 2002, a military rebellion turned into an attempted coup against the government in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, leading to a national fissure between north and south. The rebels, mainly of northern ethnic origins, clashed with loyalist forces, resulting in the death of Gu\u00e9\u00ef and the formation of the Patriotic Movement of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (MPCI). The rebels took control of over half of the country after withdrawing to Bouak\u00e9. The Patriotic Movement of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (MPCI) formed a political organization and took control of local administration in rebel-held territory in northern C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Social services sharply declined under rebel administration, and periodic fighting occurred as the government tried to retake towns along the north-south dividing line. The MPCI also allied with rebel groups in western C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, leading to further conflict. In 2002, rebels seized towns in the west, leading to armed clashes, communal violence, and criminal armed violence. International peacekeepers clashed with rebels initially. Conflict mediation efforts, including the Linas-Marcoussis Accord in early 2003, helped reduce military conflict, with sporadic exceptions like localized armed conflict in the west and ceasefire line provocations. Gbagbo remained in power under the accord, which also established an interim government. The Linas-Marcoussis Accord in 2003 allowed Gbagbo to stay in power and created an interim government of national reconciliation. The accord aimed to prepare for presidential elections, reform the armed forces, disarm all armed groups, expel foreign mercenaries, and establish an international monitoring group. It also outlined a roadmap for resolving key issues, including electoral and citizenship rules, human rights abuses, and economic recovery planning. The accord faced opposition and violence from supporters of Gbagbo's party and elements of the military. The Linas-Marcoussis Accord in 2003 aimed to prepare for presidential elections, reform the armed forces, disarm armed groups, expel foreign mercenaries, and establish an international monitoring group. Gbagbo reluctantly signed it under foreign pressure, hindering its implementation. Subsequent peace agreements built upon its provisions, focusing on political and legal reforms, military disarmament, and demobilization efforts. Key issues included the sequence of disarmament, voter registration, citizen identification, and elections. Efforts to implement key provisions of the Linas-Marcoussis Accord and other agreements were overseen by consensus prime ministers Seydou Diarra and Charles Konan Banny. Progress was made in voter registration, citizen identification, and elections, but political backtracking and obstructionism were common. Political gridlock, obstructionism, and accusations of undermining peace were common during mediation efforts in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Armed conflict briefly erupted in November 2004, leading to mass protests and breakdowns in law and order. The division of the country led to breakdowns in law and order, impunity for security officials, rise in corruption, and diversion of official revenues by local officials. Funding sources included taxes, fees, extortion-based payments, and illicit trade in goods. International community supported peace agreements through U.N. Security Council resolutions. The Security Council endorsed the LMA in 2003, authorizing peacekeeping force deployments by France and ECOWAS. MINUCI was created in May 2003, followed by UNOCI in early 2004. The Ouagadougou Agreement was signed in March 2007 after talks between President Gbagbo and opposition parties. The Ouagadougou Agreement in 2007 mediated by Burkina Faso's president between President Gbagbo and FN leader Guillaume Soro superseded earlier agreements, leading to Soro becoming foreign minister. The Ouagadougou Agreement in 2007 mediated by Burkina Faso's president led to FN leader Guillaume Soro becoming foreign minister. The accord included provisions for citizen identification, voter registration, elections, disarmament, and merging of military structures. It also established a transitional government, youth civic service, political party code of conduct, and an accord monitoring organ. Despite fulfilling some provisions like the 2010 presidential election, many key elements remain unimplemented. International reaction to the accord was generally positive. The Ouagadougou Agreement in 2007 led to FN leader Guillaume Soro becoming foreign minister and included provisions for elections, disarmament, and merging of military structures. Despite fulfilling some provisions, many key elements remain unimplemented. International reaction to the accord was generally positive but cautionary due to concerns about presidential authority and reduced international involvement in the peace process."
