    "content": "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to raise revenue and borrow money, with funds drawn from the Treasury based on appropriations made by law. The executive budget process, established by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, consolidated federal budget proposals developed by the President and submitted to Congress. The President's budget proposal is developed and submitted to Congress annually, outlining budgetary procedures and priorities. It is a unified plan for allocating federal resources, but Congress is not obligated to adopt the recommendations. The President's budget proposal is a crucial policy tool that initiates the congressional budget process and provides spending recommendations for agency programs. It includes revenue and spending projections based on existing law and must be submitted to Congress by the first Monday in February before the fiscal year begins. The President delegates budget tasks to OMB, which coordinates with agencies to develop the budget proposal. OMB issues guidance for agencies to prepare their budget requests in line with Circular A-11. Circular A-11 provides agencies with budgetary laws, policies, and guidance for preparing and submitting budget estimates to OMB. OMB issues Spring Guidance with detailed instructions and deadlines for agencies to submit their budget requests. The guidance may include instructions on achieving the President's budget priorities. The guidance from OMB instructs agencies to request a budget for 2013 that is at least 5% below their 2011 enacted discretionary appropriation, with additional reductions to reach a level at least 10% below. Agencies have their own procedures for developing budget requests, which are submitted to OMB in early fall for review before the President submits the budget to Congress. OMB is responsible for reviewing agency budget requests to ensure alignment with the President's policy objectives. Requests are first reviewed by program examiners and may also be reviewed by senior OMB officials. Examiners may request additional information before making recommendations, which are then reviewed and approved by the OMB Director and the President. Agencies are informed of budget decisions through a process called \"passback,\" where approved budget levels are communicated, which may differ from agencies' requests. The passback process involves agencies receiving budget decisions from OMB, which may include policy changes or personnel ceilings. Agencies can appeal to the OMB Director or the President directly. The President's budget submission to Congress includes various documents and interactions between Congress, the President, OMB, and agencies. The President is required to provide specific information in the budget proposal. The President's budget proposal includes estimated receipts, expenditures, appropriations for the next five years, actual financial data from the previous year, public debt information, and specific statements for appropriations accounts and trust funds. Past budget submissions have contained volumes like the Budget of the U.S. Government with policy priorities, summary tables, and detailed descriptions of government activities, as well as Historical Tables providing historical financial data. The President's budget proposal includes detailed information on budget authority, government receipts, outlays, government employment, GDP, and federal debt dating back to 1789. It consists of three main sections: Budget of the U.S. Government, Analytical Perspectives, and Appendix, providing analysis of government programs, budget baselines, and financial information on individual programs. Additional supplemental materials may also be included. The President updates the budget with supplemental requests and revisions to Congress, including the Mid-Session Review (MSR) before July 16 each year. The MSR reflects changes in economic conditions or budgetary actions, and OMB and agency officials explain and justify the request to Congress. During the congressional budget process, OMB Director and Cabinet officials testify before congressional committees to explain the President's budget objectives. Agencies also submit written justifications for their budget requests to appropriations committees. Agency officials are called before appropriations subcommittees to further justify their budget requests to Congress. During the budget process, OMB may review agency materials before Congress receives them. These materials help facilitate dialogue between agencies and congressional committees, providing program details for appropriations decisions. Informal interactions between agencies and Congress may also occur to develop ongoing relationships. During the budget process, OMB may review agency materials to facilitate dialogue with Congress. The President can communicate policy positions through formal Statements of Administration Policy (SAPs) or negotiate informally with Congress. Additionally, the President may influence Congress indirectly by appealing to the public or vetoing budgetary legislation. Presidents have vetoed appropriations acts at least 33 times between 1973 and 2012. Between 1973 and 2012, Presidents have vetoed appropriations acts at least 33 times. Once budgetary legislation becomes law, federal agencies are responsible for executing the budget by collecting, obligating, and expending resources in accordance with enacted laws. Agencies receive budget authority from appropriations and other legislation, allowing them to enter into obligations. The Antideficiency Act requires appropriated funds to be apportioned by time period. The Antideficiency Act mandates that appropriated funds be apportioned to prevent premature exhaustion. Funds for a definite period should be apportioned to avoid deficiencies, while those for an indefinite period should be used effectively. OMB apportions funds to executive agencies, with requests due before the fiscal year or within 15 days of enactment. OMB apportions funds to executive agencies, determining how funds will be apportioned by fiscal quarter or project. Executive agencies then allocate funds among programs, projects, and activities within the scope of each apportionment, while also legally obligated to execute spending legislation as enacted. Informal arrangements may be made with appropriations committees to ensure consistent fund allocation. Under the Antideficiency Act, executive agencies must ensure obligations and expenditures stay within allowable limits. Agency heads report violations to the President, Congress, and the Comptroller General. Agencies can request additional funding if needed, and OMB reviews requests for supplemental appropriations. Agencies may also reallocate funds through transfers or reprogramming during budget execution. Budget execution involves transfers or reprogramming of budgetary resources. Transfers shift resources between appropriations accounts, while reprogramming shifts resources within an account. There are two types of transfers: \"expenditure\" and \"non-expenditure.\" Expenditure transfers involve purchasing goods or services, while non-expenditure transfers increase resources for a specific program. Both types require statutory authorization as per 31 U.S.C. Section 1532. Transfers of budgetary resources between appropriations accounts require statutory authorization, with limitations on the amount and purpose of the transfer. Reprogramming involves using funds for a different project or purpose than originally intended, with requirements for notifying Congress. Reprogramming involves using funds for a different project or purpose than originally intended, with Congress having the authority to limit an agency's ability to reprogram funds through appropriations bills. Agencies may need to adjust their apportionments, with executive agencies generally requiring prior approval from OMB for reapportionments. Executive agencies can adjust apportioned amounts by up to $400,000 or 2% of their total budgetary resources without prior approval. Agencies must follow specific procedures for reprogramming funds, including obtaining approval from OMB. Executive agencies must also seek approval from the Office of National Drug Control Policy before reprogramming drug-related budget resources. Congress oversees budget execution by requiring notification before certain expenditures, such as in the Foreign Assistance Act and International Development and Food Assistance Act. Notification requirements are also found in appropriations and authorization acts. The congressional notification requirement in appropriations and authorization acts mandates agencies to notify Congress before obligating specified funds, with committees able to issue holds on fund expenditure. Impoundment allows for the reduction of budgetary authority post-appropriation. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 gives the President limited authority to reduce or withhold agency funding through rescissions (permanently canceling budget authority) or deferrals (temporarily delaying spending). The President can initiate rescissions by submitting a special message to Congress if the budget authority is no longer needed for its intended purpose. If a President's rescission request is approved by Congress and enacted into law, the funds are no longer available for obligation and expenditure. However, if after 45 days Congress has not approved the rescission request, the funds must be reapportioned and made available for obligation and expenditure. Deferrals are temporary delays in the obligation or expenditure of appropriated funds, typically lasting no longer than 45 days, to adjust to changing circumstances. Funds may only be deferred for contingencies, savings from operational changes, or as specified by law. Under the Antideficiency Act, agencies are generally prohibited from obligating or spending funds prior to the enactment of their appropriations. A funding gap occurs when full-year or interim appropriations are not enacted by the start of the fiscal year. Funds may be deferred without prior approval of Congress, but the President must inform Congress and the Comptroller General of all deferrals. Additional executive budgetary procedures are triggered under specific circumstances as provided by law. During a funding gap, agencies can only use budget resources for excepted activities like protecting human life or property. OMB may instruct agencies to prepare for shutdowns if appropriations are uncertain. Circular A-11 guides agencies on developing shutdown plans and identifying excepted activities during funding gaps or expired CRs. During a funding gap, agencies must develop shutdown plans to identify \"excepted\" and \"non-excepted\" activities. OMB may issue additional guidance if a funding gap is imminent. Sequestration involves canceling budgetary resources under a presidential sequester order, triggering a sequestration of nonexempt direct spending under certain legislation. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, sequestration of nonexempt discretionary and direct spending is triggered if deficit reduction legislation is not enacted. OMB is responsible for calculating and implementing the automatic spending reductions. Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, OMB is responsible for preparing and issuing sequestration orders based on a specified formula. Circular A-11 outlines requirements for managing sequestrations to avoid Antideficiency Act violations, but does not address sequestrations under the BCA."
