The trustee must be a bank or demonstrate compliance with trust requirements, and trust funds cannot be invested in life insurance contracts. The trust assets must not be commingled except in a common trust fund or common investment fund. Qualified start-up expenditures are defined as per section 195 and include the taxpayer's share of expenses of an entity they hold interest in. However, this term does not apply if the business has more than 50 full-time employees in a taxable year. Tax Treatment of Distributions: Any distribution is taxable under section 72. No income tax is due if qualified start-up expenses equal or exceed distributions. Excess distributions reduce taxable income.
