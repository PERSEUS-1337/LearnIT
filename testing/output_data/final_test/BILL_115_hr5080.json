    "content": "The Act is known as the Comprehensive Opioid Management and Bundled Addiction Treatment Act of 2018 or the COMBAT Act of 2018. It focuses on Medicare coverage for services provided by opioid treatment programs. The COMBAT Act of 2018 amends the Social Security Act to include coverage for opioid treatment program services, defining them as items and services furnished as part of opioid treatment programs. The COMBAT Act of 2018 amends the Social Security Act to include coverage for opioid treatment program services, which are items and services provided as part of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder at an opioid treatment program enrolled under section 1866(j). This includes initial intake and assessment, integrated psychosocial and medical treatment, additional services like urinalysis and medication monitoring, and the provision of specific products. The COMBAT Act of 2018 amends the Social Security Act to include coverage for opioid treatment program services, which are items and services provided as part of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. This includes specific products like Methadone, Buprenorphine, and Naltrexone approved by the FDA for maintenance or detoxification treatment. An opioid treatment program is defined as a program meeting certain federal regulations. The COMBAT Act of 2018 amends the Social Security Act to include coverage for opioid treatment program services. These programs must have certification from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and be accredited by an approved body. Medication-assisted treatment involves using medications alongside counseling and therapies for substance use disorders. The COMBAT Act of 2018 amends the Social Security Act to include coverage for opioid treatment program services. Payment for these services will be equal to the amount payable in accordance with section 1834(v) of the Act. The Secretary shall pay an amount equal to 120 percent of the bundled payment amount under a specific paragraph for opioid treatment programs. The COMBAT Act of 2018 amends the Social Security Act to include coverage for opioid treatment program services. Payment for these services will be a bundled payment amount for services furnished during the episode of care, starting no later than January 1, 2019, to an individual by a physician or practitioner at the program. This bundled payment will replace any other payment under this part for the services provided. The bundled payment amount for opioid treatment program services including methadone is based on HCPCS code H0020 for a week-long episode of care. For services including buprenorphine, the bundled payment amount is the sum of the payment amount for HCPCS code H0047 and additional services provided. The bundled payment amount for buprenorphine administered as part of opioid treatment program services is determined at 95% of the average wholesale price for HCPCS codes J0571, J0572, or J0573. This payment is for a week-long episode of care and includes buprenorphine administered during that time. The bundled payment amount for medication-assisted treatment services in opioid treatment programs includes the National Drug Code for Buprenorphine, dosage, and acquisition costs. For services involving naltrexone, the bundled payment amount is determined based on specific criteria. The bundled payment amount for medication-assisted treatment services includes payment amounts for specific HCPCS and CPT codes related to naltrexone administration. The bundled amount is for an episode of care. The bundled payment amount for medication-assisted treatment services covers specific HCPCS and CPT codes for naltrexone administration during a month-long episode of care. Any reference to HCPCS or CPT codes includes successor codes determined by the Secretary. The payment amount for opioid treatment services during an episode of care must not be less than the payment rate for similar services under State plans. Opioid treatment programs are included as Medicare providers under the Social Security Act. This amendment ensures payment rates for these programs are comparable to those under the TRICARE program."
