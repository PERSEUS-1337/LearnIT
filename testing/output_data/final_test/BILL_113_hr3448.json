The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include a Liquidity Pilot Program for emerging growth companies, allowing for quoting increments of $0.05 or $0.10 based on company election. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include a Liquidity Pilot Program for emerging growth companies, allowing for quoting increments of $0.05 or $0.10 based on company election. A covered emerging growth company may elect to change the minimum trading increment at any time after 90 days from the enactment of the Small Cap Liquidity Reform Act of 2014. A covered emerging growth company may elect to change the minimum trading increment from $0.05 to $0.10 or vice versa, with the election taking effect 30 days after it is made. The company can only make one such election under this provision. An election can be made to change the minimum trading increment from $0.05 to $0.10 or vice versa for a covered emerging growth company. The election must be communicated to the Commission, which will then notify all relevant exchanges and trading venues. If the issuer no longer qualifies as a covered emerging growth company, the minimum trading increment election becomes void. If a covered emerging growth company no longer qualifies, its securities will be quoted at regular increments. The SEC may specify exceptions for companies to remain covered. For securities trading below $1, the initial price increment can be changed from $0.05 to $0.10. If the price of securities of a covered emerging growth company falls below $1, they will be quoted without regard to minimum increments. If the company goes public after this, the initial share price can be adjusted. If a covered emerging growth company's securities fall below $1, they will be quoted without regard to minimum increments. If the average trading price remains below $1 for 90 days, the securities will be quoted using the regular increment. The securities of a covered emerging growth company will be quoted without regard to minimum increments if they violate securities laws. The securities may not be quoted at a minimum increment of $0.05 or $0.10 after the issuer makes an election under certain conditions. The SEC may require a covered emerging growth company with securities quoted at $0.05 or $0.10 increments to provide additional reports and disclosures. The SEC may limit liability for issuers quoting securities at specific increments and require reports from emerging growth companies. The SEC, in coordination with exchanges, must report to Congress every 6 months on the quoting and trading of securities by covered emerging growth companies. The report should assess how these activities are increasing liquidity and active trading, and include any legislative recommendations.

The term 'covered emerging growth company' is defined with specific adjustments to the criteria for an emerging growth company. The SEC must report to Congress every 6 months on quoting and trading of securities by covered emerging growth companies, assessing liquidity and trading activity. Adjustments may be made to ensure statistically meaningful results, including expanding participant eligibility and changing program duration. Additionally, studies may be conducted to evaluate quoting or trading in various minimum increments. Section 11A(c)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 will be repealed 5 years after the enactment of this Act. The House of Representatives passed the bill on February 11, 2014. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
