The Act titled \"Low Volume Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Act of 2014\" exempts low volume manufacturers from vehicle safety standards. Section 30114 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to provide exemptions for low volume manufacturers producing replica and non-replica motor vehicles. The Act exempts low volume manufacturers from vehicle safety standards, allowing them to assign vehicle identification numbers and register with the Secretary to qualify for exemptions. The Secretary is limited to providing exemptions for up to 1,000 non-replica motor vehicles per year and must report these exemptions annually. Low volume manufacturers are considered motor vehicle manufacturers under subtitle VI of this title, with exceptions outlined in the subsection. The Secretary can require low volume manufacturers to affix permanent labels on exempted motor vehicles, identifying specified standards or designating model years for replica vehicles. Written notice of the exemption may need to be delivered to the dealer. Low volume manufacturers are exempt from certain reporting requirements and must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing exempted motor vehicles. If a motor vehicle has safety defects or nonconformities, the manufacturer must comply with notification, recall, and remedy requirements. A low volume manufacturer of motor vehicles, defined as producing no more than 5,000 vehicles annually, must comply with notification, recall, and remedy requirements for non-replica and replica motor vehicles. A low volume manufacturer of motor vehicles must comply with requirements for non-replica and replica motor vehicles, including manufacturing replicas intended to resemble vehicles manufactured at least 25 years prior and subject to trademark or design patent licenses from the original manufacturer. The term 'specified standard' refers to motor vehicle standards described in specific sections of the law, excluding standards for motor vehicle equipment. Vehicle compliance standards for low volume motor vehicle manufacturers are outlined in Section 3. The Clean Air Act is amended to allow motor vehicle engines with emission controls to be installed in exempted specially produced vehicles, with written instructions for installation and maintenance. The Clean Air Act allows engines with emission controls to be installed in exempted specially produced vehicles with specific installation instructions, including emission control warranty information and certification numbers. The Clean Air Act allows engines with emission controls to be installed in exempted specially produced vehicles, with specific installation instructions provided by the manufacturer. Engine installations and alterations not in accordance with the instructions are considered prohibited acts and subject to penalties. The producer of the vehicle must provide the purchaser with all information received from the engine manufacturer, including emissions data. To qualify to install an engine in exempted specially produced motor vehicles, the producer must register with the Administrator and submit an annual report detailing the vehicles and engines installed. The report should include the certificate of conformity number or Executive order number for the engine. To qualify for installing engines in exempted specially produced motor vehicles, producers must register with the Administrator and submit an annual report with engine certification details. Exempted vehicles are not subject to certification testing or emission control programs. Producing compliant vehicles exempts producers from being considered manufacturers under the Act. An 'exempted specially produced motor vehicle' is a replica or non-replica vehicle that is exempt from certain standards as defined in the United States Code. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must issue regulations within 12 months to implement sections 2 and 3 of the Act."
