    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002 from components of 22 government agencies. It has undergone restructurings to improve effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out homeland security functions. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established in 2002 from components of 22 government agencies, including the Departments of Justice, State, Defense, and Transportation. Some functions of DHS are not directly related to homeland security, such as the Coast Guard's environmental missions. Crime, justice, military involvement in law enforcement, money transfers, human trafficking, and foreign policy all have implications for homeland security policy. The report focuses on topics within the four mission study areas of the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review: Counterterrorism and Security Management, Border Security and Trade, Immigration, and Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. It also includes a section on management issues at DHS. Each topic is introduced with the lead expert and their contact information provided. The issues covered are not exhaustive but represent a broad array likely to be addressed by Congress. Twelve years after the 9/11 attacks, policymakers continue to debate the definition of homeland security. The strategic process post-9/11 led to the development of homeland security policy, resulting in over 30 federal entities with homeland security responsibilities. Homeland security funding is not based on clearly defined strategic priorities, hindering its effectiveness. There is a need for consensus on defining homeland security, prioritizing missions, goals, and activities. The debate over these definitions and priorities persists as the federal government issues and implements homeland security strategies. The 2003 National Strategy for Homeland Security focused on terrorism, revised in 2007. The 2008 Strategic Plan expanded to include all-hazards and border security. These documents addressed incidents like the 9/11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. They have been replaced by newer principal homeland security strategies. The White House and DHS are the main sources of homeland security strategies. The current primary national homeland security strategic document is the 2010 National Security Strategy, which addresses all hazards and is not solely focused on terrorism. DHS's strategic documents include the 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, the 2010 Bottom-Up Review, and the 2012 Strategic Plan. These documents are nested within the 2010 National Security Strategy, guiding all federal government homeland security activities. The development of national homeland security strategy will continue with the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. The Obama Administration and DHS are working on developing and implementing strategies for homeland security, including the 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review and a potential new National Security Strategy. Coordination is key in homeland security due to various stakeholders and risks. Observers emphasize the importance of coordinating resources, actions, and strategic processes to address risks effectively. Without a consensus on the definition of homeland security, disjointed approaches to national security may persist. The varied homeland security definitions and concepts in national strategy documents may result from adjusting federal policy to emerging threats. The U.S. government spent $564 billion on homeland security in the 10 years after 9/11, with spending peaking at $73.8 billion in FY2009. The budget request for FY2014 was $72.7 billion, a slight decrease from previous years. The Department of Homeland Security's budget grew from $31.2 billion in FY2003 to $59.9 billion in FY2012. Roughly 58.6% of this budget is considered \"homeland security\" spending. Some argue that the current definition of homeland security is too focused on counterterrorism activities. The Department of Homeland Security's budget in 2010 was funded through a long-term continuing resolution, which gave the department less explicit direction from Congress compared to previous years. This change left decisions on fund allocation in the hands of DHS, unlike before when Congress had more control over funding decisions. In contrast to previous years, the Department of Homeland Security's budget for FY2012 and FY2013 was funded through consolidated appropriations legislation, which lacked specific congressional direction. Sequestration from the Budget Control and Deficit Reduction Act of 2011 further impacted the actual budgetary resources available. The final funding levels for FY2013 were difficult to determine due to various factors, including legislative exemptions from sequestration, implementation before final appropriations legislation, and agencies using budgetary flexibility to protect certain activities. An expenditure plan was submitted to Congress in April 2013 outlining post-sequester funding levels for DHS in the consolidated appropriations act for FY2013. The FY2013 budget did not include resources for disaster relief before budgetary flexibility was exercised. Final funding levels for FY2013 post-sequester have not been officially released. FY2014 DHS appropriations are still unresolved, with the Administration requesting $44.7 billion. House and Senate DHS appropriations bills show similar funding levels. The FY2014 DHS appropriations are still pending, with the Administration requesting $44.7 billion. The Senate has not taken up its version of the bill yet, and differences in policy direction and funding levels need to be resolved. The debate for FY2014 includes whether to continue with automatic cuts mandated in the BCA, totaling $91.6 billion. The FY2014 DHS appropriations are pending, with the Administration requesting $44.7 billion. The discretionary spending cap has been reduced by $91.6 billion, impacting defense and non-defense budgets. Homeland security programs may face challenges due to limited funds, affecting capital investments and staffing needs. The changed budget environment's potential impact is discussed in the report by John Rollins, Specialist in Terrorism and National Security. Terrorism remains a transnational threat with risks to U.S. global interests. U.S. focuses on combating Al Qaeda and its affiliates. Daniel Benjamin, Coordinator of the Office of Counterterrorism, emphasizes the need to address threats from Al Qaeda. President Obama's counterterrorism strategy focuses on Al Qaeda and its affiliates. Understanding Al Qaeda's evolution into a global entity is crucial for strategic policy. Recent terrorist attacks have been carried out by individuals or small cells claiming affiliation with Al Qaeda. Some believe U.S. counterterrorism successes are reducing terrorist threats. Counterterrorism successes have reduced terrorist threats from core Al Qaeda. The killing of Osama bin Laden and ongoing global military actions have weakened Al Qaeda's ability to launch major attacks. Some experts believe Al Qaeda has evolved into a philosophical movement, making it harder to combat. Despite this, Al Qaeda and its affiliates are expected to remain a threat, especially considering the nation's budget constraints. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross argues that while the U.S. won't be defeated by Al Qaeda, increasing national debt may lead to spending cuts that could impact counterterrorism efforts. In August 2013, concerns were raised about Al Qaeda's growing presence in multiple countries, including Somalia, Yemen, Pakistan, Mali, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Egypt, and Syria. Senior Administration officials are mindful of balancing effective counterterrorism policies with the current budget environment. John Brennan, now the Director of the CIA, has highlighted Osama bin Laden's goal of financially draining the U.S. through prolonged wars. The terrorist threat to U.S. global interests remains a key issue for the Administration and Congress. Numerous individuals have been arrested for planning attacks directed at U.S. national security interests. The attacks, both successful and unsuccessful, have ranged from lone shooters to terrorist organizations planning large-scale destruction. The 113th Congress has focused on understanding terrorism in different regions through hearings. The 113th Congress has been reviewing various programs and policies related to counterterrorism efforts, including public diplomacy, sanctions, terrorism financing, and the connection between international crime, narcotics, and terrorism. They may continue to assess the Obama Administration's strategies and programs to determine if additional guidance or legislation is needed, considering the balance between U.S. global security interests and long-term fiscal challenges. Since May 2009, there have been 50 arrests in homegrown jihadist terrorist plots in the United States, with three resulting in attacks and 17 deaths. This marks an increase in terrorist activity compared to the period following the 9/11 attacks. Since May 2009, there have been 50 arrests in homegrown jihadist terrorist plots in the United States, with three resulting in attacks and 17 deaths. The spike in activity after May 2009 suggests some Americans are susceptible to violent jihad ideologies. Plots since 9/11 involve various endgames, including becoming foreign fighters, planning attacks with explosives or firearms, and using unique tactics. The homegrown jihadist threat in the United States has seen multiple tactics used in plots since 9/11. Some individuals showed interest in martyrdom, while lone wolves were responsible for successful attacks. Participants had varying capabilities, with some showing terrorist tradecraft skills. The Obama Administration has recognized this threat in recent strategy documents. The Obama Administration's strategy for combating violent extremism focuses on countering radicalization, including that of violent jihadists. It emphasizes protecting civil rights, federal-local cooperation, and addressing various radical ideologies. Law enforcement is expected to prevent terrorist plots post-9/11. The public expects law enforcement to prevent terrorist plots before they happen, leading to a focus on preventive policing. The FBI faces the challenge of identifying when individuals transition from radical beliefs to violence. Revised guidelines allow the FBI to assess individuals without prior evidence, raising concerns about privacy impacts. The FBI's tactics in counterterrorism investigations have sparked controversy, with concerns about privacy impacts. Innovative approaches include using civil law violations to arrest suspects (the \"Al Capone\" approach) and employing \"agents provocateurs\" to incite individuals to commit arrestable acts. These tactics have been effective in preventing violent jihadist plots. Cyber threats are a growing concern for the United States, with technology being relied upon in various aspects of modern life. Disruption to one piece of equipment can have a negative cascading effect on other devices, making cybersecurity crucial. John Rollins, a Specialist in Terrorism and National Security, highlights the importance of cybersecurity in counterterrorism investigations to prevent terrorist acts before they occur. Cyber-based attacks pose significant threats to national security, the economy, and individual livelihoods. Congress is concerned about identifying aggressors in cyberspace, understanding the impacts of cyberattacks, and determining legislative and policy responses. While most users of cyber technologies have lawful intentions, criminals, terrorists, and spies also exploit these technologies for malicious purposes such as data theft and denial of service attacks. Entities using cyber-based technologies for illegal purposes pose threats to U.S. global security and economic interests. Cyber-aggressors can take various forms and engage in actions such as denial of service attacks and data theft. Cyberterrorists, cyberthieves, cyberspies, and cyberwarriors are examples of these aggressors, utilizing different technological capabilities to achieve their objectives. Terrorist organizations, insurgents, and jihadists utilize the Internet for planning attacks, propaganda distribution, and communication. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure control systems to cyberattacks was demonstrated in the 2009 Aurora Project conducted by the Department of Homeland Security. Cyberspies steal classified information for strategic advantage. Cyberspies steal valuable information for competitive advantage, often working for foreign governments. Incidents like the FBI report in 2011 and the Department of Defense breach in 2008 highlight the significant impact of cyber espionage. The intelligence community is preparing a classified report on cyberspying against U.S. targets. The cybersecurity experts expect a report addressing Chinese government's encouragement of intellectual property theft through cyberattacks. Then-DOD Secretary Leon Panetta noted Russia and China's advanced cyber capabilities. Cyberthieves engage in illegal cyber-attacks for monetary gain, such as stealing credit card numbers. The annual cost of cybercrime to individuals in 24 countries is estimated at $388 billion, but there is a lack of comprehensive assessment due to the complex nature of costs and victims' reluctance to admit attacks. There is no comprehensive assessment of the overall costs of cyberattacks. Cyberwarriors are agents of nation-states who conduct cyberattacks to support strategic objectives. In August 2012, Saudi Aramco was targeted in a series of cyberattacks. In August 2012, Saudi Aramco, the world's most valuable company, was targeted in cyberattacks that compromised 30,000 computers. The attacks were aimed at disrupting oil production, with suspicions of Iranian support. Various cyberwarrior groups, including cyberactivists, have claimed credit for the incident, engaging in attacks for nonmonetary or political reasons. Their activities range from nuisance denial of service attacks to disrupting government and private corporation processes. The United States faces challenges in cybersecurity due to threats from aggressors and vulnerabilities in emerging technologies. Despite over 50 federal statutes addressing cybersecurity, there is no overarching framework legislation in place since 2002. Recent legislative proposals have focused on national strategy and various cybersecurity issues. The 112th Congress focused on cybersecurity issues including national strategy, reform of FISMA, protection of critical infrastructure, information sharing, cybercrime, privacy in electronic commerce, international efforts, research and development, and the cybersecurity workforce. Several bills were proposed but none became law. Enactment of cybersecurity legislation is expected in the 113th Congress. In the 113th Congress, the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) established by the George W. Bush Administration aimed to consolidate access points, deploy intrusion detection systems, improve research coordination, and clarify federal roles in protecting critical infrastructure. The Obama Administration also created the position of White House Cybersecurity Coordinator in December 2009. The White House Cybersecurity Coordinator oversees government-wide coordination of cybersecurity issues, including implementing the CNCI. They work with the National Security and Economic Councils but do not control agency budgets. President Obama signed a directive in 2012 to allow the military to act more aggressively against cyberattacks. The federal role in cybersecurity includes securing federal systems, protecting nonfederal systems, and military, intelligence, and law enforcement efforts. The White House issued an executive order in 2013 directing federal agencies to enhance cybersecurity for the nation, with various agencies having complementary but sometimes overlapping roles and responsibilities in cybersecurity. The anthrax attacks of 2001 highlighted the nation's vulnerability to biological terrorism, leading to increased federal efforts to protect against CBRN terrorism. The government has created programs to develop and distribute medical countermeasures, but challenges remain in distributing them quickly following an attack. The 113th Congress will review the effectiveness of these efforts and consider whether to continue, modify, or end the programs. Congress passed the Project BioShield Act in 2004 to incentivize the private sector in developing countermeasures. In 2004, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act (P.L. 108-276) to incentivize the private sector to develop CBRN medical countermeasures by creating a guaranteed federal market. Congress allocated $5.6 billion for Project BioShield acquisitions for FY2004-FY2013, with $2.8 billion obligated by August 2013. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 authorized $2.8 billion in advance funding for Project BioShield through FY2018. The 113th Congress may consider adjusting funding amounts or providing annual appropriations to enhance program efficiency. In response to the current fiscal environment, Congress is expected to increase scrutiny of federal efforts for CBRN medical countermeasures. PAHPRA mandates detailed annual countermeasure strategy and implementation plans, along with a coordinated multi-year budget. Nontraditional programs like creating a nonprofit strategic investment corporation may be considered to improve efficiency. Distribution of medical countermeasures during emergencies remains a challenge for the federal government and its partners. The federal government maintains programs like the Strategic National Stockpile to stockpile and distribute medical countermeasures. Experts question the sufficiency of these programs and whether state governments are prepared to receive and disseminate federal stockpiles. Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and consider additional stockpiling and distribution methods, such as using the U.S. Postal Service. Concerns may arise regarding program costs, unintended use of countermeasures, and local implementation. The BioWatch program, launched in 2003, is also mentioned. The BioWatch program, launched in 2003, deploys sensors in large U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens. The DHS Office of Health Affairs manages system operations and costs, while the CDC handles laboratory testing. Local jurisdictions are responsible for public health responses to bioterrorism incidents. The BioWatch program, launched in 2003, deploys sensors in large U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens. BioWatch has not detected a bioterrorism incident since its inception, but has detected pathogens of interest. In 2012, the system was criticized for false alarms and lack of sensitivity. However, some officials defended the program for fostering collaboration among federal, state, and local officials for a prompt response to a potential incident. The BioWatch program, launched in 2003, deploys sensors in large U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism pathogens. BioWatch has not detected a bioterrorism incident since its inception, but has detected pathogens of interest. In 2012, the system was criticized for false alarms and lack of sensitivity. However, some officials defended the program for fostering collaboration among federal, state, and local officials for a prompt response to a potential incident. Federal officials have sought to reduce the delay in daily BioWatch filter collection by developing autonomous sensors that analyze filter deposits and transmit results in near-real time. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the technical and management challenges of the Gen-3 sensors, with an estimated life cycle cost of $5.8 billion. GAO recommended that DHS reevaluate the mission need and alternatives before continuing the acquisition. In June 2013, DHS paused Gen-3 deployment to analyze alternatives following GAO's recommendation. Congressional committees have scrutinized the BioWatch program's performance since its inception, with some seeking funding limits and program reviews. In the 112th Congress, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce initiated an investigation into the program, which continued in the 113th Congress. Committee leadership requested a new GAO study on the technical capabilities of the Gen-3 system in August 2013. Continuity of government operations involves ensuring governing entities can recover from operational interruptions through preparedness activities like agency response plans, employee training, and resuming normal operations. These efforts aim to maintain civil authority, provide support for affected individuals, repair infrastructure, and oversee recovery from incidents like natural disasters, accidents, technological emergencies, and terrorist attacks. The executive branch continuity programs, outlined in NSPD 51 and E.O. 12656, aim to ensure the preservation of government functions and national essential functions under all conditions, including acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies, and military or terrorist attacks. E.O. 12656 mandates federal departments to ensure continuity of essential functions in national security emergencies through succession planning, resource safekeeping, and emergency operating capabilities. Congress should assess if current authorities align with government goals, consider costs, potential conflicts, and ensure the executive branch can fulfill its responsibilities. The federal government's real property, comprising over 900,000 assets, includes multi-tenant federal buildings housing federal courthouses and congressional offices. Security measures such as closed-circuit cameras, barriers, and security personnel are crucial for the safety of federal employees and the public. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for ensuring the security of federal facilities. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is the lead agency for protecting federally owned and leased buildings and personnel. They conduct security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats, including risk assessments, countermeasures like barriers and cameras, law enforcement response, and safety education programs. FPS also supports other federal agencies at special security events. They have around 1,225 law enforcement officers and administrative personnel, as well as 15,000 contract security guards. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) administers services for approximately 15,000 contract security guards, funded by fees from federal agencies. FPS has faced criticism for security practices, including the use of private guards and coordination issues. FPS plans to improve threat identification, monitoring, guard training, and acquisition strategies. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) plans to improve security practices through acquisition strategies, risk-based security standards, stakeholder interface, and a capital plan. Congress will oversee FPS management to ensure staffing and funding for its mission. Food safety efforts now include a focus on food defense against intentional contamination for terrorism or fraud purposes. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, regulators have focused on food defense to protect the food supply from deliberate contamination. Large-scale foodborne outbreaks can harm sales and public perception. USDA and FDA are primarily responsible for federal food safety, with state and local authorities assisting in inspection and outbreak response. The FDA is responsible for regulating 80% of the food consumed in the US, overseeing a $240 billion domestic food market and a $15 billion imported food market. State and local authorities regulate restaurants, grocery stores, and other food outlets with guidance from the FDA. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) aims to prevent intentional and unintentional food contamination through various strategies. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) aims to prevent food contamination through various strategies and enhanced regulatory authorities. However, some provisions of the law have not been implemented yet. The Act also requires the development of a National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy, implementation plan, and research agenda, which have not been published. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified food safety as a high-risk issue due to federal oversight fragmentation and delays in implementing Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9) for food and agriculture defense. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found no centralized coordination of HSPD-9 implementation efforts and recommended that DHS take on this role. GAO also recommended developing a government-wide performance plan for food safety activities. Gas and oil pipelines, crucial to U.S. energy supply, transport hazardous liquids across the country. Gas and oil pipelines are a favored target of terrorists, militants, and organized crime globally. U.S. officials have foiled plots to attack pipelines since 9/11, with concerns growing about attacks by individuals unaffiliated with terrorist groups. Cybersecurity has become a significant concern for pipeline security. In March 2012, the DHS identified cyber intrusions in U.S. natural gas pipeline operators dating back to December 2011. The TSA leads federal pipeline security activities, relying on voluntary industry compliance with security guidance and best practices. TSA has been involved in pipeline security initiatives since 2003, including developing standards, risk mitigation measures, stakeholder relations, and compliance monitoring. The TSA leads federal pipeline security activities through programs like the Corporate Security Review (CSR) and Critical Facility Inspection Program (CFI). They have completed CSRs for the largest pipeline systems and conducted in-depth inspections of critical facilities. Congress has ongoing concerns about the agency's effectiveness in strengthening U.S. pipeline security. The TSA leads federal pipeline security activities through programs like the Corporate Security Review (CSR) and Critical Facility Inspection Program (CFI). Congress has ongoing concerns about the agency's pipeline security standards, resources, and CSR program. Some Members of Congress and the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General question the adequacy of voluntary federal pipeline security requirements. The Government Accountability Office recommended specific actions in a 2010 report to address these concerns. The Government Accountability Office recommended actions in a 2010 report to improve TSA's pipeline security processes. There is no federal legislation addressing these concerns yet, but they may be addressed in the 113th Congress. The next Congress may also assess how pipeline security aligns with the U.S. pipeline safety program administered by the DOT. While the DOT and TSA have different missions, pipeline safety and security are interconnected. Chemical Facility Security: Issues and Options for the 113th Congress include the regulation of fertilizers such as Ammonium Nitrate and Anhydrous Ammonia. Congress granted DHS authority to regulate security at chemical facilities in 2007, which is set to expire in 2013. Policy makers are considering extending or revising this authority, with stakeholders criticizing the content and pace of DHS regulation. Recommended statutory changes aim to broaden the regulated community, enable the federal government to mandate security measures, and increase access to vulnerability information. The Obama Administration and stakeholders support extending DHS authority to regulate chemical facilities for security purposes. Environmental groups advocate for requirements to adopt safer technologies and disseminate security information. The industry opposes mandating specific security measures, questioning the effectiveness of safer technology concepts. The Obama Administration issued Executive Order 13650 to improve chemical facility safety and security by coordinating federal efforts. Challenges for policymakers include extending statutory authority, implementing safer technologies, and balancing security information protection with dissemination. The DHS regulatory program for chemical security faces challenges with implementation delays and non-compliance from regulated facilities. Policy makers are grappling with decisions on potential program changes to improve efficacy. The nation's water supply and quality infrastructure are vulnerable to various terrorist attacks, including physical disruption, bioterrorism, and cyber attacks. Damage could disrupt vital human services, making early security changes crucial. Contact [author name scrubbed] for more information. Recent policy interest has focused on enhancing security measures for wastewater utilities and considering whether to include wastewater and water utilities in chemical plant security regulations implemented by DHS. Congress has given DHS the responsibility to coordinate information to secure the nation's critical infrastructure, including the water sector, through partnerships with the public and private sectors. EPA is the lead federal agency for protecting wastewater and drinking water utility. The EPA is the lead federal agency for protecting wastewater and drinking water utility systems under the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Congress has considered legislation to require vulnerability assessments for drinking water systems, but similar requirements for wastewater treatment facilities have not been enacted. Congress is also discussing security standards for chemical plants, which may include regulations for wastewater and drinking water utilities. Issues debated include whether to include water utilities in DHS rules under the CFATS program, requiring consideration of safer technology for hazardous substances. Debate also surrounds the roles of EPA and DHS in overseeing security at water utilities, with concerns about creating a dual regulatory arrangement. Legislative proposals in the 112th Congress debated the regulatory arrangement for water utilities, with arguments for EPA's expertise and DHS's overall responsibility. The bills aimed to preserve exemptions from the CFATS program and maintain EPA's lead role in the water utility sector. However, none of these bills were enacted, and the CFATS program was extended through October 4, 2013. Legislation (H.R. 2217) extending CFATS program authority through October 4, 2014 has passed the House and been reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. S. 67, the Secure Water Facilities Act, proposes adding wastewater and drinking water facilities to CFATS program coverage, requiring security measures in response to terrorist threats. EPA maintains regulatory role in water sector security. Passenger rail systems are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, with bombings in Europe and Asia highlighting the risk. The United States' subway systems carry five times more passengers daily than airlines, making them potential targets. As air travel security increases, there are concerns that terrorists may shift focus to softer targets like transit or passenger rail. Congressional oversight of homeland security in this sector is limited but could be of interest in the 113th Congress. The challenge for Congress is to balance increased rail passenger security with efficient transit system functioning, considering potential costs and damages of an attack. Transit security measures focus on managing attack consequences rather than screening all passengers like airlines. Steps taken include vulnerability assessments, emergency planning, response training, increasing security personnel, video surveillance, and random checks. The challenges of securing rail passengers are significant, but securing bus passengers presents an even greater challenge due to the sheer number and operational characteristics of buses. Some transit systems have installed video cameras on buses, and Congress has provided grants for security improvements. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 authorized $3.5 billion for grants for public transportation security, requiring high-risk targets to have approved security plans. In 2010, TSA completed a national threat assessment for transit and passenger rail, and in 2011 completed an updated transportation systems-sector specific plan to establish goals for a secure transportation system. TSA inspectors assess transit systems to mitigate risks to high-risk assets, expand deterrence activities, and enhance information sharing. The TSA conducts assessments of transit systems through the BASE program, developed security training and exercise programs for transit, and operates VIPR teams with local law enforcement for security measures. The House Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Transportation Security discussed the increase in inspectors from 175 in FY2008 to 404 in FY2011, highlighting issues such as lack of transportation expertise among inspectors. The Department of Homeland Security provides grants for security improvements in public transit and passenger rail under the Urban Area Security Initiative program. The Transit Security Grant Program did not receive a specified amount of funding in FY2012. The Government Accountability Office found opportunities for duplication among DHS state and local security grant programs. The Obama Administration proposed consolidating several DHS state and local security grant programs, including the public transportation security grant program, in the FY2013 budget. Congressional appropriators did not support this proposal, expressing concerns about grant programs not focusing on high-risk areas and unawarded funds. Drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico has increased, with estimates of deaths between December 2006. Estimates suggest that drug trafficking-related deaths in Mexico between December 2006 and December 2012 ranged from 45,000 to 55,000. Mexican DTOs are in conflict with each other and with law enforcement along the U.S. border. The illegal drug market's high profits lead to violence as the primary method of dispute resolution. U.S. policymakers are concerned about potential spillover violence into the United States. Mexican DTOs are the greatest drug trafficking threat to the United States, transporting or producing drugs across the border. The illicit proceeds are laundered or smuggled back, and funds may be used to buy weapons in the US for smuggling into Mexico. The US sustains a multi-billion dollar illegal drug market, fueling the DTO threat. DTOs also profit from other illegal activities like human smuggling, counterfeiting, and kidnapping. The United States faces various criminal activities such as human and weapon smuggling, counterfeiting, piracy, kidnapping, and extortion, contributing to concerns about spillover violence. Defining spillover violence is crucial for tracking trends and debating policy options to prevent or mitigate such violence. Congress may also need to address how to prevent drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico from spreading into the US. One potential option to prevent drug trafficking-related violence in Mexico from spilling into the United States is to increase border enforcement efforts, provide aid to Mexico to disrupt organized crime, reduce drug demand in the US, and consider decriminalizing or legalizing certain drugs. The flow of money outside legal channels poses challenges to law enforcement and has connections to homeland security policy. The sale of illegal drugs in the United States generates billions in annual proceeds for Mexican and Colombian drug trafficking organizations. Money from these illegal sales is moved south across the border into Mexico, fueling criminal activities. The funds are laundered through cash smuggling and other illicit methods. The development of new technologies allows drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) to conceal their illicit proceeds by using stored value cards, mobile banking systems, and other methods. Mexican DTOs can move profits from the sale of Colombian cocaine directly from the United States to the source country without involving middlemen. Traffickers have turned to stored value cards to move money, enabling them to avoid reporting requirements for cash amounts over $10,000 when crossing the border. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has proposed a rule to include prepaid access devices as monetary instruments for international transportation regulations. Policy makers are debating the balance between facilitating legitimate transactions and preventing illegal proceeds movement. Various agencies are involved in monitoring and enforcing these regulations. Mexican traffickers use cross-border tunnels to smuggle drugs, people, and contraband into the United States, increasing bilateral cooperation between U.S. agencies and Mexico. Operations targeting southbound firearms smuggling also intercept cash proceeds from illicit drug sales. The use of smuggling tunnels into the United States has increased in frequency and sophistication since the 1990s. Over 150 tunnels have been discovered along the Southwest border, with an 80% uptick in detections since 2008. These tunnels range from rudimentary \"gopher hole\" tunnels to more advanced ones that tap into existing infrastructure like storm drains or sewage systems. The most sophisticated tunnels can have rail, ventilation, and electrical systems. One of the most elaborate drug smuggling tunnels discovered in San Diego in November 2011 stretched 612 yards in length, had electric rail cars, lighting, reinforced walls, and wooden floors, leading to the seizure of 32 tons of marijuana. U.S. law enforcement uses various tactics like sonic equipment, seismic technology, and ground penetrating radar to detect cross-border tunnels, but effectiveness can be limited by factors such as soil conditions, tunnel diameter, and depth. U.S. officials rely on human intelligence and tips to detect sophisticated tunnels, as current technology is not reliable for this purpose. Cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement is crucial in investigating and prosecuting criminals involved in cross-border tunnels. The 113th Congress may consider improving technology for law enforcement and enhancing bi-national partnerships to combat transnational crime. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is America's primary trade enforcement agency, balancing efficient trade flows with cargo security and enforcement of U.S. trade laws. The policy question is how to minimize the risk of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), illegal drugs, and contraband entering U.S. ports of entry while limiting costs and delays. Six laws enacted between 2002 and 2007 address trade process and cargo security. CBP's current trade strategy focuses on trade facilitation, enforcement, and security. CBP's trade strategy emphasizes risk management and a multi-layered approach to cargo security. Importers are segmented into higher and lower risk pools, with security procedures focused on higher-risk flows. The multi-layered approach involves enforcement at multiple points in the import process, from before goods are loaded in foreign ports to months or years after goods have entered the U.S. Congressional attention has focused on the C-TPAT trusted trader program and the requirement to scan 100% of incoming maritime cargo containers abroad before loading on U.S.-bound ships. The Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is a voluntary program that allows certain import-related businesses to register with CBP and perform security tasks. Members receive benefits such as expedited import processing. Some support increased participation in C-TPAT to facilitate legal trade flows, while others criticize the program for being inadequate. Some businesses criticize the C-TPAT program for inadequate benefits despite the time and financial investments required for certification. Limited coordination between CBP and other government agencies can cause delays for C-TPAT members during the import process. Only a small percentage of eligible import-related businesses and customs brokers have joined the program. Congress may need to consider legislation to increase C-TPAT benefits and encourage participation to facilitate lawful trade flows. The C-TPAT program offers benefits such as dedicated lanes for faster processing at land ports and reduced likelihood of secondary inspection for maritime imports. However, expanding lanes at land ports is challenging due to limited space in urban areas. Only a small percentage of maritime containers undergo secondary inspection, so C-TPAT membership may not always provide practical advantages. Some officials warn that reducing C-TPAT inspections could increase security risks by allowing smugglers to exploit the system. The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the Department of Energy, private sector, and foreign governments, piloted an integrated system in three foreign ports to scan 100% of cargo containers bound for the United States. Legislation required 100% screening of imported cargo containers to identify high-risk ones, with those identified as high risk also undergoing non-intrusive inspection and radiation detection before reaching the US. Amendments to the SAFE Port Act mandated that by July 1, 2012, all maritime containers imported to the US be scanned by NII and radiation detection equipment before being loaded onto a US-bound vessel. As of August 2012, only 1% of cargo was scanned with NII before being loaded on U.S.-bound ships, and about 5% of cargo was subject to NII scanning before entering the United States. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano extended the deadline for 100% scanning due to obstacles identified in the pilot program, including lack of support from some foreign governments and logistical challenges. The implementation of 100% scanning for cargo containers faces opposition from business groups and logistical challenges at large volume ports. The estimated cost for 100% scanning at foreign ports is $8 million per shipping lane, totaling $16.8 billion for all 2,100 shipping lanes. Additionally, the approach conflicts with DHS's risk management strategy of focusing resources on high-risk containers. Congress has expressed frustration over the lack of progress in implementing 100% scanning. The DHS has faced challenges in implementing 100% cargo scanning, with Congress considering changes to the requirement due to cost and logistical issues. The House Appropriations Committee directed DHS to submit an alternative strategy for cargo scanning by January 1, 2014. One ongoing issue for Congress is the allocation of resources for CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) personnel and port infrastructure, particularly at land ports on the U.S.-Mexico border. Congress has invested more in Border Patrol agents than OFO officers. The Obama Administration proposed increasing OFO personnel by 3,477 officers, but the House-passed DHS appropriations act only included funding for about 800 new officers. The Senate-reported version of the bill would support 1,850 officers for CBP, with other legislation also requiring additional officers at ports of entry. DHS has proposed expanding inspection services at ports of entry through public-private partnerships to control costs. Section 560 of the FY2013 DHS appropriations act established a pilot program for CBP to enter into up to five PPPs to support customs and immigration services. The Administration proposed a pilot program for CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to support customs and immigration services at ports of entry. The House-passed bill does not include this language, while the Senate-reported version would reauthorize the pilot program and allow CBP to accept donations for facility construction. The Administration proposed a pilot program for CBP to enter into public-private partnerships to support customs and immigration services at ports of entry. Congress emphasized the need to detect and interdict smuggled nuclear and radiological material before it enters the United States. DHS has adopted a strategy of securing the border through radiation portal monitors and imaging equipment, but some experts criticize this system as insufficient. DHS has been developing next-generation detection equipment, but some systems did not meet testing milestones. The Cargo Advanced Automated Radiography System did not meet testing and evaluation milestones, lagged in performance and timeline expectations, and were ultimately not procured. The Government Accountability Office and other groups have questioned the efficacy of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office's efforts to develop a next-generation radiation detection system. Congress has required DHS to scan all containerized cargo entering the United States for nuclear and radiological material, a requirement that has not yet been met. The DHS has not met the requirement to scan all containerized cargo entering the United States for nuclear and radiological material. There is a shortfall of key neutron detection material, helium-3, leading to a reconsideration of the current nuclear detection approach. DHS is testing new neutron-detection materials and considering whether to recapitalize current systems or invest in next-generation technology. Congressional decision-makers are facing questions about the future of these systems. DHS is part of a larger effort to develop a global nuclear detection architecture, with Congress assigning responsibility to DHS's DNDO for coordinating federal efforts and implementing this architecture. The GNDA strategic plan has been released, with DHS developing an implementation plan. GAO has identified weaknesses in the plan but generally supports DHS's efforts. The 113th Congress may oversee the development of nuclear detection equipment and interagency coordination. Since October 2007, TSA has issued about 2.3 million TWIC cards to maritime workers for unescorted access to secure areas of port facilities or vessels. The card, authorized under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, must be renewed every five years, with a security threat assessment conducted before issuance. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issues TWIC cards to maritime workers for access to secure areas. Workers undergo background checks and biometric identification. Card readers are supposed to be deployed at port gates for verification, but TSA has not decided on the technology yet. The Coast Guard is considering requiring card readers for facilities or vessels handling dangerous bulk commodities or more than 1,000 passengers at a time. This would affect a small percentage of vessels and facilities regulated under MTSA, while others would continue to use TWIC as a \"flash pass.\" The Coast Guard is reviewing comments on the NPRM for requiring card readers for certain facilities and vessels. Recent GAO audits criticized the implementation of TWIC, highlighting issues with pilot test results and TSA's Adjudication Center. Following the 9/11 attacks, Congress created the TSA to federalize airline security. Despite progress, challenges remain in effectively screening passengers and cargo for threats and developing risk-based screening methods. The TSA was created after the 9/11 attacks to federalize airline security. Challenges remain in effectively screening passengers and cargo for threats and developing risk-based methods. Strategies include identifying potential threats, addressing aircraft vulnerabilities, and considering security implications of unmanned aircraft operations in domestic airspace. After the 9/11 attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated 100% screening of checked baggage on domestic and international passenger flights. The TSA has implemented cargo screening domestically but still needs to fully implement it for U.S.-bound international flights. Recent attention has focused on improving explosives screening of passengers in response to threats, particularly on U.S.-bound airliners. Al-Qaeda has been linked to various incidents, including the 2009 underwear bomb attempt on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 and the 2010 cargo bomb plot. The Obama Administration accelerated deployment in response to the Flight 253 incident. The Obama Administration deployed Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) and other screening technologies at airport checkpoints to improve explosives detection on passengers, following the Northwest Airlines Flight 253 incident. Privacy concerns have been raised regarding the use of AIT, especially for primary screening, and screening procedures for children, the elderly, and individuals with medical conditions have been contentious. Recent modifications to pat-down screening procedures have raised privacy concerns, including detailed inspection of private areas. To address these concerns, TSA implemented remote screening of images outside public view and prohibited recording or storing AIT images. Other issues with AIT screening include time consumption and potential medical risks from backscatter x-ray systems. TSA is transitioning to millimeter-wave scanning technology to address these concerns and is implementing automated threat detection capabilities to eliminate the need for screeners to view AIT-generated images. TSA is phasing out backscatter AIT in favor of millimeter-wave scanning technology for faster and more compatible screening. Some advocate for risk-based AIT use, while legislative proposals aim to prohibit WBI technology for primary screening and accelerate ATR software deployment. TSA has introduced risk-based screening initiatives like PreCheck and modified procedures for children. The TSA has introduced various trial programs for expedited screening, including PreCheck for trusted travelers, modified procedures for children, and expedited screening for known flight crew. These initiatives aim to improve screening efficiencies and potentially save costs. The TSA introduced PreCheck for trusted travelers to expedite screening, but questions remain about its effectiveness in directing security resources. Concerns include the public dissemination of instructions on how to bypass screening. The TSA has implemented various programs to enhance security measures, including PreCheck for trusted travelers, known crewmember program for airline flight crews, and a passenger behavior detection program. Concerns have been raised about the lack of biometric identity authentication and detailed background checks for PreCheck participants. TSA is also testing more extensive passenger interviews based on methods used at Israeli airports. The TSA is field testing more extensive passenger interviews based on Israeli airport methods. Questions remain about the effectiveness of the behavioral detection program, with concerns about potential racial or ethnic profiling despite efforts to focus on behaviors. The House Appropriations Committee did not support increasing Behavior Detection Officers, citing a lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness in protecting against aviation security threats. They have called for a cost-benefit analysis and a risk-based strategy for BDO deployment. The failed bombing attempt of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, raised policy questions about the use of terrorist watchlists and intelligence to identify threats to aviation. Failings to include the bomber on no-fly or selectee lists led to reviews of intelligence analysis and watchlisting processes. Concerns were further raised when Faisal Shazad, a suspect in a car bombing attempt in Times Square, was allowed to board a flight to Dubai despite being on the no-fly list. Following the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in December 2009, there were concerns about the effectiveness of terrorist watchlists. Changes were made to security directives, requiring airlines to check passenger names against the no-fly list within two hours of urgent updates. The Secure Flight program was accelerated to transfer watchlist checks from airlines to the TSA, ensuring 100% of passengers flying to or from U.S. airports are vetted. Secure Flight continues to vet passenger names against the Terrorist Screening Database. The Secure Flight program operates by vetting passenger name records against the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) in coordination with watchlists used by CBP's National Targeting Center-Passenger. Key issues for Congress to consider include updating watchlists in a timely manner, utilizing all available terrorist information to assess threats among passengers and airport workers, detecting identity fraud, and providing redress protocols. The threat to civilian aircraft from shoulder-fired missiles or other standoff weapons remains a significant concern for aviation security specialists. Initiatives to reduce MANPADS stockpiles have led to a decrease in worldwide inventories by at least 32,500. Despite reducing worldwide MANPADS stockpiles by 32,500 missiles, the threat of insurgents possessing these weapons still exists. Civil aircraft remain vulnerable to missile attacks, especially in conflict zones. The Counter-MANPADS program by DHS concluded in 2009, certifying systems capable of protecting airliners but high costs have prevented their deployment on commercial flights. Some critics argue that current aircraft protection systems do not cover all potential threats, but proponents believe they are effective against heat-seeking MANPADS. Airlines facing economic challenges are hesitant to invest in these systems and suggest government funding. Policy debates focus on acquiring units for the Civil Reserve Aviation Fleet. Other protection methods include ground-based missile countermeasures and escort planes or drones. Improving airport security to reduce vulnerability to MANPADS attacks remains a challenge due to limited resources and large geographic areas. Despite efforts to partner with law enforcement agencies, vulnerabilities persist, posing a significant national security threat if exploited by terrorists. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 requires the FAA to accommodate civilian drones in domestic airspace by FY2015, raising security concerns about potential terrorist use of drones for attacks. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 mandates the integration of civilian drones into domestic airspace by FY2015, sparking concerns about potential terrorist attacks using drones. Security risks include terrorists using drones for ground attacks, tapping into sensor data, or carrying out small-scale attacks with explosives or chemical, biological, or radiological materials. The FBI thwarted a terrorist plot in 2011 involving model aircraft packed with explosives targeting the Pentagon and Capitol, highlighting the threat of unmanned aircraft in terrorist attacks. Unmanned aircraft, including drones, pose security risks for potential terrorist attacks using explosives, chemical, biological, or radiological materials. Vulnerabilities include jamming or hacking of command and control systems, leading to crashes or hostile takeovers. Recommendations include requiring spoof-resistant navigation systems and reducing reliance on GPS guidance. TSA has not taken specific action to address security concerns regarding drones in domestic airspace. Despite the risks, drones can also be valuable assets for homeland security operations. The use of drones for homeland security, particularly for CBP border surveillance operations, raises legal concerns about Fourth Amendment and privacy issues. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) currently operates a fleet of 10 modified Predator B unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to patrol America's borders and has ordered 14 more. These unarmed UAVs patrol designated airspace to detect border violations and monitor drug trafficking. The use of drones for homeland security, particularly for CBP border surveillance operations, raises legal concerns about Fourth Amendment and privacy issues. Drones are used in the Gulf of Mexico to detect potential border violations and monitor suspected drug trafficking, with UAV operators cuing manned responses when necessary. State and local governments are interested in using drones for various missions such as traffic patrol, surveillance, and event security. Some law enforcement and first responder applications of drones may be eligible for DHS grants. The expansion of drones into American skies raises legal concerns about privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. Courts use various tests to determine if government drone surveillance constitutes a search or seizure, considering factors like the location of the search, technology sophistication, and societal views on privacy. While individuals have strong protections against intrusions in their homes, there are fewer restrictions on government surveillance in public places and at national borders. The use of drones for domestic surveillance raises legal concerns about privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. Courts assess the level of scrutiny based on factors like technology sophistication and societal views on privacy. Members of Congress have proposed measures requiring warrants for drone use, with exceptions for border patrols and investigating terrorist threats. Immigration policy has been a focus in Congress during the 113th session. The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill in June 2013, while the House addressed various issues related to border security, employment verification, and immigration enforcement. The report summarizes homeland security issues related to immigration enforcement by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at ports of entry. CBP aims to identify high-risk individuals while facilitating access for low-risk travelers without infringing on privacy or civil liberties. Travelers must present a passport or equivalent travel document, along with a visa or proof of eligibility for admission to the United States. Foreign nationals undergo security checks before receiving a visa or travel authorization through the Visa Waiver Program. CBP officers verify travelers' identities using biometric checks against the IDENT database. Database interoperability allows officers to check biographic and biometric records. CBP officers use biographic and biometric databases to check travelers' records. Adequate resources are needed to minimize congestion at the border. Rapid processing can lead to missed threats. Investment in ports of entry has not kept pace with international travel growth. Trusted traveler programs aim to streamline admissions without compromising security. Trusted traveler programs require background checks, interviews, and biometric data for expedited processing at ports of entry. CBP operates Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI for expedited screening at various locations. Legislation introduced during the 113th Congress aims to encourage participation in trusted traveler programs like Global Entry by facilitating enrollment. The system established in 1996 required the development of an automated entry and exit control system to track alien arrivals and departures, with amendments made over the years, including the addition of a biometric component in 2001. The system's initial focus was on identifying visa overstayers. The entry-exit system, managed by US-VISIT/OBIM, collects biographic data from foreign nationals entering the US to identify visa overstayers and inadmissible aliens. It started in 2004 at airports and sea ports, expanded to land POEs by 2004, and is now operational at almost all US ports of entry. The data is added to the ADIS database, which had 280 million records as of January 2013. The ADIS database contains 280 million unique records as of January 2013. Since 2008, ADIS receives departure data from air carriers and sea vessels. An integrated entry-exit pilot program since September 2012 allows DHS to use Canadian admissions data as U.S. departure at certain northern border land ports. However, a July 2013 GAO report raised concerns about the quality of DHS's overstay data, with more than 1 million arrival records not matched to departure data. Congress has not received statutorily required reports on visa overstays since 1994. US-VISIT/OBIM collects biometric data such as fingerprints and digital photographs, which are added to the IDENT database with over 150 million unique records as of January 2013. Biometric data collection is more time-consuming than biographic data collection, and not all travelers are required to provide biometrics. Since January 2009, US-VISIT/OBIM has collected biometric data from non-U.S. citizens entering the United States, excluding Canadian nationals and U.S. LPRs returning from cruises. Only one-third of nonimmigrant admissions in FY2012 were required to provide biometric data, with exemptions for certain travelers. As of August 2013, DHS does not collect biometric departure data from travelers leaving the United States. The completion of a more comprehensive entry-exit system has been a congressional concern, with proposed legislation requiring carriers to collect electronic biographic exit data from departing air passengers. The bill would require DHS to establish a biometric exit system at ten U.S. airports with high international air travel volume within two years of enactment. Additionally, the Border Security Results Act of 2013 would mandate DHS to submit a plan to Congress within 180 days for completing a biometric entry-exit system or implementing an alternative program within two years. The Border Patrol patrols U.S. international borders with Mexico and Canada, focusing on securing the border and measuring border security investments. DHS and INS have invested in personnel, fencing, and surveillance technology since the 1980s, with a budget of $11.8 billion in FY2013. The Senate CIR bill S. 744 proposes doubling Border Patrol agents and installing 700 miles of pedestrian fencing, funded by approximately $45 billion. The bill proposes funding new border assets with $45 billion over 5-10 years. Some Members of Congress question the effectiveness of DHS investments at the border and the lack of a clear strategy for border security. Border apprehensions have decreased since 2006, but this may not solely reflect improved enforcement. Bills in Congress aim to require DHS to report on a strategy for securing the U.S. border. Bills in Congress would mandate DHS to report on a strategy for securing U.S. borders, including developing precise metrics for border security. H.R. 1417 in the House requires DHS to achieve \"operational control\" of the border within set deadlines, defining metrics and collaborating with external partners and the GAO. The Senate CIR bill, S. 744, also calls for new border strategies, addressing concerns about the relative priority between the southern and northern borders. Some security experts warn that the northern border is a vulnerable point for terrorism and homeland security threats due to limited enforcement resources. Concerns also exist about the integrity of CBP agents and potential infiltration by criminals, leading to increased internal investigation efforts by DHS. DHS has increased internal investigation efforts to root out double agents and corruption among CBP officers. Congress allocated $10 million for integrity programs in FY2010, with GAO reports highlighting challenges in managing integrity-related programs. Congress may continue to monitor CBP integrity issues. The majority of disaster assistance provided by FEMA is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which Congress appropriates budget authority to annually. Shortfalls in the DRF have led to additional budget authority being provided through continuing resolutions or emergency supplemental appropriations. The additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) has traditionally been provided through emergency supplemental appropriations, allowing funding beyond discretionary budget limits. Congress has provided extra budget authority for the DRF nine times from FY2005 to FY2010. The reliance on emergency supplemental appropriations has raised concerns as the number and costs of disasters have increased, leading to discussions on reducing federal spending on disasters. Congress included provisions on disaster relief spending in the Budget Control Act (BCA) to address the increasing costs of disasters. The BCA allows for adjustments to discretionary spending caps to accommodate disaster assistance, with limitations on how much the budget cap can be adjusted. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received all available funding under the BCA's allowable adjustment for disaster relief for the first time. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received $11.49 billion in additional pre-sequester resources for disaster needs, exceeding the allowable adjustment under the Budget Control Act. Emergency funding designations were provided to cover the supplemental funding, with $5.38 billion used from the total amount allocated. In FY2013, $11.49 billion was allocated to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), with $5.38 billion using the allowable adjustment for disaster relief under the Budget Control Act and $6.11 billion carrying an emergency designation. Attempts in Congress to offset the costs of disaster relief were unsuccessful, with sequestration impacting funding. $898 million was cancelled by sequestration out of the $17.89 billion provided to the DRF in FY2013. Congress may consider passing reforms to reduce federal expenditures on disaster relief, such as changing criteria for federal assistance and adjusting cost-sharing percentages. Hurricane Sandy made landfall in southern New Jersey on October 29, 2012, causing immense consequences. Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey causing immense consequences: 159 deaths, 23,000 in shelters, 8.5 million without power, $65 billion in damages, and 650,000 homes damaged. Congress responded with hearings, visits, and legislation. The President declared disasters in 12 states and DC under the Stafford Act. On January 29, 2013, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, provided $50.5 billion in disaster assistance. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, provided $50.5 billion in disaster assistance largely focused on responding to Hurricane Sandy. It included funding for various programs such as the Community Development Block Grant program, the Disaster Relief Fund, the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program, and disaster-related activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Congress also considered reforming provisions of the Stafford Act in response to Hurricane Sandy recovery concerns. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 (SRIA) was passed to address concerns about delays and bureaucratic burdens in Hurricane Sandy recovery. President Obama established the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force to coordinate federal efforts for an efficient recovery process. The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, led by Shaun L. S. Donovan, included members from various executive branch agencies and offices. Supported by an advisory group of elected leaders from heavily impacted areas, the Task Force's main deliverable is the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy (HSRS), which outlines 69 recommendations for long-term recovery across different areas like infrastructure, housing, and small business support. The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, led by Shaun L. S. Donovan, outlined 69 recommendations in the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy (HSRS) to address various aspects of long-term recovery, including housing, small business support, and infrastructure. The recommendations aim to strengthen homes, provide safe housing options, support small businesses, address insurance challenges, improve data sharing, and build state and local capacity for long-term recovery and rebuilding. The strategic vision by the Administration focuses on how federal funds should be used, how agencies should coordinate efforts, and how the region can leverage the recovery process to prepare for future disasters. The Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force led by Shaun L. S. Donovan outlined 69 recommendations in the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy (HSRS) to address long-term recovery. Effective implementation will require coordinated regulatory and policy-review processes among federal agencies. The 113th Congress may need to oversee the Sandy recovery process and the use of supplemental appropriations in the affected region to improve federal delivery. State and local governments may reduce their contribution to public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. This could impact national preparedness levels. President Obama issued a directive for DHS to develop a national strategy in response to these challenges. The DHS Secretary released the National Preparedness Goal in September 2011, aiming for a secure and resilient nation with capabilities to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from threats. Grant-funded activities are linked to this goal, with additional homeland security grant programs established post-9/11. Since the release of the National Preparedness Goal in September 2011 by the DHS Secretary, various homeland security grant programs have been added to ensure state and local preparedness. These programs include SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. Federal assistance for preparedness activities only makes up a small percentage of overall state and local spending. Federal assistance for state and local government homeland security preparedness is minimal, accounting for less than 2% of total public safety expenditures, which amount to $218 billion annually. Congress appropriated $4.1 billion in FY2010, $3.3 billion in FY2011, $2.3 billion in FY2012, and $1.5 billion in FY2013 for these grant programs. In FY2013, the President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness, including funding for the National Preparedness Grant Program. However, Congress did not provide funding for NPGP in FY2013 or FY2014. The FY2013 preparedness grant consolidation was denied due to lack of congressional authorization and clarity in implementation. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns over the proposal, citing insufficient details and stakeholder participation. The Senate Committee expressed concern over funding allocation for grant programs, particularly the NPGP proposal. Congress continues to debate authorization, appropriations, and structure for DHS preparedness grants in the 113th Congress. Federal firefighter assistance is established by Congress, while firefighting activities are traditionally managed by states and local communities. In 2000, the 106th Congress established the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFG) to provide grants for firefighting equipment and training. The scope and funding for AFG were expanded after the 9/11 attacks. The 108th Congress established the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program in 2003 to support firefighter staffing. Funding levels for AFG and SAFER are debated in the 113th Congress due to inadequate state and local public safety budgets. The 112th Congress reauthorized AFG and SAFER in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, making changes to grant caps and distribution formulas. The 113th Congress will oversee the impact of these changes and evaluate the effectiveness of grants in protecting public health and safety against fire hazards. Emergency communications systems are crucial for first responders and disseminating alerts to residents in danger. These systems are moving towards a common IP platform, with federal, state, and local agencies investing in IP-enabled infrastructure. Key investments include interoperable public safety networks, digital alerts, and NG9-1-1 networks. The federal programs related to emergency communications include FirstNet, IPAWS, and ICO. FirstNet is an independent authority under NTIA, IPAWS is coordinated through FEMA, and ICO functions are shared by NTIA and NHTSA. Coordination among these programs is not required by legislation. FirstNet is mandated to share infrastructure and provide connectivity to 9-1-1 call centers. FirstNet, created by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, is limited to developing a new wireless network for emergency personnel. The 113th Congress may consider legislation to improve IPAWS, with concerns about the survivability and coverage of commercial communications infrastructure. Multiple federal agencies and congressional committees, as well as state and local entities, are involved in emergency communications policies. The National Response Framework coordinates response efforts across jurisdictions, but there is no federal policy for coordinating technology procurement and infrastructure investments for emergency communications. The transition to IP-based communications presents an opportunity to align infrastructure investments. The United States faces various threats, and strategic resource allocation for disaster preparedness is crucial. Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness (PPD-8), signed by President Obama in 2011, guides the nation in preventing, protecting against, and responding to threats like terrorist acts and natural disasters. It supersedes Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 and meets requirements of the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act of 2006. PPD-8, signed by President Obama in 2011, sets the goal for national preparedness in preventing, protecting against, and responding to threats. It is supported by various documents and frameworks that provide strategic guidance in disaster prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery. The policy embodies the federal government's strategic vision for disaster preparedness. PPD-8, signed by President Obama in 2011, aims to enhance national preparedness for disasters by providing strategic guidance on prevention, protection, response, and recovery. Its impact on budgetary decisions, national roles, and long-term policy objectives is yet to be determined, dependent on the quality of strategic planning and adherence to guidance. The 113th Congress may oversee the implementation of PPD-8 by the Administration and its impact on budgetary planning, federal roles, and non-federal stakeholders. The nation's public health emergency management laws have expanded significantly in the past decade, following lessons from past incidents like the terrorist attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Subsequent events such as the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the earthquake in Haiti, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, nuclear plant failures in Japan, and Hurricane Sandy have highlighted gaps in readiness for public health emergencies. These gaps include inadequate response plans, limited technology for assessing threats, and challenges in providing medical countermeasures. The 113th Congress reauthorized public health and medical preparedness laws through the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013. Threats like radiation or chemical exposure may be limited, medical countermeasures may not be readily available, and the medical system may lack capacity to respond to mass casualty incidents. Funding for response costs may also be a challenge. The federal government's influence on preparedness efforts through funding and policies may be restricted. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA, P.L. 113-5) focused on improving federal programs for medical countermeasures in emergencies, reauthorized grants for public health preparedness, and established a National Advisory Committee on Children and Disasters. Funding for public health incidents not declared under the Stafford Act remains a challenge due to lack of appropriations to the Public Health Emergency Fund. The Public Health Emergency Fund lacks appropriations from Congress. The Stafford Act provides assistance for public health activities, but there is no federal program to cover uninsured health care costs post-disaster. Congress has occasionally provided special assistance for uncompensated disaster-related health care costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) may help reduce disaster-related health care costs by decreasing the number of uninsured individuals. The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides the President with authorities to enhance national defense preparedness programs, including activities related to homeland security. The Defense Production Act of 1950 provides the President with authorities to support domestic homeland security activities, natural disaster response, and national emergencies. These authorities have been used to enhance U.S. military preparedness, support the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center program, and enable private sector restoration efforts after disasters like Hurricane Katrina. Title III and Title VII of the Defense Production Act (DPA) grant the government authorities to prioritize contracts for critical equipment and resources necessary for national defense. These provisions also allow for the expansion of domestic productive capacity and support private sector agreements in the interest of national defense. The President holds most of the DPA authorities, which can be delegated to subordinates through executive orders. The President issued Executive Order 13603 on \"National Defense Resources Preparedness\" to delegate DPA authorities to Cabinet Secretaries. DPA authorities are time-limited and set to expire on September 30, 2014. The 113th Congress may consider reauthorizing and amending the DPA before it expires. Committees in both chambers have held hearings on potential reauthorization. Congress may also review oversight of current DPA use by federal agencies. Since 2003, the Department of Homeland Security has undergone major and minor reorganizations using provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Congress limited funds for these reorganizations in 2007. The President delegated Defense Production Act authorities to Cabinet Secretaries through Executive Order 13603, set to expire in 2014. The 113th Congress may consider reauthorizing and amending the DPA. Committees have held hearings on potential reauthorization and oversight of current DPA use by federal agencies. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, imposed limitations on funds for reorganizations within the Department of Homeland Security. This restriction raised questions about the Secretary's authority to undertake reorganizations without Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 imposed limitations on funds for reorganizations within the Department of Homeland Security. The Secretary's authority to undertake reorganizations without Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was questioned. The decision on whether to carry over the limitation arises annually, and potential amendments to Section 872 may be considered during a reauthorization process. Congressional decisions may be influenced by the impact of Section 872 and the appropriation limitation on department management. Title I of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill funds the management functions of DHS, which have grown in response to criticism. Funding for management accounts increased from $195 million in FY2003 to $803 million in FY2012 due to staff size, personnel costs, technology investments, and real estate expenses. The management accounts for the department's headquarters offices have seen increased funding requests in recent years for capital and personnel initiatives. Pre-sequester, these accounts received $643 million in FY2013. The Administration requested $651 million for FY2014, with additional funding for headquarters and data center consolidation. House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $526 million and $633 million, respectively, with similar exclusions. House amendments reduced funding by $51 million from the committee's recommendation. The Department of Homeland Security has faced financial management challenges since its inception, with inherited problems from major legacy components like the Coast Guard and FEMA. The House reduced funding by $51 million from the committee's recommendation in the bill. The Department of Homeland Security faced financial management challenges due to failed attempts to develop its own system and contracting issues. Despite progress in reducing material weaknesses, DHS completed its first audit in FY2012. The independent auditor found that DHS was unable to verify the accuracy of its property, plant, and equipment balances in its financial statements. Five significant deficiencies in internal controls were identified, including Financial Reporting, Information Technology Controls, and Budgetary Accounting. The Coast Guard showed improvement in accounting for its PP&E. The DHS needs to address internal control deficiencies to achieve clean audit opinions on its financial statements. The 113th Congress is interested in oversight of DHS's financial systems due to its large budget and the current push for stricter budgetary oversight. This oversight may include reviewing grant programs and improper payments. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) needs to improve internal financial and management controls to reduce improper payments. DHS's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 50 locations in the Washington, DC area, a legacy of its rapid assembly from 22 federal agencies. Considerations for control standards compliance, penalties for noncompliance, and potential adjustments to standards for unique DHS programs are important. For more information, refer to CRS Report R42753 on DHS Headquarters Consolidation Project. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is working to consolidate its headquarters spread across the National Capital region to improve efficiency and reduce costs. A $3.4 billion master plan has been approved to create a new DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeth's in Anacostia, with $1.4 billion funded through DHS budget and $2 billion through GSA. Phase 1A of the project, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, has been completed with funding provided by Congress. The construction of the new DHS headquarters at St. Elizabeth's in Anacostia is projected to be completed in FY2026 at a cost of $4.5 billion, with over $530 million in projected savings compared to leasing over the next 30 years. Despite delays in funding, the project is still expected to be cost-effective. The Department of Homeland Security's consolidation plans and funding prospects could be affected by legislative action in the 113th Congress. Human resource management is a key consideration for DHS, overseen by the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer. The OCHCO supports the department's Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2012-2016. The current chief human capital officer at the Department of Homeland Security, appointed in 2011, is the first career member of the Senior Executive Service in that role. Oversight of personnel issues by Congress includes recruitment, diversity, and morale concerns. DHS faces challenges in developing a skilled workforce, particularly in cybersecurity, as recommended by the Cyberskills Task Force in 2012. The Security Advisory Council recommended building a team of 600 employees with cybersecurity skills critical to the DHS mission. They also suggested establishing a DHS Cyber Reserve Program to ensure availability of cybersecurity experts in times of need. The Secretary of Homeland Security accepted these recommendations, emphasizing the importance of professional certification, training programs, and a Cyber Surge Capacity Force composed of certified cybersecurity professionals from the private sector. DHS is seeking legislative authority to expedite hiring and provide higher compensation for cyber-skilled employees. Initiatives have been launched to develop the cybersecurity workforce, including the establishment of a Secretary's Honors Program. In 2012, the Homeland Security Secretary announced the Secretary's Honors Program (SHP) to recruit recent graduates for careers in DHS. The program offers one-year or two-year fellowships in various fields such as information technology, cybersecurity, policy, management, emergency management, and law. Participants will undergo rotations, mentoring, training, and professional development programs. Successful completion may lead to permanent employment within the department. Additionally, in 2013, DHS launched the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) as an online resource for cybersecurity career, education, and training information. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborates with various government agencies and organizations to address cybersecurity knowledge needs. In 2013, they initiated the SHP Cyber Student Initiative to engage community college students in cybersecurity-related fields through unpaid volunteer positions at a forensics lab. The department aims to increase diversity in the workforce, especially at senior levels. The Department of Homeland Security aims to increase diversity in the workforce, particularly at senior levels. A senior-level steering committee will lead efforts to improve diversity, but specific details are lacking. Data from the Office of Personnel Management show that 41.9% of DHS's civilian workforce are classified as minority, with various ethnic and racial groups represented. The Office of Personnel Management reported that the Department of Homeland Security had 24 employees on the senior-level pay schedule, with none classified as minority. Among the 610 employees on the Senior Executive Service pay schedule, 20% were minority, including 2.1% Asian, 9.7% Black/African American, and 4.7% Hispanic/Latino. Women made up 33% of the department's workforce, with 25% on the SL pay schedule and 28.4% on the SES pay schedule. The department plans to implement an exit survey to assess employee attrition and its impact on workforce diversity. The Department of Homeland Security is focusing on improving diversity and morale among employees through initiatives like improved communication, training, and leadership. Specific details about the Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan are not publicly available. Results from the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey are being used to assess employee attrition and its impact on diversity in the workforce. The Department of Homeland Security has consistently low morale, as shown in the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey conducted by OPM. The most recent survey results from November 21, 2012, revealed a decline in the department's ratings across various key indices compared to the 2011 survey. Rankings for Leadership and Knowledge Management, Results-Oriented Performance Culture, Talent Management, and Job Satisfaction were all lower in 2012. Additionally, a May 2013 report ranked DHS last among seventeen large agencies in terms of innovation based on the Employee Viewpoint Survey results. The Department of Homeland Security ranked last in innovation among seventeen large agencies, with an innovation score of 52.7%. The United States Coast Guard, the highest placed DHS component, had an innovation score of 67.2%. Congress may require DHS to provide updates on its initiatives during budget hearings. The Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer could provide detailed information on the OCHCO webpage, including specific plans like the Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. Congress may be interested in examining the department's procedures for exit interviews and any established procedures to consider the results. The Department of Homeland Security spent $4.8 billion in FY2003 and $12.4 billion in FY2012 on procurement, ranking sixth among federal agencies. The federal acquisition workforce, including DHS, has shortcomings in size, skills, and experience. DHS needs to engage in long-term strategic workforce planning to address these issues. The Department of Homeland Security is taking positive steps in long-term strategic workforce planning, including the development of a Procurement Staffing Model and a strategic plan for its acquisition function. The staffing model aims to provide optimal personnel for contract administration, while the strategic plan includes initiatives to improve the quality of the contracting workforce and promote employee retention. DHS is also examining the balance between federal employees and contractors as part of an efficiency review. The Department of Homeland Security is focusing on achieving a proper balance between federal and contractor employees through a strategic workforce planning process. This includes complying with regulations, determining the right mix of employees, and reducing mission risk while controlling costs. The department's Balanced Workforce Program Management Office leads this effort, which involves analyzing work and making sourcing decisions. This raises questions for the 113th Congress about the department's acquisition workforce funding. The Department of Homeland Security is focusing on achieving a proper balance between federal and contractor employees through a strategic workforce planning process. This includes analyzing work and making sourcing decisions to ensure the optimal numbers of acquisition staff needed for procurements. Questions arise about funding, impact on acquisition tasks, and identifying contractor employees performing inherently governmental functions. The department's efforts to achieve a balanced workforce may affect contractors and contracts. Selected Issues for Congress include the differing visions of the Administration and Congress regarding successful R&D performance in DHS, marked differences in funding requests and appropriations, unmet expectations on agency performance, and the need to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of investments in homeland security research and development. The 113th Congress may focus on determining appropriate rewards for R&D investments, balancing investments among homeland security topics, and establishing the appropriate funding level for DHS R&D. The DHS homeland security R&D activities aim to meet the needs of various stakeholders, including DHS component agencies and first responders. There are debates on how to maximize effectiveness, with some advocating for increased research funding for technology breakthroughs, while others suggest focusing on technology development to convert prototypes into procurable technologies. Some stakeholders recommend rebalancing investment towards long-term research to avoid a lack of research outcomes for prototypes. Others propose a high-risk, high-reward strategy like DARPA for \"leap-ahead\" advances in homeland security. The DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology faces challenges in coordinating R&D activities without a federal strategy, and DHS lacks a clear definition for R&D. The GAO has identified that DHS lacks a clear definition for R&D, which hinders coordination and investment. Congress may oversee new strategic approaches to address these concerns and set performance milestones. There have been discussions about reorganizing DHS R&D activities, including transferring activities from DNDO to the S&T Directorate, which was not approved by Congress. The Senate directed DHS to consider merging the Office of Health Affairs and DNDO, potentially transferring portions to other DHS components. The proposed merger and R&D reprioritization efforts could impact DHS R&D activities, which have been criticized for low productivity. Some stakeholders believe S&T Directorate R&D efforts have value, but congressional appropriations for S&T Directorate have fluctuated, indicating dissatisfaction with the slow rate of return on investments."
