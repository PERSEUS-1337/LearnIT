    "content": "Subject matter jurisdiction over criminal offenses is typically based on the location where the offense occurs, but some federal statutes have extraterritorial application. Congress has increasingly included statements of extraterritorial jurisdiction in criminal statutes, with proposals in the 109th Congress creating new crimes with overseas elements or stating overseas application for existing crimes. Some federal criminal laws have overseas application, creating new crimes with specific circumstances for application abroad. Early federal crimes included offenses committed beyond the United States, such as treason, murder, manslaughter, maiming, and larceny within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction. The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States extends to certain areas and ships, including crimes committed by or against Americans. Federal law criminalizes various offenses within this jurisdiction, such as murder, assault, kidnapping, and theft. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act prohibits misconduct outside the U.S. by certain individuals. The Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act prohibits misconduct committed outside the U.S. by certain individuals, including members of the U.S. armed forces. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal statutes can have extraterritorial application if necessary to fulfill Congress's intent. The Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act prohibits misconduct committed outside the U.S. by certain individuals, including members of the U.S. armed forces. Federal criminal statutes may be applied extraterritorially if they have the anticipated impact within the United States. Lower federal courts have concluded that Congress intends questions of overseas application of federal criminal law to be resolved consistent with international law principles. The Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act allows for the prosecution of misconduct outside the U.S. based on certain principles, including territorial, nationality, passive personality, protective, and universal. Lower federal courts interpret these principles to extend criminal jurisdiction to various statutes protecting federal interests abroad. The Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act allows for prosecution of misconduct outside the U.S. based on principles like territorial, nationality, passive personality, protective, and universal. Lower federal courts extend criminal jurisdiction to statutes protecting federal interests abroad, including cases involving fraud, false statements, theft, drug trafficking, sabotage plots, and counterfeiting of federal documents or checks overseas by Americans or aliens. In contemporary cases, courts often refer to the Restatement for a different formulation of extraterritorial principles and factors to determine their application. Congressional intent can override presumptions of domestic application and consistency with international law. Sometimes Congress declares federal extraterritorial jurisdiction over offenses committed outside the U.S. Extraterritorial jurisdiction principles include crimes occurring partially in the US, involving American offenders or victims, related to national security, universally condemned, or covered by treaties. Proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to amend alien smuggling laws. The 109th Congress proposed amendments to alien smuggling laws, adding a statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction to section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Bills included S. 2611, H.R. 4437, S. 2377, S. 2368, and S. 2454. Courts may interpret the statute to have extraterritorial application without a specific statement, as smuggling aliens into the US impacts the country. The extraterritorial jurisdiction of certain laws, such as the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act, extends to activities impacting the United States. This includes outlawing the purchase or receipt of fraudulently obtained telephone records in interstate or foreign commerce. The legislation focuses on telecommunications carriers and providers of IP-enabled voice services within the United States. The federal wiretap law, 18 U.S.C. 2510-2522, does not have extraterritorial application without an express statement. However, the proposed prohibition could apply overseas if the offender is American or the records relate to services in the United States. Two bills, the War Profiteering Prevention Act and the Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting Act, also address fraud by government contractors. The Honest Leadership and Accountability in Contracting Act proposed extraterritorial jurisdiction over government contractor schemes to defraud the United States, but the intended reach of the prohibitions is unclear. The bill also aimed to outlaw price gouging and deception without specifying a nexus to the United States. The proposed general statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction would allow prosecution when the offense involves the United States, regardless of the victim. This includes cases where the offense was committed in part within the United States, by an American, or against the United States. Congress often specifies extraterritorial jurisdiction for particular offenses under designated circumstances. For example, 50 U.S.C. 424 grants jurisdiction over certain offenses committed outside the United States by a U.S. citizen or alien. In the context of extraterritorial jurisdiction, Congress specifies factors such as citizenship status to determine applicability of laws. Immigration reform proposals in the 109th Congress exemplified this approach by rewriting laws related to passport and visa offenses. The proposed Act (S. 2454) would amend laws related to passport and visa offenses, including adding a new section for extraterritorial application. Offenses committed outside the US involving immigration documents, foreign commerce, national security, or facilitating terrorism or drug crimes would be punished under this chapter. The proposed Act (S. 2454) aims to amend laws related to passport and visa offenses, including adding a new section for extraterritorial application. It targets offenses committed outside the US involving immigration documents, foreign commerce, national security, or facilitating terrorism or drug crimes. The specific jurisdictional circumstances in the proposed inventory reflect conditions under which courts have approved extraterritorial application. Proposed section 1551(b)(1) would ground extraterritorial jurisdiction on the involvement of a U.S. immigration document in fraud or other offenses. The proposed amendments to 18 U.S.C. ch.75 would outlaw offenses involving foreign passports and U.S. passports, potentially limiting extraterritorial jurisdiction. Proposed section 1551(b) would restrict overseas application by specifying grounds for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Proposed section 1551(b)(2) would allow extraterritorial jurisdiction over offenses affecting foreign commerce of the United States, with broad legislative authority. Lower federal courts have suggested minimal impact on interstate commerce is sufficient for prosecution. The section could potentially allow prosecution of a foreign national using a forged foreign passport on a cruise ship with American passengers. The courts have upheld jurisdictional claims in cases where illicit activity in a foreign commercial environment had a substantial effect in the United States. In cases like United States v. Clark and United States v. Yousef, statutes were applied to Americans engaging in misconduct overseas, showing that extraterritorial jurisdiction can be enforced in certain circumstances. Proposed sections 1551(b)(3) and (4) aimed to influence U.S. governmental policy based on national security interests. Section 1551(b)(5) would apply when the offender is American, a recognized basis for extraterritorial jurisdiction. Section 1551(b)(6) would cover stateless persons habitually residing in the U.S., aligning with other criminal statutes for extraterritorial application. For example, the narco-terrorism offense in 21 U.S.C. 960A targets overseas drug trafficking for the benefit of the United States. The PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act prohibits overseas drug trafficking for the benefit of a foreign terrorist organization, with extraterritorial jurisdiction if the offense violates US laws, affects interstate or foreign commerce, involves providing support for a terrorist offense causing harm to US nationals or property, or occurs partially outside the US. The PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act prohibits overseas drug trafficking for the benefit of a foreign terrorist organization, with extraterritorial jurisdiction if the offense violates US laws and involves a perpetrator who is a US national or legal entity. The act also applies if an offender is brought into or found in the US, even if the offense occurred outside the country. The PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act prohibits overseas drug trafficking for the benefit of a foreign terrorist organization, with extraterritorial jurisdiction if the offense violates US laws and involves a perpetrator who is a US national or legal entity. Section 960A(b)(2) of the act applies if either the drug trafficking or terrorism offense affects US interstate or foreign commerce. This provision broadens jurisdiction, especially in cases where the offense has a significant impact on US commerce. The court in Yousef justified jurisdiction based on the impact on commerce, stating that terrorism does not allow for universal jurisdiction but can be justified in specific cases. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act provides extraterritorial jurisdiction for narco-terrorism offenses based on specific jurisdictional factors, such as the nationality of the offender or victim. This is consistent with principles like nationality, passive personality, territorial, and protective principles. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act hold accountable individuals employed by or accompanying the federal government or armed forces overseas for committing certain offenses. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act covers special maritime and territorial felonies, while H.R. 5212 aimed to expand its scope to include sexual offenses. The special maritime and territorial jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. 7(9) applies to offenses committed by Americans on overseas federal installations or in the residences of personnel assigned to such facilities. 18 U.S.C. 3271 focuses on peonage and sexual transportation offenses committed overseas by foreign nationals employed by federal entities other than the U.S. armed forces, or by Americans in locations other than federal facilities or related residences. The Federal Contractor Extraterritorial Jurisdiction for Human Trafficking Offenses Act aimed to add jurisdiction over peonage offenses committed overseas by foreign nationals working for federal entities, and by Americans in locations other than federal facilities. The proposed legislation aimed to extend extraterritorial jurisdiction in money laundering cases to include cases involving more than $10,000 and either a United States citizen, conduct occurring in part within the United States, or conduct having an effect in the United States. The statements of extraterritorial jurisdiction are often integrated into the elements of the offense rather than presented separately. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act introduces new transportation offenses related to terrorism. One offense involves knowingly transporting explosives or dangerous materials on the high seas or with United States nationality for terrorist activities. Another offense covers transporting individuals to or from terrorist acts with similar conditions. The materials covered include biological weapons, chemical weapons, and nuclear materials. The United States is a party to international treaties on biological weapons, chemical weapons, and nuclear materials, with criminal statutes providing for extraterritorial jurisdiction. For biological weapons, jurisdiction exists if the offender or victim is American; for chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction, it exists if the offense is against federal property; for nuclear material offenses, it exists if the offender is later found in the United States. The extraterritorial jurisdiction for terrorism offenses varies in detail. The offenses under sections 2283 and 2284 have extraterritorial jurisdiction based on a jurisdictional element, precluding jurisdiction on any other basis."
