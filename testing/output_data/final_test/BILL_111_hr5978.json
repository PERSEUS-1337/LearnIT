    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business Tax Relief and Retirement Restoration Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges the importance of small businesses to the US economy and notes the challenges they face in accessing credit during the recession. Data shows a significant decline in lending to small businesses in 2009. Many small business owners have had to use personal assets, like retirement savings, to keep their businesses afloat, helping to prevent further job losses. During the current recession, a temporary suspension of penalties for loans from retirement accounts can aid small businesses and inject funds into the economy. Loans from individual retirement plans can be used for certain small business expenses. Loans from individual retirement plans can be used for certain small business expenses, with a temporary exception for qualified small business loans. This exception allows for loans from an individual retirement plan to be used for small business expenses without certain tax implications. A small business loan is a loan used for purchasing property or for salaries and wages in a trade or business, subject to depreciation or used in the business. The taxpayer can elect to aggregate all loans for determining if they qualify as small business loans, with a requirement that the loan be repaid within 5 years. A qualified small business loan must be repaid within 5 years, following rules similar to section 72(p)(2)(C) for level amortization. Failure to repay is treated as a distribution from the individual retirement plan. The amendments made by this section apply to loans made after December 31, 2007. Distributions made after December 31, 2007, and before the date of enactment can be elected for repayment. If a distribution is elected for repayment in the taxable year of distribution, it will be treated as a loan under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as long as it does not exceed a certain amount and meets specific requirements within one year of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. Qualified small business loans from qualified employer plan. Section 4 introduces qualified small business loans from qualified employer plans, with a special rule outlined in subsection (p) of section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This rule allows taxpayers to elect to exclude qualified small business loans from certain limitations, only applying to loans received after the enactment date. The amendments made by this section apply to loans made after December 31, 2007. Any distribution made after December 31, 2007, and before the enactment of this Act can be treated as a loan if the taxpayer elects to do so. The distribution can be treated as a loan under certain conditions, not subject to specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code, if it does not exceed a certain amount and meets specific requirements within a year of the enactment of the Act."
