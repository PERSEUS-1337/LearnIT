    "content": "The report addresses the funding needed for the sustainment and modernization of the aging B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers. These aircraft, which are around 50, 28, and 20 years old respectively, are in need of continued support. The Air Force is working on a new Long-Range Strike-Bomber, but it won't be ready for flight-testing until the mid-2020s. The U.S. Air Force's B-52Hs, B-1Bs, and B-2As need sustainment and modernization funding to remain credible weapon systems until the new Long-Range Strike-Bomber is fielded in the 2030 timeframe. The legacy bomber force must meet national security objectives against advanced adversaries with A2/AD systems. The U.S. bomber fleet requires sustainment and modernization funding to address aging airframes, engines, and electronic components. Potential adversaries with advanced A2/AD systems pose challenges for bombers to reach their targets, limiting their effectiveness, especially against heavily fortified locations like North Korea and Iran. The U.S. Air Force's bomber fleet needs upgrades to counter A2/AD threats from countries like North Korea and Iran. Congressional oversight is crucial for funding sustainment and modernization efforts, separate from the development of the proposed LRS-B. This has been a legislative focus since the 1990s. The Air Force's bomber fleet requires upgrades to counter A2/AD threats from countries like North Korea and Iran. Congressional decisions on funding for bomber sustainment and modernization could impact the nation's long-range strike capabilities and the U.S. aerospace industry. Key issues include whether to provide funding for B-52H, B-1B, and B-2A bombers and the potential shortfall in long-range strike capabilities if funding is minimized. The Air Force's bomber fleet needs upgrades to counter A2/AD threats. Congressional decisions on funding for bomber sustainment and modernization could impact long-range strike capabilities and the aerospace industry. Congress may need to assess if current bomber plans will meet long-range strike requirements until the LRS-B is operational and if the planned LRS-Bs will replace capabilities lost as legacy bombers retire in the 2030s. This could also affect potential base realignment decisions and the U.S. aircraft manufacturing base. The Air Force's focus on bomber sustainment and Congress's decisions could impact future national defense strategies and U.S. long-range strike capabilities. The Obama Administration's 2012 shift in national security strategy towards the Asia-Pacific region has implications for America's bomber force due to China's military capabilities and assertiveness in disputed territories. This rebalance has increased emphasis on U.S. naval forces in the Pacific theater, but budget pressures may impact long-term naval procurement plans. Defense cuts may impact long-term naval procurement plans and force levels in the Pacific region. The U.S. Air Force may rely on B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s to complement naval forces in the Asia-Pacific. The new defense strategy also emphasizes the Middle East and U.S. defense commitments to European allies, posing challenges due to budget constraints from the Budget Control Act of 2011. Defense cuts totaling $55 billion over nine years from FY2013 to FY2021 could lead to an 18% reduction in bomber flying hours and sustainment efforts, affecting aircraft availability and mission capable rates. Some analysts doubt if U.S. force levels will be adequate for priorities in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Europe. However, historical examples show that the current bomber force can balance national security priorities across different regions. B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s have maintained a continuous presence in the Pacific while participating in combat operations in the Middle East since 2003. The USAF bomber force has demonstrated its ability to fight wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan while also being able to respond to potential crises in the Asia-Pacific. The Administration's strategic guidance prioritizes reaffirming U.S. commitment to allies in the Asia-Pacific region and ensuring access to global commons for economic prosperity. The U.S. commitment to forward-deployed diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region includes strengthening security alliances, maintaining a broad-based military presence, and utilizing bombers for rotational deployments and training exercises to reaffirm commitments to allies. The visible presence of U.S. bombers in training exercises abroad reinforces U.S. commitment to deterrence against potential adversaries in the region and increases U.S. influence economically. Access to the South China Sea is crucial for the economy of North America and East Asia, with a significant amount of global shipping passing through annually. Any disruption to this maritime route could impact the security and political stability of countries dependent on it. The potential restriction of access to the South China Sea and the Malacca Straits could impact the security, stability, and prosperity of the United States and its allies in the region. Long-range bombers could help maintain situational awareness and respond quickly to hostile actions in the Asia-Pacific region. The location within the theater allows bombers to reach anywhere in the Asia-Pacific quickly with a variety of weapons, providing a viable option for responding to threats to U.S. interests and commitments to allies. The Administration's strategic guidance emphasizes the need for the military to recalibrate its capabilities and make selective investments to achieve national security objectives. Arguments for or against funding bomber modernization should consider the upgrades' cost/benefit analysis and their contribution to accomplishing U.S. forces' expected missions as outlined in the DOD's strategic guidance. These missions include counterterrorism, irregular warfare, deterrence, and defeat. The nation's bombers play a crucial role in various missions such as counterterrorism, deterrence, and maintaining a nuclear deterrent. Despite their historical contributions, modern threat capabilities are surpassing their 20th-century abilities. The B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers are at risk of becoming ineffective against modern threats without critical modernization and sustainment funding. The U.S. military is shifting focus to the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to rotate B-1 bombers to augment B-52s already stationed there as part of the Continuous Bomber Presence strategy. The Continuous Bomber Presence (CBP) based at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, ensures U.S. security commitments in the Pacific by deploying bombers capable of reaching anywhere in the USPACOM's area of responsibility with various weapons. This strategy reassures allies and deters potential adversaries, such as China, by signaling that no naval vessel can patrol the South China Sea without being within reach of land-based bombers. Former Pacific Air Forces commander General Gary L. North highlighted China's ambitions to extend their power to the second island chain, potentially limiting other nations' freedom of movement in the region. The CBP, based at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, deploys bombers capable of reaching anywhere in USPACOM's area of responsibility with various weapons. This strategy reassures allies and deters potential adversaries, such as China, by preventing other nations' freedom of movement at great range. Air Force Global Strike Command announced B-2s will begin regular worldwide training deployments to combatant commands' areas of responsibility starting in 2013, rotating to forward operating locations for short periods in various regions. The U.S. Air Force conducts worldwide training deployments with bomber forces to demonstrate commitment to allies and deter potential adversaries. This \"forward deployed diplomacy\" aims to influence the Asia-Pacific region and counter rising threats like North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. South Korea invests heavily in defense, Japan aims to increase regional influence through military aid and alliances, and India is the largest weapons importer. These efforts are in response to North Korea's missile and nuclear threats. India, the second-fastest-growing economy, became the world's largest weapons importer in March 2011. With plans to spend up to $80 billion on military modernization by 2015, India is seen as close to achieving military superpower status. Indonesia is also strengthening its military with a $16.7 billion budget, including investments in frigates, submarines, and fighter jets. Taiwan, falling behind China's military buildup, tested a new anti-ship missile in 2012. The proliferation of A2/AD weapon systems in the Asia-Pacific region poses a significant challenge to naval vessels in the Taiwan Straits. The future of U.S. influence in the region could be impacted by these capabilities, regardless of who possesses them. CBP rotations and B-2 deployments are crucial for projecting military power in the Asia-Pacific, but military modernization efforts must keep pace with evolving A2/AD capabilities. The strategic and military landscape of the region in 20 or 30 years is uncertain due to the emphasis on military modernization by major states. The future strategic and military landscape of the Asia-Pacific region in 20 or 30 years is uncertain due to the rising prevalence of 21st-century anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats. A2/AD refers to adversary actions and capabilities designed to restrict access to operational areas, posing a challenge to meeting the goals of the Administration's new strategy. The rising prevalence of 21st-century anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) threats includes long-range weapons like ballistic and cruise missiles, integrated air defense systems, and cyber warfare capabilities. These threats challenge the U.S. military's power projection capabilities in key strategic areas like the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. The U.S. military addresses the A2/AD challenge in its Joint Operational Access Concept (JOAC), focusing on cross-domain synergy to counter the emerging threat. The Air Force and Navy utilize cross-domain synergy to enhance military operations and counter A2/AD threats. The Air-Sea Battle Concept aims for interoperability between air and naval forces to disrupt adversary capabilities. Modernization efforts for the bomber force should equip them to operate in denied regions of the A2/AD environment. In the 21st century A2/AD environment, adversaries aim to establish extreme-risk zones to deny advantages to U.S. forces. The B-2 bomber, with its stealth and self-defense capabilities, is the most capable aircraft to operate in extreme-risk zones. In high-risk zones, U.S. high-signature forces require significant defense support to be effective. The B-2 bomber is also the most capable aircraft to operate in high-risk zones. In high-risk zones, the B-2 bomber is the most capable aircraft due to its stealth and self-defense capabilities. In low-risk zones, the B-1 and B-52 bombers can operate freely, utilizing their long-range standoff cruise missiles. The Air-Sea Battle Concept combines high-signature forces like the B-1 and B-52 with low-signature forces like the F-22 fighter to enhance effectiveness and compensate for vulnerabilities. The Air Force's legacy bombers may struggle in A2/AD environments without modern systems and weapons. Maintaining a safe nuclear deterrent is a primary mission for the U.S. Armed Forces, in line with DOD's strategic guidance and the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review reaffirmed the importance of the B-52 and B-2 bombers in achieving the nuclear deterrent mission. Proponents argue for retaining and modernizing nuclear-capable B-52 and B-2 bombers for three main reasons: providing a rapid hedge against technical challenges and geopolitical uncertainties, ensuring extended deterrence for U.S. allies, and addressing delays and uncertainties with the new LRS-B bomber's nuclear capability. The new LRS-B will have nuclear capability but will operate initially as a conventional strike aircraft. General Schwartz suggested deferring nuclear certification until B-52 and B-2 retire to manage costs. However, the 2013 Defense Authorization Act mandates the LRS-B to be capable of carrying strategic nuclear weapons upon achieving initial operating capability. It is uncertain if B-52 and B-2 will remain the only air-delivery option for maintaining air-delivered nuclear capability. The 2010 QDR and NPR discuss the uncertainty of whether the B-52 and B-2 will be the only air-delivery options for the U.S. nuclear arsenal until the 2030s or if the LRS-B will start filling that role in the late 2020s. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (NST) aims to reduce and limit ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers. The treaty sets limits on deployed ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers, as well as deployed and non-deployed launchers. The U.S. retains the right to determine its nuclear arsenal composition. The New START treaty drives the United States to convert nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to a conventional-only role. Air Force Global Strike Command recommended a preferred course of action for bomber sustainment and modernization. The configuration of B-2 force numbers remains unchanged. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Global Strategic Affairs emphasized the need for bomber sustainment and modernization in implementing the New START Treaty. The United States will maintain aging B-52H and B-2A strategic bomber wings, requiring funding for sustainment and modernization to ensure operational effectiveness. Upgrades include survivable communications, modern flight control systems, and radar. The existing bomber fleet consists of 76 B-52H bombers, 63 B-1B bombers, and 20 B-2 stealth bombers. The B-52 is the USAF's only nuclear bomber capable of employing long-range standoff weapons. It first entered service in 1955 and has been modernized to sustain operations until 2040. 76 B-52H models remain in service today at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, and Minot AFB, North Dakota. The B-52H program faces challenges in sustaining combat effectiveness against adversaries until retirement and modernizing effectively. The B-52's strengths include diverse capabilities, precision, large payload, and long range, but mission effectiveness may erode without adaptation to 21st-century threats. Sustainment and modernization initiatives are being considered for the program. The B-52 sustainment and modernization initiatives in the program of record include CONECT, Military-standard-1760 modernization, trainer upgrades, Arms control activities, Mode S/5 IFF, low cost modifications, anti-skid replacement, research development efforts, IWBU upgrade, and budget submissions for procurement and programs. The B-1B Lancer, developed by Rockwell International (now Boeing Defense and Space Group), became operational in 1986 as a low-altitude supersonic bomber. Initially designed for the Cold War, its features made it less vulnerable than the B-52 to enemy threats. After the Cold War, the Air Force transitioned the B-1B to conventional-only weapons capability through the Conventional Mission Upgrade Program (CMUP), equipping it with GPS-guided JDAMs and long-range standoff missiles. The B-1B bomber has a large internal payload capacity and operates from Dyess AFB, Texas, and Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. It faces challenges with original equipment reliability and is undergoing sustainment and modernization initiatives to maintain mission effectiveness against 21st-century threats. The B-1B bomber is undergoing sustainment and modernization efforts to maintain mission effectiveness against 21st-century threats. The Strategic Action and Investment Plan (SAIP) outlines various upgrades and replacements for the aircraft, including digital control loading, radar improvements, and gyro stabilization system replacement. The FY2013 budget submission details procurement and research programs for the B-1. The B-2A bomber is a long-range, low observable bomber used by the U.S. Air Force for conventional and nuclear missions. It entered service in 1993, with 20 aircraft currently in operation. Originally planned for 132 aircraft, the number was reduced to 20 due to budget cuts and accidents. The B-2A bomber, with a current fleet of 20 aircraft, has limited payload weight compared to other bombers. Upgrades have enhanced its stealth, weapons options, and avionics. However, parts obsolescence and manufacturing challenges are affecting its capabilities. Concerns about survivability against modern threats have arisen, with a projected service-life goal of 2058. Sustainment and modernization initiatives are underway to address these issues. The B-2 bomber is undergoing various sustainment and modernization efforts, including upgrades such as EHF SATCOM, computer upgrades, radar modernization, and defensive system enhancements. These initiatives aim to address parts obsolescence and improve the aircraft's capabilities against modern threats. The FY2013 budget submission for B-2 procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation programs highlights the need to sustain and modernize the aging bomber fleet to maintain long-range strike capabilities. The Obama Administration's strategic guidance emphasizes the importance of a deep strike capability in the face of A2/AD threats. Under the New START treaty, nuclear-capable heavy bombers could make up one-third of the U.S. nuclear triad. The potential for a shortfall in long-range strike capabilities exists due to budget constraints and changing defense strategies. The focus is on the capability of the bomber force rather than just the number of legacy bombers in service. The focus is on the capability of the legacy bomber force to meet national security challenges posed by potential A2/AD-equipped adversaries. Analysts suggest the Navy's aircraft carrier as a flexible alternative for long-range strike needs. The limited fuel capacity of naval fighters restricts their ability to penetrate deep into enemy territory without Air Force tanker support. Carrier-based aircraft have limited weapons load out capability, potentially requiring multiple aircraft for a single target. Concerns exist over the carrier's survivability in an A2/AD environment, where anti-ship weapons could be used to deny power projection. Potential threats such as submarines, China's SS-N-22, SS-N-27, and DF-21D, and Iranian small-boat swarm tactics could push carrier task forces further out to sea, increasing the range for naval aviation. While aircraft carriers are crucial for U.S. long-range strike capabilities, they complement rather than replace long-range bombers. Congress may need to assess the feasibility and affordability of Air Force bomber sustainment and modernization programs until the LRS-B is operational. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 111-383) requested a report on the cost, schedule, and performance of modernizing the B-1, B-2, and B-52 bomber fleets. The report, submitted to Congress in September 2011, is also included in Air Force Global Strike Command's and Air Combat Command's master plan documents for each platform. These plans outline strategic vision, requirements, and capability needs to meet national security objectives. The 2012 updates to the plans for modernizing the B-1, B-2, and B-52 bomber fleets consider President Obama's Asia-Pacific rebalance and DOD strategic direction. Without sufficient funding, the survivability of each weapon system is at risk against 21st-century A2/AD threats. The DOD faces the challenge of reducing defense spending by $487 billion over the next 10 years while needing to modernize aging capabilities to address modern threats. Appendices provide summaries of each bomber's sustainment and modernization master plans. The DOD and Air Force plan to modernize the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers to address modern threats, ensuring long-range strike capabilities through the 2030s. The development of the Long-Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) is underway to achieve initial capability in the mid-2020s with a focus on cost-effective production and sustainability. Upgrades to the B-2 bomber are also planned. The Air Force plans to modernize its bomber fleet, including upgrades to the B-2 bomber and modernization of the B-52 fleet. Legacy bomber modernization is a priority to address rising A2/AD threats and ensure global strike capabilities for crisis response and escalation control options. The U.S. Air Force is modernizing its bomber fleet to address evolving threats and maintain global strike capabilities. This includes upgrading the B-2 fleet with an improved Defensive Management System (DMS) to enhance long-range strike capabilities. The U.S. Air Force is investing in modernizing its bomber fleet to maintain global strike capabilities. This includes upgrading the B-2 fleet with improved Defensive Management System (DMS) and increasing precision guided weapon capacity in the B-52 fleet. Additionally, $191.4 million is being invested in modernizing the B-1 to prevent obsolescence and sustain it until approximately 2040. The FY2013 Budget Request funds compliance activities and force reduction options to meet the central limits of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The Air Force is modernizing its bomber fleet to meet treaty limits, including converting B-52Hs to conventional-only capability and developing the LRS-B. The FY2013 Budget Request includes upgrades to the B-1 fleet, such as VSDU, CITS, and FIDL, to address obsolescence and enhance communications. Flight and maintenance training devices are also being upgraded for sustainability. The Air Force is modernizing its bomber fleet with upgrades to flight and maintenance training devices for sustainability. Congress may need to reevaluate acquisition plans for the LRS-B to ensure a sufficient backfill of long-range strike capabilities. Balancing modernization and sustainment efforts for legacy bombers while phasing them out is crucial to minimize any potential capability gap. The Air Force is modernizing its bomber fleet with upgrades to flight and maintenance training devices for sustainability. Congress will determine the final number of LRS-Bs produced, with current plans for 80-100 aircraft. Historically, the actual number of combat aircraft produced has often been lower than initially planned due to various factors. The original plan for acquiring 132 B-2 stealth bombers was reduced to 21 after the program was canceled in 1991. The Air Force initially aimed for 381 F-22 fighters but only built 195 due to high costs and the development of the F-35. Currently, the Air Force plans to acquire 1,763 F-35 Lightning II fighters, with potential adjustments due to defense spending cuts. Acquisition of fewer than 80-100 LRS-Bs will impact modernization decisions for the bomber fleet. The Air Force's oversight issue for Congress will be whether to delay development of the LRS-B given sufficient funding for legacy bomber sustainment and modernization. The B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers are receiving meticulous care to ensure their extended service life goals are met. The Air Force is working to ensure the extended service life goals of the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers are met. Analysts suggest that the development of the LRS-B could be further delayed based on the legacy bombers' combat capability in the face of advancing A2/AD defenses. The B-2 is currently the only bomber expected to penetrate tough air defenses, but even its ability may decline in the future. The Air Force plans to upgrade all three bombers with new systems and weapons as the B-2's ability to penetrate tough air defenses may decline in the future. Lieutenant General Christopher D. Miller emphasizes the need to replace aging B-52 and B-1 bomber inventories due to increasing risks from modernizing air defenses. Congress must consider funding specific legacy bomber sustainment and modernization efforts while also prioritizing the development of the LRS-B to meet evolving A2/AD capabilities. Legacy bomber sustainment and modernization efforts are crucial for the Air Force, especially in light of the need to fund the development of the LRS-B. Congress also needs to address the modernization and development of weapons for legacy bombers operating in different threat environments. This includes the B-52's AGM-86B/C Air Launched Cruise Missile service life extension program and the development of a new Advanced Cruise Missile. Madelyn Creedon testified in June 2012 about the need for a new Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) due to the increasing risk to bomber stand-off missions from modern air defenses. The Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) missile is being developed as a replacement, with a final report expected in late 2012. The existing AGM-86B/C ALCM is undergoing a service life extension program to sustain it until the LRSO is fielded in the 2020s. $887.6 million has been allocated for the development of the new Advanced Cruise Missile. The Air Force allocated $887.6 million from FY2011 to FY2016 for the development of a new Advanced Cruise Missile to replace the AGM-86 ALCMs. Funds were transferred to \"Nuclear Modernization\" in FY2012 to find solutions for replacing the AGM-86. The B-52 and B-1 are enhancing their capabilities with the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) and MALD-J to operate in high-risk environments. The MALD and MALD-J act as decoys against enemy air defense systems, with the MALD-J also incorporating jamming capabilities. The B-52 is the initial platform for this program and is currently undergoing operational testing. The B-1 community is exploring further integration of MALD and MALD-J on the B-1 bomber. Continued acquisition of the AGM-158A Joint Air-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and the AGM-158B JASSM-ER, along with the development of the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), is crucial for future A2/AD environments. The JASSM is a long-range, precision-guided cruise missile with plans to procure 4,900 missiles at an estimated cost of $6.1 billion. Additionally, DARPA is partnering with Lockheed on advanced research projects. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in partnership with Lockheed Martin, is developing the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) in response to a 2008 urgent operational needs statement from the U.S. Pacific Fleet. LRASM features a datalink for target updates and anti-radiation homing capability. It is based on the AGM-158B JASSM with a range of 500 nautical miles. Lockheed Martin and the Air Force plan to test-fire three LRASM missiles in 2013 from the B-1B bomber. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Lockheed Martin are developing the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) with target updates and anti-radiation homing capability. The potential implications of reduced bomber sustainment and modernization on future rounds of base realignment and closure (BRAC) efforts are being considered. The legacy bomber force is shrinking, with only 76 B-52Hs stationed at two bases and 63 B-1s stationed at various bases. BRAC closures or realignments may be considered as early as 2015. The B-1 bomber fleet has decreased from 100 aircraft in the 1980s to 63 currently stationed at Dyess AFB, Texas, and Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. There is excess capacity at these bases to accommodate the entire B-52 fleet at Barksdale or Minot and the B-1 fleet at Dyess or Ellsworth. Retiring airframes to fund sustainment and upgrades may lead to consolidation at one base for cost feasibility. Ellsworth AFB survived the 2005 BRAC despite recommendations to consolidate the B-1 fleet at Dyess AFB. The B-1 fleet is consolidated at Dyess AFB in Texas, with an estimated economic impact of $278 million on the local community. No BRAC actions were taken for Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB in 2005. The idea of retiring Minot's 150 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles was rejected. All 20 B-2 bombers are stationed at Whiteman AFB in Missouri. The potential basing for the LRS-B in the mid-to-late 2020s has not been publicly discussed. Sustaining a fleet of bombers with an average age of 33 years raises concerns about the nation's industrial base. The industrial base that developed and produced the aging fleet of bombers may no longer have the capability to manufacture and supply necessary parts. The B-52 and B-1 aircraft struggle with diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages for replacement parts. Defense industry may need to streamline and consolidate operations to maintain existing capabilities amidst potential budget cuts. The defense industrial base may struggle to meet sustainment requirements for America's legacy bomber force up to 2040. Congress needs to consider this issue when evaluating defense cuts. Historical authorizations and appropriations for B-52H, B-1B, and B-2 sustainment and modernization are depicted in figures 7 and 8. Figure 9 shows historical appropriations for the three bombers and their mission capable rates. Legislative actions from fiscal years 2011-2013 focused on Air Force bomber sustainment and modernization, addressing potential threats from anti-access/area denial capabilities. Section 1056 of P.L. 111-383 required a report on bomber efforts to support the National Defense Strategy. The Air Force provided a report to Congress in September 2011 detailing the cost, schedule, and performance of modernization efforts for the B-1, B-2, and B-52 bomber fleets. The report also discussed sustainment challenges and forecasted service-life until retirement. Congress requested additional reports on defending against threats posed by Anti-Access and Area-Denial capabilities. States' efforts to defend against threats posed by Anti-Access and Area-Denial capabilities of certain nations were requested by Congress in response to the DOD's 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The report highlighted the importance of maintaining dominant capabilities to project power to uphold United States alliances and security partnerships. The Secretary of Defense was also asked to assess the United States' defense efforts against potential future threats from hostile nation-states. These reports were submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees in April 2011. In April 2011, reports were submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees regarding the Air Force's proposal to retire six B-1 bombers in their FY2012 budget request. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the proposal, noting the critical role of the B-1 fleet in supporting troops and the nation's long-range strike capabilities. The Air Force planned to reinvest less than 40 percent of the savings from the retirements into the B-1 modernization program. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Air Force to reinvest a larger portion of savings from B-1 aircraft retirements into the sustainment and modernization of the B-1 fleet. Section 132 in P.L. 112-81 restricts FY2012 funds for the retirement of any B-1 aircraft until a plan detailing the identification and disposition of retired aircraft, as well as estimated savings, is submitted to congressional defense committees. The Secretary of the Air Force is directed to reinvest savings from B-1 bomber retirements into modernization and sustainment of the fleet. Section 132 in P.L. 112-81 outlines restrictions on FY2012 funds for B-1 retirements until a plan for retired aircraft disposition and estimated savings is submitted to Congress. Additionally, language specifies maintaining a minimum number of combat-coded B-1 aircraft until 2016. The FY2013 budget request did not include funds for the B-52 CONECT program of record. Instead, it included $34,700,000 for research, development, test, and evaluation for a restructured B\u201352 CONECT program. The committee directed that no funds may be obligated or expended for the B\u201352 CONECT program post-milestone C acquisition activities until 30 days after congressional defense committees are briefed on the Air Force's proposed way ahead. The committee also addressed the termination of the B-52 Strategic Radar Replacement program due to the outdated APQ-166 radar's limitations and high operating costs. The decision to reconsider retiring B-1 aircraft was also discussed in P.L. 112-239. In P.L. 112-239, Section 142 amended Section 8062 of title 10, stating the Secretary of the Air Force may not retire more than six B\u20131 aircraft and must maintain at least 36 B\u20131 aircraft in a common capability configuration. Section 211 addressed concerns over nuclear certification requirements for the Next-Generation Bomber, ensuring it can carry nuclear weapons upon achieving initial operating capability. This was in response to fiscal constraints imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and sequestration in 2013. The impacts of fiscal measures on bomber appropriations can be seen with the implementation of the FY2013 defense budget. Appropriations for B-52 and B-1 were significantly reduced in FY2013, while the B-2 was not affected by budget cuts. In FY2013, $447 million was appropriated for defense, only a 1% drop from the previous 11-year average. Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are expanding their defense capabilities to secure their interests, leading to the proliferation of advanced weapon systems. The United States relies on its long-range bomber force for deterrence, as seen in deployments to South Korea in response to threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The U.S. Air Force's legacy bomber force, including the B-52, B-1, and B-2 bombers, faces the challenge of keeping pace with modernization efforts to remain relevant in the face of increasing threats from adversaries. Congressional decisions will play a crucial role in determining the future of the nation's long-range strike capabilities. The B-52H bomber is a versatile aircraft capable of high-speed flights at altitudes up to 50,000 feet. It can carry nuclear or precision guided ordnance with worldwide navigation capability. In addition to strategic attack missions, it can also perform close-air support, air interdiction, offensive counter-air, and maritime operations. During Desert Storm, B-52s delivered 40% of coalition forces' weapons. The aircraft is equipped for ocean surveillance, anti-ship, and mine-laying operations, with advanced sensors and targeting capabilities for enhanced mission effectiveness. Night vision goggles enhance pilot vision during night operations, increasing safety by improving terrain visibility and radar avoidance. The B-52H bomber has a range of over 8,800 miles and can carry various weapons, including precision guided missiles. Upgrades include GPS integration and advanced weapon systems. The B-52H bomber, updated with modern technology, can deliver a full range of joint developed weapons and has a lifespan beyond 2040. It first flew in 1954, with a total of 744 built. The B-52H model, introduced in 1962, can carry up to 20 air-launched cruise missiles and was used in various operations, including Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom.
