    "title": "SB 1021",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 3003.5 of the Penal Code is amended to restrict parolees from residing in single-family dwellings with other registered offenders, unless they are legally related. Additionally, it is unlawful for certain offenders to reside within 2,000 feet of specified locations. The residency restriction for sex offenders under Section 290 prohibits them from living within 2,000 feet of schools or parks where children gather. The restriction is enforced by the state parole authority until discharge, unless overridden by a greater restriction, modified within the county, or deemed unconstitutional. Any person subject to residency restrictions under Section 290 may seek relief if compliance is not possible in their county. Municipalities can enact further restrictions. Section 3003.51 allows individuals prohibited from living near schools or parks to seek relief if compliant housing is unavailable in their county. Any person subject to residency restrictions under Section 290 may file a petition with the superior court of their county if compliant housing is not available. The appellate division of the court has original jurisdiction and may grant the petition if the petitioner proves a lack of compliant housing in their county. The petitioner, facing residency restrictions, struggles to find compliant housing due to a 2,000 foot rule. Relief may modify restrictions to fit county constraints, especially for those convicted of certain offenses. If relief is granted or denied, no subsequent petition shall be heard unless there is a substantial decline in compliant housing availability and an increase in sex offenders unable to comply with residency restrictions. This act is an urgency statute for immediate public safety."
