    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the existing infrastructure of Grand Canyon National Park is inadequate and needs improvement to enhance natural and cultural resources, visitor experiences, and transportation facilities. The Director of the National Park Service has identified measures to improve infrastructure and services, including historic structure reuse. This plan needs to be implemented for the Park's benefit. The management plan for Grand Canyon National Park includes agreements with non-Federal entities to share improvement costs and the collection of a special surcharge in addition to entrance fees. The Secretary of the Interior authorizes a surcharge of up to $2 per individual on top of the entrance fee for Grand Canyon National Park. The collected surcharge amounts will be remitted to a special account for park infrastructure improvement. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, establishes a special account in the Treasury for Grand Canyon National Park infrastructure improvement. Funds in the account can only be used for eligible projects, with no use for daily park operations. The Secretary of the Interior can use the funds to pay the Federal share of project costs. Eligible projects are outlined in Section 4. Eligible projects for infrastructure improvement within Grand Canyon National Park must adhere to National Park laws and the park's management plan. Cost-sharing agreements with non-federal entities are also outlined. SEC. 5. Cost-sharing agreements with non-Federal entities are required for eligible projects in Grand Canyon National Park. The agreements specify the Federal and non-Federal shares of project costs, with the non-Federal entity responsible for their share. Agreements may cover multiple projects. SEC. 6 outlines regulations. The Secretary of the Interior must create regulations for this Act, including procedures for managing the special account, soliciting funds for project costs, protecting resources, encouraging private sector funding for restoration projects, preventing commercialization of the Grand Canyon, and avoiding conflicts of interest. The Secretary of the Interior must establish regulations for the Grand Canyon National Park Act, including procedures to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure public oversight. The Secretary will follow public notice and comment procedures as outlined in section 553 of title 5, United States Code. The Secretary of the Interior is required to submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the Grand Canyon National Park infrastructure improvement authority within 5 years of the Act's enactment. The report will include assessments and recommendations for legislation related to surcharges, special accounts, and funding for eligible projects. Definitions for the Act are provided in section 8. The Act defines key terms such as \"facility\" as any structure used for park operations, \"Federal share\" as the percentage of project cost covered by federal funds, and \"non-Federal share\" as the portion not covered by federal funds. The term \"eligible project\" refers to any project eligible for funding under the Act, while the \"special account\" pertains to the account established for Grand Canyon National Park infrastructure improvement."
