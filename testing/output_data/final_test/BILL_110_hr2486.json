Congress found that President George W. Bush requested authorization for military force against Iraq due to alleged WMD threat. The authorization was signed into law in 2002, leading to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 which removed Saddam Hussein from power. After the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, the United States took temporary responsibility for the country, establishing the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance and later the Coalition Provisional Authority. The US enacted institutional changes to establish a new democratic Iraqi government, including the adoption of a new constitution and parliamentary elections under US direction. After the US occupation and return of sovereignty to Iraq, thousands of Iraqis worked for the US Government and Armed Forces. The ongoing instability in Iraq has led to millions of Iraqis becoming refugees or internally displaced. Those who assisted the US are seen as collaborators by other Iraqis and face a persistent fear. Iraqis in Iraq face persecution, physical harm, or death, with no registration facility for refugees or displaced persons. The internally displaced Iraqi population is 1,900,000, growing by 50,000 monthly, while the refugee population is around 2,000,000. The US has admitted only 692 Iraqi refugees since 2003, imposing costs on neighboring countries struggling with large refugee populations.
