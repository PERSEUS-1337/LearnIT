    "content": "EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PLAN. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior are required to conduct projects to reduce hazardous fuels on Federal land outside of designated Wilderness Areas. Projects must align with the 10-year Comprehensive Strategy for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks and be consistent with relevant agency plans. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior prioritize projects in wildland urban interface areas, municipal watersheds, forested/rangeland areas affected by disease, and areas susceptible to catastrophic reburn. They are limited to treating up to 10,000,000 acres of Federal land, with the option to treat additional acres that qualify as fire risk condition class three. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior collaborate on project selection and consultation procedures for projects in fire risk condition class three. Projects under this section are exempt from certain administrative reviews and appeals processes. Judicial review of projects selected under this section must be filed in the Federal District Court within 60 days of public notice, completed within 360 days, and cannot result in a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. The processes developed under subsection (d) are not subject to judicial review. The authorities provided to the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior in this section are in addition to those provided in other laws. SEC. 2. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTING. The Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior may enter into stewardship contracts with private persons or entities to achieve land management goals for national forests and Federal lands, including road maintenance, habitat enhancement, prescribed fires, and vegetation removal. The Secretary of Agriculture may award contracts for land management goals, including promoting healthy forest stands, watershed restoration, controlling noxious weeds, and selling timber at appraised value. The Secretary of Agriculture may award contracts for land management goals, while the Secretary of the Interior may award contracts on a best-value basis considering the contractor's performance under other contracts. The Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of the Interior may award contracts for land management goals on a best-value basis. Contracts under subsection (a) can have a term exceeding 5 years but not exceeding 10 years. The value of removed timber or forest products can be used as an offset against the cost of services received. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior may award contracts for land management goals based on best value. The offset value of products removed can be used to cover the cost of services received. Excess offset value can be collected and applied as needed. The Secretary of the Interior may collect monies from a contract for land management goals, with funds made available without further appropriation and remaining available until expended. Funds collected by the Secretary of Agriculture can be used for activities under an authorized contract. The Secretary of the Interior may collect monies from a contract for land management goals, with funds made available without further appropriation and remaining available until expended. Funds collected by the Secretary of Agriculture can be used for activities under an authorized contract, including the Knutson-Vandenberg Fund. The Secretary of Agriculture may collect monies from Federal lands for removal costs of timber or forest products. This includes funds from the Knutson-Vandenberg Act, Materials Act of 1947, and provisions for Oregon and California Railroad lands. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior may require performance and payment bonds for timber removal contracts. They can use existing contracting authorities or develop new ones. Reporting requirements are in place for accountability. The Secretaries must track and report the full costs of contracts and forest products exchanged. They must report annually to Congress on contract status, accomplishments, and project costs, including services received and payments from timber sales. The Secretaries must report annually to Congress on contract status, accomplishments, and project costs, including the difference between payments received for timber and forest products and their fair market value. The Appeals Reform Act (Section 322 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993) is repealed. Additionally, there is a focus on balancing short-term and long-term environmental harms. Congress finds that past land management practices, particularly fire suppression, have severely altered fire-adapted forest and rangeland ecosystems, making them less resilient and more vulnerable to harm by fire, drought, insects, disease, and invasive species. This degradation causes irreparable harm to public health, safety, property, and diminishes the biological productivity of the land and natural resources of the Nation. The text discusses the importance of restoring fire-adapted forests and rangelands through mechanical thinning and prescribed fire to protect threatened species, watersheds, and economic values. It emphasizes that the public interest in restoration outweighs short-term effects on water, air, soils, and habitat. When reviewing agency actions to restore fire-adapted forest or rangeland ecosystems, the court must consider the public interest in avoiding long-term harm to these ecosystems and defer to agency findings that prioritize long-term ecosystem health over short-term effects."
