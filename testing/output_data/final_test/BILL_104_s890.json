    "content": "The Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1995 may be cited as the \"Gun-Free School Zones Act.\" It prohibits certain activities related to firearms in school zones. Section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code is amended to address the nationwide issue of crime involving drugs and guns, exacerbated by the interstate movement of firearms and ammunition. The ease of interstate commerce for firearms and ammunition has led to an increasing presence of these items in and around schools. Criminals moving freely between states further complicates the issue. The ease of interstate commerce for firearms and ammunition has led to an increasing presence of these items in and around schools, impacting the quality of education. States, localities, and school systems struggle to handle gun-related crime, affecting interstate and foreign commerce. Congress has the power to enact measures to ensure school safety by prohibiting individuals from knowingly possessing firearms in school zones, with exceptions for private property and licensed individuals. Exceptions to the prohibition of possessing firearms in school zones include being licensed by the State, having the firearm unloaded and locked, using it for an approved school program, or under a contract with the school or employer. It is unlawful to discharge a firearm in a school zone, except for specific exceptions such as being on private property or part of an approved school program. Exceptions to the prohibition of discharging a firearm in a school zone include participation in an approved school program, a contract with a school or employer, or law enforcement acting in an official capacity. State or local governments can still establish gun-free school zones."
