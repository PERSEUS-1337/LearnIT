The \"Land Recycling Act of 1997\" allows cleanups under State Voluntary Response Programs. The President and others cannot use certain environmental Acts to take action on facilities with voluntary response plans in compliant states. States must certify their voluntary response programs to be exempt. The \"Land Recycling Act of 1997\" allows cleanups under State Voluntary Response Programs. States must certify their programs to be exempt from certain environmental Acts. The prohibition does not apply to facilities on the National Priorities List, proposed for listing, or owned by the US government. The United States may require response action at a facility under certain environmental laws through an administrative order on consent or judicial consent decree. These laws include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Administrator has the authority to gather information for determining National Priorities List eligibility at facilities under State voluntary response programs. No new permits are needed for remediation activities on sites covered by a State voluntary response plan. (g) Definitions:\n- Voluntary response program: State-established program for voluntary response to hazardous substances release.\n- Voluntary response plan: Facility-specific plan under a State voluntary response program. SEC. 3. INNOCENT LANDOWNERS. Section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to include a new subsection regarding Innocent Landowners. It states that a person who acquires real property must conduct an environmental site assessment meeting specific requirements within 180 days prior to acquisition. The assessment must adhere to standards set by the American Society for Testing. The Administrator shall issue or designate alternative standards for environmental site assessments in the transfer of real property in the United States, after conducting a study of commercial and industrial practices. These standards will be deemed commercially reasonable and generally accepted. The Administrator shall consider requirements for environmental site assessments, including interviews and historical sources to determine contamination potential and property history. The environmental site assessment includes reviewing various sources like insurance maps, property tax files, topographic maps, street directories, building records, and zoning/land use records to identify past property uses. It also involves checking for environmental cleanup liens and government records of sites likely to cause contamination. The environmental site assessment involves reviewing various sources to identify past property uses and checking for records of activities likely to cause contamination, including landfill and disposal location records, underground storage tank records, hazardous waste handler and generator records, spill reporting records, and government environmental records. A visual site inspection of the property and adjacent properties is also conducted. The environmental site assessment includes reviewing records of hazardous substance use, storage, treatment, and disposal practices on the property. Factors considered include the defendant's specialized knowledge, the purchase price compared to the property value if uncontaminated, and the detectability of contamination through investigation. Records are deemed 'reasonably ascertainable' if publicly available by request within reasonable time and cost constraints. The defendant must maintain a compilation of information gathered during the environmental site assessment. Contamination is defined as an existing or past release of a hazardous substance, excluding de minimis conditions. Section 101(35)(B) is amended to reference the specified requirements in section 107(n). SEC. 4. BONA FIDE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER LIABILITY. Liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 is amended to include protection for bona fide prospective purchasers who do not impede response actions at a facility. This provision shields them from liability based solely on certain criteria for releases or threats of releases from the facility. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 now protects bona fide prospective purchasers who meet specific criteria, such as proving that all hazardous substance disposal occurred before acquiring the facility, conducting appropriate inquiries into previous ownership and uses, and providing all legally required notices. The person must provide all legally required notices regarding hazardous substances at the facility, exercise appropriate care to prevent releases, and cooperate with authorized response actions. The person must provide all legally required notices regarding hazardous substances at the facility, exercise appropriate care to prevent releases, and cooperate with authorized response actions. A prospective purchaser not affiliated with any other person liable for response costs at the facility may have a windfall lien imposed by the United States for unrecovered costs if certain conditions are met. The lien shall not exceed the increase in fair market value of the property due to the response action. The windfall lien imposed by the United States for unrecovered costs arises when a response action increases the fair market value of the property. The lien continues until all response costs are recovered or the lien is satisfied. No lien shall arise with respect to property if the property owner preceding the first bona fide prospective purchaser is not a liable party or has resolved its liability, or if an environmental assessment does not give the purchaser knowledge of hazardous substances."
