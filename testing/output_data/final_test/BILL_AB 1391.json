    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 51210 of the Education Code is amended to include instruction in English and Mathematics for grades 1 to 6. The curriculum for grades 1 to 6 includes instruction in English, Mathematics, Social sciences, and Science. Social sciences cover various disciplines like anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology. Science emphasizes biological and physical aspects, focusing on experimental inquiry and human placement in ecological systems. The curriculum for grades 1 to 6 includes instruction in English, Mathematics, Social sciences, and Science. Additionally, it includes Visual and performing arts, Health, Physical education, and Other studies as prescribed by the governing board. A complaint regarding instructional minute requirements can be filed with the school district or county superintendent of schools. If unsatisfied with the decision, the complainant can appeal to the department and should receive a written appeal decision within 60 days. The school district or county superintendent of schools must provide a remedy if a complaint is found to have merit. The Legislature clarifies that this section does not create a private right of action. Instruction in physical education for grades 1 to 8 must be at least 200 minutes every 10 schooldays. A complaint regarding instructional minute requirements can be filed with the school district or county superintendent of schools. If unsatisfied with the decision, the complainant can appeal to the department and will receive a written appeal decision within 60 days. The school district or county superintendent of schools must provide a remedy if a complaint is found to have merit. The legislation does not create a private right of action but allows parties to seek relief through a writ of mandate. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that the act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts. This bill is an urgency statute to protect California public schools from lawsuits that divert funds from classrooms, going into immediate effect."
