    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sickle Cell Treatment Act of 2003\". Congress finds that Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a major health problem in the US, affecting approximately 70,000 Americans with 1,800 babies born with the disease annually. SCD is most common in African-Americans, Hispanics, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern individuals. Over 2,500,000 Americans, mostly African-Americans, have the sickle cell trait. Children with sickle cell trait are healthy carriers of the sickle cell gene and may exhibit various complications such as frequent pain episodes, spleen enlargement, severe anemia, acute lung issues, and priapism. They are also at risk for life-threatening complications like septicemia, meningitis, and stroke, especially those at high risk for stroke who can be identified early and treated with regular blood transfusions. Children with sickle cell anemia are at high risk for strokes, with 30% experiencing a stroke before their 18th birthday. Silent strokes can also occur, leading to lower educational attainment in affected individuals. Adults with sickle cell disease may face acute pain episodes, lung complications, and potential death. Regular blood transfusions can help prevent strokes in high-risk individuals. Adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) face chronic problems such as pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, joint degeneration, poor vision, and kidney failure. The average lifespan for adults with SCD is in the mid-40s, with causes of death including bacterial infections, stroke, and organ failure. Specialized care is essential for managing this complex disorder effectively. Counseling, education, and regular blood transfusions are crucial in preventing complications and reducing mortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Stroke in adults with SCD can lead to lifelong mental and physical disabilities. Blood transfusions are a key treatment to prevent strokes in children with SCD, while also being necessary for acute lung complications to prevent premature death. Primary and secondary preventative medical strategies for children and adults with sickle cell disease are now included as medical assistance under the Medicaid program. Primary and secondary preventative medical strategies, including chronic blood transfusion, are now covered under Medicaid for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease. Federal reimbursement for education and services related to preventing and treating Sickle Cell Disease is now covered under Medicaid, including genetic counseling, testing, and other treatments to prevent recurrent strokes in high-risk individuals. The amendments made by this section expand Medicaid coverage to include costs for identifying and educating individuals with Sickle Cell Disease or carriers of the gene, as well as education on stroke risks and prevention. Effective upon enactment, these changes apply to medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The amendments expand Medicaid coverage to include costs for identifying and educating individuals with Sickle Cell Disease or carriers of the gene, as well as education on stroke risks and prevention under title XIX of the Social Security Act. Assistance and services provided under title XIX of the Social Security Act are applicable regardless of final regulations being in place. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND ESTABLISHMENT OF SYSTEMIC MECHANISMS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE. The Administrator will conduct a demonstration program by providing grants to eligible entities to improve prevention and treatment of Sickle Cell Disease through service coordination, genetic counseling, technical services bundling, health professional training, and other efforts. The Administrator will award grants to eligible entities for expanding and coordinating education, treatment, and care programs for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease. Priority will be given to Federally-qualified health centers with partnerships for comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease treatment. Geographic diversity in grant awards is encouraged. The grant program aims to expand and coordinate education, treatment, and care programs for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease. Priority is given to Federally-qualified health centers partnering with comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease treatment centers not funded by the National Institutes of Health. Eligible entities must use grant funds for facilitating and coordinating education, treatment, and continuity of care for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease. The grant program aims to expand and coordinate education, treatment, and care programs for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease. It includes training nursing and health staff to provide health care and genetic counseling for individuals with the sickle cell trait. The grant program aims to expand education, treatment, and care programs for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease by partnering with hematologists and securing resources for reimbursement under health programs. A National Coordinating Center will be established for the demonstration program. The National Coordinating Center will collect, coordinate, monitor, and distribute data, best practices, and findings for activities funded under grants for Sickle Cell Disease. They will also develop a model protocol, educational materials, and submit a final report to Congress on the effectiveness of the demonstration program. The demonstration program under this section will measure the effectiveness by tracking healthcare resources used by individuals with Sickle Cell Disease and the number receiving genetic counseling for the sickle cell trait. Eligible entities must submit an application for a grant, and definitions are provided in this section. The section defines key terms like \"Administrator\" and \"eligible entity\" as entities that provide primary health care and have agreements with Sickle Cell Disease organizations or entities with relevant experience. The term \"Federally-qualified health center\" is defined in the Social Security Act. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2004 through 2009 to carry out this section."
