    "content": "The V-22 Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft used by the Department of Defense, with plans to procure a total of 458 units for different branches. The FY2012 budget requested funding for 30 MV-22s and 7 CV-22s, with concerns for oversight on readiness rates, reliability, and operational suitability. The Marine MV-22 crashed during a training exercise in Morocco on April 11, 2012, resulting in casualties. The V-22's cost per flying hour in FY2011 was 13% less than the previous year, with a 19% improvement in Mission Capability rate. These improvements are attributed to various enhancements in reliability, maintainability, maintenance concepts, repair capabilities, and contract strategies. The V-22 Osprey program has seen reduced operational costs by $3,000 per hour through procedure changes, with improved readiness rate and part reliability. Flight time costs have decreased from $12,000 to $9,000 per hour. The Marine Corps and Air Force will establish V-22 squadrons in Okinawa and England, respectively. The V-22 Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft that combines the vertical takeoff and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the long-range cruise abilities of a twin turboprop aircraft. It can transport 24 fully equipped Marines at a cruising speed of about 250 knots. The MV-22 is designed to replace the Marine Corps CH-46 medium-lift assault helicopters, with the CV-22 having 90% airframe commonality with the MV-22. The primary differences between the two variants are in their avionics. The CV-22 Osprey is designed to carry 18 troops with auxiliary fuel tanks, increasing its combat radius to about 500 miles. It is a joint-service, multi-mission aircraft with specific missions for the Navy's MV-22A, HV-22A, and the Air Force's CV-22A. CV-22A conducts long-range special operations missions, including infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply to Special Forces teams in hostile areas. Marine Corps leaders prefer the MV-22 over the CH-46 for its speed in forward flight. The Osprey's success in missions like the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft Personnel during Libyan operations showcases its unique capabilities. Without the Osprey, negotiations with Gadhafi would have been necessary. In 2013, HMX-1 will receive 12 Ospreys to support White House missions. Boeing defends the Osprey's effectiveness in combat search and rescue missions despite Pentagon report findings. Boeing's V-22 Osprey is considered very effective in combat search and rescue missions, meeting all requirements for the mission. The aircraft's impressive speed of 277 miles per hour in cruise mode gives it an advantage in the rescue role. Additionally, efforts are being made to enhance the V-22's firepower with a removable minigun linked to a sensor package for improved situational awareness. The V-22 is also being considered to replace the C-2 Greyhound in carrier onboard delivery missions due to its ability to land on ships without a runway or arrester gear. The V-22 Osprey is undergoing carrier qualifications to replace the Navy's C-2 Greyhound for carrier onboard delivery missions. The Navy is considering options such as remanufacturing C-2As or buying new ones from Northrop Grumman Corp. Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters are developing and producing the V-22, with assembly done in various locations in the US. The V-22 Osprey is being developed and produced by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters, with assembly in Fort Worth, TX, and final delivery in Amarillo, TX. The Department of Defense plans to procure a total of 458 V-22s, including 360 MV-22s for the Marine Corps, 50 CV-22s for USSOCOM, and 48 HV-22s for the Navy. As of FY2011, 247 V-22s have been procured, with production quantities detailed in Table 1. No HV-22s have been purchased for the Navy yet. The V-22 Osprey program involves the production of 34 aircraft in 2011, with a multiyear procurement contract saving $427 million. The total acquisition cost for a 459-aircraft program is estimated at $50.0 billion. The V-22 Osprey program has an average total acquisition cost of $108.9 million and an average procurement unit cost of $83.0 million, lower than the previous year's report. From FY1982 through FY2012, the program received about $37.9 billion in funding, excluding wartime supplemental funding. The proposed FY2013 budget requests funding for the procurement of 17 MV-22s and 4 CV-22s, totaling about $1.2 billion. The V-22 program has received significant funding for procurement of MV-22s and CV-22s. The program faced development challenges and crashes in the 1990s, leading to revisions in the acquisition program baseline. The program underwent restructuring to address issues raised by experts and DOD managers. The George H. W. Bush Administration considered terminating the program in 1989. The V-22 program faced termination proposals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but Congress kept it alive due to strong support from the Marine Corps. The MV-22 and CV-22 achieved Initial Operational Capability in 2007 and 2009 respectively. The Osprey's extended range, speed, and payload were praised by the Marine Corps during deployments in Iraq and Mali. The first deployment of CV-22s to Mali occurred in December 2008, participating in a multinational exercise. MV-22s arrived in Afghanistan in November 2009 with added armament. One CV-22 crashed in Afghanistan in April 2010. Talks are ongoing for potential V-22 sales to the UK, Japan, and Israel. India, Israel, Canada, UAE, and Japan have expressed interest in the V-22 Osprey for various military purposes. Bell and Boeing have responded to Canada's request for information on a new search and rescue aircraft. Other nations have also shown interest in the Osprey following a 2010 demonstration. The U.S. government is focusing on foreign military sales opportunities for the Osprey in the coming years. Textron's CEO, Scott Donnelly, discussed foreign military sales opportunities and product applications during a conference call. A 2010 GAO report highlighted ongoing improvements to the V-22 program, including addressing issues with the engine air particle separator to enhance reliability and safety. The program officials are conducting cause analysis to improve the reliability and safety of EAPS. They believe that enhancing EAPS performance could reduce shutdowns and extend engine service life. The program has purchased interim defensive weapon system mission kits for V-22 aircraft, but planning for fewer troops may be necessary to accommodate larger equipment. Incremental upgrades to the IPS are being implemented to enhance overall strategy. Incremental upgrades to the IPS are being fielded on deployed V-22 aircraft in Afghanistan to improve reliability in icing conditions. The V-22 program is in the third year of a 5-year contract for 167 aircraft, with a production rate of 35 aircraft per year. Plans for cost savings include a second multiyear procurement contract starting in fiscal year 2013. Shipboard pre-deployment training for the MV-22 revealed maintenance and operational challenges due to the aircraft's design. Shipboard operations were adjusted to provide 24-hour aircraft movement capability, with temporary work-arounds identified to address deck heating issues on smaller ships caused by the V-22's exhaust. Operational restrictions included maintaining one open spot between an MV-22 and smaller aircraft to avoid excessive buffeting. A new flight control software upgrade corrected restrictions on takeoffs and landings from two spots on LHD-class ships. Despite limitations, the amphibious assault mission was completed with half the total number of aircraft. The MV-22 completed the amphibious assault mission with fewer aircraft, in less time, and over a longer distance compared to traditional aircraft. However, the Marine Corps needs to reassess escort and close air support tactics due to the MV-22's speed, altitude, and range advantages. The MV-22's mission capable rate was below the acceptable threshold during its first sea deployment in 2009 and averaged 62 percent during three Iraq deployments. Steps are being taken to improve operational availability and reduce operating costs by addressing component failures and analyzing factors affecting readiness and support costs. The May 2009 GAO report on the V-22 program highlighted challenges with the MV-22's operational effectiveness, including unreliable component parts and supply chain weaknesses leading to low aircraft availability rates. Operational tests and training exercises also revealed limitations in the system's ability to operate in different environments and detect threats, raising questions about its suitability for replacing legacy helicopters. The V-22 program faces challenges in operational effectiveness, including unreliable parts and supply chain weaknesses. Limitations in detecting threats and operating in various environments may hinder air crew's ability to take evasive actions. The aircraft's size and inventory of repair parts create obstacles for shipboard operations. Cost projections have sharply increased, with a procurement unit cost rise of 148 percent and research costs up over 200 percent. Efforts are being made to address these deficiencies, but some are inherent in the V-22's design. The V-22 program plans to request $25 billion for aircraft procurement. The cost per flight hour for the Marine Corps' V-22 is over $11,000, double the estimate. DOD aims to acquire 122 more aircraft, with a block purchase saving $852 million. A Navy purchase could lower costs for the remaining 24 V-22s. Production rates will decrease from 40 Ospreys. The V-22 program will see a decrease in production rates from 40 Ospreys to 21 under a new deal with Bell and Boeing. The Pentagon plans to buy 21 aircraft in the next two budget years, with reduced numbers in subsequent years. Some in Congress have opposed the program, with a failed attempt to cut funding in FY2011. The V-22 program faced funding cuts in FY2011 due to cost overruns and not meeting operational requirements, despite its performance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested ending procurement of the V-22 Osprey to reduce national debt. The V-22 Osprey program has faced developmental and maintenance issues, leading to a proposal to terminate acquisition at 288 aircraft to save costs. Despite improvements in safety and reliability, readiness rates for the CV-22 and MV-22 are lower than traditional aircraft, with an average mission capable rate of 53% from 2007 to 2010. The Air Force CV-22 fleet had a mission-capable rate of 54.3% in FY2010, attributed to the small fleet size. Taking one plane off the schedule for a day lowers the rate by 6 percentage points. The Marine Corps MV-22 had a higher readiness rate in the low 70s. Afghanistan was noted to have the most deployment. The V-22 aircraft has maintained readiness rates in the low 70s despite challenges in Afghanistan's harsh air environment. Spare parts have been crucial in maintaining these rates, but concerns remain about global readiness due to supplier and reliability issues. Congress is also focusing on the reliability and maintainability of in-service V-22s to ensure readiness. Navy and Marine Corps officials testified about the challenges faced by the MV-22 aircraft in terms of reliability and maintainability. They are working with industry partners to improve logistics and support plans to increase durability, availability of parts, and lower operating costs. The May 2009 GAO report on the V-22 program highlighted these issues. The May 2009 GAO report on the V-22 program highlighted challenges with the MV-22's reliability and maintainability. In Iraq, the aircraft's mission capability rates fell significantly below required levels, averaging about 68-61 percent for squadrons. Officials modified the MC requirement to be achieved by 60,000 flight hours, expected by the end of 2009. The Osprey's FMC rate in Iraq from October 2007 to April 2008 was only 6 percent, well below the 75 percent minimum requirement. This was attributed to the unreliability of the V-22 Ice Protection System components, which could pose a threat to mission accomplishment in areas with icing conditions like Afghanistan. In Iraq, MV-22 maintenance squadrons faced challenges due to an immature parts supply chain and unreliable aircraft parts. Despite deploying with spare parts for 36 aircraft, only 13 percent were used for the 12 MV-22s actually deployed. In Iraq, MV-22 maintenance squadrons faced challenges with parts shortages. Thirteen components wore out quickly, leading to cannibalization of parts from other aircraft and increased maintenance hours. This caused low mission capability rates and affected flight hours before failure. The MV-22 engines deployed in Iraq fell short of their estimated service life, lasting less than 400 hours before replacement. The program office plans to replace the existing engine sustainment contract with Rolls Royce. The new engine sustainment contract for the MV-22 is expected to increase engine support costs. The U.S. Marine Corps acknowledges improvements in MV-22 performance and reliability but seeks further enhancements. Upgrades to the engine air particle accelerator, blades, and swashplate actuators have improved reliability. Congress may need to address oversight issues regarding the V-22 program's operational capabilities. The 12 MV-22s stationed in Iraq completed all missions successfully in a low-threat theater of operations, showcasing their enhanced speed and range. Questions have been raised about whether the MV-22 is best suited to replace legacy helicopters for all mission types. Despite some operational challenges, the Marine Corps considers the deployments in Iraq to have been successful. The MV-22 Osprey's speed and range were praised for cutting the battlefield in half, expanding coverage, and enabling two to three times more missions than legacy helicopters in Iraq. Its ability to fly at higher altitudes in airplane mode also provided protection from small arms fire. Commanders noted significant advantages over legacy platforms, allowing for rapid medical care delivery and missions previously impossible. The MV-22 Osprey in Iraq enabled rapid delivery of medical care, completed missions in a single day, and facilitated faster travel for U.S. military and Iraqi officials. It also conducted AeroScout raid and external lift missions, although these were infrequent and could also be carried out by existing helicopters. The MV-22's speed and range advantages were limited during these missions due to operating with slower legacy helicopters. The MV-22 Osprey in Iraq faced limitations in leveraging its speed and range advantages during external lift missions, as slower legacy helicopters were more readily available for such tasks. This led to a reconsideration of the Osprey's role in conjunction with existing helicopters in fulfilling mission requirements. The MV-22 Osprey in Iraq faced challenges in fulfilling warfighter needs, with concerns about its suitability for medium lift missions due to speed limitations and lack of situational awareness. Crew members highlighted issues with visibility from the troop cabin, impacting operational effectiveness. The V-22 Osprey has limited visibility with only two small windows, unlike the CH-53 and CH-46 which have larger windows providing better ground view for combat Marines. The low altitude approach of CH-53s and CH-46s in raid operations enhances situational awareness compared to the high altitude fast descent of the MV-22. Upgrades are being made to improve electronic situational awareness in the troop cabin, but challenges remain for crew chiefs providing visual cues to pilots. The crew chief faces situational awareness challenges due to limited visibility from the troop cabin in the MV-22 Osprey. Commanders are pleased with the V-22's performance in Afghanistan, but a comprehensive evaluation comparing actual performance to projections is pending. A House hearing in 2009 discussed issues with the V-22 program, and funding cuts were made in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The House and Senate cut Overseas Contingency Operations funding by $70 million for one CV-22 and $15 million for V-22 modifications. The conference report authorized $2.2 billion in Aircraft Procurement, Navy, for the V-22, with reductions in advance procurement and support equipment costs. The House and Senate reduced funding for support equipment and modifications for the V-22 Osprey, including cuts for deficiencies and reliability modifications. The final year of the V-22 multiyear procurement effort saw reductions in Overseas Contingency Operations funding and Air Force V-22 R&D due to contract delays. Multiyear procurements provide savings and program stability compared to annual procurements, according to the House Appropriations Committee report. The Committee supports multiyear procurements for platforms like the V-22 Osprey due to savings and program stability. The V-22 has proven its operational effectiveness and the Committee urges the Department of Defense to consider a new multiyear procurement contract in the fiscal year 2013 budget. The Senate Appropriations Committee added funds for Navy V-22 procurement in the fiscal year 2013 budget, while also making cuts in Navy and Air Force procurement. The Committee supports multiyear procurements for the V-22 Osprey due to savings and program stability, urging the Department of Defense to consider a new multiyear procurement contract in the fiscal year 2013 budget. The Committee recommends a new multi-year procurement contract for Navy V-22 Osprey due to cost savings and program stability. Reductions in Engineering Change Order funding are proposed to reflect actual prior year levels. The $2.2 billion appropriated for V-22 procurement is detailed in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference on H.R. 2055. The Committee recommends a new multi-year procurement contract for Navy V-22 Osprey to achieve cost savings and program stability. Reductions in Engineering Change Order funding are proposed to reflect actual prior year levels. Additionally, adjustments were made to various funding allocations for V-22 procurement, including reductions in support funding carryover, advance procurement equipment cost growth, and support equipment costs. The history of the V-22 program is discussed in detail in the provided appendix and a summary from a May 2009 GAO report is also included. The Osprey program began in December 1981 to meet mission needs for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Initially led by the Army, it was later transferred to the Navy in 1982. Despite affordability concerns, the program was approved for development in 1986, with the first flight in 1989. Production was halted in 1989 due to cost issues, but Congress continued funding. After crashes in 1991 and 1992, development resumed in October 1992 with a contract awarded to Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters. In 1994, the Navy reaffirmed the decision to proceed with the V-22 Osprey for medium lift replacement missions, defining primary and secondary mission objectives for the aircraft. The Marine Corps reaffirmed the need to replace their medium-lift aircraft fleet in 2003 and 2007 due to inventory shortfalls and reduced reliability. After analyzing various helicopter candidates, including the CH-46E and CH-53D, the V-22 tiltrotor was chosen based on performance characteristics and expected contributions to tactics and operations. A sensitivity analysis compared candidate aircraft against specific performance parameters, concluding that the V-22 was the best choice. The V-22 tiltrotor was chosen as the most effective option for non-assault missions like medical evacuation due to its speed, range, and deployment time. For assault missions, it was deemed to build combat power quickly, be more survivable, and minimize casualties. Despite higher costs, the V-22 was considered the most effective option in terms of affordability. Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) began in 1997 with five aircraft, increasing to seven each year in 1998. Initial Production (LRIP) of the V-22 began in 1997 with five aircraft, increasing to seven each year in 1998 and 1999. Operational evaluation testing in 2000 showed the MV-22 was suitable for land-based operations and effective. Despite concerns about reliability, a decision was made in December 2000 to progress to full-rate production. Two fatal crashes in 2000, resulting in 23 deaths, occurred just before this decision. Before the V-22 resumed flight tests, modifications were made to correct safety concerns and problems, including redesigning the aircraft nacelles, building a software qualification facility, and investigating Vortex Ring State. Some requirements were eliminated, and Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) were modified. The V-22 underwent modifications and testing before being approved for military use in September 2005. The aircraft is being procured in blocks, with Block A for training and later blocks for operational use. Prototype testing began in 1989, with successful sea trials in 1990. The Osprey's early flight testing faced challenges, with crashes in 1991 and 1992 due to wiring and design issues. After modifications, flight tests resumed in 1993, leading to the delivery of the first pre-production V-22 in 1997. The first EMD flight occurred in February 1997, followed by the delivery of the first LRIP aircraft in 1999. The Osprey aircraft, ordered in 1997, was delivered in 1999. Osprey number 10 completed Sea Trials in January 1999. OPEVAL testing began in October 1999 and concluded in August 2000. The MV-22 was deemed operationally effective for land-based operations in October 2000. The Osprey was also deemed suitable for both land and sea-based operations in November 2000. However, full rate production was postponed indefinitely due to mixed reports and fatal accidents, including one in April 2000 near Tucson, AZ. On April 8, 2000, an Osprey crashed near Tucson, AZ during a training exercise, resulting in the deaths of all four crew members and 15 passengers. The investigation revealed that the pilot was descending too quickly, leading to a condition known as \"power settling\" or \"vortex ring state.\" Lieutenant General Fred McCorkle stated that the pilot was descending at a rate exceeding the recommended limit of 800 feet per minute. Following a two-month suspension, flight testing resumed in June 2000 with tighter restrictions. A report by the Marine Corps JAG attributed the crash to a combination of \"human factors.\" The crash of an Osprey near Tucson, AZ in April 2000 was caused by a combination of \"human factors,\" including a steep approach with high rate of descent and slow airspeed. The investigation found that the primary cause was the aircraft entering a Vortex Ring State and/or blade stall condition, which are not unique to tilt rotors. The DOD Inspector General study highlighted deficiencies in meeting operational effectiveness requirements before entering full rate production in June 2001. The Marine Corps acknowledged these deficiencies but stated they were aware of them before the evaluation process began. On November 17, 2000, DOD's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation issued a report on the Osprey, noting operational effectiveness but operational suitability issues. More research was recommended on the V-22's susceptibility to the vortex ring state. A fatal crash occurred on December 11, 2000, near Jacksonville, NC, killing all four Marines on board, including the program's most experienced pilot. This was the fourth Osprey crash since 1991 and the third lethal accident. The Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after a crash caused by a burst hydraulic line and software malfunction. Maintenance records were allegedly falsified, leading to calls for redesigning systems. The V-22 squadron commander admitted to falsifying maintenance records, leading to his removal from command. Three Marines were found guilty of misconduct, and two were reprimanded. A U.S. grand jury indicted individuals in June 2005. In June 2005, a company supplying titanium tubing for the V-22 program was indicted for falsely certifying tube quality. The V-22 test program was halted for 11 days in 2003 due to faulty tubes, costing $4 million to replace. A Blue Ribbon panel recommended restructuring the program in 2001 after finding safety, training, and reliability issues. The V-22 program faced safety, training, and reliability issues, leading to production cuts and tests to address hardware, software, and performance problems. The panel recommended minimal production while fixes were implemented to prepare the aircraft for operational use. Congressional authorizers later codified these recommendations. In response to safety, training, and reliability issues, the V-22 program implemented production cuts and tests to address hardware, software, and performance problems. Congressional authorizers codified recommendations for minimal production until the aircraft is certified safe, reliable, maintainable, and operationally effective. DOD took steps to incorporate these recommendations, including budget adjustments for redesign and testing efforts. The FY2002 budget amendment included a request for 12 Ospreys to sustain the V-22 subcontractor base. The V-22 program's acquisition authority was changed from ACAT 1C to ACAT 1D, giving the Defense Acquisition Board decision-making power for full-rate production. The NASA-led review of the V-22 program in 2001 found no aero-mechanical issues that would hinder its development. Under Secretary of Defense Aldridge authorized the V-22 to resume flight testing in April 2002, emphasizing the need to overcome technical challenges and demonstrate superiority over other alternatives for warfighters. Secretary Aldridge approved the V-22 flight test program with conditions to slow production, ensure comprehensive testing, and full funding. The V-22 required at least two years of flight testing to determine safety and effectiveness. Mechanical adjustments delayed the test schedule, with the MV-22 and CV-22 resuming flight tests in 2002 to address technical and operational concerns. The V-22 flight test program faced technical concerns such as flight control software and hydraulic line reliability. Operational concerns included Vortex Ring State safety, formation flying, and sea handling. The \"Block A\" aircraft had improvements like re-routed hydraulic lines. Technical glitches, like hydraulic failures, were experienced during tests, leading to emergency landings and mishaps. The V-22 aircraft faced technical and operational challenges during flight testing, including a \"Class B\" mishap due to engine component issues. Modifications were made to requirements, such as eliminating certain landing and weapon protection criteria. Additionally, the aircraft no longer needs air combat maneuvering capability and troop exit methods at low altitudes were revised. A study on alternative options was initiated in case the V-22 did not meet standards. After extensive flight testing and review by DOD officials, improvements to the Osprey's hydraulics were deemed effective. The Defense Acquisition Board also approved the progress of the flight test program. Marine Corps recommended increasing production rates in FY2006. In August 2003, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Michael Wynne announced a restructuring of the V-22 procurement plan, reducing the purchase to 11 aircraft in FY2006. The savings of $231 million would be invested in improving interoperability. Wynne also directed the acceleration of a multi-year procurement of the V-22. In December 2004, the V-22 budget and schedule were restructured, cutting 22 aircraft and $1.3 billion between FY2006 and FY2009. Despite issues during operational evaluation, Navy testers recommended the V-22 as operationally suitable and effective for military use. The MV-22 aircraft was reliable and effective when used with other aircraft, with no hindrance to ground operations. In September 2005, the V-22 program was approved for military use and full rate production. The program faces technical challenges and mishaps, such as engine failures and damage during flight. Testing continues to assess survivability and develop tactics for the MV-22 and CV-22 aircraft. The V-22 Osprey faced technical challenges and mishaps, including an engine fire in December 2006. The Marine Corps grounded all V-22s in February 2007 due to a faulty computer chip issue. A hearing on the V-22 program was rescheduled for June 23, 2009, after being adjourned in May 2009. The Defense Department has failed to provide requested information on the Osprey despite repeated reminders from the Committee. The Committee intends to pursue a full investigation and will compel compliance if necessary. The Pentagon is accused of stonewalling lawmakers' requests for information about the V-22 Osprey. The Defense Department is working to fulfill the request to allow the hearing process to continue. House Oversight Committee Chairman Edolphus Towns has criticized the Department's coordination process as highly complex. House Oversight Committee Chairman Edolphus Towns accused the Pentagon of stonewalling his request for V-22 documents, leading to an abrupt end to a hearing. Towns and Rep. Darrell Issa criticized the Defense Department for failing to provide necessary information, with Towns stating the hearing would continue in two weeks. House Oversight Committee Chairman Edolphus Towns abruptly ended a hearing after accusing the Pentagon of withholding V-22 documents. Lt. Gen. George Trautman declined to speak to reporters, and the Marine Corps expressed disappointment at not being able to discuss the Osprey's performance in Iraq. Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Eric Dent emphasized the program's transparency and willingness to discuss all aspects with Congress. The Marine Corps is fully committed to transparency and has been working with the Government Accountability Office on the Osprey program. They provided over 500 pages of maintenance records and information to address a committee's request. The Marine Corps emphasized the vetting process for releasing information, including classified material."
