    "content": "The Latin America and Caribbean region has seen significant progress in political development, with most countries holding regular free and fair elections. However, challenges such as poverty, violent conflicts, autocratic leaders, drug trafficking, and rising populism threaten political stability. Weaknesses in delivering public services and ensuring accountability persist in some countries. In 2006, 12 countries successfully held elections for head of state, including Mexico where conservative Felipe Calder\u00f3n narrowly defeated leftist Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez Obrador. In 2006, conservative Felipe Calder\u00f3n won over leftist Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez Obrador in Mexico's election, leading to protests. Several countries in Latin America and the Caribbean saw re-elections or former leaders returning to power. The region experienced economic growth, with a GDP decline in 2002 and modest growth in 2003, but a significant rebound in 2004 with a growth rate of 5.9%. Most countries in the region saw positive economic growth and an increase in per capita income. In 2004, Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela saw significant economic growth despite recent recessions. In 2005, growth continued at 4.5%, with several countries registering growth rates over 8%. Guyana was the only country to experience an economic setback of 3%. Projections for 2006 show a growth rate of 5.3% for the region, with countries like Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, and Venezuela leading the way. Challenges persist in the Andean region, including political unrest in Bolivia and security threats in Colombia. In recent years, political unrest has been prevalent in Latin America. This includes the resignation of presidents in 2003 and 2005. The election of Evo Morales as president of Bolivia in 2005 complicated U.S. relations due to his efforts to decriminalize coca growing. In Ecuador, Rafael Correa, a left-leaning economist, won the 2006 presidential elections and aims to reform the political system and assert state control over foreign oil companies. Venezuela, under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has faced political polarization, with Ch\u00e1vez's rule being strengthened through various elections and referendum victories. In Peru, former President Alan Garcia's electoral victory in June 2006 eased U.S. concerns about democracy and relations. Central American countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua have strengthened democratic institutions but face challenges like violent crime and poverty. Guatemala has improved human rights policies, while Nicaragua still has significant issues. In Nicaragua, former President Daniel Ortega won the 2006 election with uncertain government plans. Haiti faces ongoing political challenges despite new elections in 2006. Rene Preval won the 2006 election in Haiti, focusing on building institutions and attracting foreign investment for job creation. Meanwhile, Cuba saw political uncertainty as Fidel Castro temporarily ceded power to his brother. Several Caribbean nations, including Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba, were affected by devastating storms in 2004 and 2005. The AIDS epidemic also remains a concern in the region. In the 109th Congress, legislative focus on Latin America and the Caribbean included counternarcotics efforts, trade issues, challenges to democracy in Venezuela, political stability in Haiti, political change in Cuba, and cooperation on migration and anti-terrorism measures. The United States provided around $5 billion for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) from FY2000-FY2006 to support Colombia's efforts against drug trafficking and terrorism. The ACI is a U.S. program supporting Colombia's efforts against drug trafficking and terrorism, with funding approved by the 109th Congress. In 2006, Congress considered funding for FY2007 with concerns about human rights and environmental impact. Additionally, legislation implementing DR-CAFTA was approved in July 2005. In 2005, the Bush Administration implemented the DR-CAFTA agreement to create jobs and attract foreign investment in the region. Congressional consideration of the agreement was controversial, with opposition from labor advocates and industry groups. In 2006, FTAs were signed with Peru and Colombia, and negotiations for a U.S.-Panamanian FTA were completed. Congress also extended trade preferences for Andean imports and approved special trade preferences for imports from Haiti. Congress focused on supporting Haiti and addressing concerns about Venezuela's political direction under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The new government in Bolivia led by President Evo Morales complicated U.S. relations due to criticism of U.S. counternarcotics policy and close ties with Venezuela and Cuba. Congress continued to debate U.S. policy towards Communist Cuba, focusing on human rights and the effectiveness of the embargo in promoting political change. The U.S. Congress debated policies towards neighboring countries like Mexico, focusing on border security and migration issues. In 2005 and 2006, Congress approved legislation for identity card standards, border fence construction, and ground surveillance technologies. Immigration reform measures were also considered but not completed. Fidel Castro's announcement of ceding power to his brother could prompt a re-examination of U.S. policy towards Cuba. In 2006, separate immigration reform measures (H.R. 4437 and S. 2611) were considered by Congress. The House bill aimed to strengthen border controls and make unlawful presence a felony, while the Senate measure included enforcement measures and a guest worker program. U.S. foreign aid, administered by USAID, supports various activities in the region such as education, poverty reduction, health care, and counternarcotics efforts. The United States provides various forms of foreign aid to the Latin America and Caribbean region, including disaster mitigation, counternarcotics, HIV/AIDS prevention, food assistance, anti-terrorism assistance, and security assistance. In 2004, the U.S. provided disaster and reconstruction aid to Caribbean nations after devastating storms. Foreign aid to the region totaled around $1.82 billion in FY2005 and $1.68 billion in FY2006. The Millennium Challenge Account has also increased aid to countries like Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. The United States has approved five-year compacts with Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador for foreign assistance programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, including security, counternarcotics, economic development, and trade capacity building. Aid to the region has increased over the years, with a focus on counternarcotics since 2000. Current aid levels comprise about 11.8% of the worldwide FY2006 bilateral aid budget, with concerns about decreasing levels of aid expressed by Members of Congress. Appropriations for FY2007 are pending. The United States provides foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean through annual appropriations bills. In FY2006, the region received $1.68 billion, with the Andean region receiving the largest portion. The FY2007 request of $1.6 billion represents a decrease from the previous year, the lowest in over four decades. The FY2007 foreign assistance request for Latin America and the Caribbean is $1.6 billion, a 3% decrease from FY2006. The Development Assistance Account sees a 28% reduction, while Economic Support Funds and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative increase by 26% and 35% respectively. Aid programs aim to achieve goals like poverty reduction and economic growth, with a focus on combating infectious diseases and promoting child and maternal health. Additionally, trade assistance is included for DR-CAFTA countries, and Millennium Challenge Compacts are signed with Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. The FY2007 foreign assistance request for Latin America and the Caribbean is $1.6 billion, with aid programs focusing on poverty reduction, economic growth, combating infectious diseases, and promoting child and maternal health. Various programs such as Economic Support Funds, Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, trade assistance for DR-CAFTA countries, and Millennium Challenge Compacts are included to support these goals. Additionally, assistance is provided in areas such as justice sector reforms, local governance, anti-corruption, human rights, counternarcotics, and foreign military financing. The House passed H.R. 5522, cutting the President's overall request for foreign assistance worldwide by $2.4 billion, potentially affecting aid levels to Latin America. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up its bill on June 29, 2006, with three continuing resolutions maintaining funding into 2007. Some Latin American countries have been affected by a cutoff of U.S. assistance due to not signing Article 98 agreements exempting U.S. citizens from the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction. The American Service Members Protection Act (ASPA) applies the aid cutoff to FMF and IMET funds, but the FY2007 Defense Authorization measure modified ASPA to end the ban on IMET aid to ICC member countries. The FY2005 and FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations acts extended the prohibition to ESF assistance for countries that are members of the ICC and do not have Article 98 agreements. Colombia has signed an agreement, while others like Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela could see their assistance withheld. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) provides aid grants to low-income nations with strong policy reform records. In Latin America, Bolivia, Honduras, and Nicaragua were eligible in the first round, with El Salvador becoming eligible in FY2006. In 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation approved compacts with Honduras and Nicaragua, and in 2006 with El Salvador. Guyana and Paraguay received assistance to become eligible for MCC compacts. The Administration's FY2007 MCC request was cut by the House and Senate. U.S. support against HIV/AIDS in Latin America is led by USAID, with contributions to the Global Fund. The House and Senate foreign operations bills meet the Administration's request for HIV/AIDS programs, but the House reduces funding for malaria by $47 million. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) is the primary U.S. program addressing counternarcotics in the Andean region, supporting Plan Colombia to combat drug trafficking and related guerrilla activity. The ACI program is regional, providing assistance to Colombia and six neighboring countries. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) receives approximately $5 billion in funding from FY2000 to FY2006. The Administration requested $721.5 million for FY2007, with $65.7 million proposed for the Critical Flight Safety Program. The House passed H.R. 5522, making changes to foreign aid to Colombia by providing funding from traditional aid accounts and creating the Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund. The bill provides $545.2 million for Colombia, an increase of $80.4 million over the FY2006 level. $135 million in Economic Support Funds (ESF) is allocated for alternative development, with $26.2 million in International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funds for rule of law programs. Drug interdiction programs receive $313.9 million in funding. $70.2 million is earmarked for the Critical Flight Safety Program in Colombia. The bill allocates $70.2 million for the Critical Flight Safety Program in Colombia, $10.5 million above the request for Peru, and cuts $15 million from Bolivia's interdiction programs due to concerns about their commitment to fighting drugs. Funding for alternative development in Bolivia is set at $31 million, with $20 million for interdiction. ACI funding for Brazil, Ecuador, and Panama remains the same as the request, while $1 million requested for Venezuela was not provided. Additionally, a new Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund is created with a total amount provided of $522 million. The bill transfers $62.5 million of ACI funds to a new account for use in ACI countries, reducing the total ACI funding to $699.4 million in the Senate bill. The decrease includes funds for a Democracy Fund and cuts to interdiction activities and the Critical Flight Safety Program. Both House and Senate bills maintain reporting requirements from previous appropriations bills, with Congress passing continuing resolutions to maintain funding into 2007. In FY2006, Congress passed the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (H.R. 3057, P.L. 109-102) providing $734.5 million for assistance to Colombia, with reductions in funding for certain programs. Critics argue that U.S. assistance to Colombia focuses too much on military aid. Critics argue that U.S. assistance to Colombia overemphasizes military and counter-drug aid, neglecting human rights protection and alternative development projects. The DR-CAFTA agreement was signed by multiple countries and faced a close vote in the U.S. Congress before being signed into law in 2005. The DR-CAFTA agreement was signed by multiple countries and ratified by all except Costa Rica. Implementation delays occurred, with the Dominican Republic expected to comply in 2007. Costa Rica still faces ratification challenges in its National Assembly. President Arias is expected to support the agreement if passed, but opposition remains uncertain. The DR-CAFTA is a regional trade agreement with comprehensive coverage of market access tariff reductions and non-tariff barriers. It replaces previous unilateral trade arrangements and has faced controversy. Supporters believe it can enhance intraregional trade and have long-term benefits. DR-CAFTA faced opposition due to concerns over poor labor standards, inadequate labor laws, and lax enforcement. Critics also highlighted issues with investor-state and pharmaceutical data protection sections. Approval was narrowly achieved, with added concerns from import-sensitive industry groups. President Bush initiated negotiations for a bilateral FTA with Panama in 2003. Negotiations for a bilateral FTA with Panama began in April 2004 and concluded in December 2006 after delays due to agriculture issues and the Panama Canal expansion referendum. With the Trade Promotion Authority set to expire on July 1, 2007, both sides hastened to find common ground. Panama's services-based economy set it apart in trade negotiations with the United States. The U.S.-Panama FTA is a comprehensive agreement with 88% of U.S. exports duty-free immediately. Tariffs on most farm products phased out over 15 years. Panama recognized U.S. food safety inspection standards, expediting meat and poultry exports. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) was signed on April 12, 2006, by U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and Peruvian Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism Alfredo Ferrero Diez Canseco. Negotiations began in May 2004 as part of a U.S.-Andean free trade agreement, with Peru continuing talks with the U.S. after negotiations with other countries failed. President Bush notified Congress of his intention to enter into the agreement on January 6, 2006. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) was signed in April 2006. The PTPA would be considered by Congress under the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002, with no time limit for submission. The Peruvian Congress approved the PTPA in June 2006. The agreement's labor provisions are controversial, with supporters citing Peru's ratification of ILO core labor standards. Critics argue about the potential economic impact on the U.S. due to Peru's smaller economy. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) was signed in April 2006 and would reinforce Peru's labor reform measures. Critics argue for enforceable ILO labor standards, while policymakers consider Peru's commitments to labor reforms and poverty alleviation. Without the PTPA, Peruvian goods entering the U.S. would face higher duties. Representative Portman and Colombia's Minister of Trade, Industry, and Tourism announced the conclusion of a U.S.-Colombia bilateral free trade agreement. Negotiations for the agreement began after the Peru Trade Promotion Agreement was concluded. The final text of the agreement was completed on July 8, 2006, and signed on November 22, 2006. The agreement was subject to TPA authority, which was set to expire on July 1, 2007. The CTPA, if ratified, would have a small economic effect on the US due to Colombia's smaller economy. The ATPA, which provides duty-free treatment to Colombian imports, is set to expire in June 2007. Without the CTPA, Colombian products may face higher duties in the US market. President Uribe urged an extension of ATPA, supported by President Bush. The Bush Administration and President Uribe aim to extend the trade preferences program as a temporary measure to reduce tariffs from Andean countries, with the long-term goal of a free trade agreement for permanent tariff reductions. The proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) has faced delays due to differences between the United States and Brazil, the co-chairs of the Trade Negotiating Committee. The United States and Brazil have not been able to define how a two-tier approach for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) would work. The resistance to the FTAA was evident at the fourth Summit of the Americas in 2005, where Latin America was divided on how to proceed. At the fourth Summit of the Americas in 2005, Latin America was divided over how to proceed with the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). 29 countries supported restarting negotiations, while Mercosur countries rejected setting a specific date in 2006, arguing that conditions were not yet suitable. Venezuela joined Mercosur and lobbied to end further FTAA efforts, calling for unified resistance against U.S. policies in the region. This may make it harder for the U.S. to isolate its negative influence on FTAA negotiations. The Summit declaration highlighted concerns about the FTAA process and the impact of the upcoming WTO Doha Round on agricultural issues. With both the FTAA and WTO talks facing challenges, the future of U.S. trade policy in the region is uncertain. Following the 9/11 attacks, U.S. focus on terrorism in Latin America increased, leading to enhanced bilateral and regional cooperation. Following the 9/11 attacks, nations strongly condemned the attacks and took action through the Organization of American States to strengthen hemispheric cooperation. In June 2002, OAS members signed an Inter-American Convention Against Terrorism to improve regional cooperation, including denying safe haven to suspected terrorists. President Bush submitted the convention to the Senate in mid-November 2002, and it was ratified on November 15, 2005. The OAS also reinvigorated the Inter-American Committee on Terrorism (CICTE) in response to the attacks. The OAS reinvigorated the Inter-American Committee on Terrorism (CICTE) after 9/11 to cooperate in preventing terrorist acts. The CICTE has programs on cyber security, port security, airport security, legislation against terrorism, customs and border protection, terrorist financing, and terrorism policy engagement exercises. The State Department highlighted terrorist threats in Colombia, Peru, and the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, where Hizballah and Hamas fundraising activities have been reported. Terrorism in the Western Hemisphere is primarily linked to narcoterrorist organizations in Colombia and radical leftist Andean groups. The report stated that Islamic extremist groups do not have an operational presence in Latin America. Cuba is still considered a state sponsor of terrorism, while Venezuela has stopped cooperating in the global war on terror and has close relations with Cuba and Iran. The US prohibited the sale of defense articles to Venezuela due to its lack of antiterrorism cooperation. Other countries on the prohibited list include Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. The United States has provided Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) training and equipment to Latin American countries including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. ATA financing is provided through the State Department for improving capabilities in airport security, hostage negotiations, bomb detection, and countering terrorism financing. Funding for FY2005 was $7.9 million, with $5.1 million for training anti-kidnapping units in Colombia. For FY2006, an estimated $12.3 million was provided for the Western Hemisphere, with $5.3 million for Colombia and $1.5 million for the Bahamas. The FY2007 request was for $11.9 million, with $3.1 million for. In FY2007, the US requested $11.9 million for the Western Hemisphere, with allocations for Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. The House approved a resolution expressing concerns about Islamic terrorist organizations in the region and urged the creation of a task force to combat their activities. In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the impact of crime and gang violence in Central America, particularly the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang. Over 1,200 MS-13 members have been arrested in the US since February 2005, raising concerns about transnational gang activities. Central American citizens view crime and gang violence as major issues, while governments in the region struggle to address these challenges along with issues like police corruption and weak judicial systems. Gang violence poses threats to political stability, social development, and foreign investment in Central America. Illicit gang activities in Central America may accelerate illegal immigration, drug smuggling, and trafficking to the United States. Analysts predict an increase in gang-related violent crime unless root causes such as poverty, joblessness, and social exclusion are addressed. Legislation introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to increase cooperation among U.S., Mexican, and Central American officials in tracking gang activity and handling deported gang members. Legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to increase cooperation among U.S., Mexican, and Central American officials in tracking gang activity and handling deported gang members. The OAS passed a resolution to address the gang issue through conferences and workshops, urging member states to support holistic solutions. The U.S. government created a task force to develop a comprehensive strategy to deal with international gang activity, focusing on diplomacy, repatriation, law enforcement, capacity enhancement, and prevention. The AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America is negatively impacting economic and social development. High infection rates in countries like Haiti, the Bahamas, and Honduras pose a threat to future development prospects. Efforts to combat criminal gang activity internationally should be coordinated with domestic policies to strengthen penalties for gang-related crime. The response to the AIDS epidemic in the Caribbean and Central America involves support from governments, donors, and NGOs. USAID has been leading the fight against the epidemic since 1986, with funding increasing from $11.2 million in FY2000 to $33.8 million in FY2003. U.S. assistance for HIV/AIDS in the region rose to $47 million due to the inclusion of Guyana and Haiti in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In FY2004, U.S. assistance for HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean and Central America increased to $47 million, reaching $82.5 million in FY2005 and an estimated $92.7 million in FY2006. The Administration requested $113 million for FY2007, with $88 million allocated for Guyana and Haiti through the GHAI funding. Some Members of Congress proposed adding 14 Caribbean countries to the list of focus countries for increased HIV/AIDS assistance, but no action was taken in the 109th Congress. The 109th Congress approved legislation providing assistance for orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries, including the Caribbean. Other legislative initiatives not considered included establishing pediatric centers in developing countries for children with HIV/AIDS and providing assistance to combat infectious diseases in Haiti. Afro-Latinos, along with women and indigenous populations, are advocating for increased rights and representation in Latin America. Afro-Latinos, descendants of West African slaves, seek political representation, human rights, and land rights with international support. They are marginalized in Latin America, comprising a majority in Cuba and the Dominican Republic, and a significant minority in other countries. US foreign policy has not prioritized assistance for Afro-Latinos. US foreign aid programs benefit Afro-Latino populations through various agencies like USAID, the State Department, the Inter-American Foundation, the Peace Corps, and the National Endowment for Democracy. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to address injustices faced by Afro-Latino communities, with specific concerns raised about Afro-Colombians affected by the conflict in Colombia. Legislation introduced in Congress, such as H.R. 4886 and H.Res. 822, aimed to help Colombian nationals, including Afro-Colombians affected by the conflict, by providing Temporary Protected Status and recognizing peace-building efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee report for FY2007 sought to ensure that U.S. assistance to Colombia did not violate the land and property rights of Afro-Colombians. Additionally, efforts were made to combat human trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced labor. Human trafficking is a lucrative criminal activity that is a major concern for the United States and the international community. It affects nearly every country and region in the world, with Latin America emerging as a growing problem area. Trafficking victims from South and Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union, and Latin America are trafficked for prostitution, forced labor, and domestic servitude. Latin America serves as a source, transit, and destination for trafficking victims, including those trafficked to the United States. Traffickers target poor young people with minimal education in politically unstable countries. Human trafficking is a major concern globally, affecting countries with political instability, high unemployment, and corruption. Organized criminal groups exploit undocumented migrants, especially in the U.S.-Mexico border region. Congress has passed laws to combat trafficking, leading to significant anti-trafficking assistance provided to foreign governments. The State Department releases annual reports on human trafficking, categorizing countries based on their efforts to combat it. Tier 3 countries are those that have not made sufficient efforts to address trafficking. In 2005, Bolivia, Ecuador, Jamaica, Venezuela, and Cuba were placed on Tier 3 for not adequately combating trafficking, with only Venezuela and Cuba facing sanctions. In 2006, Belize, Cuba, and Venezuela were Tier 3 countries in Latin America, while Brazil and Mexico were on the Tier 2 Watch List. Belize avoided sanctions due to counter-trafficking efforts, but Venezuela and Cuba were sanctioned. The Senate approved the ratification of the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, with the US becoming a party in 2005. Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2005, allocating $361 million to combat trafficking. Argentina's restructuring of defaulted bond debt in 2005 showed recovery from economic crisis under President N\u00e9stor Kirchner's leadership. President Kirchner's moves in human rights, institutional reform, and economic policy have restored faith in democracy. Strong support was shown in the 2005 legislative elections. Economic growth has rebounded significantly, with Argentina paying off its debt to the IMF in 2006. Challenges remain in reducing poverty and controlling inflation. Kirchner's support for overturning amnesty laws has led to trials of former military officials. In the first trial since the Supreme Court's action, a former police commissioner in Buenos Aires was sentenced to life in prison. President Kirchner has urged the judicial system to prosecute past human rights violations more quickly. Concerns about death squads intimidating witnesses in human rights trials have been raised. Argentina's cooperation on counterterrorism and the investigation of the 1994 AMIA bombing are of interest to the U.S. Congress. In late October 2006, Iran was accused of masterminding the AMIA attack. In the AMIA case, Iran was accused of orchestrating the attack, leading to arrest warrants for former Iranian officials. Bolivia has faced political unrest with six presidents since 2001. President Evo Morales, of the MAS party, won the election in 2005 and implemented policies to decriminalize coca cultivation and nationalize the natural gas industry, pleasing his supporters but complicating relations. President Evo Morales' policies have pleased his supporters in Bolivia but complicated relations with neighboring countries, foreign investors, and the United States. His drug policy has led to record drug seizures but also increased coca cultivation levels. The nationalization of foreign energy companies has boosted state tax revenues but hindered foreign investment. However, progress on campaign pledges has been overshadowed by a domestic crisis between the MAS government and opposition leaders in wealthy eastern provinces. In August 2006, Bolivians hoped for constitutional reforms through the constituent assembly, but it is now in chaos. The eastern provinces protest against Morales' government, escalating tensions. US-Bolivian relations strain due to drug policies, ties with Venezuela, and nationalization measures. President Bush designates Bolivia as a major drug production country in September 2006. In September 2006, President Bush designated Bolivia as a major drug production country and expressed concerns about Morales' counternarcotics efforts. Congress provided $116.6 million in foreign assistance to Bolivia in FY2006, with $79.2 million for counternarcotics. The Administration proposed $99.8 million for Bolivia in FY2007, including $66 million for counternarcotics. Trade preferences for Bolivia were extended through June 30, 2007, along with Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru under the Andean Trade Preferences and Drug Eradication Act. In January 2007, Luis In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" da Silva, of the leftist Workers' Party (PT), was inaugurated for a second four-year term as President of Brazil after winning the run-off presidential election against Geraldo Alckmin. Lula captured 61% of the valid votes, continuing macroeconomic stability under his administration despite corruption scandals involving his party. President Lula, despite facing corruption scandals, maintained orthodox economic policies and achieved improvements in inflation, interest rates, and Brazil's credit rating. He passed social security and tax reforms in 2003, and a law to increase private investment in public projects in 2004. However, legislative progress stalled in 2005, and criticism arose for the lack of effective social programs addressing land redistribution, social inequality, and crime. Lula focused on cabinet appointments and forming a governing coalition. President Lula has been working on cabinet appointments and forming a coalition to push his agenda in Brazil's legislature. He aims to ally with the PMDB party and focus on boosting economic growth through structural reforms. Investigations against his PT party may affect his second term. Lula prioritizes relations with Mercosul and nontraditional partners over the US. Brazil's President Lula prioritizes relations with Mercosul and nontraditional partners like India and China. Trade issues are central to the U.S.-Brazilian relationship, with differences in trade liberalization approaches causing tensions. The U.S. is interested in Brazil's role in stabilizing Latin America, its nuclear enrichment capabilities, ethanol production, and cooperation on counternarcotics efforts and human rights. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, a strong U.S. ally, won re-election in 2006 with 62% of the vote. His second term has been marked by scandals, including investigations into alleged paramilitary ties of pro-Uribe congressmen. Colombia is a key recipient of U.S. foreign aid in Latin America, particularly for counternarcotics efforts. Congressional interest in Colombia focuses on human rights, trade, and counterterrorism assistance. The curr_chunk discusses human rights conditions, trade, U.S. assistance for counterterrorism, drug crop fumigation, alternative development, risk to U.S. personnel in Colombia, and demobilization talks. Colombia is a major producer of cocaine and heroin, with illegal armed groups involved in the drug trade. The United States indicted FARC commanders for drug trafficking in 2006. In 2004, Congress increased military personnel support for Plan Colombia. The United Nations reported a decline in opium poppy cultivation but an increase in coca cultivation in Colombia. In 2005, coca cultivation in Colombia increased by 26% according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Despite this, the State Department reported spraying 343,000 acres of coca and 4,000 acres of opium poppy to discourage replanting of illicit crops. The ONDCP reported a slight increase in cocaine prices in 2004, which critics questioned due to 2003 prices being the lowest since 1981. The Uribe Administration reached an agreement with AUC leaders in 2003 for paramilitary demobilization by 2005, with 31,000 demobilized by 2006. About 2,000 paramilitaries remain outside the disarmament process, raising accountability concerns. The demobilization process of paramilitaries in Colombia under the Justice and Peace Law raises concerns about accountability, reduced sentences, and potential reorganization of criminal enterprises. Critics worry about fighters operating outside the AUC umbrella and the lack of addressing criminal activities like narcotics trafficking. The demobilization process of paramilitaries in Colombia under the Justice and Peace Law raises concerns about accountability, reduced sentences, and potential reorganization of criminal enterprises. Colombia faces challenges in re-incorporating ex-fighters into civilian life and providing restitution to victims. The country's drug trafficking issue is worsened by humanitarian conditions resulting from decades of civil war. Colombia has a large population of internally displaced persons, with millions of IDPs and hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers. The United States began resettling Colombian refugees in 2002, with admissions declining in 2005 due to the REAL ID Act of 2005. The REAL ID Act of 2005 led to a decline in Colombian refugee admissions to the United States, with only 115 admitted in FY2006. The UNHCR stopped referring Colombians for resettlement due to this issue. Legislation introduced in 2006 aimed to allow admission for those who provided support to terrorist groups under duress. U.S. policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the country through economic sanctions. The U.S. policy towards Cuba involves economic sanctions and support for the Cuban people. There are different approaches on how to achieve the objective of promoting democracy and human rights on the island. Fidel Castro's temporary ceding of power in 2006 could lead to a re-evaluation of U.S. policy towards Cuba. In light of Fidel Castro's temporary transfer of power in 2006, there are two main policy approaches for the U.S. towards Cuba: maintaining the status quo of isolating the Cuban government while supporting the Cuban people, or engaging with the Cuban government and society. The 109th Congress approved five human rights resolutions and funded democracy projects in Cuba. Action on FY2007 appropriations measures was pending in 2007. The 109th Congress approved democracy projects in Cuba in FY2007. House and Senate bills had differing provisions on anti-drug cooperation and Cuba-related travel and sanctions. Various legislative initiatives aimed to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba in different ways. In the 109th Congress, various measures were proposed regarding Cuba, including trademark registrations, broadcasting, fugitives, sanctions on offshore oil development, support for diplomats, and scholarship programs. President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the Dominican Liberation Party is in a strong position, overseeing rapid economic growth and enjoying popular support. President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez of the Dominican Liberation Party oversees rapid economic growth, enjoys popular support, and has enacted fiscal reforms recommended by the International Monetary Fund. Analysts predict he has a good chance of being re-elected in 2008 if he addresses corruption, crime, and electricity shortages. Fern\u00e1ndez seeks to maintain ties with the United States and improve relations with Haiti, but has faced criticism for repatriating Haitian migrants and failing to comply with a 2005 ruling on identity documents for Dominicans of Haitian descent. The Dominican Republic approved the DR-CAFTA in 2005, with implementation postponed to 2007. President-elect Rafael Correa is set to take office in Ecuador in 2007 after winning the election decisively. Correa decisively won the election with 57% of the vote, promising to reform Ecuador by calling a constituent assembly, renegotiating debt, and asserting state control over foreign oil companies. However, his lack of representation in the legislature may hinder his agenda, causing concerns among foreign investors. Ecuador's relations with the United States have been strained due to trade disputes and the suspension of negotiations for a free trade agreement. President Correa's victory has raised concerns in the U.S. regarding his ties with Venezuela and his policies on trade, energy, and counternarcotics. Correa's plans to raise taxes and exert more state control over foreign oil companies could further complicate relations with the U.S. Ecuador's strained relations with the United States include the refusal to restart FTA negotiations and the decision not to renew the lease on the U.S. air base at Manta. President-elect Correa opposes U.S. involvement in Plan Colombia and has criticized Colombian actions on Ecuadorian territory. Analysts suggest a similar approach to Correa's government as with Morales in Bolivia. President Saca of El Salvador, from the conservative National Republican Alliance (ARENA) party, aims to revive the country's economy, pass legislation in a polarized political environment, and address gang violence. The leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) continues to oppose his legislative agenda. President Saca of El Salvador, from the conservative National Republican Alliance (ARENA) party, faces challenges in passing legislation due to a lack of majority in the legislature. Despite tough anti-gang measures, El Salvador has high murder rates. President Saca's approval ratings are mixed, with support for his job performance but disapproval of maintaining soldiers in Iraq. The United States is collaborating with El Salvador on combating narco-trafficking, immigration, and promoting free trade through DR-CAFTA. In 2006, the Bush Administration extended Temporary Protected Status for Salvadoran migrants in the US. El Salvador implemented DR-CAFTA with the US and signed a $461 million compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Salvadoran government sought assistance from the US to address criminal gangs. US policy focused on promoting stability and democracy in Haiti. The Bush Administration extended Temporary Protected Status for Salvadoran migrants in the US in 2006. El Salvador implemented DR-CAFTA with the US and signed a $461 million compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Salvadoran government sought US assistance to address criminal gangs. US policy focused on promoting stability and democracy in Haiti, hoping for an elected government to improve infrastructure, reduce violence, and achieve other goals such as promoting democracy, human rights, alleviating poverty, and decreasing narcotics trafficking. Former President Rene Preval won the 2006 elections in Haiti amidst controversy and outlined his government's missions of building institutions and creating. Former President Rene Preval of Haiti emphasized the importance of building institutions, creating conditions for private investment, and promoting dialogue among all sectors. He requested the United Nations Stabilization Mission to stay and proposed a constitutional change to dissolve the Haitian army. Preval prioritized the needs of Haitian children and sought international assistance from UNICEF. He also pledged cooperation with U.S. counternarcotics efforts and requested support for public works projects and trade preferences legislation. The 109th Congress passed the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement/HOPE Act for Haiti on December 9, 2006. The Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement/HOPE Act of 2006 (H.R. 6142) was incorporated into H.R. 6111 (P.L. 109-432, Division D, Title V) to expand U.S. preferential trade for Haiti. Supporters believed it could create 40,000 jobs in Haiti, but some U.S. textile interests opposed it due to preferences for garments with components from China and Asia. The incoming Senate Finance Committee Chairman promised a hearing in the 110th Congress to address concerns before the HOPE Act takes effect. The legislation had stricter rules for apparel components' country of origin compared to the Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act (HERO, H.R. 4211/S. 1937). The House International Relations Committee approved the Haiti Economic and Infrastructure Reconstruction Act (H.R. 611) in 2006, aiming to recruit Haitian-Americans to assist in reforming education, judicial, and healthcare systems in Haiti. The bill would have allocated $3 million annually from FY2006 to FY2011 for a USAID program and provided scholarship loans to Haitian students, forgivable upon their return to Haiti for revitalization efforts. Some Members hoped to pass the bill before the end of the 109th Congress. The Bush Administration allocated $194 million for Haiti in FY2006 and requested $198 million for FY2007. Congress provided an additional $20 million in emergency funds. Former President Aristide acknowledged Preval as president and expressed a desire to return from exile. Preval publicly acknowledges Aristide's right to return but suggests he may face charges. Privately, he agrees with diplomats that Aristide's return could be destabilizing. International donors pledged $750 million for Haiti's reconstruction projects. Donors are working with the Haitian government to develop a poverty reduction plan and ensure transparency in funding distribution. Honduras faces challenges in crime, human rights, and economic conditions. Manuel Zelaya of the Liberal Party became president in 2005, succeeding Ricardo Maduro. Zelaya's efforts to address youth gang violence faced obstacles due to lack of majority in Congress. The Zelaya government in Honduras is using various techniques to convince gang members to give up violence and re-integrate into society. They have also resorted to traditional crime control efforts like arresting gang members and have plans to hire more police officers. However, there is criticism from human rights organizations regarding proposed reforms to the national police force law, fearing militarization of the police. The United States has a close relationship with Honduras, including foreign assistance, trade partnership, military presence, and cooperation on transnational issues. Honduras is part of the DR-CAFTA trade agreement. The U.S.-Honduras trade agreement was approved by both countries' Congresses in 2005. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Hondurans in the U.S. was extended until 2007. The U.S. included the Honduran port of Puerto Cortes in the Container Security Initiative. Honduras planned to convert the Soto Cano Air Base into a commercial air cargo terminal. In July, a Honduran military official announced plans to build a new military aircraft refueling facility in the Mosquito Coast region with U.S. support for anti-drug operations. However, in October 2006, the Honduran Defense Minister suggested that converting Soto Cano into a cargo terminal would be financially unviable. Felipe Calder\u00f3n of the National Action Party (PAN) became Mexico's president in December 2006, succeeding Vicente Fox. Calder\u00f3n narrowly defeated Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in the July 2 election, which was challenged but upheld by Mexico's Federal Electoral Tribunal. President Calder\u00f3n, who succeeded Vicente Fox in December 2006, focused on budget cuts and combating drug trafficking in his early administration. His proposal included reducing salaries of high-ranking officials, except military personnel, to save over $2 billion for social programs. He later reconsidered cuts in education and deployed soldiers and police to Michoac\u00e1n to address drug violence, offering 10,000 soldiers to assist federal police in fighting drug cartels. In September 2006, Congress approved the Secure Fence Act of 2006 to authorize the construction of a border fence along the U.S.-Mexico border. Both the House and Senate approved immigration reform measures in the second session of the 109th Congress, but did not enact comprehensive reform due to differences between the two measures. In May 2005, Congress passed the REAL ID Act of 2005 to strengthen border control and establish identity card standards for drivers' licenses. In March 2006, an action plan was signed to combat border violence with increased cooperation between law enforcement agencies. In August 2006, U.S. and Mexican border governors agreed to share crime data. In March 2005, the trilateral Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) of North America was established by President Bush, President Fox, and Prime Minister Martin of Canada. In August 2006, the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) working groups submitted their second report to SPP leaders outlining completed initiatives and proposing new initiatives for common security and prosperity. The working groups have established an Avian and Human Pandemic Influenza Coordinating Body and a North American Competitiveness Council. Increased cooperation between U.S. and Mexican Customs officials on money laundering has resulted in the seizure of millions of dollars. Mexico has implemented the Sea Cargo Initiative to gather data electronically before loading at a port of origin. Mexico and the United States have implemented measures to facilitate trade and enhance border security. Despite being important trading partners, disputes exist between the two countries, such as the issue of Mexican trucks accessing U.S. highways. The United States has initiated WTO dispute settlement proceedings over Mexico's tax on soft drinks made with high fructose corn syrup. In November 2005, Mexico extended the tax on HFCS products, while the WTO upheld a decision in favor of the United States in March 2006. A sweetener agreement was reached between Mexico and the United States in August 2006, allowing for duty-free sugar exports from Mexico to the U.S. and HFCS exports from the U.S. to Mexico. Additionally, the Bush Administration praised Mexico's counternarcotics efforts under Fox. In March 2006, Mexico was reported as the leading transit country for cocaine and the leading foreign supplier of methamphetamine and marijuana. President Fox vetoed counternarcotics legislation in May 2006, including a provision that some said decriminalized small amounts of drugs for personal use. The U.S. Coast Guard captured the head of the Tijuana cartel off the coast of Baja California, and Mexico extradited his brother to the United States in September 2006. In November 2005, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that life imprisonment without parole is not cruel and unusual punishment, allowing for the extradition of criminals to the United States. A January 2006 ruling streamlined extradition requests under the 1978 bilateral treaty, leading to a record high of 50 extraditions in 2006. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act bars assistance to countries refusing to extradite individuals accused of killing U.S. law enforcement officers. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act bars assistance to countries that refuse to extradite individuals accused of killing U.S. law enforcement officers. The House-passed version of the FY2007 Foreign Operations appropriations bill, H.R. 5522, would also prohibit State Department funds to countries that do not extradite indicted individuals. The 110th Congress will need to complete action on foreign aid appropriations in early 2007. Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega was elected President on November 5, 2006. Former President Daniel Ortega was elected President on November 5, 2006, after serving as an opposition leader. Ortega's victory was facilitated by a change in Nicaraguan electoral law and a divided opposition. The new law required a candidate to win either 40% of valid votes or 35% plus at least 5% more votes than the second-place candidate to avoid a run-off election. Ortega won with 37.9% of the vote, avoiding a run-off. Ortega won the election with 37.9% of the vote, avoiding a run-off due to his 9.6% lead over the next candidate. Observers are uncertain about Ortega's government positions, as he oscillated between anti-U.S. rhetoric and promises of respecting private property and pursuing free-trade policies. Montealegre, who gained 28.3% of the vote, is seen as the U.S.-favored candidate and will have a seat in the legislature. Ortega won the election with 37.9% of the vote, avoiding a run-off. Montealegre, seen as the U.S.-favored candidate, gained 28.3% of the vote and will have a seat in the legislature. The Constitutional Liberal party candidate Jos\u00e9 Rizo came in third with 26.2%. The FSLN will have 38 seats in the National Assembly, the PLC 25, the ALN 22, and the MRS 5. The pre-election process in Nicaragua faced challenges such as errors on voter registry lists and difficulties obtaining voter identification cards. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided $12 million for election support activities. Critics accused U.S. officials and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of trying to influence the election. U.S. Ambassador Paul Trivelli defended his right to comment on the elections despite calls to stop. The elections followed political tensions among President Enrique Bola\u00f1os, the Sandinista party, and rightist allies. During political tensions in Nicaragua, President Bola\u00f1os invoked the OAS Inter-American Democratic Charter to negotiate with the Sandinista party and allies of former President Alem\u00e1n. Alem\u00e1n was convicted of fraud and money-laundering, but still controlled the PLC party. Ortega broke a power-sharing pact with the PLC, leading to legislative reforms in 2006. In Nicaragua, political tensions led to negotiations between President Bola\u00f1os and the Sandinista party. Ortega and Bola\u00f1os agreed to postpone constitutional amendments transferring executive powers to the legislature. The National Assembly approved DR-CAFTA in 2005, aiming to promote economic growth and job creation. Nicaragua, the second poorest nation in the hemisphere, faces widespread poverty with little improvement in social indicators since 1993. In 2005, the Bush Administration signed a $175 million agreement with Nicaragua for rural development. Military assistance was suspended and later resumed after an agreement to destroy anti-aircraft missiles. The National Assembly passed a law authorizing the missiles' destruction, but they were not destroyed. Nicaragua hosted a meeting on regional security concerns in 2006. Resolution of property claims and immigration are contentious issues in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations. Nicaragua passed a law in 2007 creating a new Property Institute to address property claim lawsuits from the 1980s. U.S. immigration bills proposed criminalizing unlawful presence and combining enforcement with guest-worker provisions. Nicaragua, along with other Central American governments, criticized U.S. border enforcement efforts and demanded guest-worker programs. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was extended for about 4,000 eligible Nicaraguans living in the U.S. The Central American nation of Panama has made political and economic progress since the 1989 U.S. military intervention. President Mart\u00edn Torrijos, son of former leader General Omar Torrijos, was elected in 2004. Key issues for Congress include human rights, civilian control over defense policy, combating transnational crimes, judicial system reform, and good governance. President Mart\u00edn Torrijos won the 2004 election with nearly 48% of the vote, succeeding a president tainted by corruption scandals. His government faced challenges such as social security funding deficits, Panama Canal expansion, and addressing unemployment and poverty. Despite protests and strikes in 2005, plans for social security reform were adjusted. In 2006, ambitious plans were unveiled to double the Canal's capacity, leading to a referendum in October of that year. A constitutionally required referendum on the Panama Canal expansion project was held in October 2006, with 78% of voters supporting it. The United States has a strong relationship with Panama, including cooperation on counternarcotics efforts, security of the Canal, and negotiations for a free trade agreement. The US provided $19 million in foreign aid in FY2005, $14.4 million in FY2006, and requested $17.4 million in FY2007. After 10 rounds of negotiations, a free trade agreement was concluded between the US and Panama. The United States and Panama concluded a free trade agreement on December 19, 2006 after 10 rounds of negotiations. U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab mentioned that the agreement is subject to further discussions on labor. Panama sought the FTA to increase U.S. investment, while the Bush Administration emphasized that it would strengthen support for democracy and the rule of law. President Alan Garcia of Peru also embraced a free trade agreement with the U.S. and took steps to assure the international financial community. President Alan Garcia of Peru is taking steps to assure the international financial community that he is governing as a moderate. His earlier presidency was marked by hyper-inflation and a violent insurgency. Despite initial public support, his party's poor showing in recent elections reflects a drop in popularity. Garcia defeated populist Ollanta Humala in 2006 and was seen as the \"lesser of two evils\" in the second round. President Alan Garcia of Peru defeated populist Ollanta Humala in 2006, being seen as \"the lesser of two evils\" in the second round. Garcia capitalized on a backlash against Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who supported Humala. Concerns were raised about Humala's authoritarian tendencies and his past military actions. Previous President Alejandro Toledo had high economic growth rates but low popularity. Garcia aims to continue pro-market economic policies. President Alan Garcia of Peru defeated populist Ollanta Humala in 2006, continuing pro-market economic policies. Garcia aims to use trade to reduce poverty and widen economic growth distribution. Former President Alberto Fujimori faced legal issues but tried to return to Peru for presidency. Fujimori's alliance won seats in the legislature and is pushing for his exoneration. Peru's prosecutor's office criticized Fujimori's delaying tactics, expecting a decision from Chilean courts in April. Issues in U.S.-Peruvian relations include trade, drugs, security, and democracy. The United States completed negotiations for a free trade agreement with Peru in December 2005, and an agreement was signed in April 2006. The Peruvian legislature ratified the agreement in June. Some Members of the U.S. Congress have expressed concern over unresolved trade disputes with Peru and whether International Labor Organization standards should be included. Both the House and Senate held mock mark-ups of the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement in July 2006, but did not vote on the measure before the end of the 109th Congress. Congress did pass an extension of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (P.L. 109-432, Division D, Title VII) in December 2006 for six months, with a further six-month extension possible if a country enters into a free trade agreement with the United States. Peru, a major illicit drug-producing country, faces challenges with coca planting surpassing eradication efforts. The government has engaged in dialogue with coca growers and pledged to extradite drug traffickers to the United States. The Shining Path, an extremist group, remains active in coca-growing regions. The U.S. requested $98.5 million in FY2007 for anti-drug efforts in Peru, significantly less than what Colombia receives. Under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela has undergone significant political changes, with concerns raised about democratic institutions and freedom of speech. Ch\u00e1vez has survived coup attempts and a recall referendum. Under President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela has seen political changes, including his victory in the 2006 presidential elections with 63% of the vote. The government's economic boom, fueled by rising oil prices, has allowed for increased spending on social programs. Relations with the United States have been strained due to concerns about Ch\u00e1vez's military purchases, alliances with Cuba and Iran, and efforts to spread his populist ideology in Latin America. The U.S. policymakers faced a dilemma on how to encourage democratic principles in Venezuela without taking sides in the political conflict. In the 109th Congress, funding was allocated for democracy initiatives and assistance under the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The Administration requested funding for ACI, Economic Support Funds, and International Military Education and Training for FY2007. The House-passed bill did not provide ACI funding for Venezuela, while the Senate recommended full funding for ACI and ESF. Final action on FY2007 foreign aid appropriations was not completed by the end of the year, leaving the 110th Congress to finish in 2007. Two resolutions on Venezuela were approved in the 109th Congress, condemning Venezuela's failures in narcotics control and President Ch\u00e1vez's anti-American rhetoric. Other legislative initiatives, including funding for democracy programs in Venezuela, were not completed before the end of the 109th Congress. The 109th Congress approved resolutions condemning Venezuela's failures in narcotics control and President Ch\u00e1vez's anti-American rhetoric. Legislative initiatives for democracy programs in Venezuela were not completed before the end of the Congress."
