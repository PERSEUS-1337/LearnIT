Congress finds that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has failed to adequately consider alternative programs to centralized vehicle emission testing programs and provide adequate credit to States for these programs. The purpose of this title is to require the Administrator to reassess determinations regarding the equivalency of centralized and decentralized programs and issue new regulations governing these programs. The purpose of this title is to require the Administrator to issue new regulations governing decentralized testing programs with minimum disruption to States' compliance with the Act and providing them a reasonable opportunity to comply. SEC. 102. IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED VEHICLE INSPECTION PROGRAMS. The text chunk discusses the postponement of implementing an enhanced vehicle inspection program under the Clean Air Act for 2 years after the enactment of the Act. It also mentions the rescinding of regulations related to the program and reassessment of determinations by the Administrator during this period. The regulations issued under paragraph (1)(B)(ii) will make the program described in subsection (a) available to States for centralized operation, in line with the Clean Air Act. The regulations will allow States to operate the program described in subsection (a) either centrally or on a decentralized basis. States must meet criteria to show that a decentralized program is as effective as a centralized one. States can submit a new plan revision based on the new regulations, replacing any previous submissions. The regulations provide States with a schedule to implement plan revisions. Judicial review may set aside unsupported regulations. Sanctions cannot be imposed until the Administrator fulfills requirements. The regulations prohibit adverse actions against a State for failing to implement a program under certain Acts and regulations. The regulations, also known as the \"general conformity rule,\" allow decentralized programs to be considered equivalent to centralized programs for certain purposes under the Clean Air Act. Additionally, amendments are made to vehicle inspection and maintenance requirements in ozone transport regions. The regulations amend vehicle inspection and maintenance requirements in ozone transport regions, including enhanced programs for serious, severe, or extreme areas. TITLE II--REDESIGNATION OF ATTAINMENT AREAS\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that in 1988, there was a climatological anomaly with unprecedented high temperatures leading to frequent ozone air pollution episodes. The number of ozone pollution exceedance days was significantly higher in 1988 compared to subsequent years. The Environmental Protection Agency identified 98 regions as ozone nonattainment areas in a 3-year measurement that included 1988 data. In 1988, there was a climatological anomaly with high temperatures causing ozone pollution. The EPA identified 98 regions as nonattainment areas. Previously designated nonattainment regions achieved ozone attainment for consecutive years 1991-1993. Section 107(d)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act is amended to allow immediate redesignation of areas from nonattainment to attainment if the Governor submits a redesignation based on meeting air quality standards for 3 consecutive years."
