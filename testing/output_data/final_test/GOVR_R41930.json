    "content": "The federal mail and wire fraud statutes are powerful tools for prosecutors, often criticized for their broad application but effective in ending schemes that defraud victims of millions or billions of dollars. These statutes outlaw fraudulent schemes using mail or wire communications, causing concerns about due process and federalism. The federal mail and wire fraud statutes prohibit fraudulent schemes using mail or wire communications, with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, or up to 30 years for certain circumstances. Victims are entitled to restitution, and property forfeiture may occur. The mail fraud statute originated in the late 19th century to prevent fraud through mail. The mail fraud statute was last amended in 1909 to include schemes to defraud another of honest services and the use of commercial postal carriers. The wire fraud statute, enacted in 1952, mirrors the provisions of the mail fraud statute. Changes in one statute usually correspond to changes in the other. Both statutes are essentially the same, except for the medium used for the offense. The wire fraud and mail fraud statutes are similar, with changes in one usually corresponding to changes in the other. Both require the government to prove the use of mail or wire communications in furtherance of a scheme to defraud another. The wire fraud statute applies to transmitting communications for this purpose, while the mail fraud statute applies to using the postal service for the same. The statutes require that a mailing or wire communication be in furtherance of a scheme to defraud. The mailing or communication need not be essential, as long as it is incident to an essential element of the scheme. It may be routine, innocent, or self-defeating, as long as it is part of the execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator. The element may be satisfied by mailings or communications designed to lull the victim into a false sense of security or make the transaction less suspect. The mail and wire fraud statutes prohibit any scheme to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses. Congress intended to reach a wide range of fraudulent schemes and has expanded the concept whenever doubts arose. The element may be satisfied by mailings or wire communications used to obtain the property which is the object of the fraud. A defendant need not personally have mailed or wired a communication; it is enough that he \"caused\" a mailing or transmission of a wire communication in the sense that the mailing or transmission was the reasonable foreseeable consequence of his intended scheme. The mail and wire fraud statutes prohibit any scheme to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses, encompassing schemes to defraud another of the right to honest services. The crime is committed when the scheme is hatched, regardless of its success, and may involve mailings or wire communications. Demonstrating a scheme to defraud requires showing that communications were reasonably calculated to deceive. The government must demonstrate that the defendant's communications were intended to deceive, covering schemes to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses. The courts recognize the possibility of a \"puffing\" defense and question if statutes apply to schemes targeting the gullible. The focus lies on the defendant's intent and the materiality of the deception within the context of mail and wire fraud statutes. The phrase \"obtain money or property\" in fraud schemes does not represent separate crimes but defines what constitutes a scheme to defraud. Congress specifically enumerated the phrases in later offenses, such as bank fraud statutes. The mail and wire fraud statutes protect against deprivations of tangible property and certain intangible property rights with value to the victim. Courts determine if an interest qualifies as property based on traditional recognition and enforcement as a property right. The mail and wire fraud statutes require a material misrepresentation to constitute a scheme to defraud, with materiality defined as capable of influencing the victim. Intent to defraud involves knowingly deceiving for financial gain or causing harm. The Supreme Court ruled in McNally v. United States that the mail and wire fraud statutes do not protect the \"intangible right of the citizenry to good government.\" However, Congress later expanded the statutes to include the deprivation of the intangible right to honest services. The Supreme Court limited the definition of honest-services fraud to cases of bribery or kickbacks in Skilling v. United States. Bribery requires a quid pro quo, while an official act involves a decision or action on a matter before an officer. The definition of kickback has been redefined since the Skilling case. The courts have cited the dictionary definition of honest services fraud, which draws its elements from mail and wire fraud statutes. Aiding and abetting these offenses carries the same penalties as the underlying offense. Conspiracy to commit wire fraud requires an agreement between two or more persons. The defendant can be held liable for wire fraud conspiracy if they willfully join the conspiracy with intent. Liability extends until the conspiracy's objectives are met or the defendant withdraws. Attempting mail and wire fraud requires a substantial step towards the offense with intent, not necessarily successful. Conviction for both the substantive offense and attempt is not allowed. Mail and wire fraud carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine. Wire fraud carries penalties of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). If the victim is a financial institution or the offense is related to a natural disaster, the penalty can be up to $1 million and 30 years in prison. Using identity theft during the fraud results in a mandatory minimum two-year prison term. Conviction may lead to probation, supervised release, restitution, and forfeiture orders. Sentencing in federal court follows the Sentencing Guidelines, which determine the offense level based on prior criminal record and aggravating factors. The Sentencing Guidelines for mail and wire fraud convictions determine the offense level based on prior criminal record and aggravating factors. The final offense level dictates recommendations for probation, imprisonment, and fines, with sentencing ranges based on the defendant's criminal history. For example, a first-time offender with a final offense level of 15 may face imprisonment for 18 to 24 months. The Sentencing Guidelines determine offense levels based on criminal history and aggravating factors. A defendant with offense level 15 and criminal history category VI could face 41 to 51 months in prison. Probation can be granted for crimes with a maximum term of less than 25 years, with \"pure\" probation recommended for offense levels 8 and below. Courts must consider statutory factors before sentencing, and appellate courts will uphold sentences if justified. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend supervised release after imprisonment, with a maximum term of three years for wire and mail fraud cases, extending to five years for fraud against financial institutions. Appellate courts review sentences for procedural and substantive reasonableness, ensuring accurate guideline calculations and justification for the sentence chosen. The Sentencing Guidelines recommend supervised release after imprisonment, with a maximum term of three years for wire and mail fraud cases, extending to five years for fraud against financial institutions. Release conditions include no new crimes, DNA sample, and drug testing. Additional conditions may include payment of fines, restitution, and special assessments. Defendants convicted of mail or wire fraud must pay a special assessment of $100 and restitution. Victims entitled to restitution include those directly harmed by the defendant's crime. Proceeds of mail or wire fraud can be confiscated by the United States through civil or criminal forfeiture procedures. The mail and wire fraud statutes essentially outlaw fraudulent schemes. The mail and wire fraud statutes outlaw dishonesty and fraudulent schemes, with potential overlap with other federal criminal statutes. This includes crimes where mail or wire fraud are elements, fraud under different circumstances, and honest services fraud like bribery. Some federal crimes require the commission of other offenses, such as money laundering and racketeering, where mail and wire fraud can be predicate offenses. Mail and wire fraud are racketeering and money laundering predicate offenses under the RICO provisions, outlawing conducting the affairs of an enterprise impacting interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity. The RICO offenses often involve wire or mail fraud violations, with elements including conducting the affairs of an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce through a pattern of racketeering activity. To prove a RICO conspiracy, the government must show an agreement to conduct an enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity. The RICO provisions require proving that the defendant participated in an agreement to conduct an enterprise's affairs through racketeering activity, involving at least two acts of racketeering. The pattern of predicate offenses must be related and threaten continued criminal activity, with liability limited to those involved in the enterprise's operation. RICO liability under \u00a7 1962(c) extends beyond upper management to lower rung participants in an enterprise. An enterprise can be a group of individuals, a legal entity, or an association-in-fact with specific structural features. Qualified enterprises must engage in interstate or foreign commerce. RICO violations can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years and fines up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). RICO violations can lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years and fines of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Restitution must be ordered for predicate offenses like mail or wire fraud. RICO includes forfeiture provisions for property acquired through violations. Any RICO predicate offense is also a money laundering predicate. Violations allow for treble damages for those harmed in business or property. Money laundering statutes outlaw financial transactions involving proceeds from unlawful activities for the purpose of concealing them. Money laundering involves conducting financial transactions using proceeds from illegal activity to conceal their source or ownership. To establish the offense, the government must prove that the transaction affected interstate or foreign commerce, involved illegal proceeds, the defendant knew the funds were from unlawful activity, and the transaction was designed to conceal the nature of the proceeds. Promotional money laundering involves furthering predicate offenses. The offense of money laundering requires proving that the defendant conducted a financial transaction involving proceeds of unlawful activity with the intent to promote or further unlawful activity. Merely depositing proceeds without intent to promote or conceal is not enough. Violation of Section 1956 can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of up to $500,000, with property subject to forfeiture. Violating Section 1957 requires transactions involving over $10,000. Section 1957 differs from Section 1956 by requiring property involved in transactions to have a value greater than $10,000, without the need for the defendant to know about any design to conceal aspects of the transaction. Violations of Section 1957 can lead to imprisonment for up to 10 years and fines of up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for organizations), with the property subject to forfeiture. This category includes federal crimes involving fraud against the United States or other frauds related to mail and wire fraud violations. Fraud against the United States includes false claims, conspiracy, and material false statements. Bank fraud, health care fraud, securities fraud, and fraud in foreign labor contracting are similar to mail and wire fraud. Section 287 prohibits submitting false claims to the government, carrying a sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine. The offense under Section 287 carries a sentence of imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations). Restitution must be ordered for this crime. There is no explicit authority for property confiscation, but civil actions for treble damages can be brought under the False Claims Act. Section 287 offenses are not RICO or money laundering predicate offenses. Conspiracy to defraud the United States requires showing an agreement to obstruct. The offense of conspiracy to defraud the United States involves entering into an agreement to obstruct a lawful government function through deceitful or dishonest means, without the need to show intent to deprive another of money or property. It is punishable by imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for organizations), with no restitution required. This offense is not considered a RICO or money laundering predicate offense. Section 1001 prohibits knowingly and willfully making false statements to federal entities, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine. Restitution is required for this offense, but confiscation of tainted property is not authorized. Section 1001 prohibits false statements to federal entities, punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine. Restitution is required, but confiscation of tainted property is not authorized. Other fraud proscriptions in Chapter 63 include bank fraud, health care fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and fraud in foreign labor contracting, each with different jurisdictional bases. The bank fraud statute prohibits schemes to defraud federally insured financial institutions and falsely obtain property from them. To establish the offense, the government must prove the defendant knowingly executed a scheme to defraud a financial institution with the intent to defraud, and the institution was federally insured. For the bank-custody offense, the government must prove a scheme existed to obtain money from a federally-insured bank by fraud, the defendant participated in the scheme with false pretenses, and the defendant acted knowingly. Violation of either offense can result in up to 30 years in prison and a $1 fine. Bank fraud is a punishable offense with imprisonment up to 30 years and a fine of $1 million. It is considered a RICO and money laundering predicate offense, requiring victim restitution and forfeiture of proceeds. The health care fraud provision condemns schemes to defraud health care benefit programs, including bribery and kickbacks. Attempts and conspiracies carry the same penalties as the complete offense. It is often prosecuted alongside related offenses. Section 1347 of the health care fraud provision outlines penalties for defrauding health care benefit programs. Violations can result in imprisonment for up to 10 years and fines up to $250,000. Penalties increase for serious bodily injury or death. Victims are entitled to restitution, and proceeds are not subject to confiscation. Section 1348 prohibits securities and commodities fraud, requiring fraudulent intent, a scheme to defraud, and a nexus with a security. Offenders face up to 25 years in prison and fines up to $250,000. Convictions may also include mail or wire fraud. The offenses are not money laundering or RICO predicate offenses. Victims are entitled to restitution. The offense of fraud in foreign labor contracting occurs when someone recruits, solicits, or hires a person outside the United States using false pretenses with intent to defraud. It is considered a RICO predicate offense and a money laundering predicate offense. Restitution is required at sentencing, but forfeiture is not authorized. In the 2010 decision in Skilling v. United States, honest services mail and wire fraud involves bribery and kickback schemes using mail or wire communications. Key statutes include bribery of federal officials, bribery related to federal programs, extortion, foreign corrupt practices, and Medicare/Medicaid anti-kickback laws. Conviction under bribery statutes requires proof of corrupt intent to influence official acts through a quid pro quo exchange of value. The curr_chunk discusses the corrupt quid pro quo involving public officials, including federal officers and employees, and the consequences under Section 201 which punishes bribery with imprisonment, fines, and disqualification from federal office. Section 201 is also a RICO and money laundering predicate offense, with proceeds subject to forfeiture. Section 666 outlaws fraud and bribery by faithless agents. Section 666 criminalizes fraud and bribery by agents of entities receiving over $10,000 in federal benefits in transactions of $5,000 or more. Violations require proof of five elements, including obtaining property valued at least $5,000 through fraud. Guilt under \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B) involves corruptly soliciting or accepting anything of value as an agent of an organization receiving federal-program funds. Section 666 criminalizes fraud and bribery by agents of entities receiving over $10,000 in federal benefits in transactions of $5,000 or more. Violations of Section 666 are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years and a fine of not more than $250,000 (not more than $500,000 for organizations). The government does not need to establish a quid pro quo as in a Section 201 bribery case, and federal funds are not required to be involved in the tainted transaction. Section 666 criminalizes fraud and bribery by agents of entities receiving over $10,000 in federal benefits in transactions of $5,000 or more. Violations are punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for organizations). The Hobbs Act outlaws obtaining property under \"color of official right\" with an effect on interstate commerce, requiring proof of government official status, acceptance of property not entitled to, knowledge of improper receipt, and a de minimis effect on commerce. Conviction does not require the official to seek or induce payment. The Hobbs Act violations involve public officials obtaining payments not entitled to, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Violations are RICO predicate offenses and can lead to forfeiture of proceeds. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bribery provisions criminalize willful use of mail for bribery. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act criminalizes corrupt payments to foreign officials to influence their actions or secure improper advantages. Payments to expedite routine governmental actions are exempt, and defendants have an affirmative defense for lawful payments. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits corrupt payments to foreign officials, with exemptions for routine governmental actions. Violations can result in imprisonment and fines. The Medicare/Medicaid kickback prohibition outlaws offering or receiving remuneration to induce referrals or purchases for beneficiaries, punishable by imprisonment. Violations of Section 1320a-7b kickback laws can lead to imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of $25,000. These violations are considered money laundering offenses, but not RICO predicate offenses. The proceeds of such violations can be subject to forfeiture through civil or criminal procedures. The law also prohibits schemes to defraud or obtain money through false pretenses, with penalties for those who engage in such activities. Anyone who deposits or sends mail through the Postal Service or private carriers, or receives such mail, can face a fine or up to 20 years in prison. Violations related to presidential disasters or financial institutions carry harsher penalties. Anyone who devises a scheme to defraud or obtain money through false pretenses and uses communication in interstate or foreign commerce can face a fine or up to 20 years in prison. Harsher penalties apply if the violation is related to a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency. For violating the terms defined in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, or affecting a financial institution, a person can be fined up to $1,000,000 or imprisoned for up to 30 years. The term \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes depriving another of honest services. Attempting or conspiring to commit an offense under this chapter carries the same penalties as the actual offense."
