    "content": "The \"Medicare Established Provider Act of 2013\" is cited as the short title. It introduces the Medicare Established Provider System under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The Secretary will establish the Medicare Established Provider System to designate low-risk providers for fraud prevention. Providers can apply for designation, and those who qualify will receive established provider status. The Secretary will establish an electronic system for providers to submit documentation for claims under review. Providers must demonstrate eligibility to qualify as established providers for a specified reporting period. Providers must demonstrate that a certain percentage of claims for payment under this title were eligible for payment, with the required percentage increasing over time. Providers designated as established providers must demonstrate compliance with qualification requirements by showing that a certain percentage of claims for payment under this title were eligible, with at least 90 percent of appealed claims being reviewed annually. The supplier must demonstrate compliance with qualification requirements for payment under this title, including determining payment eligibility, maintaining qualifying requirements, identifying established providers, and ensuring a global track record of compliance. The management company provider number is used to identify providers and suppliers for efficiency. Protections apply to established providers for claims subject to review for payment under this title. The provider must repay any payment made under this title if a final determination is made that the payment should not have been made. Repayment must be made electronically within 45 days of notification, but the Secretary can extend this period in cases of significant hardship. The Secretary will determine appropriate repayment plans for claims submitted for payment under this title, without the need for redeterminations."
