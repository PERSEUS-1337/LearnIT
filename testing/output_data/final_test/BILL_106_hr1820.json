    "content": "Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is revised to include new findings. The Congress finds that there are 52.7 million students in elementary and secondary schools in the US, with a current federal expenditure of $12 million for education infrastructure. An additional $22 billion appropriation would result in $417 per student per year. The General Accounting Office reported that schools need $200 billion for repairs and upgrades, particularly in urban areas with high minority populations. According to a 1991 survey by the American Association of School Administrators, 74% of public school buildings need replacement, with many built before World War II. Schools in unsatisfactory condition are mainly in central cities, serving poor or minority students. In large cities, schools still use polluting coal furnaces, posing health and safety risks to students and hindering learning opportunities. According to research, student achievement and behavior are affected by school building conditions and overcrowding. Asthma rates are higher in areas with coal burning pollution. A 1995 study found that most schools lack modern technology and access to the information superhighway. Schools in central cities and with over 50% minority populations have inadequate technology and more unsatisfactory environmental conditions. Old school buildings often have inadequate libraries and science labs. Overcrowded schools with inadequate facilities negatively impact student learning. Students in crowded classrooms score lower on exams and face disruptions in classroom activities. This includes early lunch periods, lack of lockers, and disorderly behavior in jammed hallways and restrooms. The General Accounting Office emphasizes the need for school modernization in information technology to prepare students for the CyberCivilization. Investing in modern, safe, and well-equipped schools is crucial for the national economy and security, ensuring a strong workforce and well-prepared Armed Forces. The shortage of qualified information technology workers is escalating, leading to the recruitment of foreign workers in America. Military manpower shortages in personnel capable of operating high tech equipment are acute in the Navy and increasing in other branches of the Armed Forces. The purpose of this title is to provide Federal funds to local educational agencies for the construction, repair, and modernization of school facilities for information technology. Federal assistance is in the form of grants. The Secretary will make grants to State educational agencies for the construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization of elementary and secondary schools' information technology. The allocation of funds to each State will be based on the number of school-age children in the State compared to the total number in all States. To receive a grant for school construction projects, a State must submit an application to the Secretary with specified details and assurances. The State educational agency must ensure that the projects are undertaken economically and not in an elaborate or extravagant manner. When approving projects for funding under this title, the State educational agency prioritizes safety, demonstrated need, age of the facility, and preparation for modern technology. Grants to local educational agencies may cover the total cost of facility construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization. The State educational agency prioritizes safety, demonstrated need, age of the facility, and preparation for modern technology when approving projects for funding. Grants may cover the total cost of facility construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for information technology. \"SEC. 12004. GENERAL PROVISIONS prioritize safety, need, facility age, and technology readiness for project approval. Grants can fund construction, reconstruction, renovation, or modernization for IT.\" The Secretary must ensure that laborers and mechanics on assisted projects are paid prevailing wages and work no more than 40 hours per week unless paid overtime. Waivers may be granted in certain cases. The Secretary may credit amounts saved by laborers or mechanics who volunteer their services without full compensation to the educational institution undertaking the construction. The text defines \"school\" as structures for teaching students and \"State\" as including states and the District of Columbia. It authorizes $22 billion for fiscal year 2000 and the following 4 years for this purpose."
