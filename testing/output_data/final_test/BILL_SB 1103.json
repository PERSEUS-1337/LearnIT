    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 17053.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to provide a tax credit for qualified renters based on their adjusted gross income. The credit amount varies for different filing statuses and income levels, ranging from $60 to $200. The tax credit for qualified renters is based on adjusted gross income, with a maximum of $25,000. Married couples can only receive one credit, which can be divided if they file separately or if one spouse is a nonresident. For a husband and wife, each spouse can receive half of the full credit if they maintained separate residences in the state for the entire taxable year. A qualified renter is someone who is a resident of the state and rented and occupied their principal residence in the state for at least 50% of the taxable year. A \"qualified renter\" does not include individuals who rented and occupied tax-exempt premises for more than 50% of the year or individuals whose principal residence is with someone who claimed them as a dependent for income tax purposes for more than 50% of the year. An individual eligible for the homeowners' property tax exemption or their spouse can claim credits if they are residents for the taxable year. Nonresidents can claim credits based on the months they resided in the state. Claimants must provide information to the Franchise Tax Board and file returns as prescribed. The section defines \"premises\" as a house or dwelling unit used for living accommodations, excluding land only unless a mobilehome is present. The credit is not allowed for renting land with a mobilehome granted a homeowners' exemption. This section becomes effective on January 1, 1998, and applies to taxable years starting on or after that date. The Franchise Tax Board will recalculate adjusted gross income amounts annually starting from January 1, 1999. The Department of Industrial Relations annually provides the California Consumer Price Index change to the Franchise Tax Board by August 1. The Board calculates an inflation adjustment factor and applies it to the previous year's amount to determine the updated figure. The Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to adjust the credit amounts for qualified renters based on adjusted gross income. Married couples, heads of household, and surviving spouses can receive a credit of $120 if their income is $50,000 or less, while other individuals can receive a credit of $60 if their income is $25,000 or less. The amounts provided in subparagraph (A) are twice the amount provided in subparagraph (B). For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, the credit for married couples filing joint returns, heads of household, and surviving spouses with adjusted gross income of $100,000 or less is $184. For other individuals with adjusted gross income of $50,000 or less, the credit is $92. A husband and wife can receive one credit, which can be taken by either if they file separate returns. For a husband and wife, if one spouse was a resident for the entire taxable year and the other spouse was a nonresident for part of the year, the resident spouse gets half the credit allowed to married persons, and the nonresident spouse gets the other half. If both spouses were nonresidents for part of the year, the credit is divided equally between them. If each spouse maintained a separate residence in the state for the entire year, each spouse gets half the full credit allowed to married persons. A \"qualified renter\" is defined as a resident of the state. A \"qualified renter\" in the state is someone who rented and occupied premises in the state as their principal place of residence for at least 50% of the taxable year. However, it does not include individuals who rented tax-exempt premises for more than 50% of the year or individuals whose principal residence is with someone who claimed them as a dependent for income tax purposes. An individual granted the homeowners' property tax exemption or whose spouse has been granted it during the taxable year can claim the credits. Nonresident renters can claim credits based on the months they resided in the state. Claimants must provide information as prescribed by the Franchise Tax Board and file returns accordingly. For tax purposes, \"premises\" refers to a house or dwelling unit used for living accommodations, excluding land unless a mobilehome is involved. The section becomes effective on January 1, 1998, and applies to taxable years from that date. The Franchise Tax Board will adjust income amounts annually for specified years. The Department of Industrial Relations annually provides the California Consumer Price Index change to the Franchise Tax Board by August 1. The Board calculates an inflation adjustment factor and applies it to the previous year's income amounts for tax purposes. The act provides for a tax levy and shall go into immediate effect. Amounts for tax purposes are calculated based on the California Consumer Price Index change."
