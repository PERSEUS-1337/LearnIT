    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Rapid Innovation Fund Enhancement Act of 2016\" and it reestablishes and enhances the Defense Research and Development Rapid Innovation Program. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 is amended to coordinate the program with senior acquisition executives of the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense must obligate at least 1% of its budget for eligible technologies under the program for research and development from fiscal year 2017 onwards. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 requires the Department of Defense to allocate a minimum of 1% of its budget for research and development of eligible technologies from fiscal year 2017 onwards. The act also allows departments, agencies, and components to exceed the required amount for eligible technologies. Additionally, the Secretary is mandated to provide an annual briefing to Congress on funded projects, funding amounts, and defense acquisition programs. The Defense Acquisition Program must support each project, meeting identified needs in its acquisition plan. The timeline for project transition and the type of business awarded the project are also key factors. Competitive, merit-based processes are used to select project performers. The Defense Acquisition Program evaluates and selects project performers through competitive processes. The term 'appropriate committees of Congress' is defined in subsection (d) as specific Senate and House committees. The term 'eligible technology' refers to technologies that have received Phase II awards under the Small Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business Technology Transfer Program. The Small Business Act allows for the development of innovative technologies by nontraditional defense contractors, defense laboratories, and other entities as determined by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary will issue guidelines for the Defense Research and Development Rapid Innovation Program to provide additional program flexibility within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Small Business Act allows for direct award procedures for firms participating in the Small Business Innovation Research Program or Small Business Technology Transfer Program. Guidance and procedures are provided for small businesses to submit proposals separate from a broad agency announcement."
