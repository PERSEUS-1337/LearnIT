    "content": "The \"Renewable Energy Permitting Act of 2009\" establishes a pilot project to improve Federal renewable energy permit coordination under the Secretary of the Interior. During fiscal years 2009-2018, a pilot project will be established by the Secretary to enhance Federal renewable energy permit coordination. A memorandum of understanding will be entered into with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Chief of Engineers within 90 days of the Act's enactment. State Governors may also be requested to sign the memorandum. Qualified staff will be designated for the project. Designation of Qualified Staff: Within 30 days of signing the memorandum of understanding, Federal signatory parties must assign field office employees with expertise in regulatory issues related to their office, including consultations under the Endangered Species Act, permits under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and regulatory matters under the Clean Air Act. Each employee assigned under paragraph (1) must report to field managers of the Bureau of Land Management within 90 days, handle issues related to their home office jurisdiction, and work on proposed energy projects and planning as part of a team. The Secretary will assign additional personnel to field offices in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Wyoming to support the Pilot Project and other programs related to renewable energy development on Federal land. Income from solar and wind energy rentals will be distributed according to specified guidelines. For fiscal year 2009 and onwards, a portion of solar and wind energy rental income collected by the Bureau of Land Management will be distributed as follows: 50% to states, 25% to counties, and 20% (or $5,000,000, whichever is less) to a special fund. For fiscal year 2009 and onwards, a portion of solar and wind energy rental income collected by the Bureau of Land Management will be distributed as follows: 50% to states, 25% to counties, and 20% (or $5,000,000, whichever is less) to a special fund. Additionally, a percentage of the income will be deposited into specific funds in the Treasury for renewable energy permit processing improvement and solar energy land reclamation, restoration, and mitigation. The value of public land for solar energy projects will be determined by the Bureau of Land Management. The value of public land for wind and geothermal energy projects is determined by the Bureau of Land Management and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, respectively. Amounts in the Renewable Energy Permit Processing Improvement Fund are available for coordination and processing of renewable energy permits. The Solar Energy Land Reclamation, Restoration, and Mitigation Fund provides funding for reclaiming, restoring, and mitigating impacts on public land used for solar energy projects. The Solar Energy Land Reclamation, Restoration, and Mitigation Fund allocates up to $50,000,000 for restoring land used for solar or wind power generation if it cannot be adequately restored without these funds. The Solar Energy Land Reclamation, Restoration, and Mitigation Fund allocates funds for restoring land used for renewable energy projects. Amounts under this subsection are available for expenditure without further appropriation and without fiscal year limitation. The Secretary may authorize the expenditure or transfer of funds for coordination and processing of renewable energy permits on Federal public land. During the Pilot Project, certain agencies and states are involved in permitting processes for renewable energy projects on Federal public land. The Secretary is prohibited from implementing regulations to increase fees for renewable energy permits. This section does not affect existing laws or delegated authority within Federal agencies participating in the Pilot Project. The Pilot Project involves federal agencies and states permitting renewable energy projects on public land. The length of leases for these projects is determined by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress after 3 years, recommending whether the Pilot Project should be implemented nationwide. Amendments are made to the Energy Policy Act regarding the deposit and use of geothermal lease revenues. Amendments are made to the Energy Policy Act regarding the length of leases for renewable energy projects on public land. This involves striking certain time frames in the section heading and subsection (a) of the Act."
