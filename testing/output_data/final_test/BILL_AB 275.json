    "title": "AB 275",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25360.4 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to set a three-year time limit for the department or a regional board to recover costs incurred in response or corrective actions. If operation and maintenance is part of the action, the time limit starts after completion of these tasks certified by the department or regional board. No action for costs incurred by the department for removal or remedial actions can be brought after three years from the completion certification. An action for costs incurred by the department must be commenced within three years after certification of completion of authorized activities. In cases of recovery of costs or damages, the court will reserve jurisdiction to determine future liability. The department or regional board can enforce judgments for past costs immediately and may seek further costs within three years of completion certification. An action can be initiated under Section 25360 or 25352(c) before the limitations period expires. This section does not apply to cost recovery actions by a regional board under the Water Code. If found liable for costs, a party can prove only partial responsibility and pay for that portion. If evidence is insufficient, costs will be apportioned among defendants based on equitable principles. The standard of liability for costs recoverable under this chapter is strict liability. A person can seek contribution or indemnity from those liable for response or corrective action costs under this chapter. The court may allocate costs among liable parties using equitable factors. A response action contractor found liable for costs under this chapter must pay only the portion attributable to their actions. Section 25366.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended. Section 25366.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to protect public agencies or persons operating household hazardous waste collection programs from liability in cost recovery actions for properly handled waste transported to authorized facilities. For the purposes of this section, a household hazardous waste collection program refers to a program or facility where hazardous wastes from households and small quantity generators are collected and transferred to an authorized hazardous waste facility. This section does not change a person's obligations under state or federal law."
