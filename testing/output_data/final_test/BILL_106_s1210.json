    "content": "The Act titled \"Foreign Endangered Species Conservation Act of 1999\" is cited as the short title. The findings and purpose of the Act are outlined in section 2. Congress finds that numerous species of fauna and flora in foreign countries are at risk of extinction, many of which are already listed as endangered or threatened species. Insufficient resources are available to address the threats facing these species, requiring a joint effort from foreign countries, the United States, and the private sector. Grant programs have been established by Congress for tigers. The purpose of this Act is to conserve endangered and threatened species of fauna and flora in foreign countries by supporting efficient grant programs for tigers, rhinoceroses, Asian elephants, and African elephants. A new grant program is proposed to assist in the conservation of other foreign endangered species without existing grant programs. The Act aims to conserve endangered species in foreign countries by supporting grant programs for specific species and promoting partnerships between public and private sectors to provide financial resources for conservation efforts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Account\" refers to the Foreign Endangered and Threatened Species Conservation Account. The term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Agency for International Development. The term \"CITES\" refers to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. \"Conservation\" means methods to ensure the long-term viability of species in the wild. The Foreign Endangered and Threatened Species Conservation Account focuses on protecting foreign endangered or threatened species through habitat management, research, law enforcement, conflict resolution, and community outreach and education. The term \"foreign endangered or threatened species\" refers to species listed under the Endangered Species Act or CITES, with ranges in foreign countries. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary overseeing these conservation efforts. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, as designated under Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970. SEC. 4. FOREIGN SPECIES CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Secretary will use funds from the Account to provide financial assistance for projects conserving foreign endangered or threatened species in foreign countries. Project proposals can be submitted by foreign country agencies with authority over the species' range or by the CITES Secretariat. Project proposals for conserving foreign endangered or threatened species can be submitted by foreign country agencies, the CITES Secretariat, or individuals with expertise in conservation. Proposals must include the project leader's name and qualifications, the species to benefit, project purposes, methodology, and how the species will benefit. The project proposal must include details such as the estimated funds and time required, support from foreign governmental agencies if needed, non-Federal funding sources, and any other information deemed necessary by the Secretary for evaluating project eligibility for funding under the Act. After receiving a project proposal, the Secretary may request additional information if the proposal is incomplete. Written comments are requested from foreign governmental agencies where the project will take place. The Secretary submits the proposal and comments to the Administrator for review within 30 days. The Secretary may approve a project proposal promoting conservation of foreign endangered species within 180 days. Funding for approved proposals receives priority guidance. Priority guidance for funding approved project proposals includes enhancing programs for the conservation of foreign endangered and threatened species, providing the greatest conservation benefit, receiving assistance from non-Federal sources, and enhancing local capacity for conservation efforts. Recipients of assistance must submit periodic reports to the Secretary and the Administrator. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, requires project reports with necessary information for evaluating progress. Guidelines will be developed by the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce within a year to determine funding priorities and criteria for imperiled species and conservation projects. SEC. 5. MULTILATERAL COLLABORATION. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Secretary of State and the Administrator, shall coordinate efforts to conserve foreign endangered and threatened species with relevant agencies of foreign countries and provide technical assistance to further their conservation efforts. SEC. 6. FOREIGN ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES CONSERVATION ACCOUNT. Establishment of the \"Foreign Endangered and Threatened Species Conservation Account\" within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund of the Treasury, funded by donations, appropriations, and interest earned. The Secretary can use funds from the Account to carry out section 4, with a limit of 6% for administrative expenses. The Secretary can invest excess funds in interest-bearing obligations of the United States and accept donations for the Act without further appropriation. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2001 through 2005: $12,000,000 for the Secretary of the Interior and $4,000,000 for the Secretary of Commerce."
