    "content": "The report describes changes to the Medicare program in H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, focusing on payment rules, covered benefits, and funding for health reform. Estimates suggest significant reductions in Medicare spending. Division B of the legislation outlines changes to Medicare and Medicaid programs, including modifications to fee-for-service payments. Division B in H.R. 3962 focuses on payment and program modifications to Medicare, including the fee-for-service program, prescription drug benefit, and Medicare Advantage. The report discusses efforts to reform payment methods, program integrity changes, and other Medicare adjustments. It does not cover changes to graduate medical education payments, preventive care benefits, quality measurement efforts, or public health initiatives. The CBO score on the financial impact of H.R. 3962 on Medicare is included, along with an overview of Medicare changes by provider type and program, and a brief discussion of program integrity changes. The CBO analyzed H.R. 3962, estimating a $427 billion reduction in direct spending over the FY2010-FY2019 period, with Medicare accounting for $460.8 billion of the total. The analysis did not include administrative costs or impacts on other federal programs. Medicare accounts for approximately $460.8 billion of the reduction in direct spending over a 10-year period, with estimated savings of $501.7 billion offset by payment increases of $40.9 billion. The bill aims to slow Medicare spending growth to a 6% annual rate compared to the prior 8%, with the largest savings coming from permanent reductions in fee-for-service payment rates. Changes in fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare Part D would result in an estimated $220 billion in savings over 10 years. There are differing views on how to use these savings, with some advocating for funding health care coverage expansion and others prioritizing the financial stability of the Medicare program. The Department of Health and Human Services released a report on August 27 asserting that health insurance reform and changes to Medicare would improve the program's solvency and beneficiaries' access to care. Medicare pays for health services for individuals 65 and older or permanently disabled under 65, with different parts responsible for various benefits and financing mechanisms. Traditional Medicare pays for services on a fee-for-service basis using prospective payment systems or fee schedules. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implement regulatory decisions annually that affect Medicare payments to providers. Updates are made to reflect inflation and other factors, sometimes linked to the consumer price index or provider-specific market basket index. MedPAC makes payment update recommendations to Congress each March. MedPAC staff assess Medicare payments for efficiency and provider cost changes. Medicare's payment systems aim to promote efficiency similar to the economy. Recommendations to Congress are based on provider circumstances. MedPAC issues reports on systemic issues and recommendations for increasing Medicare's value and efficiency. MedPAC recommends changes to Medicare payment systems to improve efficiency and quality of care. Their suggestions are not binding but have influenced legislative changes. Part A of Medicare covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health services, and hospice care. The skilled nursing facility (SNF) services, post-hospital home health services, and hospice care are covered under Part A of Medicare. Approximately 20% of beneficiaries use these services each year, with Part A spending projected to increase to $435.2 billion in 2019. Provisions in H.R. 3962 aim to reduce Part A spending by constraining payment updates to acute care hospitals and restructuring payments to address inefficiencies. Additionally, Medicare's disproportionate share hospital (DSH) subsidies will be reshaped. H.R. 3962 would eliminate the exception allowing physician-owned hospitals to refer Medicare and Medicaid patients, adjust Medicare's payment updates for cost savings, and extend productivity adjustments to acute care hospitals. Under Medicare's current inpatient prospective payment system, acute care hospitals receive full payment for patient admissions, even if preventable readmissions occur. MedPAC estimated that readmissions cost $15 billion in additional Medicare expenditures in FY2007. This provision in H.R. 3962 would reduce payments for acute care hospitals with excessive readmission rates for selected conditions. H.R. 3962 aims to reduce hospitals' Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments starting in FY2017 based on a decrease in uninsured individuals. Hospitals with higher levels of uncompensated care would receive additional payments. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates this provision would save $10.3 billion over a 10-year period. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required the establishment of a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) to cover all services provided, including room and board, nursing, therapy, and drugs. SNFs receive a daily payment based on 1995 costs adjusted for inflation, with additional adjustments for area wages using the hospital wage index. Any profits or losses are retained by the SNF. The SNF per diem PPS payments are adjusted for geographic wage variations and include a temporary 128% increase for HIV-positive or AIDS patients. The base payments are adjusted annually for inflation, and CMS proposed recalibrating case mix indexes in FY2010 to better reflect resources for complex care. These changes would result in a 1.1% decrease in Medicare payments to SNFs for FY2010. The proposed PPS and Consolidated Billing SNF payment regulation for FY2010 includes recalibrating case-mix indexes to match beneficiaries' service needs more accurately. MedPAC has raised concerns about payment categories for nontherapy ancillary services and therapy services, recommending separating payments for NTA from the bundled PPS rate and establishing an outlier policy for stays with high ancillary care needs. MedPAC recommends recalibrating therapy payment categories to match actual service needs, eliminating the market basket update for 2010, and implementing budget-neutral changes in SNF payment categories. H.R. 3962 aligns with these recommendations by slowing payment growth and ensuring it never falls below zero. The bill H.R. 3962 proposes budget-neutral changes to SNF payment categories for NTA and therapy services, adjustments for outliers in SNF costs, reduced Medicare payments for readmitted patients, and a Post-Acute Care Demonstration expansion for Medicare-certified SNFs. This demonstration aims to improve coordination, quality, and efficiency of post-acute care services through bundled payments. Home health agencies (HHAs) are paid under a prospective payment system (PPS) that covers skilled nursing, therapy, medical social services, aide visits, and medical supplies. The base payment amount is increased annually based on the home health market basket (MB) index. HHAs must submit health care quality data, and failure to do so results in a penalty. The proposed rule for CY 2010 indicates a 2.2% increase in the MB. Additionally, CMS aims to cap outlier payments to address potential fraud and abuse. CMS proposes to cap outlier payments at 10% of total HH PPS payments and target outlier payments to be no greater than 2.5% of total HH PPS payments to address potential fraud and abuse. Refinements were made in CY2008 to the HH PPS, including changes to the HHA case-mix index. These changes resulted in adjustments to the national prospective 60-day episode payment rate for CY2008, CY2009, CY2010, and CY2011. MedPAC reports that payments to HHAs have exceeded costs significantly since the PPS was implemented in 2000, recommending adjustments to address this issue. MedPAC recommends eliminating the MB increase for 2010 and accelerating payment coding changes. H.R. 3962 would slow payment growth to HHAs by eliminating the MB update for 2010 and implementing productivity adjustments for future updates. The bill also requires full implementation of case-mix adjustments in 2010, resulting in a 5.46% payment decrease. H.R. 3962 proposes adjustments to HHA payments by a uniform percentage to match the previous year's payments. If unable to do so for 2011, payments would be 95% of the prospective amount. The bill also mandates a detailed plan for a Post-Acute Care Demonstration expansion, testing bundled payments for hospitals and post-acute care providers. Additionally, changes to Medicare physician payments and reporting programs are included. The bill proposes adjustments to physician fee schedules, bonus programs, and reporting initiatives. It allows for flexibility in reviewing and adjusting codes, addressing payment imbalances in California, creating bonus payments for physicians in low-spending areas, extending payments for certain services, and modifying imaging service payments. Additionally, it includes changes to the physician quality reporting initiative program. H.R. 3962 proposes adjustments to physician fee schedules, bonus programs, and reporting initiatives. It aims to integrate PQRI, extend bonus payments, and modify the resource-based feedback program for physicians. The bill also includes changes to Medicare payments to private health plans, reducing maximum payments in some areas to align with actual costs. H.R. 3962 aims to adjust Medicare payments to private health plans by phasing in benchmarks equal to per capita fee-for-service spending in each county. This may lead to reduced access to private plan options and supplemental benefits. The bill also increases benchmarks for MA plans that provide quality health care in qualifying areas. The provision in H.R. 3962 aims to adjust Medicare payments to private health plans by phasing in benchmarks equal to per capita fee-for-service spending in each county. This adjustment is estimated to save $47.5 billion over the FY2010-2014 period and $154.3 billion over the FY2010-2019 period. Additionally, the bill extends the Secretary's authority to adjust payments to plans for differences in diagnosis coding between MA plans and original Medicare, ensuring fair compensation for treating older and sicker beneficiaries. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required adjustments to Medicare Advantage payments based on diagnosis coding differences between plans and providers. This provision was estimated to save $2.9 billion over 2010-2014 and $15.5 billion over 2010-2019. H.R. 3962 made additional changes to the Medicare Advantage program resulting in costs or savings of less than $0.5 billion over the 10-year period. The Medicare prescription drug program, established in 2006 under the MMA, replaced Medicaid as the primary source of drug coverage for dual eligibles. Coverage is provided through private prescription drug plans or Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans. Medicare law defines a standard benefit structure. The Medicare Part D benefit includes a $295 deductible, 25% coinsurance until $2,700 in drug spending, a coverage gap (doughnut hole) until catastrophic threshold at $6,153.75. Low-income individuals can receive enhanced coverage through the low-income subsidy (LIS) which reduces out-of-pocket costs. H.R. 3962 proposes changes to Medicare Part D. H.R. 3962 aims to reduce drug costs in Medicare Part D by phasing out the coverage gap by 2019. Part D enrollees would receive 50% discounts on brand-name drugs during the coverage gap. A new prescription drug rebate program would also be established for low-income beneficiaries. CBO estimates savings from discounts and rebates. H.R. 3962 aims to reduce drug costs in Medicare Part D by phasing out the coverage gap by 2019. CBO estimates that the combined savings from discounts and rebates would offset the cost, reducing Medicare expenditures by $42.3 billion over 10 years. The bill would also require the Secretary to negotiate prices with manufacturers, with potential impacts on beneficiary cost sharing and premiums. The bill includes provisions to make it easier for beneficiaries to qualify for low-income subsidies and access LIS plans. This includes allowing self-certification of income and assets, raising the asset test, eliminating cost sharing for certain individuals, and implementing an \"intelligent assignment\" process for plan enrollment. The bill aims to make it easier for low-income beneficiaries to enroll in affordable drug plans by changing eligibility criteria. It includes provisions to protect Part D enrollees from coverage reductions or increased costs during the plan year. Additionally, the bill enhances oversight to ensure low-income beneficiaries receive retroactive reimbursement payments. The changes are estimated to cost $13.5 billion over 10 years. The Medicare program faces challenges with its fee-for-service payment systems, including incentives to increase service volume. The wide geographic variation in spending per beneficiary adds complexity to payment reform proposals. H.R. 3962 includes provisions for pilot programs to bundle payments for physician, hospital, and post-acute care services, serving as a starting point for payment reforms. The pilot programs in H.R. 3962 aim to establish care organizations and medical homes to better manage healthcare quality and cost-efficiency for chronically ill patients. The bill also includes measures to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) conducts program integrity activities to prevent, detect, and investigate health care fraud. They collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to combat fraud. Medicare program integrity and anti-fraud efforts are funded through the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program. The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) program, established by HIPAA, funds activities to combat health care fraud. HCFAC funds enforcement and prosecution of fraud, while Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) funding supports program integrity activities. Funding was appropriated to HHS, OIG, DOJ, and FBI for fiscal years 1997-2003, extended to 2010 by TRHCA. Total funding for health care fraud activities in FY2009 was $1.4 billion. The bill requires enhanced screening procedures for Medicare providers. The Secretary is required to develop enhanced screening procedures for providers enrolling in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, based on risk levels. This includes background checks, site visits, claims reviews, and enrollment moratoriums. Other measures involve compliance programs, sanctions for non-compliant hospices, timely claims submission, face-to-face encounters for reimbursement, and mandatory electronic payment acceptance. Civil Monetary Penalties are introduced for enforcement. The legislation introduces Civil Monetary Penalties for certain infractions in enforcement, enhances the Secretary's authority to penalize MA plans for contract violations, and mandates a Self-Referral Disclosure Protocol for providers. H.R. 3962 also increases funding for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program by $100 million annually starting in 2011. H.R. 3962 utilizes Medicare as a funding source for health insurance reform and aims to reshape the way health services are paid for. There is debate over whether Medicare savings should be used for broader reform efforts or to strengthen the program's financial standing. Industry representatives are discussing the balance between using Medicare as a funding source and maintaining quality care for beneficiaries. Proponents of health insurance reform believe that payment reforms in the bill will strengthen Medicare and not harm beneficiaries' care. The resolution of these discussions is uncertain. The appendix of H.R. 3962 outlines provisions affecting the Medicare program, including updates to skilled nursing facility payments. The update factor for SNFs in FY2010 would be eliminated under the provision. The provision in H.R. 3962 eliminates the Medicare update factor for skilled nursing facilities in FY2010. The rate would be increased by the skilled nursing facility MB percentage change for subsequent fiscal years. The CBO score is -$6.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$23.9 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Payment Update involves Medicare payments to IRFs under a discharge-based prospective payment system. The provision in H.R. 3962 eliminates the Medicare update factor for skilled nursing facilities in FY2010, extending it until September 30, 2010. The CBO estimates a negative impact of -$1.4 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$5.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1103 involves incorporating productivity improvements into market basket updates for various Medicare payment systems. Medicare payment systems are updated annually based on market basket indices to reflect changes in the cost of providing healthcare services. The update factors for certain providers include a productivity adjustment based on changes in multi-factor productivity. IPPS hospitals saw a reduction in the update component for discharges after January 1, 2010. The IPPS update component for hospitals not submitting quality data or not meaningful EHR users would not be reduced below zero. Updates for SNFs, IRFs, and hospice care would include productivity adjustments starting in FY2011. LTCHs' base rate annual updates would be subject to a productivity adjustment. The update factor for IPFs and LTCHs would be subject to a productivity adjustment starting in FY2011. The CBO's score is -$24.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$102.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Payments to Skilled Nursing Facilities are made through a PPS based on a daily base payment amount adjusted for case mix and area wages. In FY2010, CMS recalibrated case mix indexes to better reflect resources used for medically complex care, resulting in a decrease in Medicare payments. In FY2010, CMS recalibrated case mix indexes to better reflect resources used for medically complex care, resulting in a decrease in Medicare payments. The proposed PPS and Consolidated Billing SNF payment regulation for FY2010 would decrease Medicare payments to SNFs by 1.1% ($360 million) below FY2009 payments, with adjustments to case-mix indexes and changes in payment rates for therapy and non-therapy ancillary services. The Secretary would implement payment changes for NTA services starting April 1, 2010, until an alternative case mix classification system is in place. An analysis would ensure payment accuracy for NTA services in FY2011. Outlier payments for NTA and therapy services would be adjusted based on aggregate costs, not the number of days in a SNF stay, starting October 1, 2010. The outlier component of payment under the PPS would be adjusted to reduce estimated payments by 2% for a fiscal year. Additional payments for outliers could not exceed 2% of total projected payments. Medicare DSH payments have evolved to support hospitals serving low-income patients since 1986. The Medicare DSH adjustment was originally intended to compensate hospitals for higher costs associated with serving low-income patients, but now it is seen as a way to protect access to care. A provision in H.R. 3962 requires the Secretary to submit a report by July 1, 2016, with recommendations on targeting DSH funds. If the national rate of uninsurance decreases by 8% or more from 2012 to 2014, the Medicare DSH adjustment would be reduced starting in FY2017. Additional payments would be made to hospitals based on their estimated uncompensated care costs. The CBO projects $0.0 for FY2010-FY2014 and -10.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019 for hospitals with higher levels of uncompensated care. Sec. 1113 extends the Hospice Regulation Moratorium, adjusting payments through a wage index. A budget neutrality adjustment factor prevents payment reductions for hospices due to changes in labor cost data. The final rule published by HHS in 2008 phased out the budget neutrality adjustment factor for hospice payments over three years. However, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 delayed this phase-out during FY2009. Medicare payments to hospice in FY2009 included budget neutrality adjustments similar to previous years. The revised final rule for FY2010 specified a seven-year phase-out plan for the hospice wage index BNAF. The provision delays the phase-out of the budget neutrality adjustment factor for seven years, with reductions in subsequent years. It also allows physician assistants to order post-hospital extended care services and serve as attending physicians for hospice patients in skilled nursing facilities. The provision allows physician assistants to certify the need for post-hospital extended care services for Medicare payment purposes, as long as they are working in collaboration with a physician. Additionally, physician assistants can serve as attending physicians for hospice patients in skilled nursing facilities. The provision allows physician assistants to certify the need for post-hospital extended care services for Medicare payment purposes, as long as they are working in collaboration with a physician. The individual's attending physician and the medical director must certify in writing that the individual is terminally ill at the beginning of the first 90-day period of hospice. Physician assistants are included in the definition of an attending physician for hospice written plans of care, but they are still excluded from certifying individuals as terminally ill. The CBO score is estimated to be between minus $50 million and $50 million for both FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, there is a Resource-Based Feedback Program for Physicians in Medicare recommended by MedPAC and GAO. The Physician Resource Use Measurement and Reporting Program was established under MIPPA to provide feedback to physicians on their resource use, with the goal of encouraging practice pattern changes. CMS implemented this program by January 1, 2009, initially calling it the Physician Resource Use Feedback Program. The GAO was tasked with studying the program and submitting a report to Congress by March 1, 2011, including recommendations for improvement. The bill aims to modify the physician feedback program established under MIPPA by providing feedback reports to providers about their practice patterns. The Secretary would develop and specify the nature of the reports based on Medicare program results before the enactment of the act. Reports could be on a per capita basis or an episode basis combining related services. Methodologies would be established in 2011 to attribute items and services to physicians. The Secretary would evaluate methodologies to attribute items and services to physicians, identify appropriate physicians for comparison, and aggregate items into a composite measure per individual. Reports would be disseminated to physicians with high utilization rates, aiming to improve quality and decrease costs. Reports could be disseminated via direct meetings or through contracts with local entities engaged in quality improvement. The Medicare physician fee schedule assigns relative weights to physician service codes based on the work involved. The scale used is the resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS). CMS continually refines the methodology for maintaining and updating the fee schedule. The CBO Score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The CMS continually refines the methodology for maintaining and updating the fee schedule, relying on advice from the RUC. Increases in RVUs for some services lower fees for others, affecting payments for evaluation and management codes. CMS must review RVUs every five years and may make adjustments to values for potentially misvalued services periodically. The Secretary would examine codes for potentially misvalued services based on growth, practice expenses, new technologies, multiple billing codes, low relative values, Harvard-valued codes, and other appropriate codes. This provision would increase outlays. The provision in the bill would create a new incentive payment for physicians in low-spending areas, offering an additional 5% payment for Medicare Part B services. This would increase outlays by approximately $100 million over the next five years and $200 million over the next ten years. The bill includes a provision for an additional 5% payment for Medicare Part B services in low-spending areas. The Secretary would standardize per capita spending to eliminate geographic adjustments in payment rates. CBO estimates an additional $400 million in outlays would be required, with spending occurring from 2011 to 2013. Additionally, modifications to the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) would be made, including a feedback program. The bill aims to modify the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) by implementing a feedback program for physicians, integrating PQRI with electronic health record (EHR) reporting, and extending bonus payments. By January 1, 2011, the Secretary would establish a feedback mechanism for eligible professionals on their performance in submitting quality data. Integration of PQRI and EHR reporting would involve developing measures for meaningful use of EHR and collecting health data to identify care deficiencies. The bill aims to modify the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI) by implementing a feedback program for physicians, integrating PQRI with electronic health record (EHR) reporting, and extending bonus payments. The Secretary would develop a plan by January 1, 2012, to identify deficiencies in care for Medicare beneficiaries. Incentive payments under PQRI would be extended through 2012, with a 2% bonus of Part B payments for each year. The provision would require an additional $500 million in 2012 and $800 million in 2013. Additionally, adjustments to Medicare payment localities would be made based on geographic location. The bill proposes changes to Medicare physician payments in California, transitioning from current localities to Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) starting in 2011. This shift aims to address economic disparities and ensure fair geographic adjustments. The bill proposes a hold harmless condition to maintain geographic adjustments during the transition to MSA-based fee schedule areas. CBO estimates an additional $200 million over the next five years and $300 million over the next ten. Medicare addresses payment increases annually, including incorporating productivity improvements into market basket updates. Starting in CY2010, Medicare's updates for various services would be subject to a productivity adjustment. The CBO estimates a cost of -$9.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$42.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1141 addresses the rental and purchase of power-driven wheelchairs under Medicare, with payments made either monthly or as a lump sum. Power wheelchairs are classified into 3 groups based on their features. The provision in Sec. 1141 restricts lump-sum payments for power wheelchairs classified within group 3 or higher, effective from January 1, 2010. The CBO estimates a cost of -$0.6 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Pressure reducing support surfaces are covered by Medicare Part B DME for the care or prevention of pressure ulcers. Medicare pays a monthly rental amount for up to 13 months, after which the supplier must transfer title to the beneficiary. Medicare covers maintenance and servicing for parts and labor not under warranty if deemed necessary by the Secretary. Support surfaces are categorized, with group 3 being a complete bed system. Group 3 support surfaces, such as air-fluidized beds, simulate fluid movement through circulating filtered air. A new provision would require DME suppliers to offer beneficiaries the option to accept or reject transfer of title after 13 months of continuous rental. If not accepted within one month of the offer, title would be deemed rejected. If accepted, title would transfer after the 13th month of rental. The legislation requires DME suppliers to offer beneficiaries the option to accept or reject transfer of title for group three support surfaces after 13 months of continuous rental. If not accepted within one month, title is deemed rejected. Medicare covers maintenance and servicing not covered by warranty. CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1142 extends payment rule for brachytherapy under Medicare's outpatient prospective payment system until January 1, 2012. Cost reimbursement for brachytherapy and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals extended until January 1, 2010 by MIPPA. CBO score is between -$50 million and $50 million for FY2010-FY2019. The provision requires MedPAC to analyze home infusion therapy services under Medicare, including benefits, costs, and payment structures. Infusion drugs in a patient's home are covered by Medicare Part D, but not supplies or professional services. MedPAC must submit a report to Congress by July 1, 2011. CBO scores are $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion. Require Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) to submit cost data and quality data for Medicare evaluation. ASCs must meet health and safety standards to participate in Medicare. ASCs will need to submit facility cost information to Medicare within 18 months of the cost reporting form's development by the Secretary. An ASC cost reporting form will be developed within three years, aligning with hospital cost reporting requirements. The ASC cost reports would be audited periodically and must include quality data, such as healthcare-associated infections, starting in 2012. Eleven cancer hospitals are exempt from the IPPS and OPPS payment systems, ensuring they are not paid less under the new payment system. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare pays for outpatient services using ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups. Cancer hospitals may receive APC payments with adjustments if their costs exceed those of other hospitals under OPPS. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Payment for Imaging Services under the Medicare fee schedule involves separate payments for technical and professional components. The Medicare fee schedule for imaging services includes separate payments for technical and professional components. CMS is urged to increase the utilization rate for calculating payments from 50% to 75% to align with actual usage rates. The proposal aims to increase payment for advanced diagnostic imaging equipment from 50% to 75%, resulting in a payment decrease. It also reduces technical component fees for additional imaging services to 50% for single session imaging involving continuous body parts. These changes would be effective from January 1, 2011. The CBO estimates a cost savings of -$1.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$3.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, Section 1147 introduces modifications to the Durable Medical Equipment Program, including requirements for surety bonds, oxygen equipment, and accreditation. The CBO estimates a cost impact of between -$50 million and $50 million for both FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. The final regulation exempts certain individuals from the requirement of a surety bond for DMEPOS claims, including certain healthcare practitioners and government-owned suppliers. The provision also waives the surety bond requirement for pharmacies or suppliers exclusively providing eyeglasses or contact lenses, or those with at least five years of provider number issuance and no adverse actions. Medicare makes monthly rental payments for oxygen equipment based on medical need, not limited to a 36-month period. The provision modifies the time period for furnishing medically necessary oxygen equipment to individuals for the remainder of the equipment's useful lifetime, defined as five years. This applies to equipment furnished to individuals after the 27th month of continuous use on or after July 1, 2010. The provision allows beneficiaries to start a new 36-month rental period if their oxygen supplier goes bankrupt after at least 24 months of payments. MMA requires quality and accreditation standards for DMEPOS suppliers, exempting certain healthcare professionals. Pharmacies supplying diabetic equipment are exempt from accreditation. Medicare DMEPOS suppliers supplying diabetic testing supplies, canes, and crutches are exempt from accreditation requirements if they applied before August 1, 2009. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will conduct a study on bone mass measurement services and Medicare payment rates. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will conduct a study on bone mass measurement services and Medicare payment rates, including beneficiary access and appropriate usage among Medicare beneficiaries. The Commission will submit a report to Congress with recommendations within 9 months of enactment. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Payment for breast prosthesis and garment covered by Medicare Part B for post-mastectomy patients. Coverage regardless of timing of supply. Secretary to develop policies for beneficiary access. CBO score -$50 million to $50 million for FY2010-FY2019. Payment for biosimilar biological products under Medicare Part B involves assigning HCPCS codes to drugs, with payments based on ASP. Brand-name and generic versions of the same drug share the same HCPCS code, with prices averaged for ASP determinations. Under the provision for Medicare Part B, biosimilar and interchangeable biological products would be reimbursed at ASP, with prices averaged together for determination. Biosimilar products would be reimbursed at ASP plus 6%, while interchangeable products would follow the ASP methodology for multiple source drugs. If a biological product is the reference for both interchangeable and biosimilar products, reimbursement would be based on the ASP methodology for multiple source drugs. The provision under Medicare Part B defines biosimilar and interchangeable biological products, with reimbursement based on ASP. The CBO score for biosimilar approval pathway is -$6.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare covers DME based on medical necessity and physician prescription, with payment on a fee schedule. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 required the establishment of a competitive acquisition program for durable medical equipment (DME) based on suppliers' bids to replace fee schedule payments. The program was phased-in starting in 2009 in nine metropolitan areas, expanding to 70 more areas in 2011. A study was required to evaluate the potential establishment of a competitive bidding process for DMEPOS under Medicare. The curr_chunk discusses recommendations for the structure of an acquisition program for durable medical equipment (DME), including criteria for bidding and supplier compensation. It also compares the program to existing federal acquisition programs. The CBO score for the program is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Payment for each discharge under Medicare's Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) is based on the relative resource use of the patient's Medicare Severity diagnosis related group (MS-DRG). Hospitals in Maryland have a state-specific reimbursement system instead of IPPS. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) receive Medicare payments based on 101% of costs and have specific criteria for designation. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) receive Medicare payments based on 101% of costs for inpatient and outpatient services. MedPAC's analysis shows that 17.6% of hospitalizations result in readmission within 30 days, costing Medicare $15 billion. Providers lack financial incentives to reduce preventable readmissions, as recommended by MedPAC in 2008. Medicare recommended reducing payments to hospitals with high readmission rates for select conditions in June 2008. Hospitals in Maryland would face reduced payments for preventable readmissions starting October 1, 2011. The reduced payments would be calculated based on the base operating DRG payment amount multiplied by an adjustment factor. The adjustment factor is determined by comparing the floor adjustment factor to the excess readmissions ratio for the fiscal year. The floor adjustment factor for discharge payments would decrease annually from FY2012 to subsequent years. The excess readmissions ratio is calculated as 1 minus the ratio of payments for excess readmissions to all discharges. Starting FY2014, the Secretary can offer incentives for hospitals to reduce preventable readmission rates by ranking them and setting lower benchmarks. Applicable conditions are defined as high volume or high expenditure procedures for Medicare. Starting in FY2012, the Secretary would select 3 applicable conditions endorsed by a consensus-based entity, with the list expanding to 4 conditions in FY2013 as identified by MedPAC. The Secretary may also include other conditions and seek an all-condition measure of readmissions. Starting in FY2011, hospitals with a 30% disproportionate share patient percentage could receive increased payments for addressing patient noncompliance issues. Transitional care services would be defined as activities supporting a beneficiary from admission to 90 days post-discharge. Services must be provided by a qualified provider meeting experience and training requirements. The proposed payment increase for transitional care services would be subject to aggregate and hospital-specific caps, not exceeding 5% of estimated savings from the hospital readmission policy. The Secretary would distribute these additional payments in various forms, and a report on fund usage would be required within three years. Starting in FY2012, CAHs would receive reduced payments for preventable hospital readmissions, with the adjustment factor for acute care hospitals applied. The methodology for determining the adjustment factor and additional payments would be outlined, with no administrative or judicial review allowed for certain determinations. GAO would be required to submit a report on fund usage. The proposal includes reducing Medicare payments to post-acute care providers for patients readmitted to a hospital within 30 days. Payments would be reduced by 0.996 for FY2012, 0.993 for FY2013, and 0.99 for FY2014. This policy applies starting October 1, 2011. The Secretary would develop readmissions measures for post-acute care providers, adopt similar payment policies as hospitals, and apply monitoring and penalties. Physicians would also be studied for potential application of the readmissions policy. The study aims to apply readmissions policy to physicians by creating codes and payment amounts, developing readmissions rate measures, applying payment reductions for readmissions, and attributing payments correctly. $25 million annually would be appropriated for this purpose. The CMS Program Management Account appropriations are available until expended. CBO scores show -$2.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$9.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1152 introduces a Post-Acute Care Services Payment Reform Plan and Bundling Pilot Program to standardize patient assessment information across different PAC settings. The CMS introduced a Post-Acute Care Services Payment Reform Plan and Bundling Pilot Program in 2008 to standardize patient assessment information and guide payment policy in Medicare. A report is expected to be submitted to Congress by the Secretary in 2011. Additionally, a three-year Acute Care Episode (ACE) Demonstration was established to test bundled payments for hospital and physician services for orthopedic and cardiovascular conditions. The goal is to improve coordination, quality, and efficiency of PAC services. The Secretary would appropriate $15 million for FYs 2010 through 2012 to improve PAC services and outcomes, with funds available until expended. A final public report must be issued within three years of enactment, and by January 1, 2011, the acute care episode demonstration will be converted into a pilot program expanding to include post-acute services. Bundled payments may be applied to hospitals, physicians, and other appropriate services under this pilot program. The Secretary could apply bundled payments to hospitals, physicians, post-acute care providers, and collaborative care networks. The demonstration program could be expanded based on quality of care and cost reduction. A study and plan would be developed to increase bundling of payments for physicians. The CBO score ranges from -$50 million to $50 million for FY2010-FY2019. Home Health Agencies (HHAs) are paid under a PPS based on 60-day episodes of care for beneficiaries, covering skilled nursing, therapy, medical social services, aide visits, and medical supplies. Durable medical equipment is not included. The base payment amount is increased annually based on the home health market basket index. HHAs must submit health care quality data, or face a reduction in payment. The provision eliminates the market basket update for home health payments for 2010, with agencies still required to submit quality data in subsequent years. Payments for HHAs would increase by the HH market basket percentage change for each subsequent fiscal year. The CBO score is -$16.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$56.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. HHAs are paid under a PPS based on 60-day episodes of care, with payment adjustments and unlimited episodes of care in a year. CMS made payment reductions in CY 2008. The regulation established changes to the HHA case-mix index to adjust the national prospective 60-day episode payment rate downward by 2.75% for CY2008, and by 2.75% for each calendar year 2009 and 2010, and by 2.71% for CY2011. The proposed rule for CY 2010 would continue the 2.75% reduction, cap outlier payments at 10% of total HH PPS payments, update the fixed dollar loss ratio to 0.67, and target outlier payments to be no more than 2.5% of total HH PPS payments. The provision would accelerate case-mix adjustments by implementing both the planned CY2011 adjustment of 2.71% and the planned changes. The regulation established changes to the HHA case-mix index to adjust the national prospective 60-day episode payment rate downward by 2.75% for CY2008, and by 2.75% for each calendar year 2009 and 2010, and by 2.71% for CY2011. Starting in 2011, PPS amounts would be adjusted by a uniform percentage determined appropriate by the Secretary and based on analysis of certain factors. If more recent data indicates a greater adjustment is needed, it would not be limited. The Secretary would adjust the prospective payment amount for home health services based on the difference between the actual amount applied and the correct amount. The CBO score for home health provisions is -$16.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$56.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Home health agencies are paid under a prospective payment system, with the payment amount increased annually based on changes in the home health market basket index. The home health MB index measures changes in costs of goods and services purchased by HHAs. HHAs must submit health care quality data to the Secretary. A HHA not submitting required data will receive an update of the MB minus two percentage points. Annual updates by the HH MB, starting in 2011, are subject to a productivity adjustment. The productivity adjustment equals the 10-year moving average of changes in private non-farm business multi-factor productivity. CBO scores for home health provisions are -$16.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$54.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. MedPAC reported that home health agencies had margins of 16.6% in 2007, similar to the average of 16.5% for 2002-2007. MedPAC reported that home health agencies had margins of 16.6% in 2007, similar to the average of 16.5% for 2002-2007. The report suggested that home health payments should be reduced in 2010 and payments rebased in 2011 to prevent overpayment. MedPAC would conduct a study on variation in performance of HHAs to explain Medicare margins, with a report due to Congress by June 1, 2011. The Commission is required to submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2011, on the results of a study regarding home health agencies. Medicare regulations typically require a registered nurse to conduct an initial assessment visit for HHA beneficiaries, but there are exceptions for cases involving rehabilitation therapy services. The provision allows HHAs to choose a skilled therapist to conduct the initial assessment visit for individuals referred for home health services, as long as the therapist is qualified to provide the skilled service required. The CBO estimates a cost impact of -$50 million to $50 million for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Entities receiving Medicare payment for covered items and services must disclose ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements, including information on physicians with financial interests. Hospitals meeting specific requirements are exempt from the prohibition on self-referral. Hospitals with physician ownership and a provider agreement in operation before January 1, 2009 may be exempt from the self-referral ban, with ownership percentage restrictions and limitations on facility expansion. Information on these hospitals will be publicly disclosed on the CMS website. Exempt hospitals with physician ownership must meet certain requirements to ensure bona fide ownership and investment. Ownership or investment interest offered to physicians cannot be more favorable than to non-referring individuals. Civil monetary penalties may apply for failure to meet reporting and disclosure requirements. The Secretary can terminate a hospital's provider agreement for non-compliance with Medicare's conditions. Exempt hospitals cannot increase operating rooms, procedure rooms, or beds post-enactment, except under specific conditions. Hospitals with the highest Medicaid admissions can expand with fewer requirements, limited to the main campus. The Secretary can terminate a hospital's provider agreement for non-compliance with Medicare's conditions. Hospitals on the main campus can only increase capacity by up to 200% of operating rooms, procedure rooms, and beds at the time of enactment. Regulations for the appeal process must be established within 18 months, with a final decision posted on the CMS website within 120 days of receiving a complete application. Enforcement efforts may include unannounced site reviews of hospitals. $5 million would be appropriated annually starting in FY2010. Sec. 1157 appropriates $5 million annually from FY2010 for a study on Medicare's geographic adjustment factors. Medicare uses various adjustment factors to address geographic cost differences in healthcare services. For instance, the physician fee schedule utilizes the geographic practice cost index, while the IPPS employs a hospital wage index for acute care facilities. These adjustments also apply to inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and home care. The Secretary would contract with the Institutes of Medicine to conduct a study on the accuracy of Medicare's geographic adjustment factors for physician fee schedules and IPPS. The study would assess the impact on the healthcare workforce, population health, quality of care, and provider efficiency. The report would be submitted to Congress within one year, with necessary funds authorized for the study. The CBO score for FY2010-FY2019 is $0.0 billion. Medicare's payment systems have adjustment factors for geographic cost differences in healthcare services. The IOM was tasked with studying the GPC for Medicare's physician fee schedule and hospital wage index. Medicare uses these systems to reimburse practitioners and providers. Changes to Medicare's payment policies are made through an annual rulemaking process. The Secretary must consider IOM recommendations for revising geographic adjustments in Medicare's payment systems. Changes will be included in the next rulemaking cycle after the IOM report submission. Geographic adjustments cannot be lower than the previous year before 2014. Starting in 2014, adjustments can be changed accordingly. Starting in 2014, the geographic adjustment in the Medicare payment system would not increase expenditures. The Medicare Improvement Fund (MIF) with $8 billion authorized for FY2011 to FY2019 would fund these changes. Any unused funds for the adjustment would be returned to the MIF. The CBO score is $8.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $14.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, a study on geographic variation in health care spending would be conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to promote high-value health care. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) was tasked with studying geographic variation and growth in healthcare spending among different populations to improve payments under Medicare and private insurance by promoting high-value care. The study would evaluate factors contributing to geographic variation, such as input prices, practice patterns, and patient access to care. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) was tasked with studying geographic variation in healthcare spending to improve Medicare and private insurance payments by promoting high-value care. Factors evaluated included input prices, practice patterns, patient access to care, insurance status, distribution of resources, health outcomes, and measures of healthcare quality. The study also looked at variations attributed to physician discretion, patient preferences, compliance, and other factors deemed appropriate by the IOM. Recommendations for changes to fee-for-service Medicare payments were based on the study findings and changes made by the Act. The IOM would recommend modifications to Medicare payment systems for physicians and hospitals to incentivize high-value care through a value index based on quality and cost measures. Specific recommendations on index design and implementation would be provided to promote high-value care. The IOM would recommend modifications to Medicare payment systems for physicians and hospitals to incentivize high-value care through a value index based on quality and cost measures. A report containing findings and recommendations would be submitted to the Secretary and Congress by April 15, 2011. $10 million would be authorized for this study. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of $10 million from the Treasury for implementing changes in Medicare payments to promote high-value healthcare. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit a Final Implementation Plan to Congress, with regulations to be implemented unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted by May 31, 2012. The measure establishes fast track procedures for congressional action on a joint resolution of disapproval regarding Medicare payment changes. It includes provisions for prompt congressional action and facilitates the exchange of legislation between the House and Senate. The CBO score for Section 1161 is -$47.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$154.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. This provision modifies Medicare Advantage benchmarks by aligning them with original Medicare spending levels and increasing them for high-quality MA plans. MA is an alternative way for Medicare beneficiaries to receive covered benefits through private health plans. Payments to MA plans are determined by comparing plan bids to a benchmark. Payments to MA plans are determined by comparing plan bids to a benchmark. If the bid is below the benchmark, the plan payment is the bid plus 75% of the difference. If the bid is above the benchmark, the plan payment is equal to the benchmark and enrollees must pay a premium. MA benchmarks are based on historical Medicare private plan payment rates, which have been increased over time, resulting in benchmarks exceeding per capita FFS costs in some areas. The provision would phase-in MA benchmarks equal to per capita FFS spending in each county starting in 2011, with benchmarks not being less than per capita FFS spending. Quality bonus payments would be given to qualifying MA plans based on a quality ranking system, with benchmark increases of 1.5% in 2011, 3.0% in 2012, and 5.0% in subsequent years. The provision outlines criteria for qualifying MA plans to receive quality bonus payments based on a quality ranking system. Plans must have a quality ranking of four stars or higher and be in counties with low per capita spending in original Medicare and high MA enrollment. Non-compliance with MA rules could result in loss of the quality bonus payment. Additionally, the Secretary has the authority to adjust Medicare payments to MA plans to account for coding intensity differences between plans and providers. The provision extends the requirement for MA plan payment adjustments based on coding patterns beyond 2010. The Secretary must conduct periodic analyses of coding differences and incorporate findings promptly. The CBO estimates a cost of -$2.9 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$15.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1163 simplifies annual beneficiary election periods for Medicare beneficiaries to enroll or change MA plans from November 15 to December 31 each year. Changes take effect on January 1st, with a three-month period for enrollment or plan switching. The provision in Sec. 1164 extends reasonable cost contracts for MA plans reimbursed by Medicare. Cost plans were created in TEFRA in 1982, and the phase-out has been delayed through congressional action. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The provision extends the phase-out of reasonable cost contracts for Medicare Advantage plans, allowing them to operate if certain criteria are met. The extension lasts from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2012, regardless of other MA plans in the area. The Secretary considers minimum enrollment requirements when deciding to renew or extend a reasonable cost plan for MA regional or local plans. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. The Secretary can waive or modify requirements for employer or union sponsored MA plans, offered through contracts or directly by the employer or union group. The Secretary can waive or modify MA requirements for plans with 90% of eligible individuals living in a county where the MA organization offers a local plan. This provision applies to plan years starting January 1, 2011, and excludes plans in effect before December 31, 2010. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare payments to MA plans are risk-adjusted to cover care costs for older and sicker beneficiaries, discouraging preferential enrollment of healthier individuals. The provision requires the Secretary to evaluate and report on the adequacy of MA risk adjustments in predicting costs for beneficiaries with chronic conditions, dually-eligible beneficiaries, and low-income beneficiaries. The report will also assess the feasibility of including more disease gradations and multiple years of beneficiary data. By January 1, 2012, necessary improvements to the MA risk adjustment system must be implemented. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1167 eliminates the MA Regional Plan Stabilization Fund, originally set at $10 billion, with funds now delayed until 2014. The provision transfers amounts in the Fund to the Part B Trust Fund. The CBO score is -$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1168 requires CMS to study the effects of calculating Medicare Advantage payment rates on a regional average basis rather than using county boundaries. The study will assess impacts on plan quality, networks, and benchmark predictability. CMS must consult experts and stakeholders and submit a report to Congress within one year. CBO scores are $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1172 prohibits MA plans from offering benefits with cost-sharing requirements greater than traditional Medicare. It also limits cost-sharing for dual-eligible individuals and qualified Medicare beneficiaries. Continuous Open Enrollment allows beneficiaries to change MA plans outside of the annual election period. The provision allows enrollees in MA plans to make changes outside the annual election period under specific circumstances, such as plan termination, change in residence, plan contract violations, or other exceptional conditions. It expands eligibility for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to include beneficiaries in suspended private plans. Additionally, it mandates the publication of administrative cost information, including the medical loss ratio (MLR), for MA plans. The Secretary would develop standardized elements for reporting data to calculate a minimum MLR for MA plans. Plans failing to meet the MLR requirement would face sanctions, including providing rebates to enrollees and enrollment restrictions. CBO scores indicate no significant costs for the specified fiscal years. Additionally, the Secretary is required to strengthen audit authority for MA plans. The Secretary is required to strengthen audit authority for MA plans by conducting annual audits of financial records and having the authority to address deficiencies. Plans must submit monthly bid amounts for each MA plan they intend to offer. The Secretary has the authority to evaluate and negotiate bid amounts and benefit packages for MA plans. States have the authority to enforce federal marketing requirements and recommend sanctions to the Secretary. The Secretary has authority to evaluate and negotiate bid amounts and benefit packages for MA plans. States can enforce federal marketing requirements and recommend sanctions. MA and PDP plans are exempt from enforcement actions by the Secretary and States. Special needs plans target enrollment for individuals with specific needs. The SNP program was authorized by MMSEA and extended by MIPPA, with a moratorium on new SNPs until January 1, 2011. The number of SNPs has increased significantly since 2004. Beneficiaries can enroll in Medicare Advantage from November 15th to December 31st each year. H.R. 3962 would require SNPs serving beneficiaries with severe or disabling conditions starting January 1, 2011. Starting January 1, 2011, SNPs serving beneficiaries with severe or disabling conditions could only enroll eligible individuals during an annual open enrollment period or at the time of diagnosis. The CBO score for Sections 1176 \u2014 1178 is +$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. SNPs may restrict enrollment to special needs individuals before January 1, 2011, but new enrollment from January 1, 2010, must be limited to dual eligible, chronic care, and institutional care individuals. Dual eligible SNPs are required to contract with state Medicaid agencies for medical assistance services. The provision allows SNPs to provide Medicaid services, including long-term care, without Medicaid contracts. SNPs can continue operating without expanding if no contracts are in place by January 1, 2010. State Medicaid agencies are not obligated to contract with SNPs. Enrollment restrictions for special needs individuals are extended to January 1, 2013, and for selected SNPs with approved integrated programs, to January 1, 2016. The Secretary must analyze SNPs approved by CMS as of January 1, 2004. The analysis of grandfathered SNPs approved by CMS as of January 1, 2004 includes cost, quality of care, and patient satisfaction impact. A report with recommendations to Congress is due by December 31, 2011. CBO scores for Sections 1176\u20141178 are +$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1178 allows Medicare Advantage plans to target smaller areas with a waiver to restrict enrollment to retirement community residents. H.R. 3962 introduces a new Medicare Advantage plan type. H.R. 3962 introduces a new type of Medicare Advantage plan called Medicare Advantage Senior Housing Facility Plan, which can limit its service area to a senior housing facility. The plan serves beneficiaries in a continuing care retirement community, has on-site primary care providers, provides transportation benefits, and existed under a demonstration before January 1, 2010. CBO scores for Sections 1176\u20141178 are +$0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Sec. 1181 eliminates the coverage gap in Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Prior to the implementation of Medicare Part D, Medicaid was the main payer for drugs for dual-eligible beneficiaries. Low-income individuals may qualify for federal assistance to help with Medicare Part D costs if their income is below 150% of the FPL. Drug manufacturers must provide rebates for their drugs to be available for Medicaid enrollees. The coverage gap in Medicare Part D will be gradually phased out. The provision aims to eliminate the coverage gap in Medicare Part D by 2019. Drug manufacturers must provide rebates for drugs dispensed to eligible enrollees to fund the elimination of the coverage gap. The CBO estimates a cost of -$21.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$42.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Beneficiary premiums may increase faster, but the reduction in cost sharing would outweigh the premium increase. The provision includes discounts for certain Part D drugs in the coverage gap, with manufacturers providing 50% discounts for brand-name drugs. The discounts would count towards costs incurred by plan enrollees, excluding those receiving low income subsidy. This provision applies to drugs dispensed after December 31, 2010, with a CBO score of -$21.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$42.3 billion for FY2010-FY2019. H.R. 3962 would repeal Section 172 of MIPPA, eliminating deadlines for long-term care pharmacists to submit Part D claims, allowing more time for coordination with state Medicaid programs. The CBO score is $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Assistance Programs And Indian Health Service In Providing Prescription Drugs Toward The Annual Out Of Pocket Threshold Under Part D. Beneficiaries must reach a certain out-of-pocket cost level before catastrophic protection begins. Costs must be paid by the individual, low-income individuals under subsidy provisions, or State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs to count towards true out-of-pocket costs. Other payments that do not count include Part D premiums and coverage by other insurance. Part D plans' supplemental benefits can count costs paid by Indian Health Service or AIDS Drug Assistance Program towards out-of-pocket threshold. CBO estimates +$0.3 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and +$0.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Part D plans cannot make mid-year formulary changes, except for new therapeutic uses or newly approved drugs. Plans can apply utilization management restrictions to drugs on their formularies. Part D plans cannot make mid-year formulary changes, except for new therapeutic uses or newly approved drugs. Plans can apply utilization management restrictions to drugs on their formularies, including tiers for cost sharing, prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits. Plans must provide notice for any changes affecting coverage or cost-sharing for drugs. Starting in 2011, Part D sponsors are prohibited from removing covered drugs or making significant formulary changes after marketing activities for the plan year have begun, with exceptions for certain circumstances. The provision allows exceptions for brand name drugs with generic alternatives approved during the plan year or FDA recalls. CBO scores $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug prices and must provide access to these negotiated prices for covered drugs. The Secretary cannot interfere with negotiations or require specific formularies or price structures. Section 1186 would remove the \"non-interference provision\" from SSA \u00a7 1860D-11(i) and require the Secretary to negotiate prescription drug prices for Part D drugs. The provision maintains the prohibition against the Secretary establishing a formulary but allows for discounts or price reductions below those negotiated. It would take effect upon enactment and apply to plan years starting on January 1, 2011, with a CBO score of $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014. Sec. 1187 requires Part D plans to offer contracts to LTC pharmacies meeting performance criteria. LTC facilities choose eligible pharmacies for Medicare drug benefits. Formularies must cover necessary medications for LTC residents. Prescriptions are often dispensed in 30- or 90-day quantities. Starting January 1, 2012, Part D sponsors must use utilization management techniques to reduce medication waste for beneficiaries in long-term care facilities. This includes dispensing medications in smaller quantities to prevent unused medication due to discharge, death, or adverse reactions. The CBO estimates savings of -$1.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$5.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, Section 1128A(a) of the Social Security Act allows penalties for improper conduct related to federal health care programs. Section 1128A(a)(5) prohibits offering remuneration to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries to influence their choice of provider, practitioner, or supplier, with penalties of up to $10,000 per item received. Remuneration includes waivers of copayments and transfers of items/services for free or below fair market value, excluding copayment reductions under a prescription drug plan. The provision prohibits offering remuneration to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries to influence their choice of provider, practitioner, or supplier, with penalties of up to $10,000 per item received. It includes a reduction in copayment amount to induce individuals to switch to generic drugs. The CBO score is -$1.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and -$3.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Participants must obtain coverage through a Part D sponsor, which is required to be organized and licensed under state law. The provision would amend Section 1860D-12 of the SSA to require that CMS may only grant a waiver of licensure for a particular state if it has received a certification from the State Insurance Commissioner that the prescription drug plan has a substantially complete application pending in that state. Additionally, the waiver could be revoked if the State Insurance Commissioner submits a certification to CMS that the sponsor committed fraud with respect to the waiver. The provision requires CMS to grant a waiver of licensure only if a certification is received from the State Insurance Commissioner. The waiver can be revoked if fraud is committed. Medicare covers various services through telehealth, with an interactive telecommunications system required for payment. The originating site can be a physician's office. The originating site for telehealth services can be a variety of healthcare facilities in rural or underserved areas. A Telehealth Advisory Committee would be appointed to make policy recommendations for covered services and procedure codes. The Secretary would consider Committee recommendations for covered services and issue hospital guidance for simplifying practitioner credentialing for telehealth services. Hospitals could accept credentialing packages from other Medicare participating hospitals without oversight. This provision does not apply to privileging requirements and has a CBO score between -$50 million and $50 million for FY2010-FY2014. Extension of Outpatient Hold Harmless Provision for small rural hospitals with no more than 100 beds, not sole community hospitals, to receive additional Medicare payments if outpatient payments are less under the prospective payment system. Payment percentages decreased from 95% in CY2006 to 85% in CY2009. Sole community hospitals with not more than 100 beds receive 85% of the payment difference for covered HOPD services furnished between January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2010. The provision extends the outpatient hold harmless provision for small rural hospitals and sole community hospitals with not more than 100 beds to receive additional Medicare payments. The extension includes a payment difference of 85% for covered HOPD services furnished between January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2010. Additionally, the Section 508 hospital reclassifications were extended multiple times, exempt from budget neutrality requirements. The provision extends Section 508 reclassifications until September 30, 2011, with payments based on FY2010 wage index. CBO scores $0.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Geographic adjustments in Medicare fee schedule reflect differences in resource costs for physician services. Temporary floor value of 1.00 on physician work index set by series of bills, most recently extended by Section 134 of MIPPA. The proposal extends the 1.00 floor for the geographic index for physician work through December 2012, increasing outlays by $1.1 billion over the next three years. Additionally, the provision extends payment for the technical component of certain physician pathology services. Sec. 1196 extends ambulance add-ons, increasing outlays by $100 million in 2010 and 2011. Ground ambulance services are paid based on a national fee schedule, with mileage payments increased for rural areas from July 2004 to December 2009. Sec. 1201 of MIPPA extends higher payments for ground transports from rural areas until December 31, 2012. The provision also maintains rural designations for air ambulance payments until December 31, 2011. The CBO estimates a cost of $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Assets Tests for Medicare Savings Program and Low-income Subsidy Program are being adjusted to increase eligibility levels. Beneficiaries must meet income and resource limits to qualify for the low-income subsidy, with an asset test of $17,000 for individuals and $34,000 for couples in 2012. The CBO estimates a positive impact on Medicare spending of +$3.2 billion for FY2010-2014 and +$11.8 billion. Sec. 1202 eliminates Part D cost-sharing for certain full-benefit dual eligible individuals, providing full-subsidy eligibles with no deductible, minimal cost sharing, and no cost-sharing over the catastrophic threshold. This provision aims to eliminate cost sharing for individuals receiving care under a home and community-based waiver. The CBO scores for Sections 1201-1207 show positive effects on Medicare and Medicaid spending. Sec. 1203 aims to eliminate barriers to enrollment in the Medicare Part D low-income subsidy program. Applicants must provide financial information to support their application. Sec. 1204 allows individuals to self-certify income for low-income subsidy eligibility under the prescription drug program starting January 1, 2010. CBO scores show positive effects on Medicare and Medicaid spending. Individuals qualifying for certain programs are automatically eligible for the subsidy. The low-income subsidy eligibility can be determined by the SSA or state Medicaid agency, with retroactive application. Part D sponsors must reimburse beneficiaries for any premiums or cost-sharing that should have been covered by the subsidy. The reimbursement is automatic upon eligibility confirmation, with no further action required from the beneficiary. The CBO scores for Sections 1201-1207 show a positive impact on Medicare and Medicaid spending. Sec. 1205 discusses the process of intelligent assignment in enrollment for low-income individuals gaining Part D coverage. Full-benefit dual-eligible individuals are auto-enrolled into a Part D plan, but this random assignment process may not always meet their needs. The Secretary may use an \"intelligent assignment\" process for Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in Part D plans, considering quality, cost, and formularies. CBO scores show positive impacts on Medicare and Medicaid spending. Special enrollment period allows certain subsidy eligible individuals to enroll in Part D outside of the annual open enrollment period. The annual open enrollment period for Medicare Part D plans is from November 15 to December 31 each year. Beneficiaries can change plans during this time or during special enrollment periods. A new special enrollment period is proposed for low-income subsidy eligible individuals starting in January 2011. HHS would have the authority to enroll subsidy-eligible beneficiaries into plans based on quality, cost, and formulary, with the option for beneficiaries to choose another plan. The CBO score for the impact on Medicare spending is +$3.2 billion for FY2010-2014 and +$11.8 billion. Sec. 1207 discusses the application of MA premiums for LIS beneficiaries enrolled in benchmark plans. The federal government pays up to 100% of Part D premiums for these beneficiaries. MA plans offering prescription drug coverage submit a separate bid for the Part D portion, with payment calculated similarly to stand-alone PDPs. The MA plan may apply Part C rebate payments to lower the Part D premium for LIS enrollees. The number of qualifying plans for low-income benchmark plans has been decreasing, affecting approximately 2.3 million LIS enrollees in 2009. The provision excludes Medicare Advantage rebate amounts and MA quality bonus payments from premium bids for subsidy determinations starting in January 2011. CBO scores show a positive impact on Medicare spending. Sec. 1231 extends therapy caps exceptions process for two years, allowing additional therapy services if medically necessary. CBO scores show a positive impact on Medicaid spending. Sec. 1232 extends Medicare coverage for immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant patients and ESRD beneficiaries, with no time limit on coverage. Medicare will continue to pay for immunosuppressive drugs with no time limit, except for beneficiaries who qualify only because of kidney failure, where coverage ends 36 months after a successful transplant. This provision eliminates the 36-month limitation on coverage for kidney transplant patients starting January 1, 2012. The CBO estimates a cost of between +$50 million and -$50 million for FY2010-2014 and -$0.1 billion for FY2010-2019. MIPPA defines \"end-of-life planning\" as information on advance directives and physician willingness to follow them. It would add voluntary advance care planning consultations as a covered service for Medicare beneficiaries under Part B, with payment to physicians. Consultations are optional and can be done more frequently if there is a significant change in the individual's health status. The consultation for advance care planning under Medicare includes explanations on various topics such as advance directives, health care proxies, end-of-life care services, and life-sustaining treatment orders. The cost estimate for this service is $0.7 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $2.0 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Starting in 2001, military retirees and their eligible dependents become eligible for Tricare for Life at the same time they become eligible for Medicare. Tricare for Life functions as a Medicare supplement, providing coverage for services not covered by Medicare. Enrollment in Medicare Part B is required for access to Tricare for Life. Legislation waived penalties for late enrollment in Part B. Legislation waived penalties for late enrollment in Medicare Part B for military retirees and their eligible dependents, allowing them a special 12-month enrollment period to enroll in Part B without incurring a penalty. The provision also includes rebates for late enrollment penalties charged to certain disabled and end-stage renal disease beneficiaries who enrolled after January 2005. The CBO score estimates a cost between -$50 million and $50 million for both FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Beginning in 2007, higher-income Medicare enrollees pay a higher percentage of Part B costs. The provision excludes income from gains on the sale of a primary residence from the beneficiary's modified adjusted gross income for determining the Part B income-related premium. This modification applies to premiums and payments starting in 2011. The CBO estimates a cost between -$50 million and $50 million for FY2010-FY2014. Sec. 1236 introduces a Medicare demonstration program to assess the effectiveness of patient decision aids in helping beneficiaries understand their medical treatment options. Up to 30 eligible providers will participate, offering follow-up counseling visits after patients view the decision aids. The Medicare demonstration program assesses patient decision aids' effectiveness by offering follow-up counseling visits after beneficiaries view the aids. Providers are responsible for costs and reporting data. The program is funded through the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The accountable care organization pilot program under the Social Security Act would test different payment incentive models for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Qualifying ACOs would be groups of physicians or other providers organized to provide services and meet specific standards. The program would start by January 1, 2012, with participating providers sharing in incentive payments. The pilot program for accountable care organizations (ACOs) under the Social Security Act would begin by January 1, 2012. Qualifying ACOs would enter into agreements covering a multi-year period of three to five years, with established requirements for performance targets, adjustment factors, and incentive payments. The Secretary would set annual quality targets for ACOs to receive incentive payments, operate at financial risk, or participate in alternative financing models. An evaluation of the payment incentive model's impact on beneficiaries, providers, suppliers, and the program would be conducted, with results made publicly available within 60 days. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) would monitor ACO operations for violations of the Stark self-referral prohibition. The Secretary would report to Congress every two years on the impact of the ACO pilot program on expenditures, access, and quality. The Chief Actuary of CMS must certify that any expansion of the program would result in lower estimated spending. $25 million would be appropriated for FY2010 through FY2014 and $20 million in FY2015 for program administration. The Medical Home Pilot Program under TRHCA, as modified by MIPPA, requires the Secretary to establish a three-year demonstration in up to 8 states to provide targeted, accessible, continuous, and coordinated family-centered care to high need Medicare populations with chronic illnesses. The program aims to evaluate Medicare payments to qualified patient-centered medical homes for furnishing services to high need beneficiaries. Funding includes $25 million for FY2010-FY2014 and $20 million for FY2015 for program administration. The Secretary is required to establish pilot programs to evaluate two medical home models: the independent patient-centered medical home model and the community-based medical home model. Nurse practitioners or physician assistants can lead a patient-centered medical home as long as all pilot program requirements are met. The independent patient-centered medical home pilot program would start within 6 months of enactment, with monthly fees paid to participating homes for each targeted high need beneficiary who consents to receive services. The pilot program for community-based medical homes includes physicians from practices of all sizes, especially in underserved areas. Payments would be made for services provided to high-need beneficiaries, with community health workers assisting in chronic care management. The program must start within 12 months of enactment and operate for five years. The Secretary would establish a payment methodology for medical home services under the CBMH model, including monthly payments to organizations and primary care practices for high-need beneficiaries. A report would be submitted to Congress after the pilot program evaluation. The Secretary could implement permanent models if beneficial to Medicare, pending approval from the Chief Actuary of CMS on cost implications. Funding would be transferred from the Part B Trust Fund for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The CMS Program Management Account would receive funding from the Medical Insurance Trust Fund for patient-centered medical home services. $200 million annually for 2010-2014 and $125 million annually for 2012-2016 would be allocated. An additional $2.5 million yearly for 2010-2012 would cover implementation costs. The Medicare Medical Home Demonstration project would be repealed, with $100 million redirected to the new pilot program. The CBO estimates a total of $1.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $1.8 billion for FY2012-FY2016. The CBO estimates $1.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $1.8 billion for FY2010-FY2019 for the medical home pilot program. Payment incentives for primary care services in designated areas are provided, with bonus payments for physicians and psychiatrists in health professional shortage areas. The incentive amount is 5% for primary care practitioners starting January 1, 2011. The payment incentive for primary care services is 5% (or 10% in designated shortage areas) paid from the Part B Trust Fund. It includes evaluation, management, and preventive services, regardless of physician specialty. The incentive does not affect additional payments in shortage areas. CBO estimates $1.8 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $4.7 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Medicare pays 80% of reasonable charges for provider services under Part B, with increased reimbursement for Certified Nurse-Midwives. The proposal aims to remove the 65% restriction on Medicare payments to certified nurse-midwives for services provided under Medicare Part B. This modification would be effective from January 1, 2011. The CBO estimates a score between -$50 million and $50 million for both FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. The proposal aims to exclude items and services provided by clinical social workers to Medicare beneficiaries in a SNF from SNF consolidated billing, establishing a separate Medicare payment from October 1, 2010. The CBO estimates a score of $0.0 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the coverage of Marriage and Family Therapist Services and Mental Health Counselor Services is discussed under Section 1861(s)(2) of the SSA. The provision aims to add marriage and family therapists and mental health counselors as subcategories of medical and health services under Medicare. Medicare would cover 80% of the actual charge for services provided by these therapists. Confidentiality issues would be considered for direct payment and medical information sharing with the patient's primary care provider. Services by these therapists would be excluded from SNF consolidated billing. The provision includes adding marriage and family therapists and mental health counselors as providers in rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers. They can file claims for services provided, with a CBO score of $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.4 billion for FY2010-FY2019. Additionally, the extension of the Physician Fee Schedule Mental Health Add-on is discussed, where Medicare billing codes are evaluated every five years to adjust rates for services provided by physicians. MIPPA increased Medicare payments for psychotherapy services by 5% from July 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, with a proposed extension until December 31, 2011. The bill also includes expanding Medicare Part B coverage for federally recommended vaccines and implementing an Independence at Home Demonstration Program starting in 2012. The CBO scores for these provisions are $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $0.1 billion for FY2010-FY2019 for psychotherapy services, and $0.2 billion for FY2010-FY2014 and $1.5 billion for FY2010-FY2019 for vaccines. The Secretary would conduct a Medicare demonstration program from January 1, 2012, to test a payment incentive and service delivery model using physician and nurse practitioner directed home-based primary care teams for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries. Agreements would be made with qualifying independence at home medical practices, comprised of physicians, nurse practitioners, and other staff experienced in home-based primary care services. Practice staff would make in-home visits and be available 24 hours per day. The Medicare demonstration program aims to utilize physician and nurse practitioner directed home-based primary care teams for chronically ill beneficiaries. Beneficiaries must meet specific criteria to qualify for the program, with a limit of 10,000 participants. The Secretary will establish a methodology for sharing savings with participating practices based on annual expenditures. Target spending levels will be set to account for variations in covered services. The Secretary will determine incentive payments for practices based on annual expenditures, with savings beyond 5% apportioned considering various factors. Payments for shared savings to each practice will be limited to prevent exceeding estimated expenditures for applicable beneficiaries. The Secretary will determine incentive payments for practices based on annual expenditures, with savings beyond 5% apportioned considering various factors. Payments for shared savings to each practice will be limited to prevent exceeding estimated expenditures for applicable beneficiaries. Under the demonstration program, agreements with practices can cover a maximum of three years. The Secretary must submit a final report to Congress on the program's impact on care coordination, expenditures, beneficiary access, and healthcare quality. $5 million will be appropriated to the CMS Program Management Account annually from 2010 to 2015. Sec. 1313 amends SSA Sec. 1861 to designate certified diabetes educators as Medicare-certified providers of DSMT services. A \"certified diabetes educator\" is defined as an individual meeting specific criteria. Sec. 1601 provides increased funding and flexibility to fight fraud and abuse in healthcare. The HCFAC account funds activities to combat health care fraud. The HCFAC program, established by HIPAA in 1996, increases federal funding for anti-fraud activities in healthcare. It funds enforcement and prosecution of healthcare fraud, while MIP funding supports program integrity activities by CMS contractors. Funding for HCFAC and MIP would increase by $100 million annually starting in FY2011. Total funding for healthcare fraud activities in FY2009 was $1.4 billion.
