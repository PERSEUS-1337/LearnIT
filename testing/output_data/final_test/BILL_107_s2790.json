The \"Roadless Area Conservation Act of 2002\" aims to establish national protection for inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System to safeguard their unique social and ecological values, including protecting healthy watersheds, ensuring clean water supply, maintaining wildlife habitats, supporting outdoor recreation, and providing drinking water to millions of people. The protection of roadless areas is essential for maintaining clean water supply, preserving biodiversity, and providing habitats for imperiled species. It also saves downstream communities money on water filtration costs and prevents the spread of invasive species. Roadless areas offer various recreational activities and contain sacred sites for Native Americans. The Forest Service aims to manage these areas for resource extraction and conservation. The Act protects social and ecological values in inventoried roadless areas while allowing for multiple uses. It establishes a national policy to ensure long-term benefits, reduce controversy, and focus on conservation. The Forest Service focuses on reducing hazardous fuel buildups in roaded areas, as fires are more likely to occur there. A report advocates prioritizing fuel reduction near communities and accessible watersheds due to a backlog of maintenance needs in the road system. The Forest Service faces a significant backlog in maintaining its 386,000 mile road system, costing millions of dollars to address. Neglecting forest roads limits public access, degrades water quality, and harms wildlife habitats. Protecting roadless areas will have minimal impact on timber supply and oil/gas production. The purpose of this Act is to provide lasting protection for inventoried roadless areas within the National Forest System, within the context of multiple-use management. Roadless areas only contribute a fraction of the oil and gas production in the National Forest System. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"classified road\" refers to a road within or near National Forest System land needed for long-term motor vehicle access, including State, county, privately owned, and Forest Service roads. An \"inventoried roadless area\" is an area identified in specific maps from a document dated November 2000. The term \"responsible official\" in the Act refers to the Forest Service line officer or employee authorized to make decisions about managing roadless areas. A \"road\" is defined as a motor vehicle travelway over 50 inches wide, unless designated as a trail. \"Road construction\" involves adding classified or temporary road miles, while \"road improvement\" increases the traffic service level of an existing road. The term \"roadless area characteristics\" refers to resources and features found in inventoried roadless areas, including high-quality soil, water, air, public drinking water sources, diverse plant and animal communities, and habitat for threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The curr_chunk discusses various types of landscapes and properties, including primitive recreation areas, reference landscapes, natural appearing landscapes, traditional cultural properties, and unique local characteristics. It also defines road maintenance as ongoing upkeep to retain or restore roads and road realignment as an activity resulting in changes to roads. Road reconstruction is the improvement or realignment of an existing classified road. A temporary road is authorized by contract or permit and is not part of the forest transportation system. An unclassified road on National Forest System land is not managed as part of the forest transportation system. The curr_chunk discusses unplanned roads, abandoned travelways, and off-road vehicle tracks that are not designated and managed as trails, as well as roads that were once permitted but not decommissioned. Prohibition on road construction and reconstruction in inventoried roadless areas. Exceptions to the prohibition of road construction in inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System include cases of imminent threats to public health and safety, response actions under environmental laws, and natural resource restoration actions. Exceptions to the prohibition of road construction in inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System include natural resource restoration actions, road realignment to prevent irreparable resource damage, and provide essential public or private access. Exceptions to the prohibition of road construction in inventoried roadless areas of the National Forest System include road reconstruction for road safety improvement projects on hazardous roads, Federal-aid highway projects that are in the public interest or consistent with land purposes, and roads needed for mineral lease continuation. The Secretary of the Interior can issue a new lease immediately after an existing lease expires. Road construction or reconstruction must minimize surface resource effects, prevent unnecessary disturbance, and comply with laws. Roads must be removed when no longer needed for lease purposes. The Secretary of the Interior can issue a new lease immediately after an existing lease expires. Road construction or reconstruction must minimize surface resource effects, prevent unnecessary disturbance, and comply with laws. Roads must be removed when no longer needed for lease purposes. A classified road in an inventoried roadless area may be maintained. Prohibition on timber cutting, sale, or removal in inventoried roadless areas. Exceptions to the prohibition of timber cutting in inventoried roadless areas allow for cutting small diameter timber to improve habitat for threatened species or maintain roadless area characteristics. Exceptions to the prohibition of timber cutting in inventoried roadless areas include maintaining ecosystem composition and structure, incidental timber removal for management activities, personal or administrative use, and preserving roadless characteristics. Exceptions to the prohibition of timber cutting in inventoried roadless areas include maintaining ecosystem composition and structure, incidental timber removal for management activities, personal or administrative use, and preserving roadless characteristics. Additionally, roadless characteristics may be altered in a portion of an inventoried roadless area due to road construction and timber harvest, as long as the activities occurred after the area was designated as such and before January 12, 2001, with timber cutting limited to the altered portion. SEC. 6. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY. This Act does not affect permits, contracts, or legal instruments for National Forest System land issued before January 12, 2001. It does not require changes to land management plans or affect decisions made before that date. It also does not apply to certain activities in the Tongass National Forest if an environmental impact statement was published before January 12, 2001. The prohibitions and restrictions in this Act cannot be revised. The provisions established in this Act are final and cannot be changed in any future project decisions or revisions to land management plans under the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974."
