H.R. 2 passed with a 61 cents per pack increase, generating estimated revenues of $64.7 billion for FY2009-FY2018. Cigarettes account for 94% of tobacco sales, totaling $75 billion in 2007. Federal cigarette taxes make up 94% of tobacco tax revenue, with a tax of $0.39 per pack. Other tobacco products have varying tax rates, such as small cigars with a 4 cent tax per package and large cigars with a tax of 20.719% of sales price. The proposed 61-cent cigarette tax increase would also affect snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco. Roll-your-own tobacco would see an eight-fold increase in taxes, while small cigars would be taxed at the same rate as cigarettes. The tobacco tax receipts in the United States in FY2007 included $7.5 billion in federal tax, $16.2 billion in state and local taxes, and $8 billion in payments from the Master Tobacco Settlement. State and local taxes were roughly 88 cents per pack, and the tobacco settlement payment is approximately the same as the federal tax, 43 cents per pack. Some states have securitized their payments. Some states have securitized tobacco payments. A quarter of payments go to private investors. Federal, state, and local tobacco payments make up 42.2% of sales revenues. A 61 cent tax increase could generate $6.4 billion in revenue but may result in a $1.5 billion loss for states. Tobacco taxes are being considered as a revenue source for funding child health programs, but there are concerns about the burden falling on lower-income individuals. The discussion revolves around the trade-off between discouraging smoking, especially among youth, and the distributional effects of tobacco taxes. Economic efficiency questions arise regarding the costs smokers impose on others. Studies show that price increases reduce smoking, but the response is relatively small, with a 10% price increase leading to a 3-5% decrease in cigarettes smoked. Studies show that price increases reduce smoking, with a 10% price increase leading to a 3-5% decrease in cigarettes smoked. The response varies with age, income, gender, and ethnicity, with older adults showing a mix of participation and quantity responses. Recent studies suggest a decline in the response to price signals, potentially overstated elasticities in state comparisons, and diminishing benefits of reducing smoking. Recent studies have shown that smokers may respond to price increases by intensifying their smoking habits, which could be more harmful. Increased taxes on adults are argued to be necessary to discourage teenage smoking, as evidence suggests that teenagers are more responsive to price changes. Elasticities for teenage smoking have been estimated around 0.7, with some studies showing smaller responses in younger teenagers. Recent studies question the effectiveness of tax increases on teenage smoking, as some research found no response to price changes. While higher prices may decrease smoking, other interventions like stricter regulations and education could be more effective. Cigarette taxes are regressive, impacting lower-income individuals more. Cigarette taxes are regressive, impacting lower-income individuals more. A tax increase on cigarettes would disproportionately burden those with lower incomes, as they tend to smoke more and pay a fixed amount of tax regardless of income level. A tax increase on cigarettes would disproportionately burden lower-income families, with one smoker paying an additional $417 in taxes. Some argue for higher taxes on smokers due to the costs they impose on society, but economists question this argument citing reduced costs in government programs from smokers' premature deaths. Government programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are not factored into calculations regarding the costs of smoking. Disputes exist about the impact of environmental tobacco smoke. Additional taxes on smokers may not increase economic efficiency if they are not imposing significant costs on others. Young smokers may not fully understand the costs of smoking. Taxes on tobacco products, including cigars, have sparked controversy in Congress. Controversy surrounds proposed tax increases for cigars in the 110th Congress, with small cigar taxes potentially increasing by a factor of 27. Large cigar taxes could rise to $10 in the original Senate Finance Committee proposal, but were lowered to $3 in 2007 legislation. H.R. 2 proposes a ceiling of $0.40, eight times the previous maximum. Premium cigars above the current 5 cents cap account for about half of total sales. The average manufacturer's price for premium cigars is $1.90, with an average tax of almost a dollar in the original Senate proposal. State cigar taxes are estimated at about 30% of the value. Prices of large cigars would increase by 20.8% under the cap and 33% over the cap. Retail prices being twice the manufacturer's price would result in a modest effect with a ceiling of $0.4026. The tax on cigars should be based on a per unit rather than a price-based tax to account for health costs. Cigars may be less harmful due to occasional usage and may be less concentrated among lower incomes. There may be a larger price response due to lack of addictiveness, but usage by higher income consumers may result in a smaller response."
