    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering tax reform and deficit reduction options due to historically high deficits. A balanced approach involves changes to federal spending and revenues. The report discusses revenue options from bipartisan proposals by the President's Fiscal Commission and the Debt Reduction Task Force. Fundamental tax reform is also being considered to complement deficit reduction goals. The report reviews the current fiscal situation, highlighting historically low revenues and high spending leading to budget deficits. The budget deficit in FY2011 is projected to be nearly $1.5 trillion, or 9.8% of GDP. Mandatory spending has increased, making fiscal sustainability challenging. The analysis focuses on federal revenues raised through individual income tax and payroll taxes, suggesting reforms for additional revenues. The United States could generate additional revenue by reforming taxes, such as corporate income tax and consumption taxes. Various deficit reduction proposals have been suggested, including those from the President's Fiscal Commission and the Debt Reduction Task Force. Other notable plans have been released by congressional leadership and the Administration, such as The Path to Prosperity by Representative Paul Ryan. The Path to Prosperity budget proposal aims to reduce deficits and stabilize national debt through spending cuts, entitlement reforms, and tax reforms. Both the Administration and Chairman Ryan support eliminating tax expenditures to achieve deficit reduction or lower rates, but specific details on which tax provisions would be eliminated are not provided. The Budget Control Act of 2011 increases the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion through multiple phases, coupled with reduced spending to decrease federal deficits. Specifics on eliminating tax expenditure provisions and potential Social Security reforms were not provided. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aims to reduce federal deficits by increasing the debt ceiling and implementing spending cuts. President Obama's proposal, along with discretionary spending caps, could result in nearly $4.9 trillion in deficit reduction by 2021. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction is tasked with finding an additional $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, with the possibility of considering revenue options. The current fiscal situation involves historically large budget deficits, leading to a growing national debt. The U.S. federal budget deficit has increased significantly, with projections showing deficits exceeding 9% of GDP. If not addressed, there may be macroeconomic consequences. The federal budget deficit has increased significantly, with projections showing deficits exceeding 9% of GDP. Federal spending consists of mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and net interest payments. Mandatory spending includes spending on entitlement programs, while discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations legislation. Net interest includes the government's interest payments on debt held by the public. In FY2010, mandatory spending was 55% of total outlays, amounting to $1,913 billion, while discretionary spending was 39% of total outlays, totaling $1,347 billion. Non-defense discretionary spending in FY2010 was $658 billion, representing 49% of discretionary spending and 19% of total federal outlays. To eliminate the FY2010 budget deficit through cuts in discretionary spending alone would have required eliminating all discretionary spending, including defense-related discretionary spending. The FY2010 budget deficit was influenced by fiscal stimulus and recession-related policies, leading to a deficit of 9-10% of GDP. Projections show deficits decreasing to 3.0-3.2% of GDP by 2015, but persisting through FY2020. National debt was $9 trillion in 2010 and is projected to reach $15 trillion by 2016. Between 1970 and 2016, the national debt as a percentage of GDP fluctuated, reaching a peak of 76% in 2016. Interest payments on the debt also varied, doubling from 1970 to the mid-1980s, then decreasing to 1.3% of GDP by 2009 before predicted to rise to nearly 3% by 2015. Rising debt can lead to increased interest payments, influenced by interest rates. Net interest payments have remained low in recent years despite rising debt levels, thanks to low interest rates. However, if interest rates rise in the future, interest payments relative to GDP are projected to increase. The current fiscal situation is deemed unsustainable, with deficits causing the national debt to grow faster than GDP. The national debt is considered unsustainable when deficits cause it to grow faster than GDP over time. This leads to a higher share of income being used for debt servicing, which can erode investor confidence. The government may then choose to default on its debt or monetize it through money creation, leading to inflation. The Treasury's ability to issue debt at low interest rates indicates investors' confidence in the U.S. fiscal situation. Increased deficits in 2009 and 2010 were due to the recession and policy responses like fiscal stimulus and TARP. If deficits persist after the economy recovers, it could hinder economic growth. In FY2010, federal revenues totaled $2.2 trillion, with 41.5% coming from various sources. In FY2010, federal revenues totaled $2.2 trillion. Nearly 41.5% came from individual income taxes, 40.0% from social insurance and retirement taxes, 8.9% from corporate taxes, and 3.1% from excise taxes. Estate and gift taxes contributed 0.8%, with the remaining 5.6% from other sources. Both individual and corporate tax receipts hit a 40-year low in 2009 due to the recession. The decrease in individual and corporate income tax collections can be attributed to the recession and increased availability of tax credits, exemptions, and deductions. Social insurance tax collections were slightly above historical averages. Closing the budget deficit through tax increases alone would require a significant percentage increase in revenues, as projected by CBO and OMB for FY2011 and FY2015. The budget deficit is projected to remain around $1.5 trillion in FY2011. Closing this deficit through increased income tax revenue would require a significant percentage increase in receipts, with projections ranging from 141% to 145%. Balancing the budget through tax increases in FY2015 would require less in terms of increased revenues, as both CBO and OMB project rising tax revenues and falling deficits over time due to economic recovery. The CBO's baseline projects that increasing income tax revenues by 30% or 37% would achieve a balanced budget in FY2015. If all taxes were increased, including corporate taxes, estate and gift taxes, and excise taxes, revenues would have to increase by 15% or 17% to achieve a balanced budget. Tax policies aim to balance economic efficiency and equity, creating winners and losers with tax reforms. Eliminating targeted tax incentives may increase tax liability for some, while broadening the tax base raises equity concerns. Policymakers face challenges in achieving a balanced budget through tax code changes. Tax preferences designed to address market failures can enhance tax-code equity but may reduce economic efficiency. Education tax benefits primarily benefit higher-income households. Eliminating these incentives could improve tax code equity but may hinder economic efficiency. Taxes can lead to inefficiencies by changing behavior, such as reducing work effort in response to higher income taxes. Market outcomes are believed to maximize economic efficiency in the absence of market failures. Taxes can lead to inefficiencies by changing behavior, such as reducing work effort in response to higher income taxes. Taxes on goods with negative externalities, like the federal excise tax on gasoline, can enhance economic efficiency by reducing overconsumption. Market inefficiencies are greater when participants are highly responsive to tax-induced price changes. Changes in price can lead to changes in behavior among market participants, driving economic activity away from the optimal level. Taxing goods with low demand elasticities is more efficient, but may raise equity concerns. Necessities have low demand elasticities, while luxury goods have more elastic demand. A tax system designed to minimize economic inefficiencies should consider these factors. A tax system aimed at minimizing economic distortions should tax necessities, despite their higher share in low-income households. Higher tax rates on necessities compared to luxury goods may raise equity concerns. Economic theory suggests that the inefficiency of a tax increases disproportionately with higher tax rates. To reduce distortions and inefficiencies, taxes should be levied at low rates by broadening the tax base. This approach can generate the same revenue with fewer inefficiencies and was a key policy objective. Broadening the tax base for reduced rates was a major policy objective in the 1986 U.S. tax code overhaul. Equity in the tax system is evaluated through horizontal and vertical equity. Vertical equity suggests that those with more resources should pay more taxes, leading to progressive tax structures. Horizontal equity calls for similar treatment of similar individuals. The principle of horizontal equity in the tax system calls for similar treatment of individuals who are alike. Tax preferences that favor certain behaviors, such as homeownership, can lead to different tax liabilities for similar individuals. Various tax reform options are discussed, categorized by federal revenue sources, to address issues of equity in the tax system. The overview discusses options for increasing tax revenues through the individual income tax, including raising tax rates and eliminating exemptions, deductions, and credits to broaden the tax base. This could lead to reduced tax rates, increased revenues, and improved economic efficiency and equity within the tax code. Eliminating or scaling back existing tax expenditure provisions could enhance equity within the tax code. The largest individual income tax expenditures account for $651 billion in foregone revenue annually, approximately 70% of total individual tax expenditures. This could be part of any deficit reduction proposal, highlighting various types of tax expenditure provisions and possible equity issues associated with using tax expenditures for federal assistance. Excluding healthcare, retirement contributions, and Medicare benefits from taxable income reduces costs and encourages employers to provide these benefits. However, delivering benefits through the tax code may raise equity concerns, as higher income taxpayers receive greater benefits. Upside-down subsidies, like the mortgage interest deduction and reduced rates for dividends and capital gains, also raise equity issues. Eliminating these deductions could enhance equity within the tax code. The mortgage interest deduction benefits higher-income households disproportionately, with a reduction in after-tax income of 1.7% for those in the 90th to 95th income percentile. The reduced rates for dividends and long-term capital gains also favor higher-income households. Double taxation of corporate income may justify these reduced rates. Capital gains tax increases have limited revenue potential due to behavioral responses. Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit provide alternative benefits. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit benefit lower-income taxpayers by being partially refundable. Eliminating these tax benefits would raise revenue but reduce progressivity in the tax system. The complexity of reducing tax expenditures as a source of revenue highlights the need for analysis on the impact of such actions on targeted behavior, economic efficiency, and equity in the tax code. Mandatory spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid has increased significantly over the years, accounting for a large portion of federal spending. With the aging population and rising healthcare costs, these programs face long-term financial challenges. Social Security and Medicare recipients are expected to grow with the aging baby boom generation, adding to the fiscal pressures on these programs. The Social Security and Medicare trust funds are facing long-term financial challenges due to increasing mandatory spending on entitlement programs. Revenues are collected through payroll taxes and deposited into these trust funds, but it is expected that the funds will be exhausted within the next 30 years. Restoring the trust funds involves choosing between reducing benefits or increasing taxes. One option to increase revenues is through tax rate increases, with the Social Security payroll tax currently at 12.4%. The Medicare payroll tax is generally 2.9%, with employers and employees each contributing 1.45%. An additional payroll tax of 0.9% on high-income taxpayers is scheduled to take effect in 2013. Increasing the cap on taxable earnings for Social Security payroll taxes is another option to boost trust fund revenues. Increasing the share of covered earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes to 90% or 92% could generate significant revenue, but it may not be enough to ensure long-term solvency. Congress is considering options for corporate tax reform, focusing on broadening the base by eliminating deductions and reducing rates. Deficit reduction may or may not be a goal of this reform. Corporate tax reform proposals may aim to reduce deficits and address U.S. taxation of income earned abroad. Moving towards a territorial tax system could enhance economic efficiency but may lead to federal revenue losses. Reform could be structured to be revenue neutral or raise additional revenues. Corporate tax expenditures for 2010 are listed in Table 3. The largest corporate tax expenditure in 2010 was accelerated depreciation, which allows firms to recover capital costs quickly through larger deductions. This policy subsidizes capital investment and has been enhanced in recent years to stimulate investment. These expenditures resulted in $96.6 billion in revenue losses, accounting for 80% of total tax expenditure dollars directed to corporations. Scaling back these expenditures is one option for generating additional revenues through the corporate tax system. The Relief, Unemployment Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 expanded temporary bonus depreciation provisions, costing $55 billion in 2011. The second-largest corporate tax expenditure in 2010 was due to a provision under the Recovery Act, allowing deferral of taxable cancellations of indebtedness income. The third-largest corporate tax expenditure relates to the U.S. treatment of income earned abroad. The U.S. treatment of income earned abroad allows deferral of active income by U.S. subsidiaries operating abroad, incentivizing investment in low-tax foreign countries. Tax-exempt bonds are a significant corporate tax expenditure, reducing federal income tax liability for bondholders and allowing issuers to borrow at reduced costs. Tax-exempt bonds provide a subsidy to high-income holders and have been criticized for inequity. Tax-credit bonds offer a more equitable benefit as their value is not tied to a taxpayer's marginal tax rate. The use of tax-subsidized debt for public goods and addressing market failures is a key concern. Inventory sales tax rules interact with foreign tax credit provisions, potentially exempting a portion of export income from U.S. taxation. Last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory accounting methods create a tax subsidy during rising prices by reducing taxable income. President Obama's FY2012 budget proposes to eliminate the LIFO inventory accounting method for fossil fuels, aiming to raise $18.7 billion over the 2012-2021 budget window. The production activity deduction, designed to support domestic manufacturers, is the sixth-largest corporate tax expenditure. Other corporate tax expenditures aim to encourage low-income housing investments and research and development spending. The tax code contains provisions to reduce costs for research and development, including tax credits and expensing certain capital expenditures. These subsidies aim to correct market failures by encouraging investment in low-income housing and research. Switching to a territorial tax system could simplify the corporate tax code, potentially allowing a dividend exemption for repatriated dividends. The tax code includes provisions to reduce costs for research and development, such as tax credits and expensing capital expenditures. Repatriated dividends could be permanently exempt from U.S. taxation, potentially generating additional revenues. Estate and gift taxes historically contributed a small share of federal revenues, with taxable estates in 2009 taxed at a maximum rate of 45% with a $3.5 million exemption. The estate tax was phased out in 2010 under the EGTRAA and set at a maximum rate of 35% with a $5 million exemption in 2011 under the Tax Relief Act. The estate tax in 2011 was set at 35% with a $5 million exemption, allowing a spouse to inherit any unused exemption. Compared to other revenue options, the estate tax has limited revenue potential due to its small base. In the United States, consumption taxes make up 4.7% of GDP, while other OECD countries rely more on consumption taxes, averaging 10.9% of GDP. Consumption taxes, such as value-added tax (VAT) or national sales tax, contribute a smaller percentage of tax revenues in the United States compared to other industrialized countries. While 7.8% of tax revenues in the US come from consumption taxes, the OECD average is 18.9%. Different forms of consumption taxes could be implemented at the federal level, including a consumed-income tax based on individual consumption. This tax option could potentially create a more progressive tax system. The potential revenue from a consumption tax depends on the taxable base, estimated at $8.8 trillion with exemptions. Market-based mechanisms like pricing carbon for reducing emissions could also be a federal revenue source. A carbon tax proposal was considered but not recommended by the Debt Reduction Task Force. The proposal suggested a tax of $23 per ton of CO2 emissions starting in 2018, increasing annually, with potential revenues of $1.1 trillion by 2025. The tax could enhance economic efficiency and promote clean energy investment but may also raise energy prices and be regressive. The current federal excise tax on motor fuel is $0.184 per gallon. The United States collects a $0.184 per-gallon federal excise tax on motor fuel for the Highway Trust Fund. The tax rate has not changed since the mid-1990s, resulting in eroded real value over time. In FY2009, the tax generated $25 billion in revenue. Funds have been transferred from the general fund to the HTF due to spending exceeding revenues. Increasing the tax by $0.01 could generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually. The fuel excise tax could generate $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion annually. Economists suggest an optimal gas tax of $1 per gallon to address negative externalities. Increasing the gas tax to $1 per gallon could raise $1 trillion over 10 years. President Obama created the Fiscal Commission to improve fiscal sustainability. Various groups have proposed alternative plans for deficit reduction. Several groups have proposed alternative plans for deficit reduction and fiscal sustainability. A comparison of tax policies is not within the scope of this report. The Fiscal Commission's tax proposals are compared to those of The Debt Reduction Task Force, co-chaired by Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin. The Task Force's plan included specifics that could be compared to the Fiscal Commission's proposals. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center provides distributional analysis of tax proposals from the Fiscal Commission and the Debt Reduction Task Force. Both plans aim to broaden the tax base by eliminating exemptions, deductions, and credits for lower tax rates. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established a Joint Select Committee for Deficit Reduction, where the findings of these proposals may be considered. The Fiscal Commission's proposal aims to reduce the deficit through comprehensive tax reform, including broadening the tax base, lowering tax rates, and maintaining progressivity. The plan targets a $3.9 trillion deficit reduction by 2020, with 27% coming from additional revenues and the rest from spending cuts. Table 5 outlines the details of the proposed \"Illustrative Plan\" focusing on income tax changes. The Fiscal Commission's income tax proposal aims to eliminate tax expenditures, reduce income tax brackets, and retain key provisions like the EITC and child tax credit. Additional revenues would be generated through payroll tax, corporate tax, and excise taxes. The Fiscal Commission's proposal includes increasing the taxable base for payroll tax and raising the motor fuel excise tax by $0.15 to generate additional revenues for the Highway Trust Fund. Corporate tax reforms involve eliminating tax expenditures and reducing rates to 28%, with a shift to taxing foreign-source income under a territorial system. The Fiscal Commission's proposal aims to increase revenues by applying a chained-CPI to adjust portions of the tax code for inflation. This would slow the increase in bracket thresholds and overall tax liability. The proposal does not change the tax treatment of passive foreign-source income. The Fiscal Commission's proposal includes applying a chained-CPI to the tax code to slow bracket threshold increases and increase federal revenues. It also limits tax revenues to 21% of GDP and includes a \"failsafe\" for automatic reductions in tax expenditures if comprehensive tax reform is not enacted. Table 6 provides estimated revenues under the proposal. The Fiscal Commission's Illustrative Plan, adopted in the 2012-2020 budget window, would generate over $1.1 trillion in additional revenues. $785 billion would come from comprehensive tax reform, and $96 billion from applying chained-CPI to the tax code. The proposal would reduce budget deficits by an estimated $4.1 trillion, with 27% of the deficit reduction attributed to tax provisions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction may consider both spending and revenue options. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with finding $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, may use a ratio of spending cuts to revenues similar to that of the Fiscal Commission. This could result in roughly $550 billion to $650 billion in deficit reduction from additional revenues. The President's deficit reduction proposal would generate $1.3 trillion in additional revenues. The Debt Reduction Task Force's proposal, similar to the Fiscal Commission's, aims to generate $1.3 trillion in additional revenues over a 10-year period through comprehensive tax reform. The proposal seeks to broaden the tax base, reduce tax rates, enhance progressivity, and stabilize the federal debt below 60% of GDP. Approximately 39% of the $5.9 trillion total debt reduction would come from tax reforms. Key provisions of the proposed tax reform are summarized in Table 5. The Debt Reduction Task Force's plan for tax reform includes eliminating most tax expenditures, standard deduction, personal exemption, AMT, and moving to two tax brackets. Limited tax benefits for children, mortgage interest, charitable giving, and retirement would be retained. The plan would also eliminate the exclusion for employer-provided health insurance and increase revenues through payroll tax, corporate tax, and excise taxes. Additionally, the estate tax proposal would generate more revenue compared to current law. Both the Fiscal Commission and Debt Reduction Task Force proposals would raise the payroll tax cap to cover 90% of wages. The Debt Reduction Task Force proposed a payroll tax holiday as an economic stimulus measure, resulting in $641 billion in federal revenue losses. The plan also included a one-year 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax rate paid by individuals. Additionally, the plan proposed corporate tax reform to reduce rates and eliminate most corporate tax expenditures, but did not move towards a territorial tax system. The Debt Reduction Task Force's plan includes increasing excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and imposing a new tax on sweetened beverages. They also propose a national sales tax at 6.5%, which would generate the majority of new revenues. Proposed reforms to income taxes would result in estimated revenue losses of $415 billion, but eliminating tax expenditures would bring in $3.5 trillion in added revenues. The Debt Reduction Task Force's proposal includes a 6.5% national sales tax to raise $3 trillion over 2012-2020. This tax is seen as attractive for not taxing savings and investment, potentially promoting economic growth. However, sales taxes are regressive, and changes to the income tax system aim to address this issue. There may also be concerns about how a national sales tax would interact with existing state-level sales taxes. The Debt Reduction Task Force's proposal includes a 6.5% national sales tax to raise $3 trillion over 2012-2020, generating more tax revenue than the Fiscal Commission's proposal. The Task Force's reforms would result in $2.3 trillion in additional revenues over the same period, including the payroll tax holiday option. President Obama submitted this proposal to Congress on September 19, 2011. President Obama submitted a deficit reduction plan to Congress on September 19, 2011, alongside the American Jobs Act of 2011. The plan includes various tax provisions that would raise $1.3 trillion over the 2012-2021 budget window. The majority of the additional revenues would come from allowing the expiration of tax cuts for high-income earners and limiting the value of itemized deductions to 28%. President Obama's deficit reduction plan includes tax incentives to promote fossil fuels, taxing carried interests as ordinary income, modifying inventory accounting rules, changing tax treatment for insurance companies, and adjusting provisions for the U.S. international tax system. The plan also proposes changes to depreciation rules for corporate jets and reinstating Superfund taxes. Additionally, the plan aims to raise revenues by making the 0.2% unemployment insurance surtax permanent and modifying worker classification treatment. The plan would result in $1.3 trillion in new revenues over the 2012-2021 budget window. The proposal includes tax relief measures such as reducing employer and employee payroll taxes in 2012, extending bonus depreciation allowance, and providing tax credits for hiring veterans and the long-term unemployed. The Fiscal Commission's proposal aims to maintain progressivity in the tax code, with moderate changes to the distribution of the federal tax burden. The highest income quintile would see a slight increase in their share of the federal tax burden. The Debt Reduction Task Force's plan aims to increase progressivity in the tax code by shifting more of the federal tax burden to higher income groups. This would result in a slight increase in average federal tax rates for all income quintiles except the lowest, with the highest income group responsible for a larger share of federal taxes. The plan is in line with principles of vertical equity, with lower-income groups seeing a decrease or no change in their share of the tax burden. The Tax Policy Center's analysis of the Debt Reduction Task Force's plan may underestimate its regressivity. Different methods for allocating the burden of a consumption tax include the \"income sources\" method and the \"consumption ratio\" method, with the latter leading to a more regressive distribution. Economists disagree on which method best represents the impact of uniform consumption taxes. Persistent budget deficits and increasing national debt are key issues in congressional debates. Achieving fiscal sustainability will require a combination of spending and revenue measures. This report outlines potential revenue options for Congress, including enhancing revenues through the individual income tax system and payroll taxes. Broadening the tax base by eliminating deductions and credits could lead to lower tax rates and improve economic efficiency. Tax reform is a key component in achieving fiscal sustainability, with proposals to modify individual and corporate tax systems by eliminating tax expenditures for lower tax rates. The President's Fiscal Commission and Debt Reduction Task Force outlined plans for comprehensive tax reform, including increasing the payroll tax base. The Fiscal Commission's proposal would generate the majority of revenues through tax reforms and an additional excise tax on motor fuels, while the Debt Reduction Task Force's plan would not generate added revenues through 2020. The Debt Reduction Task Force proposed raising revenues through a consumption tax, specifically a national sales tax. The President's deficit reduction proposal includes raising revenues by allowing tax rates on high-income taxpayers to expire and limiting deductions, all aimed at broadening the tax base. Tax reform is a crucial component in achieving fiscal sustainability, as outlined by the Fiscal Commission, Debt Reduction Task Force, and the President's proposal. Tax policies play a crucial role in deficit reduction and debt control. Congress should consider efficient and equitable tax policies for future economic growth. However, improving equity and efficiency in the tax code may not directly lead to deficit reduction."
