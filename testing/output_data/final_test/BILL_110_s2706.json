    "content": "The \"Health Insurance Coverage Protection Act\" is cited as the short title. It includes amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, specifically adding a limitation on lifetime aggregate limits. The \"Health Insurance Coverage Protection Act\" prohibits group health plans and health insurance issuers from imposing lifetime dollar limits below specified amounts, with adjustments for inflation. Small employers are exempt from this requirement. The \"Health Insurance Coverage Protection Act\" exempts small employers from the requirement to provide group health plans with lifetime dollar limits, as long as the plan applies an aggregate limit consistent with regulations. A small employer is defined as one with fewer than 20 employees on a typical business day in the previous year and at the start of the plan year. Rules similar to those in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 apply for determining if employers are considered a single employer. For new employers, the number of expected employees in the current year is used to determine small employer status. Any reference to an employer includes their predecessors. The term 'aggregate dollar lifetime limit' is defined as a dollar limitation on total benefits under a group health plan or insurance coverage. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Act. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a limitation on lifetime aggregate limits in the group market, effective one year after the enactment of the Act. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a limitation on lifetime aggregate limits in the group market. Group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot impose a lifetime limit of less than $5,000,000 for the first 2 years, $10,000,000 for the third and fourth years, and adjusted amounts for subsequent years based on the consumer price index. This does not apply to group health plans offered to small employers. The term 'small employer' refers to an employer with fewer than 20 employees, both on a typical business day in the previous year and on the first day of the plan year. Rules similar to aggregation rules for employers apply in determining employer size for the purpose of this subsection. Employers must adhere to rules similar to those in the Internal Revenue Code to determine if they are considered a single employer.

Any reference to an employer includes its predecessors. The term 'aggregate dollar lifetime limit' is defined as a dollar limitation on total benefits under a group health plan or insurance coverage. The amendment will apply to plan years starting 1 year after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will contract the Institute of Medicine to study the number of individuals reaching lifetime limitations set by the Act. The Institute of Medicine must submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within 1 year of conducting the study."
