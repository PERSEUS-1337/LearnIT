Congress finds that in recent Presidential elections, many States have awarded their electoral votes to candidates who earned less than half the popular vote. This has led to situations where a candidate supported by only a minority of the electorate wins the election, violating the principle of majority rule. To address this issue, a simple solution is to require the winner of an election to earn a majority of votes, as seen in instant runoff voting systems used in other countries like Ireland, Australia, and London. There is a growing interest in instant runoff voting, where voters rank candidates and their votes transfer to their second choice in a runoff round until one candidate earns a majority of votes. States like Alaska, New Mexico, and Vermont are considering implementing instant runoff voting for Presidential elections. Maine has also shown interest in enacting this voting system. Several states, including Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington, debated legislation in 2001 to implement instant runoff voting for Presidential elections. The Speaker of the California Assembly introduced a bill for instant runoff voting in elections to fill vacancies in Congress. However, much of the Nation's voting equipment is not compatible with ranked ballots due to underinvestment, as there are no Federal mandatory minimum standards for voting equipment. Funding for states implementing instant runoff voting for presidential elections. The Federal Election Commission will provide grants to states that have adopted an instant runoff voting system for presidential elections to cover administration costs, including purchasing necessary technology. The Commission will develop a plan for the program within 60 days of the Act's enactment, outlining criteria for grant applications and fund oversight. States are eligible for grants without being required to match funds awarded. States are eligible for grants under the program if they submit an application containing required information and assurances to the Commission. The Commission must approve or reject applications within 120 days of receiving them, and may not consider applications submitted after the 60-day deadline from the plan's public release. The Commission may reject an application if the state's election technology is not compatible with instant runoff voting or if there is inadequate education for voters and officials. Grants awarded to states cannot exceed the product of the state's population and $12. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program. Authorization of Appropriations: $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and additional funds for subsequent years. States must use voting equipment compatible with instant runoff voting for federal elections starting in 2004. In this Act, the term \"instant runoff voting system\" refers to a voting system where voters rank candidates in order of preference, runoff counts are conducted in rounds, candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated in each round, voters cast one vote for their highest-ranked candidate in each round, and the counts are automatically tabulated. The term \"State\" includes the District. In this Act, the term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS: This Act does not override or conflict with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 or the National Voter Registration Act of 1993."
