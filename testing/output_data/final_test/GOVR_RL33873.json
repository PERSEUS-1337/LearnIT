The Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities recommended tearing down these walls to improve information exchange. The Intelligence Community before and after the 9/11 attacks failed to fully appreciate and share crucial information that could have prevented the terrorist plot. Communication breakdowns within and between agencies were due to differences in missions, legal authorities, and cultures, hindering counterterrorism efforts. The 9/11 Commission highlighted failures in information sharing among agencies and within the Justice Department, leading to a lack of unity in sharing intelligence. This lack of information sharing was not accidental, as longstanding divisions and regulations hindered communication between law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was enacted in 1978 in response to domestic intelligence gathering activities during the Vietnam War era. FISA provides a framework for electronic surveillance in foreign intelligence investigations, while Title III governs electronic surveillance in criminal investigations. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 influenced the relationship between law enforcement and intelligence by requiring the primary purpose of domestic surveillance to be gathering foreign intelligence information. FISA allowed dissemination of criminal activity information incidentally acquired during surveillance, upheld by federal courts as consistent with Fourth Amendment requirements. Before 9/11, government practice and Justice Department policy aimed to prevent aggressive criminal investigators from obtaining FISA court orders for gathering evidence of criminal activities. There was a concern that using FISA for this purpose could lead to suppression of evidence in criminal trials or even overturning of FISA itself. Intelligence agencies, including parts of the FBI focused on counterterrorism and counterintelligence, kept information separate. The FBI, focused on counterterrorism and counterintelligence, kept information separate from prosecutors. Concerns arose in the mid-1990s about barriers between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, following controversies involving illegal activities of foreign banks. The Senate Intelligence Committee found that communication gaps between intelligence and law enforcement agencies hindered the sharing of information on suspicious activities by banks. They recommended addressing the relationship between the two agencies to improve cooperation. Congressional concerns led to a shift towards closer collaboration between law enforcement and intelligence efforts. The Joint Task Force on Intelligence and Law Enforcement, in response to congressional concerns, conducted a review in August 1994. They highlighted the failure of intelligence and law enforcement agencies to utilize available information on foreign banks' activities. The Task Force recommended bureaucratic mechanisms for better information exchange without the need for statutory changes. They emphasized the importance of a more interactive approach while maintaining distinctions between the two communities. The Joint Task Force Report established interagency coordinative mechanisms to improve information exchanges and resolve difficulties between intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Despite efforts to overcome obstacles, progress was limited. By the 1990s, the threat of international terrorism was increasing, with Middle Eastern terrorists targeting U.S. forces overseas and occasionally within the U.S. Observers believed that both intelligence and law enforcement agencies were collecting relevant information on terrorism. Members of Congress sought changes to facilitate information sharing on international terrorism following the establishment of the National Commission on Terrorism in 1998. The Bremer Commission's report in June 2000 highlighted concerns about inadequate sharing of terrorism-related information and recommended removing barriers to collecting information on terrorists. It also identified bureaucratic and cultural obstacles within the FBI hindering terrorism information gathering. The Bremer Commission recommended streamlining the FISA application process for electronic surveillance of international terrorists. It also suggested expanding the Office of Intelligence Policy Review and promoting cooperation between OIPR and the FBI to improve information sharing on terrorist threats. The Bremer Commission recommended streamlining the FISA application process for electronic surveillance of international terrorists and promoting cooperation between OIPR and the FBI to improve information sharing on terrorist threats. The Commission also highlighted the limitations in sharing law enforcement information with the intelligence community and suggested clarifying what information can be shared to enhance dissemination of terrorist-related information. The bill proposed regulations for disclosing information acquired under FISA for law enforcement purposes. It also required reports on establishing an intelligence reporting function within the FBI and improving the sharing of criminal wiretap information with intelligence agencies. The Senate Intelligence Committee emphasized the importance of cooperation among intelligence agencies for successful intelligence missions. They praised efforts by the FBI and CIA to enhance information sharing under FISA orders and expect these efforts to continue and expand. The Senate Intelligence Committee highlighted the need for cooperation among intelligence agencies for successful missions. S. 2089 requested reports on disclosure of FISA-derived information for law enforcement purposes. S. 3205, the Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000, aimed to combat terrorism and improve information sharing within the Department of Justice. The FBI's potential role in disseminating information on international terrorism and national security matters was discussed in a report. Legislation aimed to improve information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies, with concerns raised about privacy and civil liberties. Some civil libertarians expressed concerns about legislation allowing sharing of electronic surveillance information with intelligence agencies, citing potential breaches of constitutional boundaries and misuse by CIA. They also raised worries about using such data in criminal proceedings and emphasized the need for oversight. Since the Church committee, it has been recognized that conducting international terrorism and national security investigations as criminal proceedings better protect Americans' rights and may enhance FBI effectiveness. Senator Leahy raised concerns about constitutional issues in initial drafts of S. 3205, but modifications addressed these worries. The Clinton Administration Justice Department argued that existing laws allowed sharing of information obtained in wiretaps with law enforcement agencies. The Justice Department opposed a provision in the bill that would allow sharing of foreign intelligence information collected under Title III with intelligence agencies, citing legal constraints and the need to protect ongoing criminal investigations. The Kyl-Feinstein bill only requested reports on the issue, but faced controversy from civil liberties groups and the Department of Justice. The Senate passed legislation in 2000 addressing concerns about information sharing and civil liberties, but it was not sent to the House before the Congress adjourned. The FY2001 Intelligence Authorization Act included a requirement for a report on information disclosure procedures under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 formalized procedures for authorizing FISA surveillance, expanded grounds for probable cause, established new procedures for physical searches, and facilitated intelligence use in counterintelligence investigations. It also provided increased funding for OIPR and required a report on coordinating intelligence dissemination within the Justice Department. The existence of the \"wall\" between law enforcement and the Intelligence Community was recognized before 9/11. The Justice Department opposed removing barriers in 2000. Some believed Congress would not allow broader surveillance powers for the Intelligence Community. Former Attorney General William Barr testified to Congress about curtailment of domestic intelligence activities leading up to 9/11. The concerns about curtailing the Bureau's domestic intelligence activities and imposing criminal justice standards hindered the pursuit of domestic security matters. Prohibitions on sharing information created a 'wall of separation' between intelligence and law enforcement. There were tentative steps towards greater information sharing, but opposition stemmed from past domestic surveillance history and distrust of intelligence organizations. The FY2001 Intelligence Authorization Act included minimalist provisions but the wall between intelligence and law enforcement remained. The attacks of September 11, 2001, led to the recognition that counterterrorism efforts must involve all parts of the U.S. Government and be based on sharing information from all sources. The counterterrorism effort post-9/11 required sharing information from all sources. Congress and the executive branch worked to establish mechanisms for information sharing with safeguards for future trials. The USA PATRIOT Act was quickly enacted, incorporating various proposals and recommendations to combat international terrorism. The USA PATRIOT Act (P.L. 107-56) was a result of various proposals to combat international terrorism post-9/11. It changed FISA surveillance requirements to allow for a significant foreign intelligence purpose alongside criminal investigations. The Act also addressed concerns about sharing intelligence and law enforcement information. The USA PATRIOT Act allowed for the sharing of grand jury information related to foreign intelligence and counterintelligence with federal law enforcement and intelligence officials to assist in their duties. It also permitted the sharing of information acquired from wiretaps with other federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The USA PATRIOT Act allows for the sharing of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information obtained through federal criminal investigations with federal law enforcement, intelligence, immigration, national defense, or national security officials to assist in their official duties. The Attorney General has the authority to establish implementing procedures for this purpose. Section 504 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows federal officers under FISA to coordinate with law enforcement to combat foreign threats. Section 905 mandates the disclosure of foreign intelligence acquired during criminal investigations to the Director of National Intelligence, with exceptions for ongoing law enforcement operations. The USA PATRIOT Act's Section 905 required the Attorney General to develop procedures for notifying the Director of National Intelligence about criminal investigations involving foreign intelligence sources. The Act's provisions were extensive and not entirely welcomed by the FISA Court, as they blurred the line between intelligence gathering and law enforcement control. The FISA Court attempted to reinstate the bright line used in the 1995 procedures to moderate the broad acquisition, retention, and dissemination of FISA information in intelligence and criminal investigations. The Justice Department appealed the FISA Court's decision, leading to the Court of Review overruling the limitations imposed by the FISA Court and expressing concern about its role in prescribing internal procedures. The FISA Court was criticized by the Court of Review for overstepping its role in prescribing internal procedures for handling surveillances within the Justice Department. This led to the dismantling of the legal structure supporting the wall between law enforcement and intelligence information, allowing for the implementation of information-sharing provisions in legislation like the USA PATRIOT Act and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Security Act of 2002 and the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 mandated the establishment of procedures for sharing intelligence and law enforcement information about international terrorism. The Information Sharing Environment (ISE) was created to link information collections and users. An implementation plan for the ISE was released in 2006, outlining procedures for sharing information among federal, state, and local agencies while protecting privacy and civil liberties. Congress may review the ISE implementation in the future, with a focus on balancing advantages and concerns. The need to balance advantages of sharing information with concerns about undermining lawful activities complicates counterterrorism efforts. Public opinion shifted after 9/11, leading to the rapid passage of legislation like the USA PATRIOT Act. While there is now a consensus on the importance of information sharing, there are lingering concerns about potential risks to civil liberties. The importance of sharing intelligence and law enforcement information extends beyond international terrorism to include issues like banking fraud and narcotics smuggling. Combating terrorism requires more vigorous approaches compared to other crimes, but assembling a full range of information is beneficial in all cases. The political controversy surrounding NSA's electronic surveillance efforts and data mining programs may lead to restrictions on information sharing due to concerns about lawfully obtained information. There is also a possibility that surveillance-obtained information may not be admissible in court cases, raising Fourth Amendment bypass concerns. Despite the need for information sharing, fears of governmental abuses persist, making legislation difficult. Increased information sharing poses potential threats to civil liberties and intelligence sources. The compromise of valuable sources and methods is a major concern, as it can lead to a loss of confidence in U.S. intelligence agencies. Congress plays a crucial role in addressing these issues, balancing liberty and security concerns. Air Force General Michael V. Hayden, now CIA Director, emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between security and liberty. Congress's oversight can prevent past abuses and ensure an information sharing policy aligned with public opinion. However, gridlock in the government may hinder effective solutions for intelligence acquisition and analysis. Gridlock in the government might hinder effective intelligence acquisition and analysis for national security threats."
