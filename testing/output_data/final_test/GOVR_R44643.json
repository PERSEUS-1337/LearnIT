    "content": "The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 addresses medical innovation and healthcare costs by facilitating generic pharmaceutical marketing and providing incentives for brand-name firms to innovate. Congress has made modifications to the Act, but potential legislative issues remain for consideration. This report provides an overview of the Act, including the patent acquisition process and patent litigation in federal courts. The report discusses the relationship between pharmaceutical innovation, competition, and the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984. It highlights key features of the Act, such as expedited generic regulatory approval, patent term extension, and regulatory exclusivity for approved drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allows for expedited generic regulatory approval and patent term extension for approved drugs. Inventors can obtain patents for useful, novel, and nonobvious inventions by filing a patent application with the USPTO. To obtain a patent, inventors must file an application with the USPTO that includes a detailed description of the invention and distinct claims. Examiners at the USPTO review applications to ensure they meet patent law requirements. If approved, the patent is granted for a term of 20 years from the filing date. Patents grant the patentee exclusive rights for 20 years from the filing date. Infringement can lead to civil suits and monetary remedies. Patents can be assigned or licensed. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates the marketing of new drugs for safety and efficacy. The process of bringing a new drug to market involves conducting clinical investigations to ensure safety and efficacy. This includes preclinical evaluation, filing an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA, and carrying out clinical trials in three phases to gather evidence of the drug's effectiveness. The FDA evaluates a New Drug Application (NDA) to determine the safety, effectiveness, and benefits of a new drug. The NDA includes clinical trial results, manufacturing details, and quality controls. The agency reviews whether the drug is safe and effective, if the labeling is appropriate, and if manufacturing processes maintain quality. The FDA evaluates a New Drug Application (NDA) to determine the safety, effectiveness, and benefits of a new drug, including clinical trial results, manufacturing details, and quality controls. FDA approval allows the drug to be marketed, while patent approval by the USPTO is a separate process. The relationship between marketing approval and patent protection has been a subject of policy debate. The 1984 judicial decision in Roche Products, Inc. v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. accelerated discussions in Congress regarding patent infringement defenses. One defense is the experimental use privilege, allowing experimentation with a patented article for philosophical or amusement purposes without infringing on the patentee's rights. However, this defense is rarely successful in practice. The experimental use defense raised the question of whether generic drug manufacturers conducting regulatory compliance activities during a patent term were infringing on the patent. The 1984 Roche v. Bolar case definitively ruled in favor of patent infringement, allowing the patent holder to prevent generic firms from marketing their drug before the patent expiration. During the Roche v. Bolar case, Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. used Roche's patented active ingredient to gather data for an FDA filing. The federal courts ruled in favor of Roche, stating that Bolar's use was for business purposes and infringed on Roche's patent rights. The ruling in Roche v. Bolar found that Bolar's use of Roche's patented active ingredient for FDA filing purposes infringed on Roche's patent rights, as it had definite commercial purposes. This decision was seen as potentially distorting the statutory patent term. The Roche v. Bolar decision led to the enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, providing patent term restoration and exclusivity for drug manufacturers. The Hatch-Waxman Act, enacted in 1984, allows generic drug manufacturers to obtain FDA approval using data from brand-name firms in exchange for regulatory exclusivity and patent term extension. Key provisions include a statutory exemption from patent infringement claims. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drug manufacturers to use data from brand-name firms for FDA approval, with a statutory exemption from patent infringement claims. This provision overturned the Roche v. Bolar decision, allowing generic manufacturers to work on a generic version of a drug during the patent's life for FDA compliance. Before this act, generic manufacturers had to file their own NDA to market their drug. Some generic manufacturers had to independently prove the safety and efficacy of their chemically identical drugs, despite the approval process being costly and time-consuming before the Hatch-Waxman Act. This hindered the introduction of generic equivalents, impacting consumer prices. The Hatch-Waxman Act introduced the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for generic drug approval, allowing manufacturers to rely on existing safety and efficacy data. It also established the Section 505(b)(2) application, which utilizes published literature for approval. Generic manufacturers can use ANDAs and Section 505(b)(2) applications to expedite marketing approval and avoid NDA costs. The FDA's Orange Book lists all approved drug products, with an \"A\" code indicating therapeutic equivalence. The book is now accessible online or through the \"Orange Book Express\" app. The Orange Book provides information on therapeutic equivalence of generic drugs and helps resolve patent disputes. Generic drug manufacturers must comply with Orange Book-listed patents when seeking approval through ANDAs. Generic drug manufacturers seeking approval through ANDAs must provide a Section VIII statement or one of four patent certifications: 1. brand-name firm has not filed any patent info, 2. patent has expired, 3. patent expiration date, or 4. patent is invalid/not infringed. Certifications are labeled as paragraph I, II, III, or IV. Approval for paragraphs I or II is immediate, while paragraph III requires waiting for approval. After meeting regulatory and scientific requirements, wait for approval until the drug's patent expires. A paragraph IV certification can lead to patent infringement litigation if successful, delaying the marketing of the generic equivalent. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides a significant benefit to patent owners by allowing them to suspend approval of a generic drug if a patent infringement charge is brought within 45 days. This suspension can last until the court decides on the patent's validity or infringement, or for a 30-month period to resolve the dispute before the generic product is introduced to the market. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for a 30-month stay to delay the introduction of generic drugs to the market, acting as a preliminary injunction. This stay is automatically awarded if the brand-name drug company follows the appropriate procedures. The Act also allows for the extension of patent terms for pharmaceutical patents, compensating for time lost during clinical testing. If a drug has multiple patents, the patent proprietor must choose one for term extension. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for patent term extension for pharmaceutical patents to compensate for time lost during clinical testing. If a drug has multiple patents, the patent holder must choose one for extension. The extension period is capped at five years, with a maximum total patent term of 14 years after FDA approval. Due diligence is required to seek patent term restoration from the USPTO. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for patent term extension for pharmaceutical patents to compensate for time lost during clinical testing. The extension period is capped at five years, with a maximum total patent term of 14 years after FDA approval. Regulatory exclusivity is granted by the FDA to protect approved drugs from competition, separate from patent protection. The Orphan Drug Act established a seven-year market exclusivity for drugs treating rare diseases. The Hatch-Waxman Act introduced a five-year exclusivity for new chemical entities not previously approved by the FDA. The Hatch-Waxman Act introduced a five-year exclusivity for new chemical entities (NCE) not previously approved by the FDA. This exclusivity period may be reduced to four years if a generic firm files a paragraph IV ANDA. Additionally, the Act provided for a three-year new clinical study exclusivity period for essential new clinical studies conducted by the sponsor. The Generic Animal Drug and Patent Term Restoration Act, effective from November 16, 1988, extended the term-restoration provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act to veterinary drugs and biological products, allowing patents claiming these products to receive term extension benefits. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 1997 introduced pediatric exclusivity to encourage research on drug effectiveness in children. This provision adds six months to the term of any existing patent or regulatory exclusivity for children's drug products with the same active moiety as previously approved drugs. The pediatric exclusivity provision adds six months to the term of an existing patent or regulatory exclusivity for children's drug products with the same active moiety. This extension is not granted if awarded less than nine months before the expiration of the intellectual property right. The provision was made permanent in 2012 with the FDA Safety and Innovation Act, incentivizing drug companies to conduct pediatric research. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) introduced changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act to expedite the availability of generic drugs in the market. It limits the 30-month stay on FDA approval for drugs with patents listed in the Orange Book. Additionally, it allows for a declaratory judgment if a patent holder does not file an infringement action within 45 days of notification of a paragraph IV ANDA. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) introduced changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act to expedite the availability of generic drugs in the market. It allows for a declaratory judgment if a patent holder does not file an infringement action within 45 days of notification of a paragraph IV ANDA. The MMA stipulates that no monetary damages are to be awarded in such suits, and the 180-day generic exclusivity commences with the first commercial marketing of the generic drug. This exclusivity can be forfeited under specified circumstances.

The MMA stipulates that no monetary damages are to be awarded in such suits, and the 180-day generic exclusivity commences with the first commercial marketing of the generic drug. This exclusivity can be forfeited under specified circumstances. The FDA can grant NCE exclusivity to enantiomers of previously approved drugs. The FDA can grant NCE exclusivity to enantiomers of previously approved racemates under the FDAAA, but only if the non-racemic drug is approved for a different use. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was approved by Congress to regulate biologics, which are important in U.S. healthcare. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was enacted to regulate biologics in U.S. healthcare. It created an expedited pathway for biosimilars and interchangeable biologics, established regulatory exclusivities for brand-name and follow-on firms, and outlined procedures for resolving patent disputes. The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, enacted as Title VIII of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act, allows the FDA to designate drugs as \"qualified infectious disease products\" (QIDPs) for serious infections. It adds five years to exclusivities for QIDPs to incentivize the development of innovative antibiotics. The GAIN Act allows the FDA to designate drugs as QIDPs for serious infections, adding five years to exclusivities to incentivize antibiotic development. Congress has consistently considered the balance between intellectual property rights and promoting competition in pharmaceutical development. The 2016 announcement of a brand-name firm producing a generic EpiPen\u00ae auto-injector renewed interest in this issue. The production of a generic version of the EpiPen\u00ae auto-injector by a brand-name firm has sparked discussion on \"authorized generics.\" These are pharmaceuticals marketed by the brand-named company but sold under a generic name, typically at a lower price. Authorized generics can increase competition and lower prices in the short-term, but are controversial and often enter the market when the brand-name drug's patents are expiring. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires generic drug companies to prove bioequivalence to brand-name drugs, but some face challenges accessing samples for testing. The CREATES Act addresses this issue by ensuring access to reference product samples in limited distribution channels. The bill would allow generic or biosimilar firms to litigate in federal court to obtain samples of drugs subject to restricted distribution for FDA approval. Several bills in Congress aim to allow importation of lower-cost prescription drugs from foreign countries, with varying approved jurisdictions such as Canada, Australia, Israel, Japan, and New Zealand. The Safe and Affordable Prescription Drugs Act of 2015 would allow U.S.-approved drugs to be imported from approved pharmacies worldwide, expanding on previous bills that aimed to allow importation from specific countries. Congress is also considering extending regulatory exclusivities for certain drugs. The COMBAT Act proposes extending generic exclusivity by 60 days in certain cases, while the PRICED Act aims to reduce biologics exclusivity from 12 to 7 years. FDA regulatory exclusivities have been increasing in number and duration over the past 35 years, with Congress establishing 15 types since 1982. Encouraging innovation through regulatory exclusivities may have advantages over the patent system. The requirement of technological neutrality in patent rights may complicate patent reform, while fine-tuning drug regulation rules could be more feasible. Increasing reliance on regulatory exclusivities may require greater legislative oversight and have less regard for the public domain. Settlements between generic and brand-name drug companies under the Hatch-Waxman Act often involve agreements to delay generic versions in exchange for compensation. The Supreme Court's 2013 Actavis decision revolutionized antitrust review of reverse payment settlements between brand-name and generic drug companies under the Hatch-Waxman Act. It established that these settlements should be evaluated using the \"rule of reason\" approach, ending previous court distinctions on the issue. The Actavis decision in 2013 changed the antitrust review of reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent cases. It established the \"rule of reason\" approach for evaluating these settlements, resolving a circuit split. The lower courts now face the challenge of applying this approach to reverse payment settlements. In the 114th Congress, bills like the Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act aim to discourage such settlements by making changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act. The legislation aims to address patent infringement by brand companies and generic firms, requiring adherence to settlement agreements and timely enforcement of patents. Another bill, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, targets unfair competition in reverse payment settlements, presuming anticompetitive effects if an ANDA filer receives anything of value. The legislation aims to address patent infringement by brand companies and generic firms, requiring adherence to settlement agreements and timely enforcement of patents. S. 2019 and S. 2023 target unfair competition in reverse payment settlements, creating a presumption that such agreements violate antitrust laws, with exceptions for reasonable litigation expenses. The parties can overcome this presumption in S. 2019 by showing procompetitive benefits outweigh anticompetitive effects, while in S. 2023, they cannot."
