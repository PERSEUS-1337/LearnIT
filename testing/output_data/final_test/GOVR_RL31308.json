    "content": "President Bush submitted his budget proposal for FY2003, with a $56.1 billion budget for the Department of Transportation, a decrease of 6% from FY2002. This decrease was due to a decline in Highway Trust Fund revenues triggering a $4.4 billion reduction in highway spending. An emergency supplemental budget request of $27.1 billion was submitted, with $6.7 billion allocated to the DOT for various programs including TSA and rebuilding the Manhattan transit system. President Bush proposed a $56.1 billion budget for the Department of Transportation for FY2003, with reductions in highway spending due to declining revenues. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.7 billion for the DOT, including increases for various agencies like the Coast Guard and TSA. The proposal also included the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security, transferring agencies from the DOT. The FY2003 Department of Transportation budget included $8.6 billion more than the Administration request. This funding increase was allocated to various agencies such as FHWA, Amtrak, Transportation Security Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Coast Guard, and Amtrak. President Bush signed an emergency supplemental bill in August 2002, providing an additional $6.6 billion for the DOT for FY2002. The President decided not to request $5.1 billion in contingency emergency funding, reducing the supplemental funding to DOT. The emergency funding for the Department of Transportation was reduced by $1.1 billion, with major cuts to TSA, the Coast Guard, and FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $60.1 billion for the DOT, $4.0 billion more than the Administration request, with a significant increase in FHWA spending. Congress passed a Continuing Resolution to fund the DOT through January 11, 2003. The FY2003 DOT appropriations act, P.L. 107-294, provides funding at FY2002 levels through January 11, 2003. Legislation created the Department of Homeland Security, transferring Coast Guard and TSA. The omnibus FY2003 appropriations bill passed by the Senate includes $65.1 billion for DOT and related agencies, $9 billion more than the Administration request, with significant increases in highway and Amtrak funding. The Senate passed an omnibus appropriations bill for FY2003, including $65.1 billion for DOT and related agencies, with increases in highway and Amtrak funding. The bill also included a 2.852% across-the-board cut to align with the Administration's request. The House will now confer with the Senate to finalize the omnibus appropriations act. The FY2003 transportation appropriations were included in H.J.Res. 2, an omnibus appropriations bill for the 107th Congress. The Senate amended the bill to include non-defense agency appropriations for FY2003 and passed it on January 24, 2003. New appropriations legislation had to be provided as all pending legislation from the 107th Congress expired with the beginning of the 108th Congress in January 2003. The FY2003 transportation appropriations were included in H.J.Res. 2, an omnibus appropriations bill for the 107th Congress. The Committee on Conference issued their report on February 13, 2003, and the legislation was signed by President Bush on February 20, 2003. The FY2003 budget request proposed a Department of Transportation budget of roughly $56.1 billion, about 6% below FY2002's enacted level. The FY2003 DOT budget request aligned with TEA-21 and FAIR21, proposing increases for the Coast Guard and FTA, and decreases for FRA. The budget saw reductions in highway funding and the introduction of TSA due to the impact of the events of September 11, 2001. Additional funding was received through emergency supplemental bills. In FY2002, $7.3 billion in supplemental funding was provided through emergency bills. The TSA was created within the DOT for security concerns. In FY2003, the Coast Guard and TSA were scheduled to be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. The Senate and House Committees on Appropriations passed DOT appropriations bills, but they expired with the 108th Congress. The House passed H.J.Res. 2 without substantive appropriations language, which was then amended by the Senate to include $65.1 billion for transportation in FY2003. The Senate bill had $4.1 billion more for the federal-aid highway program and included a 2.852% across-the-board rescission. The final agreement provided $64.6 billion for DOT and related agencies with a 0.65% across-the-board rescission. The bill signed by President Bush on February 20, 2003 included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission to control non-defense spending. TEA-21 introduced Revenue-Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to manage Highway Trust Account revenues, allowing for automatic adjustments in highway spending levels based on revenue forecasts. RABA led to significant increases in highway funding in FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002, but the 2001 recession slowed this growth. In FY2002, there was a $4.4 billion cut in highway program funding due to a drop in revenues below forecast levels. This cut, combined with the RABA boost of $4.5 billion in FY2002, created an $8.4 billion difference between FY2002 and FY2003 highway funding levels. The RABA adjustment for FY2003 was set to zero, restoring highway funding to the previous level. In FY2003, highway funding was restored to $27.7 billion, the same level as in TEA-21. The House Committee recommended funding at $27.7 billion, $4.4 billion over the Administration request. The Senate passed an omnibus bill providing $31.8 billion for transportation, the same as in FY2002. P.L. 108-7 allocated $31.8 billion for the Transportation Security Administration's budget, created in response to security concerns in aviation and transportation systems. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was tasked with screening passengers and baggage at airports by the end of 2002. Initial estimates of needing 25,000-30,000 screeners increased to 70,000 due to additional requirements. Concerns were raised about TSA's size, leading to a cap of 45,000 full-time screener positions in FY2002. The FY2002 emergency supplemental act capped TSA's full-time screener positions at 45,000, but currently, TSA employs nearly 62,000 screeners, with 28,000 being temporary. TSA was appropriated $1.3 billion in FY2002 and received an additional $3.9 billion in the second FY2002 emergency supplemental bill. Its FY2003 request was $5.3 billion, based on 41,300 full-time employees. Congress questioned the amounts requested and criticized the lack of detail on how the money will be used. TSA was under pressure to hire and train 50,000-60,000 screeners and install baggage-screening devices at 429 airports by December 31, 2002, resulting in noted inefficiencies by the DOT Inspector General. The TSA's budget for FY2003 is $5.3 billion, but revenue from fees will not cover it. The House recommended $5.146 billion, the Senate provided $5.346 billion, and P.L.108-7 allocated $5.180 billion. President Bush signed legislation transferring TSA to the Department of Homeland Security in March 2002. The TSA's budget for FY2003 is $5.3 billion, with budget implications unclear. Amtrak requested $1.2 billion but was allocated $521 million for FY2003. The Administration proposed restructuring passenger rail service with reduced federal support. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $762 million for Amtrak in FY2003, while the Senate provided $1.2 billion in H.J.Res. 2. P.L. 108-7 ultimately allocated $1.05 billion to the Secretary of Transportation for distribution to Amtrak quarterly. Funding for Amtrak's long-distance routes now requires individual grant applications. Total annual Department of Transportation funding more than doubled from FY1988 to FY2002. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-71) created the Transportation Security Administration within the Department of Transportation in response to the September 11, 2001 attack. Funding amounts from FY1988 to FY2001 include initial appropriations, supplemental appropriations, and rescissions. FY2002 and FY2003 enacted figures are provided by the House Committee on Appropriations. The FY2003 enacted figure does not reflect a 0.65% across-the-board rescission. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in response to the September 11, 2001 attack. The TSA is responsible for civil aviation security functions, screening passengers and baggage at airports, deploying Federal Air Marshals, improving airport security, and overseeing all modes of transportation during national emergencies. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created in response to the September 11, 2001 attack to oversee domestic transportation security for air, rail, maritime, and other modes. In FY2002, TSA received $5.8 billion, and for FY2003, the budget was initially requested at $4.8 billion but later increased to $5.346 billion with fees from the Aviation and Transportation Security Act offsetting $2.0-2.4 billion. The TSA may impose a fee on airlines if the security fee is insufficient. There is a dispute over the amount airlines paid for screening services in 2000. President Bush signed legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, which includes transferring TSA. The budget implications of this proposal are unclear. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 provides $5.2 billion for the TSA, $166 million less than the Administration's budget request. $4.5 billion is allocated for civil aviation security services, including $3 billion for screening activities and funds for airport modifications and baggage detection systems. Additionally, $1.5 billion is provided for airport support and enforcement presence, with a cap of 45,000 full-time employees for TSA's workforce. $245 million is allocated for maritime and land transportation security, including grants for seaport security and Operation Safe Commerce. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution provides funding for transportation security, including $150 million for seaport security grants and $30 million for Operation Safe Commerce. The Act also allocates $309 million for administrative expenses, $110 million for research and development, and addresses concerns about the TSA's budget allocation and funding for seaport security. The Coast Guard faces challenges with increased responsibilities. The Coast Guard is facing challenges with increased responsibilities for Homeland Security, search and rescue, enforcement, drug and illegal immigrant interdiction on the high seas. The Administration requested a budget authority of $6.1 billion for Coast Guard funding in FY2003, which was a 17% increase from the previous year. The final FY2003 appropriation was $6.1 billion, with a potential reduction to $6.0 billion due to an across-the-board rescission. Coast Guard programs are usually authorized every 2 years, with authorization for FY2003 included in the Maritime Transportation Security Act. The FY2003 budget request for the Coast Guard was $6.1 billion, with potential reduction to $6.0 billion due to rescission. Authorization for FY2003 was included in the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. The budget aimed to support activities against drug smuggling, fleet recapitalization, and accelerated Homeland Security operations. The requested $4.2 billion was for operation and maintenance of various assets. The FY2003 budget for the Coast Guard was $6.1 billion, with potential reduction to $6.0 billion. The Senate and House committees recommended $4.3 billion, which was included in P.L. 108-7. The budget also included funds for acquisition, construction, and improvement, with additional allocations for compliance with environmental regulations and cleaning up contaminated sites. Other requested funding included spill clean-up and research and development. The Coast Guard's FY2003 budget was $6.1 billion, potentially reduced to $6.0 billion. The Senate and House recommended $4.3 billion, included in P.L. 108-7. Funding requests included $62.1 million for spill clean-up and initial damage assessment, and $889 million for retired pay. The Coast Guard faces challenges in managing security responsibilities, search and rescue, and law enforcement. $771 million increase for operating activities to be allocated among Homeland Security and traditional activities. Major issue is the replacement of aging vessels and aircraft. The Coast Guard's FY2003 budget was $6.1 billion, potentially reduced to $6.0 billion. The Senate Committee approved $480 million; P.L.108-7 provides $478 million. Actual purchases of nearly $10 billion are anticipated over a 20-year period beginning in FY2002. President Bush signed legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Coast Guard. The budget implications of this proposal are not clear. The FAA's budget for FY2003 is $13.6 billion, with a general fund contribution of $3.4 billion. The majority of funding comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The Bush Administration requested $13.6 billion in budget authority, compared to $13.3 billion in FY2002. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution makes changes to existing programs and consolidates earmarks from Senate and House bills. The FAA's budget for FY2003 is $13.6 billion, with a general fund contribution of $3.3 billion. The Administration proposed an increase in general fund contribution compared to FY2002. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same general fund contribution amount. There were some programmatic recommendations in the Senate bill that differ from the Administration's request, but they would not result in major changes to FAA programs or operations. The House Committee on Appropriations version of FY2003 appropriations supported a total spending level of nearly $13.6 billion for the FAA, with a larger general fund contribution for operations spending. The bill expressed concerns about the aviation trust fund's long-term health due to reduced air travel post-September 11, instructing the FAA to reexamine spending priorities in anticipation of a tighter budget environment. The Administration proposed an FY2003 funding level of $7.1 billion for Operations and Maintenance. The Administration proposed an FY2003 funding level of $7.1 billion for Operations and Maintenance, compared to $6.9 billion in FY2002. P.L. 108-7 provides about $30 million less than the proposed amount. The Senate Committee proposed a funding level $4 million higher than the Administration request, while the House provided for a reduction of $17 million. The majority of funding in this category is for the salaries of FAA personnel engaged in air traffic control, certification, and safety related activities. The Consolidated Act provides $2.96 billion for Facilities and Equipment, slightly more than the FY2002 level. The Administration proposed raising F&E funding to $3 billion in FY2003, adopted by the Senate Committee and House bill. RE&D received $148.5 million, below the authorized $249 million. EAS program operations were discussed. The EAS program, funded through user fees, received $63 million in FY2002 appropriations and an additional $50 million in emergency funding. The Bush Administration requested $83 million from the AIP fund for FY2003, as overflight fees were predicted to generate only $30 million. P.L. 108-7 approved $113 million for EAS, with the Senate recommending $115 million. The Senate approved $115 million for the EAS program, while the House set funding at $100 million and rejected using AIP funds. The House suggested using F&E funds to cover any funding gaps and mentioned that the program has unused funds to operate at the same level as in FY2002. Additionally, the SCASD program received $20 million in FY2002, but the President's budget proposal requested no funds for it. The Senate bill and House Appropriations Committee allocated $20 million for SCASD in FY2003, but the Consolidated Act did not provide any funding for the program. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) received $3.4 billion in funding for FY2003, with a 3% increase over the previous year. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution provided this amount, with a small rescission and specific allocations for administrative expenses and a pilot program. The small community air service development pilot program under the FHWA budget received $24.1 billion for FY2003, a decrease of $9 billion from the previous year. The report lists 164 airports as AIP high priority projects, with a requirement for airport sponsors to use available AIP formula funds first. The funding listed in the report should not affect other AIP discretionary grants or multi-year letters of intent. The FY2003 appropriation for the FAHP was reduced by 27% from the previous year, totaling $23.2 billion. This decrease was in line with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). The funding for exempt programs was set at $893 million, slightly lower than the previous year. The decline in spending was due to TEA-21 provisions linking federal highway program spending with revenues from the Highway Trust Fund. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a total program level of $28.7 billion for FY2003, $4.2 billion less than the previous year. The House Committee recommended a total program level of $28.7 billion for FY2003, $4.2 billion less than the previous year. The Senate Committee recommended a total FY2003 program level of $32.9 billion, roughly the same as FY2002. The FY2003 limitation on obligations was set at $31.8 billion, virtually the same as FY2002 and $8.6 billion above the President's budget request. The Committee recommendation not only eliminated the negative FY2003 RABA but also provided amounts equal to the FY2002 RABA bonus to raise the FY2003 obligation limitation to the FY2002 level. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution provided $32.9 billion for FHWA, with rescissions reducing the total to approximately $32.4 billion. The Act also included an across-the-board rescission of 0.65%. The FHWA discretionary programs were extensively earmarked in the FY2003 Conference Report. Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) was reduced due to decreased revenues accruing to the Highway Trust Fund in FY2001. The RABA process created by TEA-21 resulted in a $4.4 billion reduction in guaranteed spending for FY2003, impacting state and local governments reliant on federal contributions for transportation funding. This unexpected cut, combined with previous adjustments, led to a potential $8.6 billion decrease from the FY2002 level. The RABA situation led to a reduction in highway program funding for FY2003. Hearings were held in Congress, resulting in the restoration of funding to $31.8 billion. P.L. 108-7 provided this funding level, following support from Members of the House and Senate. The TEA-21 Funding Framework established the largest surface transportation program. TEA-21, the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continued most highway and transit programs from ISTEA. It included new funding initiatives like the Border Infrastructure Program but mainly focused on existing programs like NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and Congestion. The Surface Transportation Program (STP), Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation (BRR), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) are key programs subject to annual apportionment by formula. Additional highway funding includes minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief, not limited by annual obligations. Allocated programs, such as the Federal Lands Highway Program and High Priority Projects, are under direct control of FHWA or other entities. The Administration proposes decreased funding for various RD&T activities, from $417.5 million in FY2002 to $351.2 million in FY2003. RD&T funds are used primarily to advance and deploy technologies intended to improve highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, highway policies, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). The ITS deployment program provides funds for states and local governments to use advanced communication and information systems to improve the management and safety of their surface transportation. The ITS deployment program funds advanced communication and information systems for surface transportation safety. Earmarking of funds has been a concern, with some preferring competitive awards. The FMCSA, created in 2000, enforces motor carrier safety regulations. The FMCSA enforces Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations, administers grants for state safety activities, and receives funding from the federal highway trust fund. The FY2003 budget request was $367.5 million, with $60 million allocated for border enforcement activities. The FMCSA's FY2003 budget includes $117.5 million for administrative and operations expenses, $7 million for research and technology activities, and $190 million for grants to states. The funds are used to improve truck and bus safety regulations and compliance activities. The FMCSA's FY2003 budget includes $117.5 million for administrative and operations expenses, $7 million for research and technology activities, and $190 million for grants to states. These funds are primarily used for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) to enforce truck and bus safety regulations. The program covers up to 80% of a state's safety program costs and involves over 10,000 officers conducting roadside inspections. Additionally, $60 million is allocated for border enforcement to enhance safety for Mexican trucks and buses entering the US. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's total budget authority for FY2003 is $435.3 million, with $225 million designated for Highway Traffic Safety Grants and $210.3 million for Operations and Research activities. This amount is a compromise between Senate and House recommendations, with the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommending budget authority of $440 million. For FY2003, the Committee recommended a budget authority for NHTSA of $440 million, $15 million above the Administration's request. The House Committee on Appropriations suggested total NHTSA funding of $430 million, with $205 million for Operations & Research and $225 million for Highway Traffic Safety Grants. NHTSA's responsibilities include establishing safety standards, providing information to drivers, studying safety issues, and promoting state laws. The Bush Administration prioritizes improving transportation safety through NHTSA, targeting programs to reduce drunk driving, aggressive driving, enhance child safety, and explore safety programs. The NHTSA is focused on improving transportation safety by complying with the TREAD Act, which includes rulemaking actions on tire safety, rollover propensity, and child safety. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed disappointment in NHTSA for not meeting the deadline to produce a study on booster seats for children. The Committee urged NHTSA to issue the results without delay. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concern over NHTSA's failure to achieve a safety goal and lowering seat belt usage target. They also noted dissatisfaction and morale drop after a reorganization in fiscal year 2002, warning of continued decline in program effectiveness. The Administration requested $711 million for FRA in FY2003, $23 million less than the previous year. The Administration's FY2003 budget request for Amtrak included $521 million, with plans for a new structure involving government, states, and the private sector. Core safety and operations would receive $118 million, an increase of $7 million from FY2002. Funding for Alaska Railroad rehabilitation was not included, and spending for high-speed rail development was reduced to $23 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 provided $1.05 billion for Amtrak, lower than the requested amount. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $1.05 billion for Amtrak, lower than the Senate's approved $1.2 billion but more than the House's recommended $763 million. Additionally, $30 million is allocated for next generation high-speed rail development, $7 million more than the Administration's request. The Act also includes funding for core safety and operations, railroad research and development, and the Alaska Railroad. The debate on the FRA budget focuses on Amtrak, safety activities, and high-speed rail initiatives. The FRA is the primary federal agency for railroad safety, with a proposed budget of $118.2 million for FY2003. Most funds go towards salaries, travel, training, and information systems monitoring safety. Increased railroad traffic volume makes safety a concern. The FY2003 budget request is a 6% increase from FY2002, with a conference agreement of $117.4 million. The railroad safety statute was last reauthorized in 1994. The railroad safety program's funding expired in FY1998, and reauthorization efforts since 1994 have not resulted in consensus. Changes to FRA's safety activities could impact budgets post-FY2003. Grade-crossing safety effectiveness and budget adequacy for FY2003 are key concerns. In FY2003, FRA requested funding to strengthen its grade-crossing safety program and R&D activities. The appropriations committees historically allocate funds for safety research categories. The FY2002 DOT appropriations act provided $29 million for R&D, and for FY2003, FRA requested $28.3 million, with a conference agreement of $29.3 million. The conference agreement provides $29.3 million for FRA's safety and research programs, excluding user fees. The industry opposes user fees, arguing they already pay taxes and invest in safety. In FY2002, $32.3 million was allocated for Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D, with a request for $23.2 million in FY2003. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $30.45 billion for this program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $30.45 billion for Amtrak, $7.25 billion over the Administration request. The President's FY2003 budget request for Amtrak was $521.5 million, with the Administration not supporting additional funding unless significant reform is implemented. Amtrak had stated a need for at least $1.2 billion in FY2003. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $762 million for Amtrak, with limitations on operating support for long-distance trains. The Senate provided $1.2 billion in funding for Amtrak in H.J.Res. 2, while P.L. 108-7 provides $1.05 billion and defers repayment of a $100 million loan. Amtrak's funding will now go to the Secretary of Transportation, who will provide quarterly funding through the grant-making process. Amtrak's authorization expired in FY2002, and Congress is likely to consider reauthorization during the first session of the 108th Congress. President Bush's FY2003 budget request for FTA is $7.226 billion, a 7% increase from FY2002. The FTA's FY2003 funding increased to $7.226 billion, following the enactment of TEA-21 in 1998. The funding is allocated to various transit programs, including Capital Investment Grants, Urbanized Area Formula Grants, and smaller formula and planning programs. The Urbanized Area Formula Program receives 86% of the funding, while the Non-Urbanized Area Formula Program receives 6%. The Capital Investment Grants and Loans Program (Section 5309) received a funding increase to $3.036 billion for FY2003, with allocations for new transit starts, fixed guideway modernization, and bus & bus facilities. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) also received funding, with 86% allocated to urban areas and 6% to non-urban areas. The Urbanized Area Formula Program (Section 5307) provides funding for capital and operating needs in urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. For FY2003, $3.3 billion was proposed, apportioned based on population and transit service data. The House, Senate, and P.L. 108-7 all approved the requested amount. Operating assistance funding was eliminated with the enactment of TEA-21. With the enactment of TEA-21, operating assistance funding was eliminated for urbanized areas with populations over 200,000. Preventive maintenance is now eligible for funding as a capital expense. Urbanized areas under 200,000 population and non-urbanized areas can use formula funds for capital or operating purposes. Other transit programs include funding for non-urbanized areas, grants for elderly and individuals with disabilities, clean fuels, and rural transportation accessibility incentive programs. The House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate agreed to provide $7 million for the over-the-road bus accessibility program in FY2003, as outlined in P.L. 108-7. The President's budget request for the New Freedom Initiative, a program to promote transportation access for persons with disabilities, was not supported. The Job Access and Reverse Commute Program received $150 million in FY2003, up from $125 million in FY2002, as proposed by the Administration. RSPA requested a budget of $102.5 million for FY2003. RSPA requested a budget of $102.5 million for FY2003, with most allocated to transportation safety activities. The budget included $63.8 million for pipeline safety and $23.8 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. The House Committee recommended $99.6 million, while the Senate approved $107.8 million. The final conference agreement (P.L. 108-7) provided $105 million, with $63.8 million for pipeline safety and $23.3 million for hazardous materials. The budget for FY2003 was $105 million, with $63.8 million allocated for pipeline safety and $23.3 million for hazardous materials transportation safety. The FY2002 funding for TSA was $5.8 billion, including supplementals, transfers, and offsetting collections. The FY2003 request was increased by $546 million, with estimated offsetting collections of $2.65 billion. The FY2002 DOT Appropriations Act included a rescission of $317 million of FY2000 AIP contract authority. The FY2002 total budget for FAA programs reflects a rescission of $59 million, while the FY2003 figure includes a negative RABA adjustment of $4.4 billion. Amtrak's total funding for FY2002 was $1.1 billion, excluding $14 million in permanent appropriations. The requested total resources for RSPA for FY2003 may be considered as $123 million. MARAD and FMC are not funded by the DOT and related agencies appropriation. The Administration budgets do not include the NTSB or the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board budgets; they are included in the DOT Appropriations bills. The rescission of unobligated previous years' contract authority has been subtracted from this total. The total resources available could be seen as $61.3 billion for FY2002 enacted, and $64.9 billion for FY2003 enacted. Key acronyms include ARC, AIP, AIR21, ARAA, and ATSA. Key transportation-related acronyms include ATSA, BRR, BTS, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, FAIR21, FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, and IM. Key transportation-related acronyms include HPP (High Priority Projects), HTF (Highway Trust Fund), IM (Interstate Maintenance program), ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems), MCSAP (Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program), New Starts (part of FTA's Capital Grants and Loans Program), NHS (National Highway System), NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), NMCSA (National Motor Carrier Safety Administration), O&M (Operations and Maintenance program), OIG (Office of the Inspector General), OST (Office of the Secretary of Transportation), RABA (Revenue-Aligned Budget Authority), RD&T (Research, Development and Technology program), RE&D (Research, Engineering and Development program), RSPA (Research and Special Projects Administration), SCASD (Small Community Air Service Development program), STB (Surface Transportation Board), and STP (Surface Transportation). The curr_chunk provides a list of transportation-related acronyms and programs, including FAA, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, TIFIA, TSA, and various CRS reports on different transportation topics. The curr_chunk lists various CRS reports on transportation topics, including the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program, Environmental Streamlining Provisions, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Railroad Safety Program, High-Speed Rail Development, Highway Finance, North American Free Trade Agreement, and Selected Aviation Security. The curr_chunk provides a list of resources related to transportation legislation and budget, including CRS reports, Department of Transportation budget information, House Appropriations Committee, Maritime Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Office of Management and Budget. Transportation funding for the Department of Transportation (DOT) comes from various sources, including transportation trust funds and federal Treasury general funds. Trust funds, such as the highway trust fund and airport and airway trust fund, are funded by specific excise and other taxes. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of total federal transportation spending, with highway and transit funding being the largest components of DOT. Highway and transit funding are the largest components of DOT appropriations, funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund. Contract authority allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year without the need for new appropriations. Transportation appropriators have existing authority to spend on major programs, requiring appropriations only for future outlays. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs to make it difficult for funding levels to be altered. Funding guarantees were set up to prevent changes in funding levels through the annual budget/appropriations process. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through a mechanism called \"Revenue Aligned Budget.\" The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) established a mechanism called \"Revenue Aligned Budget Authority\" (RABA) to provide additional highway funds annually. However, for FY2003, the RABA adjustment would have caused a significant drop in highway obligational funding if left intact. TEA-21 changed the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs, limiting their ability to set annual obligations. In FY2000, appropriators took steps to regain discretion over highway spending by redistributing funds among programs and adding significant projects. This trend continued in FY2001 with funds for earmarked projects and additional funding for TEA-21 programs. In FY2002, major redistributions of RABA funds occurred, with some funds transferred to ineligible agencies under TEA-21. The FAIR21 Act provides a guarantee for FAA program spending, different from TEA-21, with weaker guarantees. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Enactment of TEA-21 and FAIR21 gives transportation appropriators control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, and FAA programs. Transportation appropriators have control over spending for the TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies. Budgeting for transportation uses a complex lexicon of budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing funding for trust fund-financed programs. Limitations on obligations help control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. TEA-21 amended Title 23 U.S.C. to provide contract authority for transportation projects, allowing states to access funds at the start of each fiscal year without appropriations. The Act limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and are reimbursed by the federal government after completion. Trust fund balances remain high due to obligated funds representing work in progress, which are not subtracted from balances. Both highway and transit accounts have short- and long-term commitments, including payments for current fiscal year projects and outstanding obligations for future dates. Unobligated amounts are dedicated to projects but not yet committed. Contract authority funds are distributed to states and specific projects. Contract authority funds are distributed to states and programs through apportionments and allocations. Apportionments are for formula-driven programs like the national highway system, while allocations are for programs under direct federal control. Recipients may mistakenly assume state apportionments are part of the federal budget."
