    "content": "The \"Local Community Radio Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Key findings are outlined in Section 2. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 led to increased ownership consolidation in the radio industry, with concerns raised about too much consolidation in some local radio markets. A commitment to localism in radio operations, programming, and content could enhance radio listening. Local communities face challenges in launching radio stations due to limited spectrum availability and high costs. In 2003, the average cost to acquire a commercial radio station was over $2,500,000. In 2000, the Federal Communications Commission introduced low-power FM (LPFM) to promote community-oriented radio broadcasting. LPFM aimed to provide opportunities for new voices on the airwaves and allow local groups to offer programming tailored to community needs and interests without compromising the FM radio band's integrity. The FCC is committed to creating a low-power FM radio service without causing interference to existing radio stations. FM translator stations can operate on adjacent channels to full power stations with up to 250 watts of power. LPFM rules are based on the performance of these translators, which have shown minimal interference. Small rural broadcasters have expressed concerns. In September 2000, the Commission simplified the interference complaint process for LPFM stations. Congress delayed full implementation of LPFM in December 2000 for an engineering study, causing a delay in local community radio stations. Despite this delay, over 500 LPFM stations are currently on the air, operated by local entities. After a 2-year study costing $2,193,343 in taxpayer dollars, concerns of broadcasters were found to be unsubstantiated. Minorities make up almost a third of the population, but only own 7% of local TV and radio stations. Women, representing over half the population, own only 6% of stations. LPFM stations, while not a solution to overall inequalities in minority and female broadcast ownership, provide underrepresented communities with an opportunity to operate a station and offer diverse viewpoints. During emergencies like Hurricane Katrina, LPFM stations have been crucial sources of information, with examples like WQRZ in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi serving as an Emergency Operations Center. During Hurricane Katrina, evacuees at the Houston Astrodome couldn't hear important information over loudspeakers, so volunteers distributed radios and set up an LPFM station outside for broadcasting essential updates. The text chunk discusses the repeal of a prior law, modification of rules by the Federal Communications Commission regarding minimum distance separation requirements between different types of FM stations, retention of rules for protection of radio reading services, and ensuring availability of spectrum for LPFM stations. SEC. 6. ENSURING AVAILABILITY OF SPECTRUM FOR LPFM STATIONS. The FCC must ensure licenses are available for both FM translator and low-power FM stations based on local community needs. SEC. 7. PROHIBITIONS ON CERTAIN APPLICANTS. The FCC will prohibit applicants who have engaged in unlicensed station operation from obtaining a low-power FM license. SEC. 8. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RULES. The Federal Communications Commission will maintain rules for third-adjacent channel protection for full-power FM stations in highly populated States. Additionally, the FCC will conduct an economic study on the impact of low-power FM stations on commercial FM stations."
