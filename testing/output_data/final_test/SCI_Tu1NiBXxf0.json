Watching tutorial videos does not guarantee success in achieving balance. A system is proposed to support beginners by projecting the etching latte art procedure directly onto a cappuccino. The experiment results demonstrate the progress made using the system for etching latte art. Different methods of creating patterns in latte art are discussed, including using syrup directly on milk foam. Beginners often struggle with creating patterns due to the viscosity differences of the fluids used. In this paper, a support system is developed to help beginners create well-balanced latte art by projecting a making procedure using syrup onto a cappuccino. The system also uses animations to help beginners understand the deformation of fluids with viscosity. The usefulness of the system is demonstrated through a questionnaire survey and design templates. The making of latte art involves free pouring with milk foam and syrup to create patterns. Researchers have simulated the flow of milk in latte art, but users still need advanced skills to understand and replicate the process. An automated latte art machine has been developed to create unlimited designs easily. An automated latte art machine has been developed to easily create unlimited designs without the need for barista skills. However, this machine cannot replicate latte art with milk foam like in free pour latte art. Researchers have also developed support systems for baristas to improve their latte art skills, such as a system that shows how to pour milk to create animated lines for latte art designs. Another system projects a painting procedure onto a canvas to assist users in painting. Researchers have developed various systems to support users in different creative tasks. Morioka et al. created a system that visually guides users in cooking by projecting instructions on a dedicated kitchen ceiling. Xie et al. proposed an interactive system for building balloon art with fabrication guidance and shaking animations. Yoshida et al. introduced a system for creating latte art designs. Yoshida et al. proposed a projector-camera guidance system for digital fabrication, using a depth camera and projection mapping. The system allows for intuitive information-sharing among workers and reduces the difference between instructions and users' manipulation. They also supported making etching latte art with a small projector. The system configuration for making etching latte art with a small projector includes a laptop connected to a projector, tripod for the projector, and users selecting patterns like Heart Ring, Leaf, or Spider Web. The making procedure is projected on the cappuccino, with animations of syrup deformation. Users trace the projected image with syrup to complete the etching latte art. Users select a pattern for etching latte art, followed by a making procedure projected on the cappuccino. The system displays how to put syrup and manipulate the pick separately, helping beginners understand syrup deformation. This system is unique in showing the making procedure of etching latte art. The system displays animations of syrup deformation and etching latte art making procedures using a projector. An experiment was conducted with twelve latte art beginners to evaluate the system's effectiveness. In an experiment with latte art beginners, participants were divided into two groups (Group 1 and Group 2) to create etching latte art using different methods. Group 1 first made art by themselves and then with the system, while Group 2 did the opposite. Different patterns were selected to avoid repetition. Questionnaires were filled out after creating the art, and feedback was gathered from inexperienced individuals on the balance of the art. Foreground images were created to compare the art made by oneself versus with the system. Participants in the experiment created etching latte art using different methods: making by themselves and making with the system. The making process involved watching a video or CG animations to guide them in creating the art. Baristas typically use well-steamed foamed milk with tiny bubbles for etching latte art. Participants in the experiment made etching latte art using yoghurt instead of foamed milk. The results showed comparisons between art made by participants themselves and art made with the system, with some participants putting too much syrup. Participants in the experiment made etching latte art using yoghurt instead of foamed milk. The results showed comparisons between art made by participants themselves and art made with the system. Some participants struggled with shaping hearts and drawing lines vertically, but were able to improve with the system. Others had difficulty with drawing spirals, but achieved better balance with the system. Participants in the experiment used a system to create better balanced etching latte art. A questionnaire survey was conducted to gather feedback on the process. Results showed that beginners found the patterns of etching latte art complex. The experiment involved participants using a system to create balanced etching latte art. Feedback from a questionnaire survey revealed that beginners found the patterns complex. The average score for Question 2 was 3.00pt, with some participants struggling with syrup placement and pick manipulation. However, Question 5 received high scores, indicating the system's effectiveness in projecting the making procedure directly on the cappuccino. Participants rated Question 3 and 4 highly, suggesting the system's ability to produce quality etching latte art. The animations of syrup deformation in the system help users understand how syrup deforms when drawing lines with a pick. Participants found it easy to draw lines and create etching latte art using the system. The animation speed was ideal, making it easier for beginners to make latte art compared to watching videos on another screen. Users found it easy to create etching latte art using the system, but some struggled with the amount and placement of syrup. Suggestions were made to improve by providing animations showing how to put syrup to help users understand better. The study addressed issues with syrup placement in etching latte art. Multiple projectors will be used to improve visibility. A questionnaire survey showed that most participants found their art made with the system more similar to the design template. Participant G's etching latte art was well-balanced, with proper syrup placement even without the system. Participant I struggled with syrup placement, but found it easier with the system's guidance. The system will be improved with new animations to show the proper speed for syrup placement. Foreground images were created to evaluate similarity between the design template and etching latte art. The results of background subtraction showed that most participants found their etching latte art made with the system to be more similar to the design template than art made by themselves. However, some participants had issues with syrup placement, resulting in differences from the template. Overall, the difference in similarities between art made with the system and art made by themselves was minimal at 0.001. The system developed supports beginners in practicing etching latte art by projecting animations of syrup deformation onto the cappuccino. Participants' evaluations confirmed the system's usefulness, with over 80% achieving better-balanced art. However, some individuals still produced better results on their own. In future work, the system will be improved to consider human preferences for etching latte art and develop animations of syrup deformation automatically. Development factors from the survey will also be addressed. Experimental results show differences in etching latte art creation between Group 1 and Group 2, while participants' questionnaire results and background subtraction data indicate similarities to the design template."
