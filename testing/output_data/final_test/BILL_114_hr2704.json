Targeting at-risk seniors with these services can help prevent negative health outcomes and asset depletion. SEC. 1859A. COMMUNITY-BASED INSTITUTIONAL SPECIAL NEEDS PLAN DEMONSTRATION. The Secretary will establish a CBI-SNP demonstration program to provide home and community-based care to eligible Medicare beneficiaries through agreements with MA organizations offering eligible MA plans. The program will be limited to five MA plans. Eligible MA plans must include additional items and services beyond typical coverage. The CBI-SNP demonstration program, limited to five MA plans, provides coverage for long-term care services and supports such as homemaker services, home delivered meals, transportation services, respite care, adult day care services, and safety equipment. Eligible MA organizations must have experience in offering specialized MA plans. Eligible MA organizations offering specialized MA plans for special needs individuals must have experience working with low-income seniors groups, be located in a State participating in the CBI-SNP demonstration program, and meet additional criteria set by the Secretary. Eligible Medicare beneficiaries are those eligible to enroll in an eligible MA plan under the CBI-SNP demonstration program. The CBI-SNP demonstration program provides benchmark payments to eligible MA organizations offering specialized MA plans for individuals who are subsidy eligible, not eligible for Medicaid benefits, have difficulty with daily activities, and are aged 65 or older. These payments are in addition to regular payments made under part C. The CBI-SNP demonstration program allows eligible Medicare beneficiaries to switch from an MA plan not participating in the program to one that does, or from original Medicare to an MA plan in the program. The Secretary is required to educate beneficiaries on these options through various assistance programs. The CBI-SNP demonstration program for eligible Medicare beneficiaries must be implemented by January 1 of the second year after enactment and will run for five years. The Secretary has the authority to extend or expand the program based on a report, including nationwide implementation or making it permanent, unless certain criteria are met. The expansion of the CBI-SNP demonstration program for eligible Medicare beneficiaries will increase expenditures and may impact the quality of healthcare services. An independent evaluation by a third party will assess the program's effectiveness. The CBI-SNP demonstration program has resulted in improved patient care, reduced hospitalizations, delayed nursing facility admissions, reduced spend down for medical assistance eligibility, improved quality of life for Medicare beneficiaries, and increased caregiver satisfaction. An evaluation process will assess the program's effectiveness. The evaluation process for the CBI-SNP demonstration program involves the Secretary establishing goals and criteria, implementing data collection and reporting requirements for eligible MA plans to measure program effectiveness. The Secretary will recognize variations in long-term care services across states. A report with evaluation results and recommendations will be submitted to Congress after four years of the CBI-SNP program implementation. Budget neutrality will be ensured after the third year of the program. The Secretary will ensure that aggregate payments made under the CBI-SNP demonstration program do not exceed the estimated amount that would have been spent without the program. The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to the testing and evaluation of the program."
