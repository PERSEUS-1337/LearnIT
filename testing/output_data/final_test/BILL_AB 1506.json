    "title": "AB 1506",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2699 of the Labor Code is amended to allow civil penalties to be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of themselves and others. \"Person\" and \"aggrieved employee\" are defined for the purpose of this part. For the purpose of this part, \"cure\" means the employer abates each violation alleged by any aggrieved employee, complies with the underlying statutes, and makes the aggrieved employee whole. A violation of specific sections requires the employer to provide compliant wage statements for the three-year period prior to the notice. Additionally, courts have the authority to assess civil penalties in line with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency's discretion. In actions seeking civil penalties, courts may award a lesser amount if the maximum penalty would be unjust. A civil penalty of $500 is established for violations when the person does not employ any employees. If a person employs one or more employees at the time of the violation, the civil penalty is $100 per aggrieved employee per pay period for the initial violation and $200 per aggrieved employee per pay period for subsequent violations. No civil penalty is imposed for a failure to act by the Labor and Workplace Development Agency. An aggrieved employee can recover a civil penalty in a civil action filed on behalf of themselves and others for violations. Prevailing employees are entitled to attorney's fees and costs. No action can be brought for certain violations unless they involve mandatory reporting requirements. Civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees will be distributed with 75% going to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education purposes, and 25% going to the employees themselves. No action can be brought if the agency has already cited a person for the same violation within the specified timeframes. The civil penalties recovered under subdivision (f) will be distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency for enforcement and education purposes. The superior court must review and approve any penalties sought as part of a proposed settlement agreement. This does not affect the exclusive remedy provided by workers' compensation provisions for employer liability. Section 2699.3 of the Labor Code is amended to allow civil action by an aggrieved employee after meeting specific requirements. The agency may create regulations to implement the provisions of this part, excluding penalties related to workers' compensation laws. The aggrieved employee must provide written notice to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer of alleged violations, after which the agency has 30 days to decide whether to investigate. If no investigation is initiated within 33 days, the employee can pursue a civil action under Section 2699. If the agency decides to investigate the alleged violation, it must notify the employer and the aggrieved employee within 33 days of receiving the initial notice. The agency has 120 days to investigate and issue a citation. If no citation is issued within 158 days, the employee can start a civil action under Section 2699. A plaintiff can add a cause of action under this part to an existing complaint within 60 days. A civil action for a violation of Division 5 can only commence after giving notice to the relevant agencies and employer. The division will inspect or investigate alleged violations according to procedures in Division 5. If a citation is issued, the employee cannot take action under Section 2699. The division must notify the employee and employer within 14 days of certifying the violation's correction. If no citation is issued by the end of the inspection period, the employee can challenge this decision in court following precedents of the Occupational Safety and Health Appeals Board. If the court orders the division to issue a citation, the employee cannot pursue a civil action under Section 2699. The superior court must receive a copy of the notice of violation when filing a complaint for Division 5 violations. Nonmaterial differences between the notice of violation and the court complaint will not lead to dismissal. If the division fails to investigate, certain provisions will apply. The division's authority for long-term abatement issues remains unchanged. An employee cannot file a civil action under Section 2699 while the employer is in consultation with the division to address worksite conditions. Employers cannot enter into consultation with the division after receiving notice to avoid legal action. The superior court reviews and approves settlements for violations of Division 5 to ensure they meet state and federal law standards. The division can comment on health and safety settlement provisions, with the court considering their input. Civil actions by aggrieved employees for violations must meet specific requirements before commencing. The aggrieved employee must provide written notice of alleged violations to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and the employer. The employer has 33 days to cure the violation, after which the employee can commence a civil action if the violation is not resolved. Employers can only use notice and cure provisions three times in a 12-month period for the same violation, except for violations of specific sections which can only be used once. If the aggrieved employee disputes that the alleged violation has been cured, they must provide written notice to the employer and agency. The agency will review the actions taken by the employer and provide a decision within 17 days. If the violation is not cured or if there is no timely notification, the employee can proceed with a civil action. If the agency determines the violation has been cured but the employee disagrees, they can appeal to the superior court. The specified periods in this section do not count towards the time limit for starting a civil action to recover penalties under this part. Section 2699.5 of the Labor Code is amended. The provisions of subdivision (a) of Section 2699.3 apply to alleged violations of various labor code sections. The curr_chunk lists various sections of the labor code, including Sections 1174, 1194, 1197, 1197.1, 1197.5, 1198, and many others. This act is an urgency statute to incentivize prompt resolution of disputes over itemized wage statements under the Labor Code."
