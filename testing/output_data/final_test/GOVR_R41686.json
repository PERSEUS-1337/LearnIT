    "content": "The United States has two tsunami warning centers managed by NOAA's National Weather Service. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii monitors and issues warnings for the Pacific basin, while the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska covers the West Coast and Alaska. The PTWC also monitors the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, and Caribbean Sea. The National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) was established in 1967 after the PTWC issued warnings to Alaska. The NTWC is responsible for issuing tsunami warnings to Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, California, U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, Atlantic coast of Canada, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and British Virgin Islands. The PTWC and NTWC monitor seismic data to determine tsunami likelihood. They transmit warnings to NOAA and state emergency centers. Coastal water-level data and DART buoys are used to confirm tsunamis. NOAA established a DART array in 2001 after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. In 2001, Congress passed P.L. 109-424 to enhance the Pacific Tsunami Warning System after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The DART system was expanded to 39 U.S. buoys and 21 buoys in other countries. NWS prioritizes maintaining tsunami detection equipment. The highest priority in the tsunami forecasting and warning program at NOAA is the maintenance of tsunami detection equipment. As of November 18, 2015, 4 out of 39 U.S. buoys were not operational, an improvement from March 2015. While inoperable stations may not prevent tsunami warnings, they could result in warnings covering a larger area and potentially lengthen warning times. The National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) was established in response to the tsunami threat from the Cascadia subduction zone. It assists states in emergency planning, develops coastal inundation maps, and conducts outreach programs. NOAA's goals for the NTHMP include raising awareness and improving warning guidance. The National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) aims to develop improved warning guidance, enhance tsunami warning systems, and integrate tsunami planning into multi-hazard programs. The program coordinates NOAA's activities in detection, warning, communication, outreach, education, and research. Congress has raised concerns about the maintenance and availability of the DART buoy network. In P.L. 109-424, Congress emphasized the importance of maintaining operational tsunami detection equipment. Bills introduced in the 114th Congress addressed DART buoy maintenance and availability within the NTHMP. The House and Senate passed legislation regarding the Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2015. Both H.R. 34 and S. 533 aim to amend the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, authorizing appropriations for the NTHMP through FY2017 or FY2021. The bills would broaden the program to include a focus on tsunami research and outreach. Notable differences between the House and Senate versions are highlighted, including the addition of the term \"research\" to the act's title. Both H.R. 34 and S. 533 seek to amend the Tsunami Warning and Education Act by broadening the program to include research efforts related to improving tsunami detection, forecasting, warnings, notification, mitigation, resiliency, response, outreach, and recovery. The Senate-passed version includes a requirement for maintaining 80% of DART buoys at operational capacity and a cooperative effort among NOAA, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation to provide seismic information. The House-passed bill does not include provisions for rapid and reliable seismic information from international and domestic seismic networks. Both bills would rename subsection (c) to the Tsunami Warning System, requiring forecasting capabilities for tsunamis in various oceans. Subsection 4(d) in both bills explicitly names the NTWC and includes requirements for using multiple models for predicting tsunamis. The House-passed bill adds four new subsections for fail-safe warning capabilities. The House-passed bill adds fail-safe warning capabilities for tsunami centers to coordinate with NWS and develop operational procedures. The Senate-passed bill focuses on using data for new inundation estimates and coordination with Coast Guard. Coordination with NWS differs between the two bills, with the House bill directing NWS and the Senate bill requiring NOAA administrator to coordinate. The Senate-passed bill emphasizes increased coordination efforts for timely tsunami warnings, including implementing mass communication tools. Both bills omit requirements for reports to Congress on system integration and technology transfer. The House bill adds fail-safe warning capabilities for tsunami centers, while the Senate bill focuses on new inundation estimates and coordination with the Coast Guard. Coordination with the NWS differs between the two bills. The Senate-passed bill would retain subsection 4(h) of P.L. 109-424, requiring congressional notification of impaired forecasting capabilities. It also includes a requirement for congressional notification within 90 days of a significant tsunami warning, with details on the tsunami model, monitoring equipment, and warning effectiveness. The House-passed version does not include this reporting requirement. Both bills are similar in Section 5, focusing on improving tsunami preparedness through a community-based hazard mitigation program. The bills aim to improve tsunami preparedness and resilience in at-risk areas by providing technical and financial assistance to coastal states, territories, tribes, and local governments. They also focus on developing regional tsunami hazard and risk assessments, as well as supporting vertical evacuation structure planning for communities with limited evacuation capabilities. The bills aim to improve tsunami preparedness by providing assistance to at-risk areas for developing regional hazard assessments and supporting vertical evacuation structure planning in communities with limited evacuation capabilities. The program may include vulnerability research, education, risk management training, and development of technologies. States can designate at-risk areas based on local conditions. The bills aim to improve tsunami preparedness by providing assistance to at-risk areas for developing regional hazard assessments and supporting vertical evacuation structure planning. Section 5 in both bills would require a report on accreditation of the TsunamiReady program within 180 days of enactment. NOAA would be tasked with supporting and maintaining the research program in consultation with other federal agencies, state governments, academic institutions, and advisory committees. Section 6 of the bill broadens the responsibilities of the research program to include improving near-field tsunami detection and forecasting abilities using technology like DART buoys and NOAA supercomputers. It also requires the development of a technical basis for validating tsunami maps, models, and forecasts. The House-passed bill includes a pilot project for near-field tsunami forecasting in the Cascadia region, while the Senate-passed bill does not have a similar provision. The Cascadia subduction zone is located offshore of Washington State. The Cascadia subduction zone offshore of Washington State, Oregon, and Northern California has the potential for major earthquakes similar to the magnitude 9 Great Sendai Earthquake in 2011. Evidence shows a large earthquake in 1700 generated a tsunami that hit the U.S. northwest coast and Japan. Both bills aim to update language and require NOAA to coordinate with international entities for technical assistance and training. Both bills propose establishing a new advisory panel within the NOAA to advise on tsunami science, technology, and regional preparedness. The panel would review federal government activities related to tsunamis and submit recommendations to NOAA, which would then report to Congress on progress in implementing the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. The Tsunami Warning and Education Act includes provisions for ensuring resources are available, disseminating guidelines for community planning and education, and developing the technical basis for validation of tsunami maps and forecasts. It also requires standardization and streamlining of tsunami warnings with other natural hazards. The Senate-passed bill includes provisions for national efforts supporting rapid emergency response after a domestic near-shore tsunami event. It authorizes appropriations for tsunami activities for three years at $27 million each year, with specific allocations for the NTHMP and Tsunami Research Program. The House-passed bill does not have a similar provision. The House-passed bill authorizes the program for six years, requiring NOAA to coordinate with state and local emergency managers to improve tsunami education and awareness. It includes a provision for a coordinating committee to assist with the administration of the NTHMP, with representatives from states at risk from tsunamis. The House-passed bill authorizes the NTHMP for six years, requiring coordination with state and local emergency managers to enhance tsunami education and awareness. It includes a provision for a coordinating committee with representatives from at-risk states. Funding for the program is maintained at the FY2014 level by the Senate Appropriations Committee, while the House Appropriations Committee allocates $27 million for the NOAA Tsunami Program. The House report supports funding for the DART buoy network and expects NOAA to maintain availability at 80% of stations. Instructions were included to restore $6 million for NTHMP grant funds. NOAA allocated $31.4 million for tsunami activities in FY2015, with DART buoys funded under Observations PPA and other activities under Analyze, Forecast, and Support PPA. The FY2016 budget request was $6 million less. The FY2016 budget request for NOAA tsunami program was $6 million less than FY2015, totaling $31.4 million. Funding historically supported warning, mitigation, and research activities. GAO noted funding ranged from $5-10 million annually between FY1997 and FY2004, increasing after 2004. Between FY1997 and FY2004, funding for the NOAA tsunami program ranged from $5 million to $10 million annually. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, funding increased to $27 million in FY2005 and peaked at $42 million in FY2009. The proportion of funding allocated to warning activities rose from 40% in FY2004 to 70% in FY2009, while mitigation funding decreased from 50% to 30%. Research funding remained steady at 6-10%."
