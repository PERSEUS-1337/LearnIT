    "content": "We provide a new perspective on the forward pass in deep networks, showing that passing through a dropout layer, linear layer, and non-linear activation is equivalent to optimizing a convex objective with a Proximal Stochastic Gradient method. Replacing Bernoulli dropout with additive dropout is equivalent to optimizing the same objective with a variance-reduced proximal method. We unify fully-connected and convolutional layers as special cases of a high-order tensor product, deriving a formula for the Lipschitz constant. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show the effectiveness of this approach. Deep learning has transformed computer vision and natural language processing. Mathematical analysis of deep networks is ongoing, but a complete understanding remains elusive. Different types of dropout layers have varying effects on generalization. The effectiveness of these layers raises questions about their fundamental properties. The effectiveness of dropout layers in deep networks raises questions about their fundamental properties and potential for improvement. A strong connection is established between the forward pass through a block of layers and the solution of convex optimization problems. The effectiveness of dropout layers in deep networks is closely connected to applying stochastic solvers. The choice of stochastic optimization algorithms leads to various types of dropout layers. A block with Bernoulli dropout, linear transformation, and non-linear activation is equivalent to a single iteration of a Proximal Stochastic Gradient algorithm. The text chunk discusses the equivalence of different dropout methods in deep networks and their connection to stochastic solvers. It also explores the use of high-order tensor products to compute the Lipschitz constant and optimal step size for stochastic solvers. Experimental validation shows that replacing layers with corresponding solvers improves model accuracy. Optimization algorithms can guide the design of deep network architectures, improving model accuracy. Various studies have proposed new architectures inspired by optimization updates, such as ADMM-Net for compressed sensing and variational networks for image reconstruction. Embedding optimization problems as structured layers in deep networks and replacing proximal operators with neural networks have also been explored. Our work aims to contribute to a unified framework that connects optimization algorithms with deep layers, focusing on structured layers and neural networks. Previous studies have proposed specialized architectures for specific tasks, while our approach aims to create a more unified framework. Our work contributes to a unified framework linking optimization algorithms with deep layers. Dropout layers are rigorously interpreted in various ways, such as being connected to a balanced 2-regularized loss and approximated with a normal distribution for faster dropout. A framework connecting dropout with approximate variational inference in Bayesian models has also been developed. In our perspective, dropout layers naturally arise in an optimization-driven network design framework. In Section 3.3, fully-connected and convolutional layers are unified as special cases of a high-order tensor product. A generic instance of a tensor setting is proposed, providing a formula for the Lipschitz constant of a finite sum structure. Section 3.4 explores the relation between stochastic solvers and dropout layers. An overview in FIG6 illustrates the connection between a stochastic solver iteration and the forward pass through a network layer with dropout, linear transformation, and non-linear activation. The text discusses the use of tensors in optimization, with a focus on tensors of order four or less. Scalars, vectors, and matrices are denoted differently, and tensors are represented by cursive capital letters. The text discusses high-order tensors up to order four, with a focus on vector tensors denoted as A \u2208 R J1\u00d71\u00d7J3\u00d7J4. It explains inner product notation, Frobenius norm, and linear layers in deep networks with weights and biases. The text discusses optimizing an objective function with a convex function using Prox-GD. The update equation involves a fully-connected layer followed by a non-linearity determined by the choice of g(x). Popular activation functions like ReLU correspond to specific forms of non-linearity. The text explores various activation functions that can be used in the Prox-GD framework, including squared hinge loss and nuclear norm regularization. It also discusses how these activations can be extended to explain dropout layers. The text discusses how specific forms of dropout do not arise from particular objective functions, but from different stochastic optimization algorithms. It introduces key lemmas for a unified treatment of fully-connected and convolutional layers, enabling efficient computation of the Lipschitz constant. The layer can be described as a high-order tensor product where input and output features are stacked into 4th-order tensors. The spatial dimensions of features are denoted by W and H, with a special case for fully-connected layers when W = H = 1. The order of dimensions is crucial, with the first dimension representing independent filters and the second dimension representing input features aggregated after 2D convolutions. The spatial size of filters must match the input activations' dimensions for 2D circular convolutions to work effectively in deep networks. The operator HO performs 2D circular convolutions, which can be equivalent to linear convolutions through zero-padding. Values in B are replicated along spatial dimensions to mimic biases in deep networks. A linear layer is referred to as either fully-connected or convolutional. The tensor quadratic version of F(x) is denoted as F(X). Transposing and rotating filters are part of the aggregation process in A H HO X. The Lipschitz constant L for the finite sum part of a formula is computed using a practical formula involving the maximum eigenvalues of all possible combinations of outer products of frontal slices. This is based on the 2D discrete Fourier transform along the spatial dimensions W and H. If W = H = 1, the formula simplifies to L = \u03bb max AA. The Lipschitz constant for fully-connected layers is recovered by \u03bb max AA. Two propositions are presented, one relating standard Bernoulli dropout to \u03c4 -nice Prox-SG, and the other relating additive dropout to mS2GD. Sampling from a set is defined as a random set-valued mapping with uniform probabilities for subsets of [n 1 ]. Proposition 1 states that Prox-SG with \u03c4-nice sampling on a specific equation exhibits an update equivalent to a forward pass through a BerDropout layer. The detailed proof is provided in the supplement. Trivially reparameterizing the sum, BerDropout p is equivalent to a mask that zeroes out pn1 input activations. Proposition 1 suggests applying dropout to convolutional layers by dropping complete input features from n1 and performing 2D convolutions on the \u03c4-sampled subset, where \u03c4 = (1 \u2212 p)n1. A single iteration of mS2GD BID16 is equivalent to a forward pass through an AddDropout layer followed by a linear layer and a non-linear activation. Various variance-reduced algorithms can be used as replacements for mS2GD, such as S2GD BID16 and SVRG BID12. The question of applying the optimization algorithm for multiple iterations is empirically answered in experiments. In experiments, solvers are embedded as replacements for blocks of layers to improve model accuracy without increasing network parameters. Experiments were conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using variants of LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG16. Stochastic gradient descent with momentum and weight decay was used, with varying learning rates for different epochs. Finetuning involved adjusting the learning rate after 100 epochs. In experiments, solvers are used to replace layers in order to improve model accuracy without increasing network parameters. The step size in Prox-GD is set to 1/L, updated every epoch, and a decaying step size is used in Prox-SG for convergence. A strongly convex function is added to ensure convergence of stochastic solvers, with \u03bb = 10^-3 in all experiments. The network will be stochastic at test time, and average accuracy is reported over 20 trials. In this experiment, training networks with solvers replacing layers can improve accuracy when trained from scratch. Different variants of LeNet on CIFAR-10 dataset with BerDropout layers are considered. The dropout rate is set to p = 0.5, and the layers are replaced with stochastic solvers for 10 iterations. Replacing BerDropout layers with stochastic solvers significantly improves performance in training networks from scratch. The accuracy of different variants of the LeNet architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset consistently increases when using the Prox-SG solver. Replacing the first convolutional layer in AlexNet with the deterministic Prox-GD solver leads to an improvement of \u2248 1.2% on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The results are summarized in Table 3. Replacing the first convolutional layer of AlexNet with the deterministic Prox-GD solver consistently improves test accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Results for VGG16 are shown in Table 4, with comparable performance on CIFAR-10 and a notable increase in accuracy on CIFAR-100. The replacement of the stochastic solver with a deterministic solver further enhances performance on CIFAR-100. In experiments with the VGG16 architecture on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, replacing layers with a deterministic solver led to improved performance. The setting VGG16-Prox-GD performed the best on CIFAR-10 and comparably to VGG16-Prox-SG-ND-D on CIFAR-100. The improvement in performance was consistent across varying dropout rates, showing a tight connection between dropout rate and sampling rate. The experiments involved adapting the AlexNet and VGG16 architectures for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Different dropout rates were tested, and a stochastic solver with a sampling rate \u03c4 was used to finetune the network. The results showed that the stochastic solver provided a more graceful degradation in performance compared to high dropout rates in the baseline network. Replacing common layers in deep networks with stochastic solvers can improve performance without increasing parameters. In experiments with VGG16 on CIFAR-100, a baseline network with BerDropout p had a 56% accuracy reduction at p=0.95, while the stochastic solver only declined by 5%. This approach offers stable training and high accuracy, especially at high dropout rates. Equivalences between layers and stochastic solvers were demonstrated. The relationships between layers in deep networks and stochastic solvers can improve accuracy. This opens doors for future work, such as proposing new types of dropout layers using theory from stochastic optimization literature. For example, a serial importance sampling strategy with Prox-SG can be used to solve BID37, where each function is sampled with a probability proportional to the norm of the gradient. This optimal sampling strategy maximizes the rate of convergence in deep layers. Performing Prox-SG with importance sampling for a single iteration is equivalent to a forward pass through a dropout layer with non-uniform probabilities based on gradient norms. Different dropout types arise with non-serial importance sampling. Empirical demonstrations show replacing network blocks with stochastic solvers improves performance on various datasets and architectures. The presented framework demonstrates that replacing network blocks with stochastic solvers improves model accuracy. The Proximal Operator is defined as a generalized form of Leaky ReLU with a shift of \u03bb and a slope \u03b1. The function g(x) is elementwise separable, convex, and smooth, leading to a closed-form solution. The Proximal Operator is a closed-form solution that approximates the Tanh non-linearity. It is defined as Prox g (a) = arg min DISPLAYFORM0, with a smooth transition for small |x i |. The operator is close to zero for x i << 0 and close to x i for x i >> 0. The activation SoftPlus = log(1 + exp (a)) is well approximated by the function Prox g (a). The optimal solution for the cubic equation is guaranteed to have real and distinct roots. The root minimizing the equation is found to correspond to k = 2, resembling the Tanh activation function. The proximal operator for the Sigmoid activation can be derived similarly. The paper also introduces definitions related to tensors. The paper introduces definitions related to tensors, including the t-product between high-order tensors and operators that unfold tensors into structured matrices or vectors. The operator bdiag maps a tensor to a block diagonal matrix. The tensor unfold of circ HO (.) results in a blockwise diagonal matrix circ HO (D) with dimensions n 3 and n 4 replaced by 2D Discrete Fourier Transforms. This process involves 2D convolutions spatially, aggregation along the feature dimension, and independent filtering. Equation FORMULA1 demonstrates feature aggregation along the n 1 dimension. Lemma 1 is proven by showing that A performs independent 2D convolutions along the i th channel. The 2D-Inverse Fourier Transform with stride of n2 is demonstrated, and Lemma 3 discusses \u03c4 -nice Prox-SG as an unbiased estimator to F(X). The first equality is derived using an indicator function, and the last equality is based on uniformity in \u03c4 -nice S. From Lemma 3, with zero initialization, DISPLAYFORM11 is an unbiased estimator of \u2207F(X) at X=0. The first iteration of \u03c4 -nice Prox-SGD with zero initialization and unit step size is DISPLAYFORM12, reparameterized as DISPLAYFORM13 with a mask tensor M for dropout. This is equivalent to a forward pass through a BerDropout p layer followed by a linear layer and non-linear activation. Performing a randomized coordinate descent on network design is equivalent to a linear transformation followed by BerDropout and a non-linear activation. This permutation of linear transformation and dropout is shown under the special case of fully connected layers. Performing a randomized coordinate descent on network design involves a linear transformation followed by BerDropout and a non-linear activation, shown under the special case of fully connected layers. The process includes unit step sizes along each partial derivative and zero initialization, equivalent to a forward pass through a linear layer with dropout and non-linear activation."
