    "content": "In 1971, Congress established the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) as a self-supporting, wholly governmental entity, replacing the U.S. Post Office Department (USPOD). The Postal Reorganization Act (PRA) made USPS an independent establishment of the executive branch, operating as a marketized government agency covering its costs through revenue from postage sales. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) receives an annual appropriation of approximately $90 million, which is 0.1% of its $65 billion operating budget. This appropriation is provided by Congress to compensate USPS for providing free mailing privileges to blind persons and overseas voters. USPS covers its operational costs from revenues deposited in the Postal Service Fund, not relying on public appropriations. USPS employees are eligible for benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) employees are eligible for benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). USPS retirees may participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Recent deficits have prompted discussions on reforms to USPS operations, including retiree health benefits and pension funding policies costing the agency significant amounts annually. Insufficient funding could have negative ramifications on postal retirees and the public. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is required to prefund its current employees' future retirement benefits since FY2007, as mandated by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA). This policy has become contentious due to USPS's financial losses and missed prepayments. Debates in Congress revolve around abolishing or revising the prefunding requirement to alleviate USPS's costs. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) required USPS to prefund retiree health benefits, with a 50-year payment schedule including 10 years of prefunding payments. This policy aimed to alleviate USPS's costs in the short term by setting aside funds for future retiree health benefits. Between FY2017 and FY2056, USPS will continue making annual payments to the Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHBF) as determined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The OPM calculates the annual payments based on current employees' future retiree healthcare liability and the RHBF balance to settle any outstanding liability by September 30, 2056. The prefunding policy under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) has faced criticism for being unfair to USPS as no other federal agency or private-sector companies follow a similar prefunding approach for retiree health benefits. Prefunding future retiree health benefits by private-sector companies is typically not fully funded, causing financial harm to USPS. Arguments for prefunding include creating a more accurate financial depiction and ensuring current postage ratepayers cover the full costs of services. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) requires the USPS to prefund future retiree health benefits to ensure compensation security for current employees and protect taxpayers from potential bailouts. However, USPS has struggled to meet the payment schedule, leading to actuarial disputes over the size of future benefits. The USPS has faced actuarial disputes over the size of future retiree health benefits liability and the practicality of the payment schedule. Between FY2007 and FY2012, USPS's financial condition deteriorated significantly, with a 25.1% decline in mail volume and a 12.8% drop in revenue. The agency's debt also increased from $4.2 billion to $15 billion. Despite the requirement to pay over $5 billion annually through FY2017, USPS has struggled to make these payments due to cash flow issues. The USPS has faced financial difficulties in meeting the RHBF payment schedule since FY2009 when Congress reduced the payment owed. Despite defaulting on payments in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013, USPS has an unfunded retiree health benefits liability of $47.9 billion. The estimation of healthcare costs involves making assumptions that could significantly impact the liability amount. The USPS's unfunded retiree health benefits liability could range from $35 billion to $63 billion for September 30, 2012, and from $34 billion to $60 billion for 2011. The size of this obligation affects USPS's financial results as it is expected to pay these obligations to retirees. Studies suggest that USPS's future retirees' health benefits obligation may be lower than estimated by OPM, with potential yearly outlays of $1.6 billion to $3.2 billion between FY2007 and FY2016. The USPS paid $1.6 billion to $3.2 billion per year between FY2007 and FY2016 for retiree healthcare. Differences in estimates were due to varying assumptions. Bills in the 113th Congress aimed to change the RHBF policy, proposing to eliminate or modify the payment schedule. In 2013, H.R. 2690 and H.R. 2748 proposed new payment schedules for USPS's Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHBF), with no payments until 2016 and amortization of total liability between 2016 and 2053 or 2056. The bills also aimed to reduce USPS's funding requirement to 80% from 100%. The proposed bill, S. 1486, aimed to reduce USPS's long-term retiree health benefits costs by moving retirees onto Medicare and creating a new health insurance program for employees. It also sought to lower USPS's prefunding costs by requiring 80% funding of total liability instead of 100%. Policy debates have focused on cost allocation between USPS and the federal government for retirement benefits and the issue of potential overpayments by USPS for FERS employees. The Postal Reorganization Act (PRA) in 1971 created a situation where some USPS employees had service under both the old USPOD and the newly created USPS. The responsibility for funding CSRS benefits for these employees was not clearly assigned between USPS and the federal government. Amendments to current law would be needed to refund any payments to USPS for CSRS benefits. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1971 created a situation where USPS employees had service under both USPOD and USPS. P.L. 93-349 in 1974 transferred responsibility for CSRS retirement benefits costs to USPS for pay increases after July 1, 1971. The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-18) made USPS liable for all CSRS benefits post-1971. PAEA in 2006 (P.L. 109-435) changed OPM's methodology for determining USPS funding surplus or liability for CSRS benefits. OPM now calculates pay and benefits separately for USPOD and USPS service, with the federal government responsible for the former and USPS for the latter. The CSRS benefits for USPS employees with service under both USPOD and USPS are financed by the federal government and USPS based on different pay measures. USPS may finance a larger portion of the benefit cost due to pay increases after 1971. OPM's method of allocating costs for these employees has been questioned by oversight agencies. The allocation of CSRS pension costs for employees with service under both USPOD and USPS is a topic of debate. Reports suggest that the federal government should fund one-half of the CSRS annuity, with USPS funding the other half. Additionally, using final high-three pay instead of 1971 salary to calculate the federal government's portion of CSRS benefits could shift the cost from USPS to the federal government. The federal government and USPS share funding for CSRS pension costs based on service years and benefit accrual percentages. Recent analyses show that the allocation of costs remains unchanged despite legislative reforms. The U.S. Government Accountability Office confirmed OPM's compliance with calculating retirement costs as required by P.L. 93-349. The 2003 and 2006 Acts did not change the fundamental allocation made by the 1974 Act for pre-1971 service. OPM's current methodology for allocating costs for USPS CSRS employees remains consistent with law. Any reallocation of costs would require changes to legislation and could increase the unfunded liability of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The reallocation of CSRS costs would lead to an increase in CSRS pension expenses funded by the U.S. Treasury. FERS, covering most civilian federal workers, must be fully funded according to law. Agencies and USPS contribute to FERS at a rate equal to the dynamic normal cost minus required employee contributions. USPS overpaid agency contributions for FERS employees due to workforce composition differences. OPMOIG and GAO agree on the overpayment, requiring a statute for refund authorization. OPM uses uniform demographic assumptions for FERS employees' dynamic normal costs. The Postal Service overpaid FERS contributions by $2.6 billion as of September 30, 2011, with a projected surplus of $3.0 billion by September 30, 2012. OPM's uniform demographic assumptions for FERS employees led to the overpayment, requiring a statute for refund authorization. The USPS Office of Inspector General (USPSOIG) reported that using Postal Service specific demographic assumptions for calculating FERS liability would result in a significantly larger overpayment amount. This would lead to a $12.5 billion overpayment for FY2012, $9.5 billion more than the surplus estimated by OPM using government-wide averages. USPS-specific demographics such as smaller pay increases, condensed pay scale, and higher rates of in-service mortality contribute to this overpayment. The USPS faced challenges such as service withdrawal, early retirement, and higher rates of mortality and disability retirement. Congress considered legislative proposals to address USPS pension funding issues, including changing cost allocation for CSRS benefits, refunding FERS overpayment, altering FERS benefits calculation, and providing non-FERS coverage for new employees. Examples of these proposals are outlined in Table 2. The Postal Service Protection Act of 2013 proposed changes to the allocation of costs for CSRS benefits, refunding FERS overpayments, and transferring surplus to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefit Fund. Other bills also aimed to refund USPS FERS overpayments for specific fiscal years. The Postal Reform Acts of 2013 aimed to refund USPS FERS overpayments in fiscal years with surpluses, with variations in how the refunds were calculated and allocated. The bills also required OPM to calculate dynamic normal costs of USPS FERS benefits separately for USPS employees, using specific demographic and economic assumptions. The Postal Reform Act of 2013 aimed to grant USPS authority to negotiate retirement benefits for new employees through collective bargaining, allowing for new retirement benefit plans separate from FERS."
