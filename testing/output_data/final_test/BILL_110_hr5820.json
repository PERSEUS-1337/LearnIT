    "content": "The Act titled \"Traditional Use Protection Act of 2008\" supports the traditional use of lands. The Chief of the Forest Service will award grants to States for acquiring land rights for traditional use and making subgrants to entities for the same purpose. States must use the funds to acquire land rights in perpetuity and make subgrants to entities. The Chief of the Forest Service awards grants to States and entities to acquire land rights in perpetuity for traditional use. States must purchase land from willing sellers and cannot use eminent domain. Land acquired must be made available to the public for appropriate traditional use. To be considered for a grant under this section, a State must demonstrate commitment to stewardship of land for traditional and recreational use, maintain a landowner relations program, submit a comprehensive State plan, and provide required information. The grant amount cannot exceed 75 percent of the total cost of land rights acquired. The Chief must publish grant criteria within 60 days of the Act's enactment. A report on the grant program must be submitted to Congress annually. Definitions include the Chief as the Forest Service Chief and a comprehensive state plan as a plan developed by the State for land conservation and recreational access. The State develops a comprehensive plan involving public and private sectors, including landowners, to create partnerships for traditional recreational opportunities. A landowner relations program engages private landowners to facilitate public access and address concerns about access to private land. The (C) clearinghouse provides information on land use rules, regulations, certifications, and procedures. The term \"traditional use\" includes activities like hunting, fishing, motorized recreation, hiking, and bird watching, but excludes residential or commercial development. Authorization of appropriations is set at $50,000,000 annually from 2009 to 2013 for the Chief to implement the Act."
