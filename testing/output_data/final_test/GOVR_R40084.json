    "content": "The United States and Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) in 1991, which included Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia. The Treaty expired in 2009, and discussions were held to consider extending it for five more years. The START Treaty between the United States and Soviet Union expired in 2009, leading to discussions on extending it. The Obama Administration resumed talks in 2009 and signed the New START Treaty in 2010, aiming for deeper reductions in nuclear weapons. The original START Treaty from 1984 to 1991 imposed restrictions on warheads and delivery vehicles, reflecting the competitive relationship between the two countries. Some officials and analysts questioned the importance of the START Treaty and U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control in the current political relationship between the United States and Russia. Critics suggested that the bilateral arms control process should fade away after START expired. Some officials and analysts question the relevance of the START Treaty and U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control. Critics suggest that the treaty may have served its purpose in reducing Russian arsenal size but argue for maintaining U.S. freedom in deploying nuclear forces. Others believe that arms control remains important for the U.S.-Russian relationship and advocate for a new treaty to replace START. The START Treaty's restrictions on Russian and U.S. nuclear forces can enhance security and trust between the two nations. Some in Russia feel threatened by U.S. nuclear weapons and value the restraints provided by arms control treaties. Senator Richard Lugar believes that failing to renew START could increase distrust between the two sides. Some believe that not renewing the START Treaty could weaken international nuclear nonproliferation efforts. However, rushing to complete a new treaty may compromise U.S. security. Congress has limited influence on the treaty process, but can offer its views through resolutions and consultations. The START Treaty limits long-range nuclear-capable delivery systems in the US and former Soviet Union. Each side can deploy 6,000 warheads on no more than 1,600 ballistic missiles and heavy bombers. Congress can offer its views on the treaty through resolutions and consultations. The START Treaty limits long-range nuclear-capable delivery systems in the US and former Soviet Union, with specific limits on ballistic missile warheads. The United States sought to limit the Soviet monopoly on heavy ICBMs to prevent them from exceeding warhead limits. The Soviet Union eventually agreed to halve their force of 304 SS-18 ICBMs under START. The United States grew concerned about Soviet deployment of ballistic missiles on mobile launchers during START negotiations in the 1980s. The Soviet Union deployed single-warhead SS-25 missiles on road-mobile launchers and 10-warhead SS-24 missiles on rail-mobile launchers, posing a military and arms control problem for the US. The US believed it would be difficult to track and target these mobile missiles during a conflict, making it challenging to monitor compliance with START limits. During START negotiations, the United States proposed banning mobile ICBMs but later agreed with the Soviet Union to limit these systems instead. Various monitoring and verification measures were put in place to track the numbers of mobile ICBMs, including location restrictions, notifications prior to movement, data exchanges, and continuous monitoring. The US eventually abandoned plans to deploy mobile ICBMs. The START Treaty imposed limits on mobile ICBMs and restricted the Peacekeeper (MX) missiles deployed in silos. It also set a limit on the total throwweight of ballistic missiles, preventing the Soviet Union from adding more warheads. The START Treaty imposed limits on mobile ICBMs and restricted the Peacekeeper (MX) missiles deployed in silos. It also set a limit on the total throwweight of ballistic missiles. START counts each deployed ICBM, SLBM, and heavy bomber as a single delivery vehicle under the Treaty limit of 1,600 delivery vehicles, regardless of warhead type. Launchers or bombers must be eliminated according to the Treaty's procedures to no longer count towards the limit. The START Treaty imposes limits on weapons, including mobile ICBMs and Peacekeeper missiles. An empty missile launcher still counts towards the limit, even if deactivated. The number of warheads attributed to each missile is listed in a database, based on the maximum number it could carry when the treaty entered into force. Some missiles, like the U.S. Trident II (D-5), have fewer attributed warheads than their maximum capacity. The START Treaty counts delivery vehicles and attributes warheads based on type, as monitoring actual warhead numbers is difficult. Heavy bombers have limited warheads under the treaty, with some counting as only one warhead despite being able to carry more. The START Treaty allows bombers to carry fewer warheads than their maximum capacity. U.S. bombers can carry up to 20 ALCMs but only count as 10 warheads, while Russian bombers can carry up to 16 ALCMs but only count as 8 warheads. The Treaty allows for reducing the number of warheads attributed to a missile through a process called \"downloading.\" Each party can reduce the number of warheads carried on a missile, and if it decreases by more than two warheads, the platform must be replaced. This process helps both countries stay within the limit of 6,000 warheads. The START Treaty allows countries to spread their ballistic missile warheads among a greater number of missiles through a process called \"downloading.\" Short-notice on-site inspections are used to confirm compliance with the number of warheads deployed on each missile. The number of warheads attributed to a missile type in the data base cannot be exceeded, unless the missile is altered to meet the definition of a \"new type.\" START bans new types of heavy ICBMs and contains a definition for distinguishing modified versions of existing missiles. During the START negotiations, parties debated the definition of a \"new type\" missile, with concerns about potential backfitting of existing missiles with more warheads. START treaty includes detailed definitions of limited items and activities. The START Treaty mandates parties to exchange detailed data on treaty-limited items and locate strategic forces at declared facilities. It outlines procedures for notifications, movement of items, and elimination of weapons to minimize disputes and ambiguity, forming the foundation for the verification regime. Verification is crucial in assessing compliance with arms control agreements. Treaty language defines limits and obligations, guiding countries in identifying compliant forces and activities. While no regime can detect all violations, the START regime aims to ensure high probability of detecting significant breaches. The parties to a treaty use various means to monitor each other's forces and activities, including exchanging data, displaying treaty-limited items, and on-site inspections. They analyze and refine collected information to evaluate compliance with treaty obligations, such as monitoring the numbers and locations of ballistic missiles and launchers. The START treaty requires both countries to monitor the numbers and locations of ballistic missiles, launchers, and heavy bombers deployed by each other. This includes establishing the number and location of weapons when the treaty entered into force, confirming technical characteristics, adding or subtracting deployed weapons, tracking movement of treaty-limited items, monitoring armament on permitted systems, and observing ballistic missile flight tests. The START treaty includes a verification regime using satellites and remote sensing equipment to monitor ballistic missile flight tests and ensure compliance with treaty limits. Specific verification provisions such as data exchanges and on-site inspections help gather necessary information. The START treaty includes on-site inspections to gather detailed information about forces and activities limited by the Treaty. The Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission (JCIC) was established for discussing treaty implementation and compliance issues. Verification measures in START allow countries' National Technical Means (NTM) to access information about each other's treaty-limited forces, including a ban on interference with NTM and a requirement to broadcast telemetry data openly. START also prohibits efforts to conceal forces and activities from NTM. The START treaty bans efforts to conceal forces and activities from National Technical Means (NTM) and mandates displaying treaty limited items under certain circumstances for NTM confirmation. The ban on data denial during missile flight tests was crucial for the United States, as nations transmit telemetry data during tests to gain information about missile characteristics. The START treaty requires the exchange of detailed information on treaty-limited ballistic missiles and heavy bombers to monitor compliance. This includes sharing data from flight tests and notifying each other of movements of limited weapons. Under the START treaty, the United States and Russia exchange information on treaty-limited weapons and conduct on-site inspections to verify compliance. Inspections provide additional details to information collected through other means and make it difficult for countries to hide violations at declared facilities. Under the START Treaty, inspections are conducted at declared facilities to confirm information about ballistic missiles and heavy bombers. Inspectors use detailed procedures to verify the number of systems and treaty-limited items, such as warheads on missiles. Permanent monitoring systems are also established around final assembly facilities for mobile ICBMs to track their entry into service. The START Treaty outlines procedures for inspections at declared facilities to verify information about ballistic missiles and heavy bombers. These procedures cover airports for inspectors, notice requirements, transportation to inspection sites, equipment usage, inspection duration, and conflict resolution. While designed to minimize conflicts, questions about procedures can still arise. Overall, the START inspection process has had few significant problems over the years. Each verification provision in START provides parties with essential information. The START Treaty's verification provisions aim to provide parties with crucial information about each other's forces and activities to deter violations and increase confidence in compliance. Inspections and data exchanges help confirm expected information and detect inconsistencies that could indicate attempts to hide or evade treaty limits. This system has allowed parties to collect valuable information over time. The START Treaty's verification provisions allow parties to collect information that enhances their understanding of each other's forces. The number of accountable warheads and delivery vehicles for the United States and Soviet forces has significantly decreased since September 1990. In 1995, all nuclear weapons were removed from Ukraine by June 1996, and SS-25 mobile ICBMs were transferred from Belarus to Russia by late November 1996. Ukraine eliminated ICBM silos and heavy bombers on its territory. The United States and Russia had few compliance disputes under the START Treaty. In 2001, the Bush Administration conducted a Nuclear Posture Review to reduce U.S. strategic forces to 1,700-2,200 deployed nuclear warheads. In 2001, President Bush announced plans to reduce U.S. nuclear warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 without a formal arms control agreement. Secretary of State Colin Powell supported a legally binding arms control agreement, leading to the signing of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia. The United States and Russia signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (Moscow Treaty) on May 24, 2002, with Senate approval on March 6, 2003, and Russian parliament approval on May 14, 2003. The treaty aimed to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700-2,200 by December 31, 2012, without a clear definition of \"strategic nuclear warheads.\" Each country uses its own counting method based on statements by Presidents Bush and Putin in 2001. The Moscow Treaty signed by the United States and Russia in 2002 aimed to reduce strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700-2,200 by 2012. Each country uses its own counting method, and the Treaty does not limit delivery vehicles or specify types of weapons systems. Monitoring and verification provisions are also absent in the Treaty. The Bush Administration assured the Senate that there would be time to negotiate a new treaty or extend monitoring provisions before START expired, but this did not happen. Analysts and Members of Congress argued for extending monitoring provisions through the end of the Moscow Treaty. In 2006, a new strategic security dialogue was initiated between the U.S. and Russia, with START included but not a priority on the agenda. Russia and the United States outlined their goals for talks regarding a new formal treaty similar in size and complexity to START. Russia proposed establishing a working group for this new Treaty, but the US preferred broader \"strategic discussions\" without a formal agreement. The Bush Administration believed arms control agreements were no longer necessary to manage the strategic relationship with Russia. Russia and the United States discussed a new Treaty to follow START, with Russia proposing a legally binding agreement including monitoring and verification provisions, while the US preferred transparency and confidence-building measures. The two sides held meetings to explore these options. Despite initial rejection by Secretary of State Joseph, the United States and Russia engaged in a series of meetings to discuss a possible monitoring and verification agreement. Disagreements persisted over whether the measures should be voluntary or legally binding, and if they should be part of a formal treaty limiting deployed warheads. High-level meetings, including one between Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in July 2007, emphasized the intention to reduce strategic offensive capabilities to the lowest possible level. The United States and Russia discussed developing a post-START arrangement for strategic offensive reductions, with the U.S. initially hesitant to pursue a formal Treaty. However, in 2007, there was a shift in the U.S. position towards accepting a binding agreement preserving some aspects of START, although still rejecting a formal treaty limiting nuclear weapons. In 2008, Secretary Rice argued against highly articulated limitations on nuclear weapons with Russia, but they failed to reach an agreement. Despite signing a Strategic Framework for reductions, the U.S. and Russia couldn't agree on the way forward in their arms control relationship. Russia wanted a Treaty based on the START framework, while the U.S. was hesitant. In 2008, negotiations between the United States and Russia for a new Treaty based on the START framework were ongoing. The talks were described as irregular and unproductive, with both sides having differing preferences for the agreement. Russia insisted on a formal Treaty with detailed definitions and counting rules, while the United States favored a less formal agreement focusing on transparency and confidence-building measures. Despite the disagreements, both countries recognized the importance of the talks and continued them through September and October. In October 2008, Russia rejected a proposal for an informal transparency regime attached to a legally binding Treaty, emphasizing the need for a new Russian-American agreement on nuclear disarmament to replace START. President Dmitry Medvedev highlighted the importance of a treaty over a declaration, referencing the format of the Moscow Treaty. In November 2008, the JCIC meeting with representatives from several countries discussed extending the START Treaty. No agreements were reached, leaving options open for the Obama Administration. The U.S. and Russia had further discussions on arms control but failed to reach agreements. Talks resumed under the Obama Administration, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov aiming to reach an agreement in early 2009. In Geneva, Minister Sergey Lavrov and officials from the US agreed to replace the START Treaty by the end of 2009. They planned to develop a specific set of objectives and responsibilities to present to the presidents before their meeting in April. Obama and Medvedev endorsed the negotiations in London, aiming to reach an agreement by the end of 2009. They instructed negotiators to start talks immediately and report results before meeting again in July. The new agreement would focus on reducing and limiting strategic offensive arms, enhancing mutual security. The 2002 Moscow Treaty was being replaced by a new agreement to enhance security and stability in strategic offensive forces. Negotiations began in April 2009 between Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller and Anatoly Antonov from the Russian Foreign Ministry. The talks progressed well, with nine rounds of negotiations leading to a framework for review by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in July 2009. In July 2009, Presidents Obama and Medvedev signed a Joint Understanding for the START follow-on Treaty, outlining numerical limits for strategic delivery vehicles and warheads. Negotiations progressed with rounds of talks in July, August, September, and October, leading to the eighth round in Geneva in mid-November 2009. General James Jones also traveled in late October as part of the negotiations. In late October, General James Jones, President Obama's national security advisor, traveled to Moscow with new proposals to resolve outstanding issues in discussions with Russia regarding the START Treaty. Russia responded with a counterproposal, and both sides made progress on some issues. The START Treaty expired on December 5, 2009, but Presidents Obama and Medvedev expressed their commitment to continue working together in the spirit of the treaty and to ensure a new treaty on strategic arms enters into force soon. In January 2010, Admiral Mullen and General Jones traveled to Moscow to resolve issues in negotiations for a new treaty. They reached compromises on verification issues, including telemetry during missile tests. The negotiating teams were close to finalizing an agreement in the ninth round of talks, working on technical details and translating prior agreements. In February 2010, negotiators worked on final technical details and translating prior agreements for a new treaty. Russia raised concerns about offensive and defensive weapons, causing a delay. Talks resumed on March 9, with remaining differences resolved a few weeks later. On March 24, both US and Russia confirmed the agreement, leading to a phone call between Presidents Obama and Medvedev on March 26 to meet in Prague on April 8, 2010. Both the United States and Russia agreed to meet in Prague on April 8, 2010 to discuss the extension of the START Treaty. Both parties were hesitant to continue with the original treaty due to the costly and complicated monitoring and verification provisions. President Putin proposed negotiations for a new Treaty to replace START in 2006. Russia has consistently proposed replacing START with a new treaty that would reduce strategic offensive forces to 1,500 warheads and count warheads on all deployed delivery vehicles. The new treaty should maintain predictability and stability, while relaxing or eliminating provisions on new types of ballistic missiles from START. Russia has developed the RS-24 missile, a new variant of its single-warhead SS-27 missile, with plans to deploy it with three warheads on each missile. This missile does not meet the Treaty's \"new types\" definition under START, limiting it to a single warhead. The missile had its third successful test launch in late November 2008, and Russia planned to deploy it in December 2009 after START expires. Russian officials view this missile as critical to their strategic forces due to its ability to carry up to three warheads. Russia's RS-24 missile, a new variant of the SS-27 missile, can carry up to three warheads and is crucial for Russia's strategic forces. The new Treaty aims to limit deployed delivery vehicles and warheads, recognizing Russia's declining arsenal. This lower limit would align the United States with Russia's reduced numbers of delivery vehicles. Russia may propose limiting delivery vehicles and counting all warheads on these vehicles with START-type rules to restrict the U.S. from quickly adding warheads. They may also suggest replacing platforms on all downloaded missiles and retaining some monitoring provisions from START, but making them less costly and cumbersome. This could involve reducing short-notice inspections and replacing them with informal visits. Russia is proposing changes to the new START Treaty, including reducing mandatory notifications, replacing inspections with informal visits, and excluding certain monitoring systems. They argue that the current provisions are one-sided and want to ease restrictions on mobile ICBMs. The United States has also ceased operations at a facility in Russia as START expired. The United States has never been affected by restrictions on mobile ICBMs under START as it never deployed them. These provisions complicate hiding extra missiles within legal deployments but also add to operating costs. The US suggested retaining some restrictions, while Russia argued they are unfair and destabilizing. Russia is pushing for relaxed requirements in the new treaty regarding the exchange of data from missile flight tests, known as telemetry. They believe the provision is intrusive and one-sided, as the United States is no longer developing new types of missiles. This disagreement is one of the final issues to be resolved before completing the new treaty. Russia is pushing for relaxed requirements in the new treaty regarding missile telemetry data exchange, citing the United States' lack of new missile development. This disagreement is a key issue in finalizing the treaty, with Russia linking limits on offensive nuclear forces to ballistic missile defenses. The U.S. and Russia had differing views on extending START's monitoring provisions during talks that began in 2006. U.S. officials argue that the START inspections regime has become costly and unnecessary, suggesting a more informal system for military cooperation with Russia. Some believe the START regime still provides valuable information and builds confidence between the two sides. The U.S. intelligence community argues that without START's monitoring provisions, assessing Russia's compliance with the Moscow Treaty will be challenging. Concerns have been raised about how extending these provisions could impact future plans, such as deploying conventional warheads on ballistic missiles. This has been a major point of contention in U.S.-Russian discussions on a new treaty. Russia insists on counting deployable warheads in the new treaty. Russia has insisted on counting deployable warheads in the new treaty to limit the U.S. ability to convert missiles back to nuclear warheads. The question of how to count strategic delivery vehicles with conventional warheads remains unresolved in negotiations. Russia has agreed to exclude U.S. submarines converted to carry conventional cruise missiles. The U.S. has concerns about some monitoring and verification provisions in the START treaty, such as Russian requests for re-entry vehicle inspections on U.S. ballistic missile submarines. The treaty's limits on warhead removal from Trident submarines could also impact future deployment plans. The United States has proposed changes to the new Treaty to only count deployed warheads on missiles, rather than equal allocations. Concerns have been raised about START's telemetry data exchange requirements during missile tests, which could impact U.S. military plans. The U.S. uses old ballistic missiles as target vehicles in missile defense tests, but must provide Russia with telemetry data from these flights. The Bush Administration proposed replacing START with a shorter, legally binding Treaty similar to the Moscow Treaty, along with a non-binding appendix on transparency and cooperation. This new transparency regime would have been less detailed and complex than START, allowing for informal visits and potentially relaxing telemetry provisions during missile defense tests. The United States was willing to abandon monitoring Russian missile production at Votkinsk due to the Moscow Treaty not counting deployed delivery vehicles. Under the Moscow Treaty, deployed warheads were not counted, and limits on warheads attributed to mobile ICBMs were no longer imposed. Analysts questioned the decision to exclude Votkinsk from a future treaty as START expiration approached. The United States is considering excluding Votkinsk from a future treaty as START expiration approaches. Some argue that this could hinder verification of Russian compliance, while others believe alternative monitoring mechanisms can compensate for the loss. The Obama Administration supported a new treaty limiting warheads and delivery vehicles, with a less rigorous verification regime. The Obama Administration supported a new treaty limiting warheads and delivery vehicles with a less rigorous verification regime. The Treaty will address Russia's concerns about strategic systems armed with conventional warheads and will focus on strategic offensive weapons. It will not limit U.S. plans for ballistic missile defenses. The statement signed by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in April 2009 indicates that this Treaty is the first step in an ongoing process to reduce nuclear weapons. Limits on nonstrategic and non-deployed weapons will be addressed in a subsequent treaty. The new START Treaty will limit each side to between 500 and 1,100 delivery vehicles, with Russia suggesting 500 and the US suggesting 1,100. These numbers are based on each side's expected deployment of delivery vehicles in the absence of arms control limits. Russia currently has 809 strategic delivery vehicles, but may reduce to 500 in the next 5 to 10 years. The United States has 1,188 delivery vehicles under the START Treaty, including some that no longer carry nuclear warheads but still count towards the limit. The United States currently has around 800 operationally deployed delivery vehicles, with the possibility of accepting a lower limit proposed by Russia. Some analysts criticize the U.S. for agreeing to reduce its delivery vehicles, arguing that it gives Russia an advantage. However, it is expected that a compromise will be reached in the negotiations to address both sides' concerns. The new START Treaty proposed a compromise to limit each side to a combined total of 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. It also included a separate limit of 700 deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs, and deployed heavy bombers. The details of which systems would count as deployed and nondeployed were not specified in the fact sheet released by the White House. The new START Treaty proposed limits on deployed and nondeployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. The treaty aims to reduce forces to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads, with a specific limit of 1,550 warheads per side. The definitions of deployed and nondeployed systems will be clarified in the treaty text. The new START Treaty will count each deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments as one warhead towards the 1,550 limit, going further than previous treaties in discounting bomber weapons. The treaty will not use the START counting rules for ICBMs and SLBMs. The new treaty may involve a hybrid solution where parties declare the number of warheads deployed on each type of missile, allowing for on-site inspections to confirm compliance. This approach addresses concerns about the U.S. nuclear arsenal size and shape, while ensuring transparency and verification of warhead numbers. The Moscow Treaty and START have differences in counting rules for warheads. The United States declared 2,126 operationally deployed strategic warheads under the Moscow Treaty, but stated 5,916 warheads under START data exchange with Russia in July 2009. This discrepancy is due to strategic delivery vehicles counted under START rules, even if they were no longer equipped to carry nuclear weapons. The United States has \"phantom\" launchers that could be eliminated with accounting changes, such as excluding certain missile silos and warheads attributed to them. Changes in definitions and monitoring could also exclude warheads deployed on converted Trident submarines. The U.S. Navy has converted submarines to carry non-nuclear cruise missiles, but this alone won't reduce warhead totals to desired levels. Further reductions from the Moscow Treaty's 2,168 warheads count may involve changing counting rules for Trident missiles, Minuteman ICBMs, or eliminating deployed launchers. The United States may consider converting some bombers to conventional roles and excluding them from treaty limits. It could be challenging to reduce the Minuteman ICBM and Trident submarine fleets, but the treaty may allow for excluding some systems if they are not deployed. Experts believe Trident submarines will be crucial for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The Trident submarines are crucial for the U.S. nuclear arsenal, but deep reductions in warheads may require cutting the number of submarines. If the fleet is reduced to 10 or fewer submarines, operational changes may be needed, impacting missions and targets. The President and military would need to consider implications before accepting arms control limits. The new Treaty between the United States and Russia includes a verification regime with on-site inspections, data exchanges, and provisions for treaty monitoring. There was disagreement on whether telemetry from missile flight tests should be shared. The new Treaty between the United States and Russia includes a verification regime with on-site inspections, data exchanges, and provisions for treaty monitoring. Russia disagreed on sharing telemetry from missile flight tests, viewing it as unnecessary and unfair. Secretary of Defense Gates stated that telemetry is not needed for monitoring compliance with the treaty, as it was under the previous START treaty. The new START treaty does not limit ballistic missile throwweight or refer to the maximum number of warheads tested on a missile, so telemetry is no longer needed for verification. The new Treaty between the United States and Russia includes a verification regime with on-site inspections, data exchanges, and provisions for treaty monitoring. Secretary Gates stated that telemetry is no longer needed for monitoring compliance with the treaty, as it was under the previous START treaty. The United States and Russia have agreed to exchange telemetry information on up to five missile launches a year to provide transparency and build trust. The new treaty between the United States and Russia includes a provision on the interrelationship of strategic offensive and defensive arms. Russian officials have stated that further reductions on offensive forces are contingent on addressing this link. Speculation arose that the US may need to abandon its missile defense plans in Europe to reach an agreement on offensive weapons, which some argue would be detrimental to US security. However, others note that a statement on the relationship between offensive and defensive weapons does not necessarily limit US missile defense programs. In a briefing before the Moscow summit, Michael McFaul stated that the US won't trade anything with Russia on missile defense. The Obama Administration changed plans for missile defense in Europe by deploying more sea-based interceptors and radars. This system would address the existing threat from Iran. The Obama Administration changed plans for missile defense in Europe to address the threat from Iran. This decision was based on an assessment of the Iranian missile threat and a commitment to deploy proven, cost-effective technology adaptable to evolving security needs. The change was not aimed at addressing Russia's concerns or influencing negotiations for a START follow-on treaty. In December 2009, Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, expressed concerns that the U.S. missile defense system could disrupt the balance of power and lead to increased aggressiveness. He suggested that Russia may need to deploy more offensive weapons to counter this imbalance. Analysts have debated the reasons behind Putin's comments, with some suggesting he was trying to influence the new START Treaty negotiations by linking reductions in offensive weapons to limits on missile defenses. In February 2010, Russia raised concerns that U.S. missile defense interceptors near its territory could undermine its nuclear deterrent. Despite this, President Obama stated that the U.S. would not accept limits on its missile defense programs and was prepared to walk away from negotiations to protect them. Russia raised concerns about U.S. missile defense programs and threatened to withdraw from the treaty if it felt its national interests were threatened. This would not impact U.S. missile defense plans. The link between offensive and defensive weapons is crucial for Russia's national security. Some argue that a statement on missile defense could hinder U.S. plans, while others point to a similar Soviet statement when signing START in 1991. When the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, Russia continued participating in negotiations on the 2002 Moscow Treaty. The Obama Administration reassured that the new START treaty would not limit US missile defense programs. The preamble of the treaty mentions the relationship between strategic defensive and offensive arms but does not impose any specific limits. The legally binding treaty document does not specify limits on missile defense programs. Russia reserves the right to withdraw if it perceives U.S. missile defense plans as a threat. The U.S. plans to continue developing missile defenses without threatening Russian security. Senator Richard Lugar views these statements as editorial opinions. The U.S. maintains its position that the treaty will not limit missile defenses, while Russia had to back away from insisting on limits. In a recent report, Russia had to back away from its insistence on limits on missile defenses during negotiations with the U.S. The new START Treaty includes a provision addressing Russia's concerns about the deployment of conventional warheads on ballistic missiles. This provision aims to maintain strategic stability between the two countries. Some analysts have raised concerns about the potential misinterpretation of missile launches, the possibility of using missiles to destroy strategic targets, and the risk of exceeding treaty limits by replacing conventional warheads with nuclear warheads. Russian officials argue that these missiles could upset strategic stability and should be restricted by a new START Treaty, while some in the United States see them as a way to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons. Some analysts fear that including provisions on nuclear weapons in the Joint Understanding could lead to limits on US conventional capabilities in a nuclear arms control agreement. The US has agreed to count ICBMs and SLBMs with conventional warheads against treaty limits in New START, requiring trade-offs between conventional and nuclear weapons. Ambassador Linton Brooks believes this trade-off would not be burdensome as the US plans to deploy only a small number of ballistic missiles with conventional warheads. Deploying small numbers of these weapons would not specifically limit conventional weapons. The United States plans to deploy small numbers of conventional long-range strike weapons under the New START Treaty, which will not count towards the treaty's limits on warheads. The treaty allows for the development of a conventional global strike capability without constraints on current or planned US long-range conventional strike capabilities. The United States and Russia are negotiating a new START Treaty after the previous one expired in 2009. The negotiations were delayed due to the need to build expert teams. The goal now is to complete the negotiations soon after the expiration and seek ratification in 2010. Many analysts support the process to strengthen U.S. national security, while others have questioned its necessity. The discussion surrounding the new START Treaty negotiations between the United States and Russia focuses on whether rushing to complete it before the expiration of the previous treaty is necessary. Some argue that concessions made in haste may not serve U.S. national security interests, while others suggest that the existing verification regime could have been maintained by extending the current treaty. The broader debate also considers whether arms control can help improve the political relationship between the two nations. The U.S.-Russian relationship has evolved to the point where some believe arms control is no longer necessary as a symbol of cooperation on security issues. However, others argue that START and arms control are still crucial for trust and the broader international nonproliferation goals. Some argue that START can strengthen nonproliferation efforts, while others believe nations seeking nuclear weapons are not influenced by US and Russia's actions. Analysts suggest that in the current security environment, detailed nuclear force structures are no longer necessary. Both the United States and Russia have reduced their nuclear forces in recent years, leading to a decreased need for formal treaties to maintain balance. Analysts argue that concessions in treaties may not be necessary as Russia's force is expected to decline due to retiring aging systems. The stability and predictability offered by arms control agreements are still valued by many in the United States. Some believe arms control agreements provide stability and predictability, outweighing limitations on U.S. flexibility. Implementation involves communication and cooperation to reduce nuclear forces and dangers. Detailed provisions in treaties like START aim to restrain and reduce nuclear forces, with monitoring and verification for confidence in achieving goals. Russia values arms control measures that restrain U.S. forces for stability and predictability, despite recognizing a less tense relationship with the U.S. A confidence-building regime could replace START to ensure transparency and cooperation between the two nations. A confidence-building regime could foster cooperation between the United States and Russia, promoting transparency and trust even without a formal arms control agreement. Efforts to reduce nuclear dangers through nonproliferation programs and informal visits to weapons facilities can further enhance security. Some argue that the formal monitoring and verification provisions in START can hinder cooperation due to rigid requirements. Analysts hoped START would lead to a comprehensive agreement for deeper reductions and monitoring. This could demonstrate leadership before the 2010 NPT Review Conference. In the months before the 2010 NPT Review Conference, an interim agreement with lesser reductions could still advance the arms control agenda by highlighting commitment to pursue further reductions in the future. Presidents Obama and Medvedev pledged to achieve new reductions in a step-by-step process. Some suggest a shorter, less detailed document like the Moscow Treaty could have been easier to complete before START expired, demonstrating intent to reduce nuclear arms. This approach allows flexibility for both sides to alter their forces as needed. The negotiations for a new arms control agreement could proceed more quickly than previous treaties like START. The history of U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations shows a trend of including limits on various types of weapons, including non-strategic nuclear weapons. Analysts suggest that these limits are necessary and inevitable in future agreements. The negotiations for a new arms control agreement could proceed more quickly than previous treaties like START. Analysts suggest that limits on various types of weapons, including non-strategic nuclear weapons, are necessary and inevitable in future agreements. The linkage between progress in discussions on missile defense programs and limits on strategic offensive nuclear weapons has been important, as seen in past agreements like SALT I. Russia remains concerned about U.S. plans for missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic. Suggestions have been made to limit not only deployed warheads but also the numbers of warheads in each side's stockpile of reserve warheads. The number of warheads in storage could create an imbalance if either side could return them to deployment quickly. Reductions in the numbers of stored warheads and their consolidation in fewer storage facilities might ease concerns about theft. START evolved into a multilateral treaty with Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan succeeding the Soviet Union. Each former Soviet state is subject to the treaty's limits and monitoring provisions, with a voice in deliberations. If START is extended, Ukraine, Belarus, and other parties will continue to be involved. The Commission established by the Treaty may extend START, with Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan remaining as parties unless amended to include only the United States and Russia. Analysts suggest that as the US and Russia reduce their forces, other nuclear weapons states may eventually join the arms control process. France, Great Britain, and China have deployed fewer warheads and should not join until the US and Russia reduce to 1,000 warheads. The United States and Russia are facing delays in completing a new START Treaty, which may not enter into force until mid-2010 or later. If they fail to reach an agreement, they could consider pursuing less formal arrangements for managing their nuclear forces or establishing a new treaty with altered goals. Other nuclear nations may eventually join the arms control process as the US and Russia reduce their forces. France, Great Britain, and China are suggested to wait until the US and Russia reduce to 1,000 warheads before joining. The United States and Russia are facing delays in completing a new START Treaty, which may not enter into force until mid-2010 or later. They could seek a new Treaty with altered goals and establish a transparency regime for monitoring without further reductions in deployed weapons. Approval from Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan would be needed to extend START, possibly for a shorter period like two years while negotiating a new Treaty. The U.S. and Russia are facing delays in completing a new START Treaty, with the possibility of a short-term extension. The U.S. Senate may approve an extension, but Russia's parliament may not be as accepting due to tensions in the relationship. There is a possibility that START could lapse, leading to a relationship without a new formal treaty in the near term. The Bush Administration suggested that the U.S. and Russia could continue implementing monitoring provisions from START without signing a formal Treaty. This could conflict with Russia's domestic law, requiring a legally binding Treaty for access to sensitive sites. An executive agreement or memorandum of understanding could be negotiated to allow visits, or monitoring provisions could be attached to another agreement. The Bush Administration proposed attaching monitoring provisions to a simple treaty document, potentially replacing both START and the Moscow Treaty in the longer term. The absence of arms control limits could either prompt negotiations for a new agreement or diminish the pressure for one, depending on its impact on stability and cooperation between the U.S. and Russia. This approach may appeal to those who believe formal treaties are unnecessary for managing the relationship but may be seen as risky by those who value the arms control process. The Bush Administration proposed a simpler, less detailed Treaty with monitoring provisions to replace START and the Moscow Treaty. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates advocated for a shorter, easier to adjust agreement with Russia, emphasizing the need for verification provisions. This approach may appeal to those who believe formal treaties are unnecessary for managing the relationship. The Moscow Treaty, which lacks details, does not provide transparency or predictability in nuclear forces. Without timelines or definitions, it hinders confidence in reduction processes. A shorter Treaty may not strengthen US-Russia relations or reduce nuclear threats. Some Members of Congress and analysts urge extending the monitoring regime in START for transparency and confidence in US-Russia nuclear cooperation. Representative Ellen Tauscher emphasized the importance of START verification. Senator Lugar introduced legislation to extend privileges for inspectors under START. The Obama Administration considered using an executive agreement to extend monitoring and verification provisions in START if negotiations on a new Treaty were not completed before START expired. Officials in the US and Russia discussed potentially applying the verification provisions in a new Treaty before ratification. Officials in the US and Russia are working on a \"bridging agreement\" to address monitoring lapses after the expiration of START. It is uncertain if this agreement will extend START provisions or establish a new transparency regime without further nuclear weapon reductions. This would help maintain confidence in each other's nuclear weapons deployments through data exchanges. The parties can be confident in the accuracy of data by visiting sites and viewing weapons themselves. START required notification of changes in strategic systems. Even without limiting nuclear weapons, they could house them at agreed sites, provide data, and notify movements. Cooperation in monitoring locations and characteristics of weapons could aid in compliance with the Moscow Treaty. Notifications, data exchanges, and on-site visits would inform about missile and bomber numbers and locations. The on-site visits under the START treaty confirm the number of warheads on specific missiles but do not allow for counting all warheads. However, they provide confidence in the accuracy of deployed warhead numbers for calculations. The US and Russia negotiating a new START treaty must address disagreements on counting rules and definitions. The US and Russia negotiating a new Treaty must decide on counting rules, missile deployment regulations, and monitoring provisions. They aim to balance their preferences to create a compromise for more transparency and predictability. The two nations have pledged to work together in the spirit of the expired START Treaty. The US and Russia are negotiating a new Treaty, aiming to balance preferences for transparency and predictability. They have pledged to work together in the spirit of the START Treaty, with analysts interpreting this as a continuation of some verification provisions. Details of a formal agreement on monitoring provisions are still being negotiated."
