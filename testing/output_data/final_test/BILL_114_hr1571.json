    "content": "The Act titled \"Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act of 2015\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that Medicare beneficiaries need to be hospitalized for at least three consecutive days for coverage of post-hospital care in a skilled nursing facility. Observation stays in hospitals have increased sharply since 2006, leading to a rise in outpatient visits. Observation stays in hospitals have increased sharply between 2006 and 2012, with a 12.6 percent decrease in inpatient stays. A study in Health Affairs noted a 34-percent increase in observation stays to inpatient admissions ratio from 2007 to 2009, suggesting outpatient observation as a substitute for inpatient admission. The study also reported an 88-percent increase in observation stays exceeding 72 hours. Care during observation is similar to inpatient care, with all necessary care provided regardless of patient status. Older Americans and people with disabilities can face unexpected financial burdens for skilled nursing facility care if they are placed in outpatient observation status during a hospital stay, even if their total stay exceeds three days. This can result in thousands of dollars in costs, as such care may not count towards Medicare coverage eligibility requirements. The Office of Inspector General found that beneficiaries faced high out-of-pocket charges for skilled nursing facility care not covered by Medicare. CMS's hospital payment rule for 2014 does not address the issue of observation status days not counting towards the 3-day inpatient stay requirement. This Act updates Medicare policy by deeming patients under observation as inpatients for the purposes of satisfying the Medicare 3-day inpatient stay requirement. It expands the Secretary's definition of \"inpatient\" to include time spent under observation, aiming to alleviate the financial burden on patients needing skilled nursing care after their hospital stay. The 3-day rule was originally intended to ensure Medicare coverage for skilled nursing facility stays after a 3-day hospital stay. This Act aims to allow access to skilled nursing care for beneficiaries who meet medical necessity requirements but do not meet the 3-day inpatient stay requirement due to being classified as \"outpatient observation status.\" Congress expects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to monitor providers to ensure appropriate care levels are delivered. The Office of the Inspector General and the Commission on Long-Term Care support counting hospital observation days towards the 3-day inpatient stay requirement for Medicare coverage. SEC. 3. Counting outpatient observation services in a hospital towards the 3-day inpatient hospital stay requirement for Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility services. The amendment to the Social Security Act states that individuals receiving outpatient observation services will be considered inpatients, with the discharge date being when they stop receiving services. This amendment applies to services starting on or after January 1, 2015, with exceptions for completed post-hospital extended care services if an appeal is made within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may implement the amendment to the Social Security Act through an interim final regulation, program instruction, or otherwise, regardless of the date of enactment of the Act."
