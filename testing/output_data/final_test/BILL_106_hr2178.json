The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act designates approximately 249,562 acres of land in Colorado as wilderness, in line with the Wilderness Act. The designated area will be known as the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness. The Secretary of the Interior will provide a map and boundary description to relevant committees after the Act's enactment. The Secretary of the Interior will provide a map and description of the designated Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness area to relevant committees for public inspection. SEC. 3. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The lands designated as wilderness by section 2(a) shall be managed by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. Any reference in the Wilderness Act to its effective date shall be deemed to refer to the date of enactment of this Act. \"Potential wilderness lands\" are defined as lands identified on the map in section 2(a) and lands acquired by the United States within the boundaries of the Rocky Mountains after the enactment of this Act. The Rocky Mountain National Park contains potential wilderness lands that will be managed as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The United States has existing water rights within the park for the purposes of wilderness preservation. The Act does not require additional water rights reservation for the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness. No reservation of water rights is implied or expressed by the Act. Activities related to the Colorado-Big Thompson Project in the designated wilderness areas are monitored and maintained. The Colorado-Big Thompson Project activities in designated wilderness areas are allowed to continue without being affected by the wilderness designation. New activities may be permitted in emergencies or catastrophic events, subject to restrictions to protect wilderness values. The Secretary shall not establish restrictions that hinder necessary activities or reduce water supply from the Colorado-Big Thompson Project or Windy Gap Project. The Act of January 26, 1915 does not allow development of new reclamation projects in designated wilderness areas. Exclusions from the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness and potential wilderness lands include the Grand Ditch. The Grand Ditch and associated lands owned by the St. Vrain & Left Hand Water Conservancy District are included in the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness. No buffer zones are intended by Congress. The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness designation does not create buffer zones or protective perimeters. Nonwilderness activities can be seen or heard from within the wilderness area without precluding such activities up to the boundary of the wilderness area."
