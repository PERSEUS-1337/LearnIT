    "content": "CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. The Congress acknowledges the President's goals to enhance education through the America 2000 program. It notes the shorter academic year in US schools compared to other countries and the poor performance of US students in international assessments. Extending the academic year is suggested based on various studies. Various studies suggest that extending the academic year at elementary and secondary schools can increase student learning time and reduce the need for review at the beginning of the year. In 1988, the report \"A Nation At Risk\" recommended extending the academic year to 220 days and increasing the academic day from 6 to 7 hours in the US. Elementary and secondary schools in the United States have expanded their course offerings, including health and driver education, without increasing overall instructional time. Establishment of demonstration grant program. The Secretary will provide grants to secondary schools to extend the academic year to at least 200 days over a period of up to 3 fiscal years, subject to annual approval and availability of appropriations. Schools must submit an application with assurances to receive the grant. Secondary schools receiving grants must extend the academic year to a minimum of 200 days, with each day consisting of at least 7 hours of instruction. Schools must also provide 20% of the grant amount from non-Federal sources to lengthen the academic year. A good-faith attempt to meet this requirement is acceptable. Selection for grants is based on submitting an application and having academic years with fewer than 200 days. Secondary schools receiving grants must have academic years with fewer than 200 days, a high percentage of students from single-parent or working parent homes, and be located in economically depressed communities with individuals facing alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and gang-related activities. The Secretary must ensure equitable distribution of grants among different regions and rural and urban areas. The Secretary may replace secondary schools that fail to comply with grant requirements. Notification is required for schools participating in the program. A study will test the impact of extended academic years on student learning retention. The study will examine the effects of the extended academic year on student learning, including attendance rates, parental involvement, post-secondary education attendance, behavioral and social skills, and reducing substance abuse and gang-related activities. It will also assess the impact on students, teachers, parents, and the local educational agency. The extended academic year has been successful according to parents, local educational agencies, and State educational agencies. The Secretary will submit a preliminary report by August 1, 1999, containing study information, program success evaluation, and recommendations for improvements. The Secretary will submit a final report by January 1, 2000, with additional information from the study for the demonstration grant program. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 authorized for fiscal years 1997-1999, available until expended. Definitions: Terms defined including \"local educational agency\", \"State\", \"State educational agency\", \"secondary school\", and \"Secretary\"."
