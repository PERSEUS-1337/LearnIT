The aggregate retirement savings and HSA contributions shall be reduced by distributions received during the testing period. Special rule for certain medical expenses incurred before establishment of account.

This change applies to coverage starting after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4. Allow both spouses to make catch-up contributions to the same health savings account. SEC. 4 amends section 223(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to allow married individuals with family coverage under a high deductible health plan to combine their coverage for the purpose of contribution limitations.
