The \"Local Education Freedom Act of 2016\" allows parents to enter agreements with State educational agencies to receive Federal funds for implementing a Federal mandate if the parent disagrees with the mandate. The agreement must be renewed each academic year for eligible children in grades with free public education provided by the State. Each State educational agency must provide education savings accounts. The \"Local Education Freedom Act of 2016\" allows parents to enter agreements with State educational agencies to receive Federal funds for education savings accounts for eligible children. The accounts must be maintained for each academic year as long as the agreement is renewed. The requirements for the education savings account include that it belongs to the eligible child for whom it was created. The education savings account is designated for the eligible child and can only receive funds disbursed by the State educational agency. The funds can only be used for the eligible child's education expenses, and the parent has the authority to direct the use of the funds. The State educational agency disburses funds from the education savings account to qualifying providers chosen by the parent, in accordance with the parent's direction. The amount disbursed is based on the average per-pupil expenditure of the State. The State educational agency disburses funds from education savings accounts to qualifying providers chosen by parents based on the average per-pupil expenditure of the State. Funds are disbursed in four equal quarterly deposits and any remaining amounts in the account at the end of the agreement period are available for use in the following academic year. The agency will recapture any unused funds. The educational agency will recapture any remaining funds in an education savings account if the parent ends or violates the agreement, does not renew it for the next academic year, or if the child no longer qualifies as eligible. Eligible Education Expenses for education savings account include tuition, fees, textbooks, supplies, exams, and transportation to qualifying providers. Eligible education expenses from the education savings account include transportation to a qualifying provider, contributions to qualified tuition programs and Coverdell education savings accounts, and other approved education expenses by the State educational agency. State educational agencies are responsible for approving qualifying providers for each academic year and maintaining a list of these providers. The list must be made publicly available on the agency's website. State educational agencies are required to ensure proper implementation of the Act by conducting audits of education savings accounts, monitoring fund usage, freezing or revoking accounts in case of fraud, and referring any misuse for criminal prosecution. They also have to transfer academic records upon request. The educational agency and public school must provide academic records of eligible children to qualifying providers for admissions. Qualifying providers can enforce admissions requirements and accept best-qualified students. Schools participating in the program must agree to transfer academic records. The program under this Act requires schools to transfer academic records of eligible children to other schools upon transfer. Refunds and rebates from education savings accounts are prohibited, except for necessary refunds.

Qualifying providers affiliated with religious organizations are exempt from sex discrimination prohibitions if inconsistent with their beliefs. Qualifying providers affiliated with religious organizations may exercise employment rights in line with title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, including exemptions. Funds from education savings accounts under subsection (b)(2) are protected by the first amendment to the Constitution. The Constitution of the United States allows qualifying providers to maintain their religious identity, including retaining religious terms in their name, selecting board members based on religion, and including religious references in their governing documents. Rules of Construction under the Act specify that no assistance provided can be considered as assistance to any qualifying provider, and funds in an education savings account cannot be treated as income for the eligible child or their parent. The Act also clarifies that it does not give federal officers the authority to control curriculum through grants or agreements. The Act clarifies that it does not expand regulatory authority for State or Federal governments over nonpublic schools beyond what is necessary to enforce the Act. Each State educational agency must ensure a smooth transition to the program under the Act to make education savings accounts available to eligible children starting in the 2017-2018 academic year.
