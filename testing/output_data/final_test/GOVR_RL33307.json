    "content": "Child nutrition programs, including the WIC program, provide assistance under federal laws such as the National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act. The Food and Nutrition Service administers these programs, with funding included in Agriculture Department appropriations laws. Congressional oversight is carried out by specific committees. Child nutrition and WIC programs are governed by federal laws, with recent amendments made in the 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act. The next general reauthorization is scheduled for 2009, with various local and state entities involved in program operation. At the state and local levels, various departments oversee child nutrition and WIC programs, ensuring federal support reaches providers like schools, child care centers, and summer program sites. Over 39 million children and infants, along with 2 million lower-income pregnant and postpartum women, benefit from these programs through a network of public and private institutions. The WIC program and other meal service programs operate in various locations, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. There are no restrictions on eligibility based on citizenship or legal residence status. American Samoa and the Northern Marianas receive assistance for school lunch programs. Federal aid for meal service programs is provided through legislatively set subsidies paid for each meal/snack served that meets federal nutrition guidelines. Federal subsidies for meal service programs cover meals/snacks meeting nutrition guidelines, with about 10% in federally donated food commodities. Subsidies are higher for meals served free or at reduced prices to lower-income children. While subsidies are indexed annually for inflation, they may not cover the full cost, requiring contributions from states, localities, and families. States must provide minimal nonfederal cost-sharing to participate in the program. Federal child nutrition programs require providers to spend over $200 million annually to receive federal funds. These funds cover administrative costs, state audits, and special payments for summer programs and family day care homes. The goal is to improve children's nutrition, increase access to nutritious meals for lower-income children, and support the agricultural economy. Funding and commodity support for these programs are treated as entitlements. Child nutrition programs receive federal funding and commodity support based on the number of meals served and the demographics of the recipients. The WIC program, on the other hand, is a discretionary grant program that serves as many applicants as possible with the available funds. More information on these programs can be found on the Agriculture Department's Food and Nutrition Service website. The School Lunch program provides federal cash subsidies and commodities to public and private schools participating in the program. The program, established in 1946, follows nutrition standards based on RDAs and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The School Lunch program provides federal cash subsidies and commodities to schools, ensuring free/reduced-price meals for lower-income children. There is minimal federal regulation for competitive foods, with cash subsidies set by federal law regardless of providers' costs. Subsidies vary based on meal pricing (free, reduced, full price). Free lunch subsidies are for eligible applicants. For the School Lunch program, lunch cash subsidies are provided based on family income levels. Free lunch eligibility is determined by annual family cash income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, while reduced-price lunch subsidies are for those with income between 130% and 185% of the poverty guidelines. Free lunch subsidies are $2.40 per lunch for the 2006-2007 school year. In the 2006-2007 school year, reduced-price lunch subsidies are $2.00, while full-price lunch subsidies are 23 cents for children with family income above 185% of the poverty guidelines. Schools with high free and reduced-price participation receive an additional 2 cents per lunch. Schools also receive federal commodity assistance for each lunch served. In the 2006-2007 school year, schools receive federal subsidies for \"entitlement\" commodities valued at a minimum of 16.75 cents per lunch, with annual inflation indexing. Special provisions include $50 million for fresh fruit and vegetables through the DOD Fresh program, and assistance for schools to offer free fresh produce. Schools can expand their program to cover snacks for children up to age 18 in after-school programs. The 2004 child nutrition reauthorization law requires schools to establish local \"school wellness\" policies, including goals for nutrition education, physical activity, nutrition guidelines, and measuring policy implementation. Subsidies for snacks vary based on family income, with free snacks offered in lower-income areas. Schools can also receive subsidies for meals served free in after-school programs. In FY2005, over 90% of schools and RCCIs received School Lunch program subsidies, with an average daily participation of 29.6 million children. Free lunches were received by 14.5 million children, reduced-price lunches by 2.9 million, and full-price lunches by 12.2 million. Additionally, the after-school snack component of the program reached 1 million children daily. The School Breakfast program, like the School Lunch program, provides subsidized breakfasts meeting federal nutrition standards in public and private nonprofit schools. Subsidy rates vary based on whether the breakfast is free, at a reduced price, or full price. The program originated from a pilot project in 1966 and became permanent in 1975. Income eligibility standards for free and reduced-price breakfasts are the same as the School Lunch program. Basic cash subsidies for the 2006-2007 school year are $1.31 per free breakfast, $1.01 per reduced-price breakfast, and 24 cents per full-price breakfast. Special \"severe need\" rates are paid to schools with high free or reduced-price breakfast participation. Participation in the School Breakfast program is voluntary, with some states requiring schools with lunch programs to join. In FY2005, 80% of School Lunch program schools and virtually all RCCIs in the lunch program also operated a breakfast program. The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) serves millions of children in schools and RCCIs. The program includes free, reduced-price, and full-price breakfast options. CACFP originated in 1968 and has separate components for summer food service and child care. Under certain conditions, for-profit nonresidential child care centers serving 30-50 children or more can receive cash subsidies for meals/snacks through the CACFP. Eligible centers include after-school projects, Head Start centers, recreational centers, centers for children with disabilities, and residential emergency homeless shelters. Meals/snacks must meet federal nutrition standards and be served to children age 12 or under (or migrant children age 15 or under, or children with disabilities). Emergency/homeless shelters can serve children up to age 18. Participating centers also receive commodity assistance or cash-in-lieu of commodities, representing about 4% of the aid value. Cash subsidies for meals/snacks through the CACFP vary based on the type of meal served and the income level of the children. Subsidies are provided for children with family income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, between 130% and 185% of the guidelines, and above 185% of the guidelines. The subsidies for lunches, suppers, and breakfasts are the same as those for the School Lunch and Breakfast programs. The CACFP provides subsidies for snacks based on family income, with different rates for \"free,\" \"reduced-price,\" and other snacks. Unlike school meal programs, there is no requirement to serve free or reduced-price meals. Child care centers can adjust fees to account for subsidies but are not regulated by the CACFP. For-profit centers can participate if they meet certain conditions, including receiving payments from Title XX of the Social Security Act. Under a pilot project in Iowa, Kentucky, and Delaware, for-profit child care centers can qualify for subsidies if at least 25% of enrolled children meet income requirements for free/reduced-price school meals. This rule was made applicable nationwide under P.L. 106-554 and extended through various laws until it became permanent under P.L. 108-265. This provides three potential methods for for-profit centers to qualify for subsidies. The law allows for-profit child care centers to qualify for federal CACFP subsidies for snacks served free to children in lower-income areas. Additionally, in seven states, federal subsidies can be offered for free meals, such as suppers, served in after-school programs. The CACFP provides cash subsidies to family and group day care homes, with higher subsidies for lower-income areas or providers. Subsidies are not based on individual children's family income, unlike programs for schools and child care centers. Cash subsidies are provided to family and group day care homes under the CACFP program. Tier I homes in lower-income areas receive higher subsidies, with lunches/suppers at $1.97, breakfasts at $1.06, and snacks at 58 cents. Tier II homes receive lower subsidies, with lunches/suppers at $1.19, breakfasts at 39 cents, and snacks at 16 cents. Tier II homes can request Tier I rates for lower-income children. Day care homes participate through nonprofit sponsoring organizations. Sponsors of day care homes receive monthly payments for administrative tasks, ranging from $50 to $95 per home. Centers can participate directly or through a sponsoring organization, which does not receive additional federal funds. Participating homes and centers must meet state or local licensing requirements. CACFP funds state costs for auditing sponsors and providers. In FY2005, 47,000 centers/sites and 153,000 day care home sites participated in CACFP, serving a total of 2.1 million children. Cash subsidies and food commodities are provided to service institutions for free food service to children during the summer. Summer programs for disabled children are provided by service institutions, such as schools, government agencies, camps, and nonprofit organizations. These programs have been in existence since 1968, with federal assistance authorized for special food service programs. Sponsors can operate three types of summer program sites, including \"open\" sites in lower-income areas. Summer sponsors receive operating cost subsidies for providing free meals and snacks to children in summer programs. The subsidies cover documented food and food service costs up to annually indexed maximums. For the summer of 2006, the maximum subsidy rates are $2.56 for lunch/supper, $1.47 for breakfast, and 59 cents for snacks. Subsidies do not vary based on individual children's family income. Summer program sponsors receive significant payments for administrative costs, up to about 27 cents a meal, based on the number and type of meals served. State agencies also receive special administrative cost payments for oversight and health inspections. Schools can operate summer programs using School Lunch and School Breakfast program rules and subsidy rates. States receive direct subsidies for health and meal quality inspection costs related to summer programs. In July 2005, summer program sponsors provided subsidized meals and snacks to nearly 2 million children. Schools and institutions not participating in federally subsidized meal programs offer milk at reduced or free prices. Each half-pint served is federally subsidized at varying rates. The federal government subsidizes half-pints of milk served in schools at 14.5 cents each for the 2006-2007 school year. Participating schools must lower milk prices and use federal payments to reduce costs for children. The program dates back to 1954-1955 and in FY2005, nearly 7,000 schools served about 100 million subsidized half-pints to 500,000 children. The federal government provides commodity assistance to schools and other providers through the Lunchprogram, CACFP, and Summer Food Service program. Schools receive federally donated commodities and cash subsidies based on the number of meals served, with an inflation-indexed commodity entitlement of 16.75 cents per meal for the 2006-2007 school year. The Department purchases these commodities to support agricultural prices and remove surpluses. The Agriculture Department provides bonus commodities valued at $120 million in FY2005 to schools and other providers, in addition to commodity donations. The value of commodity donations must equal at least 12% of total assistance under the School Lunch program. States receive grants to cover administrative costs related to child nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department provides bonus commodities valued at $120 million in FY2005 to schools and other providers, in addition to commodity donations. States receive grants to cover administrative and oversight costs for child nutrition programs, including commodity distribution costs. The national amount each year is equal to 1.5% of federal cash payments for various programs. States also receive administrative payments for overseeing summer programs. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) provides nutritious foods and support to lower-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5. The program operates through local health care clinics/sites run by local agencies, state health agencies, and Indian tribal organizations. Additionally, there is a WIC-like extension for overseas military personnel. The program began as a pilot project in 1972 and became a national program in 1975. The WIC program, established in 1975, provides nutritious foods to lower-income individuals. Eligibility is based on household income not exceeding 185% of the federal poverty guidelines. Applicants can also qualify if they receive Medicaid, food stamps, or TANF benefits. Enrollees must also be assessed as \"nutritional risk\" by health professionals. The WIC program provides nutritious foods to lower-income individuals based on income and nutritional risk assessment by health professionals. Foods are prescribed through vouchers/checks and redeemed at approved retail outlets, with WIC agencies having flexibility in food package implementation. Retailers redeem vouchers for cash through state WIC agencies. The WIC program provides financial support for state and local clinic Nutrition Services and Administrative costs, including assessments, education, referrals, and eligibility determination. Additionally, grants are allocated for infrastructure improvements and special projects. Annual federal appropriations are granted to state and Indian tribal WIC agencies based on food and NSA caseload costs. The WIC program receives annual federal appropriations based on food and NSA caseload costs, with additional funds allocated for infrastructure development and special projects. Unused money is carried over and reallocated among state and tribal grantees, with recent appropriations including a contingency fund. Rebates from manufacturers also help reduce food costs for the program. The WIC program utilizes substantial rebates from manufacturers to control food costs, with state agencies receiving discounts through competitive bidding. In FY2005, agencies saved $1.6 billion through rebate contracts for infant formula, juice, and cereal. Special limits are in place for WIC-only stores, and a WIC farmers' market nutrition program operates with non-federal matching funding. The WIC farmers' market nutrition program operates in 38 states, DC, Puerto Rico, Guam, and four Indian tribal organizations. It provides special vouchers to 2.5 million WIC participants to buy fresh produce at 4,700 locations. The federal government covers the first $30 of each voucher and shares administrative costs with states. In FY2005, average monthly WIC participation was 8.0 million people, with federal costs of $37.50 per person for food. The federal government covers the first $30 of each voucher for the WIC farmers' market nutrition program, which operates in 38 states. Average monthly WIC participation in FY2005 was 8.0 million people, with federal costs of $37.50 per person for food. The coordinated review effort (CRE) aims to improve management and identify problems in child nutrition programs. The Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service (ERS) and the FNS conduct nutrition research and evaluations. The federal government funds various projects and initiatives to support nutrition education and food service management, including the Food Service Management Institute and Team Nutrition projects. These efforts aim to improve meal service operations, ensure federal support is spent correctly, and provide technical assistance to program operators. Funding for these projects typically ranges from $10-$20 million a year. The 2004 Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act added new spending to improve school meal programs, develop wellness policies, and fund pilot projects. Federal support for child nutrition programs comes from Agriculture Department appropriations and permanent appropriations. Federal support for child nutrition programs includes permanent appropriations, unused money from prior years, transfers from other accounts, and funds from separate budget accounts. Actual spending is determined by demand for subsidized meals, while WIC spending is discretionary. WIC spending is discretionary and determined by available appropriations, including carryovers and recoveries. State WIC agencies serve as many individuals as possible within their allocated funds, with funding shifting among child nutrition programs as needed to stay within overall budget limits. Congressional appropriations do not provide a complete picture of total federal spending. The appropriations for child nutrition and WIC programs do not provide a complete picture of total federal support. Spending figures give a better overview, with Table 1 showing recent appropriations and Table 2 showing spending estimates for various programs. For more detailed information, refer to CRS Report RL33412. The FY2007 budget and appropriations for Child Nutrition & WIC programs have been detailed in Table 1, showing appropriations from FY2004 to FY2007. WIC appropriations have been reduced due to rescissions in discretionary programs and transfers in various fiscal years. Mandatory appropriations and funding from other Agriculture Department accounts are not included in these figures. The House bill's child nutrition appropriation for FY2005 and later years does not include a $300 million contingency fund proposed by the Administration and included in the Senate bill. However, it allows for $125 million in contingency funds for the WIC program. Additional funds for a free fresh fruit and vegetable program in selected schools are not included in the House bill but are included in the Senate child nutrition appropriation. The curr_chunk discusses WIC spending under the House bill, including funding sources and details on cash assistance, commodities purchased for child nutrition programs, and federal commodity donation support spending. It does not include spending on child nutrition- and WIC-related research. The curr_chunk discusses funding sources for child nutrition programs, including federal commodity donation support spending. Actual spending figures may be lower than shown due to uncertainty. Funding amounts for each year are specified, with mandates from farm bills and child nutrition reauthorization laws. The FY2007 Administration request for child nutrition programs includes a $9 million mandatory funding amount, with additional discretionary appropriations for special projects like nutrition education, food safety, program integrity initiatives, and wellness policies. Funding also supports a summer program pilot project and an information clearinghouse. The FY2007 Administration request for the WIC program includes a recommendation to limit WIC Nutrition Services and Administration support to 25% of state grants, with estimated savings of $152 million in FY2007. The House and Senate figures reject the proposed limits and reflect changes in assumptions regarding food costs, participation, and prior-year funds. WIC farmers' market figures show spending from new annual appropriations and recovered funds, with assumptions of decreasing unused money in FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007. In FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007, there was a decrease in unused money. Annual appropriations were $22.9 million in FY2004, $19.8 million in FY2005, and $19.8 million in FY2006. A $19.8 million appropriation is requested for FY2007. The drop in appropriations starting in FY2005 does not reflect in spending totals until FY2006 due to unspent funds from previous years. FY2005 spending may be revised downward by $2 million, while FY2006 and FY2007 amounts may be revised upward if recoveries from FY2005 are made available as grants. The House and Senate bills for FY2007 include an additional $200,000."
