Congress enacted five major anti-crime bills and increased funding for law enforcement agencies, leading to the FBI's expanded role in fighting domestic crime. The federal government expanded its role in domestic crime control through grant programs and legislation in response to rising crime rates. Congress faced the policy question of the federal government's role in crime control, particularly in violent crime, fraud, drug policy, and DOJ grant oversight. The FBI shifted focus to counterterrorism post-9/11, leading to a decline in federal assistance to state and local law enforcement. The federal government took a more direct role in crime control due to the increasing violent crime rate in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report program collects data on offenses known to police and arrests for Part I offenses, including murder, rape, robbery, and assault. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report program collects data on various offenses, including murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. The data is collected from state and local law enforcement agencies and presented in different formats. The national violent crime rate began to rise sharply in the 1960s, continuing into the 1970s. The violent crime rate increased sharply in the 1960s, peaking in 1991. However, it began to decline in the mid-1990s and continued to decrease through 2009. The property crime rate also trended downward, starting in the early 1990s and declining through 2009. Despite these trends, Congress continues to debate measures to further reduce crime rates. The national violent crime rate has decreased since the mid-1990s, but interest in combating violent crimes remains. The 111th Congress discussed various crime-related issues and questioned the federal government's role in addressing crimes. One key issue was whether Congress has provided adequate tools to counter violent crime effectively, including hate crimes. Hate crimes target victims based on race, religion, gender, or other characteristics. Federal law prohibits using force to intimidate or harm individuals based on these factors. In 2009, there were 6,604 reported hate crime incidents. Hate crimes are labeled as such when there is evidence of bias motivating the offender. The 111th Congress debated expanding federal jurisdiction over hate crimes, adding federal penalties for crimes currently under state jurisdiction. Some argued for greater federal involvement to address hate crimes systematically, while others saw it as redundant since state penalties already exist. Another issue was whether to broaden the definition of hate crimes to include biases like gender identity, which was included in the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Congress also considered expanding federal assistance to state and local law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, as well as categorizing and reporting them. Additionally, there was discussion on including crimes against the homeless population in FBI crime data. Gang crimes, classified as both violent and property crimes, have policymakers focusing on curbing violent gang crimes. The National Youth Gang Center found gang activity prevalent in both urban and rural areas. According to the National Youth Gang Center (NYGC), gang activity is widespread in urban and rural America, with an estimated 774,000 gang members and 27,900 gangs active in the US in 2008. About 32.4% of surveyed areas experienced gang problems. Policy makers are exploring various solutions to youth gang violence, including prevention, intervention, and suppression efforts. The 111th Congress debated creating new grant programs for gang prevention research and funding for gang-specific investigations and prosecutions. The 111th Congress debated whether to include gang-specific provisions in the RICO Act to aid in prosecuting gang members for specified crimes. Congress also considered amending the federal criminal code to update the definition of a gang and criminalize specified gang crimes. The Government Accountability Office suggested a uniform definition of \"gangs\" to enhance coordination of gang-related data collection. Statistics on crime and mortality, such as firearm-related homicides, have been used in the gun control debate. Congress continues to debate the efficacy and constitutionality of federal regulation of firearms. The 111th Congress debated various firearm-related issues, including legislating on concealed carry rights, retaining background check records for terrorist screening, and imposing further regulations on certain firearms like assault weapons and .50 caliber rifles. The 111th Congress debated firearm-related issues such as concealed carry rights, background check records for terrorist screening, and regulations on assault weapons and .50 caliber rifles. Congress also passed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 to address various types of fraud, including identity theft, and to ensure effective investigation and prosecution of evolving crimes. The 111th Congress debated the federal government's role in preventing identity theft, which costs consumers about $50 billion annually. In 2009, 11.1 million Americans were victims of identity theft, an increase of 12% from 2008. Identity theft is linked to various criminal activities, and Congress discussed providing effective tools for investigation and prosecution of identity thieves. The federal government debated regulating the availability of personally identifiable information, including social security numbers, in both public and private sectors. Policy options included giving agencies rulemaking authority and prohibiting the use of social security numbers on government documents. The Social Security Number Protection Act of 2010 was passed to prevent the display of social security numbers on government-issued payment checks. Another issue was whether to impose stricter requirements for reporting data breaches, such as reporting to law enforcement or individuals. The 111th Congress considered expanding the list of crimes for aggravated identity theft to deter identity thieves. Organized retail crime (ORC) costs the retail industry over $30 billion annually and poses economic and health risks to society. Stolen goods are resold in national and international markets, leading to lost tax revenue and health risks for consumers. The 111th Congress debated the federal government's role in combating organized retail crime (ORC), questioning the effectiveness of current investigative tools and the need for specific criminal provisions. There was also discussion on regulating online marketplaces to aid law enforcement in investigating fraudulent sellers. The National Drug Intelligence Center highlighted the ongoing threat of illicit drug trafficking and abuse in American society. Drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are a significant threat to American society, with Mexican DTOs being the largest threat according to the NDIC. They maintain drug distribution networks in at least 230 U.S. cities, and 14% of U.S. counties are designated as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs). The HIDTA Program provides federal resources to areas plagued by drug trafficking and promotes coordination among drug control organizations. Policy makers in the 111th Congress debated designating more counties as HIDTAs and adjusting criteria for inclusion. Concerns included drug-related violence in Mexico spilling over into the U.S., with reports of kidnappings related to drug smuggling. Issues facing the 111th Congress included debates on authorizing additional funding for law enforcement initiatives along the Southwest border, forming border task forces to address drug-related violence, and increasing penalties for drug offenses. Judges have discretion in sentencing unless a mandatory sentence is specified by law, leading to concerns about sentencing disparities. The 111th Congress faced issues regarding federal sentencing guidelines, including disparities in crack and powder cocaine sentences, early release for certain prisoners, and mandatory minimum sentencing laws. Proponents argue that mandatory minimums deter crime, while critics claim they disproportionately affect non-violent, minority offenders. The 111th Congress debated mandatory sentences for non-violent, minority offenders, focusing on crack versus powder cocaine sentencing disparities. The U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended equalizing quantities triggering mandatory penalties for crack and powder cocaine offenses. The U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended raising trigger quantities for crack cocaine penalties, but not to the level of powder cocaine. Some states have started to address disparities in state law. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the crack/powder cocaine ratio for mandatory minimum penalties and eliminated the five-year sentence for crack cocaine possession. Congress is addressing issues related to non-violent drug offenders and prison overcrowding. In response to the issues of non-violent drug offenders and prison overcrowding, early release for federal prisoners has been considered. The 1984 Sentencing Reform Act eliminated parole in the federal system, leading to inmates serving full sentences. The 111th Congress debated options for early release mechanisms, such as expanded good time credit or credit for employment in prison. Another issue was the sentencing of juvenile prisoners to life without parole, with debates on whether juveniles should receive adult sentences for similar crimes. Juveniles sentenced to life in prison without parole have sparked debates due to cognitive differences with adults. The federal government influences state juvenile justice systems through grant programs. Policy makers have considered incentivizing early release through grant monies for states to establish review boards for juvenile cases. The Department of Justice oversees grant programs for justice assistance, including the COPS program created in 1994 to increase community policing by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies. Congress evaluates funding adequacy and scope of these programs, considering changes to the number of programs and their purpose areas. The COPS program, created in 1994, aims to increase community policing by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies for various purposes. The 109th Congress reauthorized the program through FY2009 and consolidated it into a single grant program. The 111th Congress debated issues such as reauthorization, funding levels, and provided supplemental funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Several bills in the 111th Congress aimed to reauthorize appropriations for the COPS program, with proposals to change it to a multi-grant program and make the COPS Office part of the Department of Justice. One bill, H.R. 1139, received legislative action and was passed. The COPS program received funding under various legislative acts, shifting focus towards holding young offenders accountable rather than rehabilitation. This debate on rehabilitation versus retribution in the juvenile justice system has been a topic of national discussion. The Juvenile Justice Delinquency and Prevention Act (JJDPA) provisions expired in FY2007 and FY2008, leading to a debate on rehabilitation versus retribution in handling young offenders. Congress restructured grant programs in 2002, consolidating them into one large block grant with accountability and graduated sanctions. Despite this, many repealed programs still receive funding, while overall juvenile justice appropriations have decreased by 25% since FY2002. The core issue in the juvenile justice debate is whether rehabilitation or a punitive approach should drive the handling of young offenders. The focus should be on a punitive approach for young offenders' responsibility for their crimes. The 111th Congress debated the reauthorization of the JJDPA and the adequacy of existing grant programs. Some jurisdictions have seen an increase in crime rates, leading to calls for a grant program to assist witnesses in serious cases. H.R. 1741 proposed the Witness Security and Protection Grant Program Act of 2010 to provide funding for this purpose. The House passed a bill creating a grant program for witness protection in cases of homicide, serious felonies, or drug offenses. The Senate did not consider the bill. Legislation was introduced to establish a commission to review the U.S. criminal justice system, focusing on costs and policies. The commission would provide recommendations to Congress on reducing incarceration rates, improving prison administration, utilizing proven strategies to reduce criminal behavior, reevaluating drug-related crimes, enhancing mental illness treatment, and improving law enforcement response to criminal organizations."
