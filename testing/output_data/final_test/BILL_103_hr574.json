    "content": "The \"Financial Fraud Detection and Disclosure Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 includes a new section on fraud detection and disclosure. Sec. 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates audit requirements for an issuer's financial statements by an independent public accountant. This includes procedures to detect illegal acts, identify related party transactions, and evaluate the issuer's ability to continue as a going concern. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires independent public accountants to investigate and report any illegal acts detected during audits, determining their potential impact on the issuer's financial statements. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates that independent public accountants promptly inform the issuer's management and audit committee about any illegal acts detected during audits, unless the act is deemed inconsequential. If the issuer fails to take remedial action, the accountant must ensure that the audit committee or board of directors is adequately informed. The independent public accountant must report to the board of directors if they conclude that an illegal act has a material effect on the issuer's financial statements, senior management has not taken timely remedial actions, and the failure to act may warrant departure from a standard auditor's report or resignation from the audit engagement. An issuer must notify the Commission within one business day if their board of directors receives a report from an independent public accountant regarding illegal acts affecting financial statements. If the accountant does not receive a copy of the notice within the required timeframe, they must either resign from the engagement or provide a copy of their report to the Commission within the next business day. An independent public accountant must report to the Commission within one business day if an issuer fails to notify them of illegal acts affecting financial statements. The accountant can resign or provide a copy of their report to the Commission. The accountant is not liable for any findings in their report, and civil penalties may be imposed for willful violations. The Commission may impose civil penalties on an independent public accountant for willful violations of specified subsections. The determination and amount of penalties are governed by set standards. The section does not limit the Commission's existing authority. The term 'illegal act' refers to actions violating laws or regulations. The amendments made by subsection (a) of this section apply to registrants filing quarterly financial data under Regulation S-K starting from January 1, 1994, and for other registrants starting from January 1, 1995."
