    "content": "The promotion of democracy has been a key element of U.S. foreign policy, supported by Congress through legislation and funding for democracy promotion activities. Concerns exist over the current global trajectory of democracy, with bipartisan worry reflected in hearings during the 115th Congress. Experts have debated whether the global expansion of democracy has stalled in recent years. Many argue that a global \"democratic recession\" began around 2006, citing concerns over authoritarian leaders, international authoritarian influence, and new tools used by nondemocratic governments to suppress democratizing forces. Experts differ in their assessment of these trends and their impact on the future of democracy worldwide. The report provides information, analysis, and perspectives on global democracy trends, U.S. policy disagreements, and democracy promotion. It includes background on democracy, analyzes global democracy levels, and discusses factors affecting democracy worldwide. The report also synthesizes debates on democracy promotion in U.S. foreign policy and presents related policy issues for Congress. Democracy is defined as \"rule by the people\" and can vary across cultural contexts and time. Different conceptions of democracy can be categorized as \"thin\" or \"thick,\" with thin definitions focusing on electoral competition and participation, while thick definitions include broader protections for individual rights. Ideological biases and the political zeitgeist can influence what features are considered essential to the definition of democracy. Definitions of democracy can vary, with some focusing on basic elements like electoral competition, while others include broader protections for individual rights and civil liberties. Adjectives are often used to denote different levels of democracy, with criticisms directed at both minimalist and expansive definitions. Adjectives are frequently used to denote different levels of democracy, such as electoral democracy and liberal democracy. Modern definitions recognize middle zones like hybrid regimes. Democracy is seen as a continuous variable with arbitrary divisions between concepts. The concept of democracy is not explicitly defined in U.S. policy or law. The concept of democracy in U.S. policy aligns with nonminimalist views, including elements like the rule of law and civil liberties. Democracy promotion programs include the rule of law and labor rights. The term democracy in this report refers to broader conceptions typically associated with liberal democracy. Encouraging democracy is a recurrent theme in U.S. foreign policy, despite competing objectives and differing priorities. Congress has consistently advocated for democracy and human rights in U.S. foreign policy, passing legislation to institutionalize support and allocating over $2 billion annually for democracy promotion programs. Various means, such as diplomacy, sanctions, and foreign assistance, are utilized to promote democracy. U.S. democracy promotion includes conditionality in foreign assistance programs, educational and cultural exchanges, and public diplomacy. There is a distinction between peaceful democracy support and democracy imposition, with military intervention falling into the latter category. Despite the official embrace of democracy promotion by U.S. policymakers, it is not always reflected in foreign policy activities. Congressional efforts in this area have been documented in CRS Report R44858. U.S. policymakers have long linked democracy with foreign policy and national security interests, emphasizing partnerships between democracies for peace and world order. This belief, dating back to Woodrow Wilson's advocacy in World War I, has influenced U.S. \"grand strategy\" post-World War II, including democracy promotion alongside free trade and international institution creation. The creation of new international institutions post-World War II was based on the assumption that a foundation of democracies with shared values is essential for sustainable order. There are ongoing debates among scholars and policymakers regarding the historical importance of the international order within U.S. strategy and its role in promoting peace and stability. Additionally, there is a continuing discussion on whether democracy promotion should be a part of U.S. foreign policy. Recent presidential administrations have highlighted the importance of democracies in international relations. President Clinton and President Bush emphasized that democratic states are more peaceful and cooperative, while President Obama's administration connected democracy promotion with U.S. interests. The 2010 NSS emphasized the importance of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in strengthening U.S. influence globally. Unlike previous administrations, the Trump Administration's 2017 NSS did not focus on promoting democracy. The Trump Administration's December 2017 NSS does not prioritize promoting democracy but mentions improving governance, anticorruption, and the rule of law. It emphasizes championing American values and supporting those fighting for human dignity. The NSS highlights the importance of governments respecting the rights of their citizens for prosperity, happiness, and peace. Many argue that the Trump Administration has deemphasized democracy promotion in foreign policy. Global indexes measure respect for democracy in countries, including Freedom House's Freedom in the World report and the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index. Analyzing trends in these indexes can help quantify global democratic declines and provide historical context. Background information on methodology, other global indexes, and critiques of democracy indexes can be found in Appendix A. Freedom House's Freedom in the World country ratings are often used as a proxy measure for the level of democracy, including protections for civil liberties, rule of law, and safeguards against corruption. Respect for political rights and civil liberties globally has increased substantially since the mid-1970s, with the combined average reaching its highest point in 2005. The percentage of countries categorized as \"free\" by Freedom House has also increased over time. The percentage of countries categorized as \"free\" by Freedom House peaked in 2006 and 2007 at 46.63%. From 2005 to 2017, there has been a global decline in ratings for civil liberties and political rights. The combined global average rating decreased by approximately 3.2% during this period. Countries that have gained in freedom have been outnumbered by those that have declined every year since 2006, with the gap widening since 2015. In 2017, 35 countries gained while 71 declined. Table 1 compares Freedom House's country statuses from 2005 to 2017, showing an increase in \"not free\" countries. In 2005, 53% of the world's population lived in \"not free\" or \"partly free\" countries, rising to 61% in 2017. The average global scores for political rights and civil liberties decreased in 2017 compared to 2005, with civil liberties showing greater declines. Within the political rights category, the \"functioning of government\" subcategory saw the largest decline, focusing on elected officials' power, corruption safeguards, and government transparency. The \"electoral process\" and \"political pluralism and participation\" categories also declined, emphasizing fair elections and political competition components. Civil liberties subcategories experienced larger declines than political rights, except for \"personal autonomy and individual rights.\" The \"personal autonomy and individual rights\" subcategory includes indicators on freedom of movement, property rights, social freedoms, and equality of economic opportunity. The \"freedom of expression and belief\" subcategory declined the most, including indicators on free media, religious freedom, academic freedom, and freedom of expression. The \"associational and organizational rights\" subcategory includes indicators on freedom of assembly, operation of NGOs, and labor organizations. The \"rule of law\" subcategory includes indicators on independent judiciary, due process, freedom from physical force, and equal treatment under the law. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index measures global democracy, including political rights, civil liberties, government functioning, political participation, and public support for democracy. The index shows a slight decrease in global democracy from 2006 to 2017, but the decline is not consistent across all countries. The global average level of democracy declined slightly from 2006 to 2017, with a renewed downward trend since 2015. The discrepancy in decline between the Economist Intelligence Unit's index and Freedom House's may be due to improvements in political participation measures. There was a decrease in \"full democracies\" but a smaller decline in \"authoritarian regimes,\" with an increase in \"flawed democracies\" and \"hybrid regimes.\" The global average level of democracy declined slightly from 2006 to 2017, with a renewed downward trend since 2015. The increase in \"flawed democracies\" and \"hybrid regimes\" contributed to this trend, with a significant rise in the \"political participation\" category balancing out declines in other areas. This category includes indicators like voter participation rates and political engagement levels, not captured in Freedom House's index. The decline in global democracy from 2006 to 2017 is evident in indicators like voter participation rates and political engagement levels. The categories of \"electoral process and pluralism,\" \"functioning of government,\" \"political culture,\" and \"civil liberties\" in politics are crucial for a healthy democracy, focusing on free and fair elections, government transparency, and support for democratic norms among the population. The decline in global democracy from 2006 to 2017 is evident in indicators like voter participation rates and political engagement levels. EIU's \"civil liberties\" category decreased significantly, reflecting declines in free media, freedom of expression, independence of the judiciary, and other civil liberties-related elements. This contrasts with smaller declines in elections and political participation aspects of democracy. The global decline in democracy since 2006 is evident in various indicators, including voter participation rates and political engagement levels. Data from Freedom House and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) show a halt in the expansion of political rights and civil liberties since 2005. The Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem) also indicates a lack of democratic progress globally in recent years. The extent of actual global backsliding during this period remains unclear. According to Freedom House and EIU data, there has been a decline in global democracy since 2006. The percentage of \"free\" countries decreased slightly, but the percentage of the world's population living in a \"free\" country decreased significantly. In 2017, less than 50% of the world's population lived in either a \"full\" or \"flawed\" democracy. The global level of democracy declined below 50% in 2017, with 4.5% living in \"full\" democracies. This trend aligns with findings showing that democratic declines have been more prominent in countries with large populations like Brazil, India, and Russia. Improving countries tend to have smaller populations such as Burkina Faso, Fiji, and Sri Lanka. The decline in democracy is more evident in broader rights and institutions rather than political competition and electoral processes. The decline in global democracy is more evident in broader rights and institutions associated with liberal democratic systems, such as media independence, freedom of expression, and the rule of law. Some governments focus on visible aspects like elections while neglecting less visible elements of democracy. Democratic backsliding has become more subtle over time, with tactics like censorship, media restrictions, and engineered deteriorations in judicial independence. Despite negative trends, improvements have been seen in smaller countries like Burkina Faso, Fiji, and Sri Lanka. Despite recent power grabs and concerns about declining democracy indexes, experts note that the longer-term trajectory of democracy remains uncertain. Historical analysis shows previous \"reverse waves\" against democratic expansion, followed by renewed democratization. While challenges to democracy are acknowledged, a comparable third \"reverse wave\" has not yet emerged. The current state of democracy is a cause for concern, with negative trend lines in recent years raising questions about a possible global reversal. Despite some improvements in certain regions, analysts point to key factors affecting democracies worldwide. Many observers believe that democracy's expansion in the 20th century was influenced by powerful countries shaping an international environment conducive to democracy through multilateral institutions like the United Nations, NATO, EU, and OSCE. Democracy was integrated into the international order after World War II. The spread of democracy since the mid-1970s coincided with an emphasis on human rights in U.S. foreign policy. The economic dominance of the United States promoted democratization in closed societies. However, the share of global income from \"not free\" countries has increased, giving them more power regionally and globally. The rise of authoritarian powers like China and Russia is seen as a threat to democracy by democracy scholars and U.S. policymakers. These influential authoritarian regimes are becoming more assertive internationally, putting leading democracies on the defensive. There were hopes that engagement with the U.S. and other democracies, participation in international institutions, and economic growth would lead to political change, but this may not be the case. Both China and Russia resent key elements of the U.S. postwar order and aim to undermine the liberal democratic order. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy highlights ideological competition with these countries. Authoritarian regimes are impacting democracy internationally by undercutting support for democratic norms and human rights. The rising international influence of authoritarian states is challenging the universality of democratic norms and human rights. China and Russia are actively undermining democracy through various means, including providing support that hinders democratization in other countries and subverting democratic institutions within existing democracies. The overall impact of these efforts is still unclear. China and Russia actively emphasize state sovereignty and noninterference in international relations. Russia defends \"traditional values\" to justify discriminatory policies, while China critiques Western-style capitalism and liberal democracy. Both countries are challenging democratic norms and human rights internationally. China's principles of noninterference and respect for \"civilizational diversity\" guide its foreign aid, which is given without governance conditions. Chinese aid recipients from 2000 to 2014 were mostly nondemocracies. China promotes \"cyber sovereignty,\" allowing countries to control internet content. China, like Russia, introduces resolutions at the U.N. Human Rights Council that some criticize. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), including China and Russia, promotes respect for sovereignty and noninterference, aiming to uphold diversity of civilization and development models. Despite being a regional grouping of authoritarian states, India and Pakistan joined in 2017. Some analysts suggest that the SCO's emphasis on \"civilizational diversity\" may undermine universal human rights norms. Some analysts believe that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's promotion of \"civilizational diversity\" may undermine democratic principles in the region, impacting the work of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Authoritarian states like China, Russia, and Iran are driven by a desire to maintain power and regime stability, influencing their foreign policy decisions. Defensive regime threat imperatives shape their actions in the international arena. Some authoritarian governments may aim to \"contain\" democracy due to regime stability concerns, rather than actively promoting authoritarianism. Authoritarian states often prioritize narrow economic and geopolitical interests in their foreign policies, with support for autocrats or undermining democracy being incidental to other goals like control over resources. Russia's support for authoritarian regimes is opportunistic, driven by economic and geopolitical motives and limited by a cultural focus on the \"Russian world.\" Russia's foreign policy is influenced by a desire to insulate itself against democratic political change and promote its cultural emphasis on the \"Russian world.\" China, on the other hand, maintains a \"regime-type neutral\" approach in its foreign policy, seeking good relations with countries regardless of their political systems. While China does not actively promote authoritarianism, its foreign policy efforts may sometimes undermine democracy or lend prestige to authoritarian systems. Powerful nondemocracies could potentially increase efforts to promote authoritarian political systems in the future. Analysts note that democracy promotion efforts by the United States and other democracies have been driven by a normative commitment to democracy as a universal value. While authoritarian systems may hold appeal, it is uncertain if \"authoritarian values\" could garner similar enthusiasm. Even repressive governments often frame their systems as democratic, using terms like \"socialist democracy.\" Some countries frame their political systems as \"socialist democracy\" to appear democratic, despite maintaining elements like political parties and elections. China and Russia promote noninterference and different political systems, conflicting with efforts to promote democracy. Backsliding in democracies has raised concerns about the erosion of democracy's appeal globally. Despite contextual differences, citizens in diverse democracies have supported candidates with questionable commitment to liberal democracy. Arguably authoritarian leaders are in power in various countries, attacking liberal democracy. Leaders in Hungary and Poland have also achieved electoral success despite views contrary to democratic norms. Hungary's Viktor Orb\u00e1n aims to create an \"illiberal state,\" raising concerns about the erosion of democracy globally. Some political scientists question the stability of consolidated democracies, suggesting democratic deconsolidation is possible. Support for democracy is based on intrinsic freedoms and instrumental benefits like economic growth. Post-Cold War, many countries pursued democratizing reforms. After the Cold War, many countries pursued democratizing reforms for economic growth and national prestige. Challenges within democracies, including poor governance and economic inequality, may be eroding support for democracy as a political system. The connection between democracy and economic and security rewards from international institutions may be weakening due to democratic backsliding in some EU and NATO member states. Economically successful authoritarian capitalist states, like China, are challenging the appeal of democracy by disconnecting it from economic success and modernity. China's economic success and modernity are challenging the appeal of democracy. Xi Jinping's statements suggest that China's model of \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" could be a new choice for development. However, China will not export its political model. Some argue that challenges in the U.S. political system are hindering its ability to promote democratic values abroad. The United States is facing challenges such as institutional gridlock and eroding respect for democratic norms, which could undermine its democracy promotion efforts. Reports from Freedom House and the Economist Intelligence Unit show a decline in political rights and civil liberties, with the U.S. being categorized as a \"flawed democracy\" in 2017. Despite mixed attitudes towards democracy, support for democracy as a political system remains high globally. Support for democracy as a political system remains high globally, with a median of 78% of respondents approving of representative democracy. Approximately 23% of respondents expressed support for representative democracy and rejected all three nondemocratic alternatives posed. The proportion of \"committed democrats\" in a country is correlated with its level of wealth and democracy, suggesting higher support in richer and more democratic countries. Analysis of polling data does not show a clear overall global negative trend in support for democracy. The analysis of support for democracy across 134 countries since 1990 shows varying trend-lines, with some countries experiencing a decline while others show an increase or stable levels of support. Regional polls in Africa also reflect mixed trends, with support increasing in some countries and decreasing in others since 2012. Support for democracy has shown mixed trends globally since 2012. In the Middle East and North Africa, support remained unchanged in five countries, decreased in two, and increased in two. In Latin America, overall support has remained largely unchanged since 1995. These trends reflect the diverse political, social, and economic contexts in different countries. Support for democracy globally appears to be resilient based on public opinion polling. Despite concerns over international influence, nondemocracies are using new, less heavy-handed tools to prevent democratizing forces within their societies. These methods are discussed further below. Civil society organizations are facing increasing limitations on their operations worldwide, with restrictions on funding and registration requirements. These measures, commonly imposed by authoritarian regimes, are creating a \"closing space\" for civil society work. Scholars note that the origins of this phenomenon vary by country. After the Cold War, Western governments increased funding for pro-democracy CSOs, leading to civil society restrictions. Events like the color revolutions and Arab Spring fueled government wariness. States justify restrictions on national security grounds, critics see it as crackdowns. Some countries cite sovereignty for foreign funding restrictions. Russia's suppression of civil society is a notable example. Russia's suppression of civil society has served as a model for other states to emulate, with measures including restrictions on foreign-funded groups engaging in political activity. Many governments worldwide have imposed similar constraints on civil society, with 60 countries enacting over 120 laws between 2012 and 2015 to limit freedom of association and assembly. These restrictions make it difficult for civil society organizations to operate legally or sustain their activities. Many civil society organizations (CSOs) face challenges in sustaining operations due to restrictions on funding and activities, particularly those dependent on foreign support or focusing on sensitive issues. Governments use legal measures to investigate and intimidate CSOs, draining resources and hindering democratizing efforts. Technological advancements are also utilized by nondemocratic governments to censor and monitor opposition, dampening optimism about their democratizing potential. Emerging technologies can have dual uses with both positive and negative impacts on democracy. Authoritarian governments have been able to control politically threatening aspects of these technologies and may use them for social and political control. Restrictions on internet freedom have increased since the color revolutions and Arab Spring movements, with obstacles to access, content limits, and violations of user rights being common. Obstacles to access, content limitations, and violations of user rights are common in internet freedom. Governments use various tactics such as deliberate outages, censorship, offline punishment, and cyberattacks to control online information. They also manipulate online discourse through bots and paid commentators to spread misinformation and distract users. Governments use tactics like spreading misinformation and using advanced technologies to track and suppress political dissent online. China is a prominent example, employing facial recognition and big data collection for surveillance. The use of these tactics has significantly increased in the past decade, according to the U.S. intelligence community. Some countries are developing efficient AI technologies for social control, which could spread to other governments. Chinese facial recognition technology has been sold to foreign governments. Lack of global democratic expansion is attributed to unfavorable conditions in nondemocracies, influenced by factors like wealth and inequality. According to analysts, challenges in democratization are not surprising as most countries with favorable conditions had already democratized by the mid-2000s. Factors like wealth may not strongly correlate with democratization anymore, and state capacity may not always support democracy. Strong state capacity in authoritarian regimes could hinder democratization efforts. Authoritarian regimes with strong state capacity may hinder democratization by enhancing \"performance legitimacy\" through providing public goods and monitoring dissent. The \"oil curse\" theory suggests that countries with natural resources are less likely to democratize due to government control over revenues. The impact of these factors on democratization prospects is complex and contested. Some analysts argue that conditions are causally important for democratization, but examples exist where democratization occurred despite unfavorable conditions. The rationale for U.S. democracy promotion varies, with links to national security, economic interests, moral obligations, and American political culture. There is ongoing debate on the extent to which the U.S. should prioritize democracy promotion in its foreign policy. The debate over democracy promotion in U.S. foreign policy revolves around questions of legitimacy, sovereignty, and national interests. Supporters argue that democratic values are universal, while critics question the imposition of American values on other societies. The extent to which democracy promotion aligns with U.S. national interests and its potential impact on other foreign policy objectives are key points of contention. The United States has the means and capacity to support the spread of democracy and prevent backsliding. Scholars, advocates, and policymakers associate democracy promotion with U.S. interests, believing democracies are more reliable partners and less likely to go to war. Democratic transparency may support international agreements and institutions, strengthening the current order. Scholars debate the importance of the current order in relation to traditional power dynamics. Most agree that democracies rarely engage in military conflict with each other due to mutual respect and peaceful conflict resolution tendencies. However, there is ongoing scholarly debate over the causal explanations for this phenomenon. Scholarly debate continues over the causal explanations for the democratic peace theory, with some arguing that evidence is lacking in historical records. Critics also question the theory's validity. Observers note that threats to U.S. security often come from nondemocracies, suggesting that democratic systems may be less prone to internal conflicts or terrorism. Democracy promotion may conflict with other U.S. foreign policy goals, leading to trade-offs. Emphasizing democracy promotion can strain relations with nondemocratic governments, creating tension and distrust. Tension and distrust between the United States and nondemocratic governments can hinder cooperation on shared counterterrorism or geopolitical goals. The U.S. must decide how to engage with countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In Asia, competition with China may affect relationships with nondemocratic countries like Vietnam. Emphasizing democratic values can strengthen the U.S.'s position against authoritarian competitors. Scholarly research suggests that new democracies or countries in political transition may exhibit nationalism and instability, potentially leading to conflicts. Democracies are generally better at protecting human rights, but without strong safeguards, minority groups may suffer. Conversely, supporting repressive authoritarian regimes for security reasons can have negative consequences. Support for repressive authoritarian governments in the name of security can breed anti-American sentiments among their populations, leading to long-term negative impacts on relations if these regimes fall. Some argue that promoting democracy can address security concerns by fostering political inclusion and the rule of law to tackle terrorism at its roots. Skeptics doubt the US's ability to spread democracy effectively, pointing to failed efforts post-military interventions in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. Democracy promotion experts recognize the challenges of democratization as a complex and uncertain process, with limited external influence. While internal forces drive democratic transitions, the US and other external actors can play a supportive role in certain instances. Evaluating the impact of US democracy promotion efforts is difficult due to various factors affecting democracy in each country. Congress plays a significant role in shaping US policy on democracy promotion. The Trump Administration's stance on democracy promotion may clash with Congress members who prioritize it in U.S. foreign policy. There is a shift towards prioritizing economic and security issues over democracy and human rights promotion. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the \"America First\" policy, separating U.S. foreign policies from U.S. values related to freedom and human dignity. The Trump Administration's stance on democracy promotion may clash with Congress members who prioritize it in U.S. foreign policy. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson emphasized the \"America First\" policy, separating U.S. foreign policies from U.S. values related to freedom and human dignity. The Administration's proposed cuts to democracy promotion programs have drawn criticism. Some scholars argue that the Administration is not adequately defending international institutions. Some observers believe the Trump Administration may be moving away from a leadership role in promoting democracy overseas. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has shown support for democracy promotion, despite the Administration's unclear stance on the issue. In 2018, Pompeo emphasized the importance of the US leading calls for democracy, prosperity, and human rights worldwide. The Trump Administration has highlighted democracy in its foreign policy strategies, particularly towards countries like Venezuela and Iran. However, tensions may arise with Congress over the prioritization of democracy promotion. Some argue for increased U.S. efforts in democracy promotion to prevent a decline, suggesting using high-level diplomacy and aid conditionality. This could involve modifying relations with non-democracies and defending international norms. Trade-offs with other U.S. interests are a concern. Some analysts advocate a \"triage\" approach for democracy promotion, weighing potential risks to prioritize countries. Critics suggest the U.S. should focus on vital interests and democracy at home. Prioritizing freedom of expression, media freedom, and rule of law may help address recent democratic declines. The United States may prioritize diplomatic and programmatic tools focusing on democracy elements, including supporting civil society despite restrictive laws. Initiatives under the Obama Administration aimed to address challenges in civil society space globally. Congress could assess U.S. efforts in combating these impacts and consider new tools to counter international efforts by nondemocratic governments. The State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) has expanded its mandate to counter state-sponsored propaganda and disinformation. Public Diplomacy (PD) grants are being awarded to support partners in exposing and countering foreign propaganda. U.S. international broadcasting entities overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media are also relevant. Congress may consider promoting democracy through capacity building partnerships with other legislatures. The House Democracy Partnership, established in 2005, aims to strengthen democratic institutions by assisting legislatures in emerging democracies. It has worked with partner legislatures in various countries. Congress may need to consider funding levels for democracy promotion programs in light of current challenges to democracy. The Trump Administration's FY2018 request proposed $1.689 billion for democracy promotion assistance, a 32% decrease from FY2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 specified approximately $2.479 billion for democracy promotion programs. The Administration's FY2019 budget proposes $1.480 billion, a 40% decrease from FY2018. Democracy promotion programs are difficult to measure due to long time horizons and other factors. One democracy aid expert notes a lack of in-depth studies on democracy aid impact. Analysts suggest strategic targeting of resources due to funding constraints and external influences. A \"triage\" approach could help inform funding allocations based on program effectiveness and diplomatic considerations. Some scholars suggest considering broader diplomatic efforts and structural conditions when allocating democracy promotion resources. Aligning program goals with U.S. policy and using diplomatic tools like sanctions or aid conditionality can enhance effectiveness. Experts recommend a differentiated allocation of resources among major funders based on funding models and political openness in target countries. Some scholars suggest broader diplomatic efforts and considering structural conditions when allocating democracy promotion resources. They recommend aligning program goals with U.S. policy and using tools like sanctions or aid conditionality for effectiveness. Analysts call for renewed international collaboration in defense of democracy, potentially including new initiatives among like-minded democracies outside of Western Europe and North America. Multilateral initiatives could combat perceptions that democracy promotion is solely linked to U.S. geostrategic interests. Existing democracy-focused initiatives like the Community of Democracies could be utilized for this purpose. Some suggest utilizing democracy-focused initiatives such as the Community of Democracies and the Open Government Partnership to counter efforts by nondemocracies to challenge democratic norms in international institutions. Analysts propose building explicit democracy caucuses within organizations like the U.N. and NATO, and establishing multilateral groupings of democracies to combat political interference by authoritarian countries. However, multilateral efforts may face limitations due to complexity and differing interests. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the U.N. Human Rights Council and funding cuts to human rights organizations have raised concerns about the promotion of democratic values in multilateral venues. Some argue that democratic principles alone may not be enough to drive collective action among nations. This has led to discussions on the limitations and challenges of multilateral efforts in promoting democracy and human rights norms. The trends analyzed in the report suggest constraints on democratic expansion globally, posing challenges for policymakers. Congress may face policy considerations related to U.S. foreign policy's strategic orientation and democracy promotion. Differences in views on democracy promotion between Congress and the executive branch may raise questions about Congress's institutional role in U.S. foreign affairs. Freedom House's Freedom in the World report measures civil liberties and political rights in countries annually since 1972. The methodology is based on the UN Declaration of Human Rights and aims for freedom in liberal democratic societies. Scores determine overall ratings guided by in-house and external analysts. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index evaluates political rights and civil liberties using methodological questions, including the independence of the judiciary. Analysts rely on various sources for information. The index, which started in 2006, is based on 60 indicators, some of which go beyond the core definition of democracy. The Democracy Index evaluates political rights and civil liberties using methodological questions, including indicators on political participation and public confidence in the government. Various sources, including public opinion surveys like the World Values Survey, are used to determine indicators. Other democracy-related indexes and databases are also utilized by policymakers and scholars. The Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem) and Polity IV are global democracy measures with different focuses. V-Dem includes over 350 indicators across five indexes, while Polity IV is a minimalist measure concentrating on procedural aspects. These measures are correlated with Freedom House's measure, but disagreements arise for countries in the middle range of democracy. Other major indexes include Freedom House's Nations in Transit report, the Bertelsmann Transformation Index, the Electoral Integrity Project, and The World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators. Critiques of Global Democracy Indexes highlight disagreements between different indexes due to varying conceptions of democracy, sources, evaluation methods, and indicator selection. Some argue that popular indexes may have ideological biases or prioritize advocacy over scientific rigor. Organizations producing the indexes aim to reduce political bias in their processes. Organizations producing democracy indexes aim to reduce political bias and ensure methodological rigor. CRS does not endorse any specific index's value or accuracy. Selected CRS reports on democracy-related developments in various regions are listed in the report. The curr_chunk discusses various CRS reports on human rights, internet freedom, U.S. relations with Cambodia, Burma, Iran, Sub-Saharan Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Latin America, and Venezuela. The reports cover key issues, challenges, and U.S. responses in these regions. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Cuba sanctions, U.S. international broadcasting, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation."
