    "content": "On January 5, 2011, the House of Representatives amended House Rule XII to require all bills and joint resolutions introduced to state the specific powers granted to Congress in the Constitution. The House Clerk has the authority to reject any bill or joint resolution that does not include this statement. This rule does not apply to House Resolutions. The House Rule XII amendment requires bills and joint resolutions to include a statement of constitutional authority. This rule does not apply to House Resolutions or Senate bills and joint resolutions. The statement is not required to be part of the text of the proposed bill or joint resolution. The House Rule XII amendment mandates a statement of constitutional authority for bills and joint resolutions, separate from the text, to be signed by the sponsoring Member and made publicly available. The rule allows for updates or amendments to the statement throughout the legislative process. The House Rule XII amendment requires a statement of constitutional authority for bills and joint resolutions to be signed by the sponsoring Member and made publicly available. The rule allows for updates or amendments to the statement during the legislative process, with no restrictions on how Members determine their own basis for constitutional authority. Members can rely on various sources, including personal interpretations of the Constitution or Supreme Court opinions. Members can rely on various sources for their statement of constitutional authority, including personal interpretations of the Constitution, documents from the Constitutional Convention, sources published during the ratification of the Constitution, commentaries on the Constitution, academic articles, advice from support agencies or outside groups, and any other relevant and authoritative source. The rule \"as specifically as practicable\" suggests citing a specific clause of the Constitution for authority, but does not require it. The Clerk can reject bills without a constitutional authority statement, but once included, Members have no recourse even if they disagree with it. The House rule requires Members to identify the constitutional authority for a bill, not to analyze its constitutionality. This distinction is crucial as it may lead to different results. The rule asks which part of the Constitution grants Congress the power to enact the proposed bill. The House rule requires Members to identify the constitutional authority for a bill, not to analyze its constitutionality. The rule does not require assessing if the bill aligns with the Constitution, but rather specifies the constitutional basis for Congress to act. For example, citing the Commerce Clause as the basis for Congress's authority to act would fulfill the rule's requirement. The House rule requires Members to state the constitutional basis for authority to act, not to consider constitutional limitations on Congress's authority. The rule does not require analyzing the constitutionality of a bill, but rather specifying the constitutional authority for Congress to act. The rule allows Congress to rely on multiple constitutional provisions for authority to enact a bill, as seen in the example of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). PPACA cites the Commerce Clause and other constitutional provisions for its authority. Legislation governing internal rules and procedures in Congress is authorized by Article I, \u00a75, clause 2, not the Commerce Clause. The possibility of conflicting results between Congress's authority to act and an act's constitutionality is evident. Litigation over the constitutionality of specific provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) has resulted in conflicting judicial decisions. The House of Representatives introduces various bills, which can be categorized into authorization legislation, appropriations legislation, legislation with federal fund conditions, and legislation repealing laws. This categorization helps determine the constitutional authority of proposed legislation. Authorization legislation is commonly introduced during a Congress. Authorization bills proposed during a Congress establish or continue agencies or programs, providing legal authority for their operation. Specific clauses in the Constitution, such as Article I, \u00a78, determine the authorization of bills based on the subject matter. For example, military programs are authorized by clauses 12, 13, or 14, while the FAA is authorized by the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause, authorized by Article I, \u00a78, clause 3, serves as the basis for constitutional authority for regulating aviation. The House rule only requires a basis for constitutional authority, not an assessment of constitutionality. Many bills cite the Commerce Clause for authority. Funding for federal government activities is typically through annual appropriations bills, including regular, supplemental, and continuing resolutions. Annual appropriations bills, supplemental appropriations bills for emergencies, and continuing appropriation resolutions provide funding for federal government activities. Larger bills may include provisions for funding, even if they have other purposes. Members of Congress may introduce bills with a statement of constitutional authority for parts not covered by the Appropriations Clause. The Appropriations Clause allows for bills that incentivize states to perform certain functions, such as maintaining a minimum drinking age to receive federal highway funds. This is authorized by the \"general welfare\" language in Article I, \u00a78, clause 1, known as the Spending Clause. The constitutionality of specific bills under this clause is a separate issue. The Spending Clause allows for bills incentivizing states to perform certain functions. The constitutionality of repealing laws, agencies, or programs may be elusive as there is no direct language addressing the power of repeal in the Constitution. One argument is that the authority to repeal is the same as the authority to create, citing the Commerce or Spending Clauses as sources of constitutional authority. The Department of Education was created without clear constitutional authority. Legislation citing the Tenth Amendment may not meet House rules as it is a limitation on Congress's authority. The Congressional Review Act allows for the revocation of agency regulations. The Congressional Review Act allows for the introduction of joint resolutions of disapproval of federal agency rules within 60 legislative days. Resolutions must be presented to the President for approval or veto, potentially becoming law. The CRA provides a statutory basis for resolutions, but the House rule requires a statement of constitutional authority. Joint resolutions under the CRA may benefit from expedited procedures in Congress, with the constitutional authority being Article I, \u00a75, clause 2. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to determine its proceedings, with various powers overlapping and multiple constitutional authorities potentially authorizing Congress's control over a subject. Case law can expand or limit these authorizations, and implied powers like the Necessary and Proper Clause may further extend congressional authority. A list of legislation types and related constitutional provisions is provided, along with the potential for legislative power expansion beyond explicit authorities through case law analysis. The treatise Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation by the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service provides an analysis of relevant case law on all provisions of the Constitution.
