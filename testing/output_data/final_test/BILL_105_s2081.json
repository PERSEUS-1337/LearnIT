    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998\". The Congress of the United States emphasizes the importance of achieving \"Full Spectrum Dominance\" in military operations through technological innovation and information superiority. The global spread of advanced technology poses challenges such as information warfare, weapons of mass destruction, cruise missiles, and urban operations. The United States is currently in a secure international relations phase, but the future security environment is uncertain. It is crucial to focus Defense investments on research to address new threats and achieve Full Spectrum Dominance. The Department of Defense and Department of Energy play key roles in supporting research in various disciplines critical for information superiority and military technological innovation. The current budget plan for the Defense Science and Technology Program is flat through fiscal year 2003, while the budget for nonproliferation science and technology activities at the Department of Energy will decline. These budget plans do not align with the vision of Full Spectrum Dominance or the threats on the horizon, posing a serious threat to national security in the next 15 years. The Congress must establish a long-term vision and funding plan for the Defense Science and Technology Program to address future threats and achieve Full Spectrum Dominance. Additionally, a robust vision and funding plan are needed for nonproliferation science and technology activities at the Department of Energy. The purpose and funding requirements for the Defense Science and Technology Program and nonproliferation science and technology activities at the Department of Energy need to be established by Congress to address future threats and achieve Full Spectrum Dominance. The Act aims to create a ten-year budget plan to transform the military and reduce the threat from weapons of mass destruction. It includes objectives to increase the Defense Science and Technology Program budget by 2.0 percent over inflation each year from 2000 to 2008, and to increase the budget for nonproliferation science and technology activities at the Department of Energy. The Act aims to increase the budget for nonproliferation science and technology activities by at least 2.0 percent annually over inflation, exceeding the previous year's budget request. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR THE DEFENSE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. The Secretary of Defense can use funds from various Department of Defense accounts to support projects in the Defense Science and Technology Program. The program aims to leverage commercial research and technology for the benefit of the Department of Defense, focusing on developing defense unique technology. The Defense Science and Technology Program focuses on developing defense unique technology, military useful commercial technology, and adapting commercial technology for military purposes. Key objectives include sustaining research capabilities critical to the Department of Defense, educating the next generation of scientists and engineers, and supporting Defense Experimental efforts. The Defense Science and Technology Program focuses on developing defense unique technology, military useful commercial technology, and adapting commercial technology for military purposes. Key objectives include sustaining research capabilities critical to the Department of Defense, educating the next generation of scientists and engineers, and supporting research programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Defense Science and Technology Program refers to work funded in Department of Defense accounts 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3. Nonproliferation science and technology activities involve preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and are funded by the Department of Energy under specific programs and projects. Projects under the Nuclear Safeguards and Security program, national capability for radiological threats, combating nuclear materials trafficking, and developing technology for emergencies involving weapons of mass destruction fall under the Office of Nonproliferation and National Security. The Office of Defense Programs oversees program direction costs for programs and projects related to terrorist threats."
