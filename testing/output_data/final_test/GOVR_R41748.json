    "content": "China, the world's most populous country with 1.4 billion people, has seen significant economic growth in the last three decades, averaging a 9.8% annual increase in GDP. This growth has led to a surge in energy demand, prompting China to double its electric power generating capacity every decade, reaching 1,100 GW in 2011. As the largest producer and consumer of coal globally, coal currently fuels 66% of China's electricity generation. However, the country is focusing on reducing air pollution caused by coal combustion. China is among the most technically advanced countries in the world, but burning coal leads to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This has prompted China to decrease coal usage and focus on renewable energy sources. Limited domestic reserves of coal, natural gas, and oil are also driving this shift. China has ambitious targets for developing hydropower and non-hydropower renewable energy resources, with a focus on sustainable solutions for its growing energy needs. China has made significant progress in developing renewable energy sources, with a focus on wind power. The country has seen a substantial increase in installed wind power capacity, from 567 MW in 2003 to 75,000 MW in 2012. This growth has also provided opportunities for China's domestic renewable energy technology industries and manufacturing capabilities. Government incentives in both China and the United States support renewable energy projects, encouraging the development of wind, solar, hydropower, and biomass power. Energy projects in China depend on the stage of development, with direct subsidies for early research and tax incentives for later manufacturing. Most large industries in China are state-owned, including the five major power generation companies. The State Grid Corporation covers northern and western provinces, while the Southern Power Grid covers southern provinces. China's energy policy is now guided by the National Energy Commission (NEC), with a focus on clean energy development to address air pollution and climate change concerns. The central government drives renewable energy policies, leading to significant investments in clean energy technologies. In 2013, China topped global investment with $61.3 billion in clean energy funding. China led global investment in 2013 with $61.3 billion in clean energy funding, a 4% decrease from 2012. This marked China's first decline in clean energy spending in over a decade. The country established programs for renewable energy technology research and development under the Ministry of Science and Technology, including the Key Technology R&D Program and the 863 Program. The 863 Program, established in March 1986, aims to boost innovation in high technology sectors for China's global market presence. It focuses on developing civilian and dual-use technologies like satellites, computers, robotics, biotechnology, and space exploration. The program invested $3 billion in research from 2001 to 2005, with additional funding approved in 2008. The 973 Program, focusing on basic research, complements the 863 Program and emphasizes energy and sustainable development. The National Science and Technology Committee established a program in 1997 that funded 382 projects from 1998 to 2008 with a total investment of $1.3 billion. The Five-Year Plans (FYP) guide China's economic growth, with the 10th FYP budgeting $2.4 billion for 12 \"mega-projects\" based on the 863 and National Key Technologies Programs. The 11th FYP focuses on energy technologies, with $172 million allocated for hydrogen, fuel cells, energy efficiency, clean coal, and renewable energy. The 973 Program under the 11th FYP emphasizes utility-scale renewable energy and new energy development. The 12th FYP will cover 2011 to 2015. The 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) in China, covering 2011 to 2015, focuses on energy efficiency and renewable energy as part of strategic emerging industries. Specific investment goals will be implemented in various sectors such as biotechnology, new energy, high-end equipment manufacturing, energy conservation, environmental protection, clean-energy vehicles, new materials, and next-generation information technology. These industries are expected to drive China's economy and expand into global markets. The Electricity Law of 1995 centralized control of the utility industry in China, promoting safe development and identifying renewable energy for rural electrification. The Energy Conservation Law of 1997 guides energy resource use and promotes energy-saving measures. Laws lack specific implementation details, with the NDRC determining how goals will be achieved. The Energy Conservation Law of 1997 guides the use of energy resources, promotes energy-saving technologies, and supports research in energy conservation. It prioritizes energy conservation investment projects over energy development projects, with funds allocated for rational energy utilization and development of renewable energy sources. The Energy Conservation Law of 1997 prioritizes rational energy utilization and development of renewable energy sources. Article 38 requires government to use renewable energy resources sustainably, especially in rural areas, while Article 39 focuses on improving energy efficiency through various technologies. The Energy Conservation Law of 1997 emphasizes the development and dissemination of energy-efficient technologies, including clean coal technologies and other universal energy-efficient technologies. It also directs trades and professions to seek and promote energy-efficient solutions to replace outdated technologies. The law aims to consider sustainability while supporting economic growth by lowering financial and environmental costs. China's 2007 Climate Change Program focuses on demand-side management to reduce energy intensity through various measures like energy conservation plans, technology adoption, and R&D. The Law for Prevention and Control of Air Pollution of 2000 promotes renewable energy to prevent atmospheric air pollution. The Renewable Energy Law of 2005 in China promotes the development and utilization of renewable energy, sets national targets for renewable energy development, mandates grid connection and purchase of electricity from renewable energy generators, offers preferential loans and tax benefits for renewable energy projects. The Renewable Energy Law of 2005 in China promotes renewable energy development, sets national targets, mandates grid connection, offers loans, tax benefits, and aims to raise renewable energy share to 10% by 2010 and 15% by 2020 through the Medium and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy. The Renewable Energy Law in China mandates market share requirements for non-hydropower renewable energy, with targets set for power generation and capacity by 2020. Grid companies are incentivized to connect to renewable energy projects, and fines are imposed on power companies that refuse to comply with purchasing electricity from renewable energy generators. China aims for 15% of total energy consumption to come from renewable sources. China aims for 15% of total energy consumption to come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020. The 11th FYP targeted a 20% reduction in energy intensity, with the 12th FYP aiming for an additional 16% reduction by 2015. China's renewable energy development goals include various technologies, with biomass facing challenges in transportation efficiency. Biomass electric production in China was estimated at 5,500 MW. Biomass electric production in China is expected to increase to 30,000 MW by 2020, with over 80% of the population in rural areas using biomass. Biogas from livestock manure can be up to 70% methane and is used for household cooking and heating. Larger biogas projects can provide electricity and thermal energy, but biomass is a small part of China's overall electricity production. Development of biomass projects connected to the grid will be limited to areas with abundant biomass resources. Biomass electric power generation in China is expected to be limited to areas with abundant biomass resources. Biomass power projects are eligible for a feed-in tariff and production subsidy. Willow trees are planted to combat desertification, with a power plant in Inner Mongolia using willow for energy production. The ashes from combustion can be used as fertilizer. China's focus on biofuels as a supplement to transportation energy supplies and to reduce air emissions is supported by over $290 million allocated for research and development. The country's emphasis is on using marginal lands and non-food crops for biofuels production, with specific targets for bioethanol and biodiesel. China, a net food importing country, prioritizes food security, hence the focus on non-food crop sources of bioethanol. As of 2009, China was the world's third-largest ethanol producer. Additionally, China is the world's largest hydropower producer, with plans to increase installed capacity to 290 GW by 2015. China plans to increase its hydropower capacity from 229 GW to 290 GW by 2015, with new dams to be installed on various rivers. The goal is to double hydropower capacity to 380 GW by 2020, with an estimated potential of 542 GW. China has passed laws to mitigate environmental impacts of dam-building. In 2007, the country set a goal of 1.8 GW for solar power. China set a goal of 1.8 GW for solar power in 2007. Initiatives like \"Golden Roofs\" and \"Golden Sun\" provided subsidies and incentives for solar projects, including feed-in tariffs and cost coverage for utility-scale projects. Provinces also offer local incentives for solar development. In 2009, the Jiangsu provincial government established a FIT for solar power with rates of $0.31, $0.54, and $0.63 per kWh for different types of installations. A national solar FIT was introduced in 2011 at $0.19 per kWh but was reduced to $0.16 per kWh. In 2013, China extended the FIT program to cover distributed generation, offering subsidies ranging from $0.14 to $0.16 per kWh based on solar radiation levels. PV systems are eligible for a 20-year subsidy of $0.07 per kWh, with additional incentives available for distributed systems. China's solar PV industry saw significant growth, with manufacturers producing 63% of global solar panels by 2011. The country aimed to boost domestic solar capacity, reaching 19 GW in 2013 and planning to increase to 50 GW by 2020. Incentives were provided for surplus electricity sent back to the grid, and plans were made for large-scale CSP facilities in Gansu and Shaanxi. China aims to develop 3 GW of CSP by 2015, increasing to 10 GW by 2020. Wind capacity was 91 GW in 2013, with plans to reach 200 GW by 2020. China surpassed the MLTPRE target of 30 GW by 2020 and became the world leader in installed wind power capacity. However, grid-connected capacity lagged behind installed capacity by over 30%. As of 2012, China had 75 GW of installed capacity, with about 17% not connected to the grid. Plans are in place to increase investment in the transmission system to connect remote wind regions. China plans to increase investment in its transmission system to connect remote wind farms to population centers. Government support for wind power began in 2001 with tax cuts and a tender process for project concessions in 2003. Projects below 50 MW can be developed by local authorities, while those over 50 MW are approved by the NDRC, which also sets electricity prices. The NDRC approves wind power projects over 50 MW and sets electricity prices. Local governments can approve projects under 50 MW, but prices are subject to NDRC approval. The regional grid power company enters into long-term power purchase agreements with selected bidders, guaranteed by the national government. The bidding process determines the in-grid tariff and the amount of electricity provided to the grid. The goal is to achieve economies of scale and attract foreign investment in China's wind energy sector. Initial results have been mixed. In 2005, China established a purchase system for renewable electricity, but faced challenges with low power prices in wind energy tenders. To address this, the government adjusted the evaluation process. By 2007, a target of 15% renewable energy consumption by 2020 was set. The NDRC replaced public bidding with FITs for wind power in 2009, tailored to regional wind resources and construction conditions. China's wind power potential is vast, with onshore capacity estimated between 700 GW and 1,200 GW. Offshore wind resources are largely untapped, with a potential of over 750 million kilowatt-hours. Developers must be Chinese-funded enterprises or Sino-foreign joint ventures with majority Chinese ownership to bid for concessions. China aims to establish 30 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2020. Financial support in China for renewable energy includes subsidies, tax policies, pricing mechanisms, and a reward scheme for green production. Subsidies cover overhead costs, technology research, and local electrification projects, while tax incentives can be technology-specific. Tax incentives for renewable energy in China can be technology-specific and come from central or local governments. Pricing is determined by contracts between projects and utilities, with subsidies funded by a rate fee charged to all electricity users. Industrial users saw a doubling of the fee to about 0.8% of their electricity bill in 2009. However, issues with payments into the renewable energy fund caused delays in reimbursing generators, leading the NDRC to shift the burden of funding to the industrial sector. In 2013, the NDRC doubled the industrial surcharge for renewable energy funding to 0.015 yuan per kWh. China allocated over 210 billion yuan for environmental protection and energy conservation as part of an economic stimulus plan. The country is now using more domestic manufacturing capacity for clean energy, with incentives and subsidies in place. Low interest rates and procurement policies support renewable energy projects. The Government Procurement Law of 2002 established rules for government procurement of domestic goods, construction, and services. In 2005, the NDRC formalized domestic content rules for renewable energy projects. The NDRC oversees the construction of wind farms under the Wind Power Concession Project. Domestic content for wind turbines was determined by the percentage of components manufactured and assembled in China. Local content requirements were abolished in 2009 with the introduction of the wind power FIT. The Chinese government provides financial incentives for renewable energy projects, including a 50% investment subsidy for solar power projects and a $0.04 per kWh subsidy for biomass power projects. Incentives for non-food sourced biofuels production are also available. Ethanol production in 2006 was 1.56 million tons compared to 0.19 million tons for biodiesel, with subsidies for ethanol at $115. In 2007, China provided flexible subsidies to biofuels producers to offset losses from low crude oil prices. Farmers received subsidies for forest and biofuel crop production. China controls transportation fuel prices, setting ethanol at 91% of gasoline prices. Licensed ethanol producers receive support through subsidies, tax exemptions, and blending programs. The biodiesel industry in China is less controlled compared to ethanol. China's biodiesel industry is dominated by small-scale producers using waste cooking oil and animal fats as feedstock. Producers sell biodiesel directly to users without taxation or fuel subsidies. Total support for ethanol and biodiesel is expected to reach $1.2 billion by 2020. China provides substantial domestic subsidies to its green energy industries, but faced complaints from the United States regarding illegal subsidies for wind power and solar PV exports. China's export restrictions on rare-earth elements (REEs, produced by China) were deemed unfair by the United Steelworkers Union due to a 10% export tariff and a 40% cut in exports in 2010. The WTO ruled against China twice, stating that their restrictions on REEs were inconsistent with WTO rules. China denied allegations of unfair trade practices, citing U.S. clean energy industry incentives as comparable subsidies. The United States lacks a comprehensive national policy for promoting renewable energy technologies, with federal incentives often short-term and not fully funded. However, biofuels receive significant support through the Renewable Fuel Standard, mandating blending goals through 2022. The U.S. lacks a comprehensive national policy for promoting renewable energy technologies, with federal incentives often short-term and not fully funded. State deployment initiatives drive much of the renewable electricity installed capacity, with 30 states having a renewable portfolio standard. Federal tax incentives, like the Investment Tax Credit, have aided deployment, especially in solar PV installations. The U.S. Department of Energy has been the key federal agency involved in energy R&D, driven by energy prices in the late 20th century. The federal government has been a major source of energy R&D funding, investing $91.5 billion from 1978 to 1999. The Department of Energy (DOE) plays a significant role in energy research, administering national laboratories and technology centers. Government policies influence private sector investment in energy R&D. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977 by the Department of Energy Organization Act, leading to the National Energy Act of 1978 focusing on fossil fuel conservation. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) in 1978 encouraged electricity generation from renewable sources. The Energy Security Act of 1980 brought renewable energy to the forefront, providing funding for research in areas such as biofuels. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 addressed various energy topics. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT5) focused on energy efficiency, conservation, alternative fuels, and renewable energy technologies. EPACT set goals for energy management and authorized subsidies for wind and other alternative energy technologies. EPACT5 extended the Production Tax Credit for wind and biomass technologies, funded renewable energy development, and required electric utilities to offer net metering. EPACT5 also established the Renewable Fuel Standard for blending renewable fuel with gasoline. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) focused on energy security and efficiency, providing funds for renewable energy R&D. It extended the Renewable Fuel Standard program to blend 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel with gasoline and diesel by 2022. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) allocated over $45 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs to aid economic recovery. In FY2010, significant funding was allocated for energy R&D programs, energy technology grants, electric power transmission grid infrastructure development, and renewable energy tax incentives. A temporary provision allowed projects eligible for the Investment Tax Credit to receive a grant covering 30% of project costs. The U.S. renewable energy sectors, including hydropower and biomass for electric power, were highlighted. Biomass is a conventional renewable electricity technology, accounting for 23.5% of non-hydropower renewable electricity in the US in 2010. Biomass combustion is mature but not widely used or efficient, except in combined heat and power applications. Co-firing biomass with coal is more efficient and cost-effective, often categorized under coal power generation. Biomass gasification technologies could improve efficiency for producing synthesis gas or hydrogen. Deployment of newer gasification technologies is needed for scaling up plants economically. Wood-burning stoves and solar water heaters are common residential renewable energy applications. The Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that 11 GW of biomass capacity could be available by 2030, with a focus on cellulosic and other advanced feedstocks. Hydropower has potential in enhancing existing facilities, with up to 12GW of additional capacity. Hydropower has the potential to add up to 12GW of capacity at top non-powered dam sites in the United States. The DOE identified around 5,400 sites suitable for small hydro projects, which could increase U.S. hydroelectric power generation by over 50%. Solar power industry in the U.S. had 7.7 GW capacity in 2012, with an estimated 29 GW potential by 2030. Solar power technologies can produce high output during peak energy demand times. Concentrating solar power thermal plants with heat storage are considered for large generating plants in sun-rich areas of the western United States. Solar thermal hot water heating is a growing application in the U.S. The key federal incentive for the solar power industry has been the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), allowing businesses to receive a tax credit for up to 30% of the expense. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the solar investment tax credit to 2016 and allowed utility companies to utilize the credit. The US had 59 GW of wind power capacity in 2012, with a potential to reach 77 GW by 2030. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) provides a $0.023 per kWh credit for wind power, but has expired multiple times, impacting industry installations. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind power was extended through 2013 under the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA). The PTC expiration date was changed to a construction start date for all qualifying electricity-producing technologies. Offshore wind power in the US began in 2010 with the approval of the first offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound. The Cape Wind project is the first U.S. offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound, with 130 turbines and a capacity of up to 468 MW. The U.S. has a potential offshore wind power capacity of 908 GW. Government incentives and procurement requirements exist at federal and state levels, with goals for renewable energy use. EPACT5 mandates federal agencies to increase renewable energy purchases to 7.5% by 2013, with double credit for on-site generation. EO 13423 requires half of the renewable energy to be from new sources. The EPACT renewable energy requirement mandates federal agencies to increase renewable energy purchases to 7.5% by 2013, with a focus on new renewable energy sources preferably sited on agency property. Non-electric renewable energy sources like solar heating and cooling systems can also be used to meet the requirement. The Renewable Energy Production Incentive (REPI) under EPACT provides incentive payments for new projects generating renewable electricity from solar, wind, and biomass. The program offers $0.015 per kWh for the first 10 years of operation, subject to annual appropriations. REPI was reauthorized for FY2006 through FY2026 but has not been funded since 2010. The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) to support renewable energy and energy efficiency projects for rural small businesses and farmers through grants and loan guarantees. The program also provides funding for energy audits and renewable energy technology assistance. The 2014 Farm Bill extended the REAP program with mandatory funding of $50 million annually. In China, urbanization is expected to continue, with 200-300 million people moving to urban areas in the next 20 years, leading to a shift towards increasing domestic consumption in the 12th Five-Year Plan. China's national government controls many industries and sets economic development goals in Five-Year Plans. The country is shifting towards a market focus, with a growing private sector and emphasis on developing new industries like renewable energy. China has made strides in manufacturing wind turbines and solar panels to meet its own renewable electricity needs. China has developed its domestic renewable energy industry to produce renewable electricity for its growing energy needs. The government supports the industry by mandating minimum deployment levels for renewable technologies and implementing a national feed-in tariff. China's energy efficiency and conservation are top priorities in China, with a focus on reducing energy use and cutting demand. Energy intensity decreased by 19.6% during the 11th FYP, but the 12th FYP may not see the same level of energy savings due to the closure of less efficient power plants and steel mills. Structural changes in the economic structure and technological improvements are expected to drive energy savings in the 12th FYP. Energy efficiency benchmarks have been set for China's top 1,000 energy-consuming industries. China's top 1,000 energy-consuming industries in China have energy reduction goals set, accounting for a significant portion of national and industrial energy usage. New energy-efficient building codes are being developed since 2005, focusing on heating, ventilation, lighting, and power use. Transmission has been identified as a weak link in China's electricity planning, with targets set for renewable energy generation but challenges in grid connection and integration, especially for remote wind power. China's grid companies must accept subsidized wind power, but costs of building transmission lines to connect to wind farms (especially those in remote regions) are not subsidized. As much as one-third of wind power generation in China is not connected to the grid due to a lack of transmission capacity. To help remedy this, the State Grid Corporation has begun to build a pilot \"Smart Grid\" in China's larger cities to integrate renewable energy sources. Formal goals for a Smart Grid are expected to be incorporated into China's 12th Five-Year Plan, with a \"unified strong and smart grid\" to be built nationwide by 2020. China's transmission system, like that of the United States, faces challenges in connecting renewable resources in remote areas. China has started building efficient ultra-high voltage (UHV) transmission lines to reduce losses and improve connectivity. The cost of developing the transmission system will be significant in both countries. China's State Grid Corporation plans to invest $88 billion through 2020 to build ultra-high voltage (UHV) lines, which can reduce transmission line losses and transmit more power over longer distances. The United States has a market-driven economy, and goals for increased use of renewable energy include energy security, cleaner air, and sustainability concepts. Government regulations in both countries aim to reduce pollution and emissions from power generation. In the United States, there is a need for federal policy to drive renewable energy development and create national demand for renewable electricity. Renewable energy technologies are seen as not mature enough, requiring fossil resources for reliability. Implementing a renewable electricity standard and a FIT could help increase deployment of renewable energy technologies in the U.S. The United States relies heavily on venture capital for clean energy technology development, driving energy innovation in the country. Creating green jobs through a competitive renewable energy manufacturing industry is a key economic policy goal, requiring significant federal investments beyond tax credits and loan guarantees. The United States traditionally relies on market forces and tax incentives to promote new technologies, but there are factors questioning this approach for innovation and deployment in the renewable energy sector. Other countries are investing heavily in government-funded resources to build renewable energy technology leadership and increase global market share, indicating a shift towards greater reliance on the renewable energy industry for economic growth and job creation. Factors challenging the traditional approach to innovation and deployment of renewable energy technologies include scarce investment dollars due to the recent recession, aggressive government support in other nations surpassing the U.S., and limitations of the existing low-cost energy system. Calls for more aggressive governmental intervention to accelerate U.S. renewable energy activities have been made. China faced challenges in meeting energy intensity goals set in its 11th and 12th Five-Year Plans. Despite reducing energy intensity by 14.4% from 2005 to 2009, there was a 3.2% increase in the first quarter of 2010. The 12th FYP aimed to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 16% and carbon emissions by 17% from 2011 to 2015. However, progress has been slow, with only a 5.5% drop in energy consumption per unit of GDP in the first two years of the plan. Meeting the 16% energy intensity reduction target may be challenging if GDP continues to grow. China needs to reduce annual energy consumption by 3.84% to achieve its goals. China aims to reduce annual energy consumption by 3.84% over the next three years. The United States heavily relies on coal for power generation. Clean coal technologies are part of China's clean energy future, along with renewable electricity which is set to contribute 15% of its energy needs by 2020. Targets, planning, and investment are in place to achieve China's renewable energy goals. Both countries can explore unconventional natural gas sources like coalbed methane and gas shales. The potential for abundant natural gas production from tight shale gas formations could impact the development of renewable energy."
