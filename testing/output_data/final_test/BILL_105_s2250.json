    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998\". Congress recognizes the constitutional authority of State governments to govern according to the needs and desires of the people. Federal laws should be limited to powers delegated by the Constitution, as intended by the framers. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the United States to the States or the people. The Tenth Amendment reserves powers not delegated to the United States to the States or the people, and courts should strictly construe Federal laws interfering with State powers in favor of State authority. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION. On or after January 1, 1999, any statute enacted by Congress must include a declaration stating that Congress has the authority delegated by the Constitution, Congress is more competent than states in governing the area, and if the statute interferes with state powers, Congress intends to do so. Congress must make specific factual findings to support the declarations in statutes enacted after January 1, 1999. SEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER. In General, any bill, joint resolution, or amendment must include a declaration of congressional intent as required under section 3. Rulemaking for this section is part of the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, applicable only to matters in section 3 and supersedes inconsistent rules. The rules of the Senate or House of Representatives can be changed at any time in the same manner as any other rule. SEC. 5. EXECUTIVE PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW. Section 559a of title 5, United States Code, prohibits agencies from preempting State law unless authorized by statute and in cases of direct conflict with Federal power. Any regulatory preemption must be narrowly tailored to achieve statutory objectives. When an agency proposes to preempt State law through rulemaking or other agency action, affected States must be provided notice and an opportunity to comment. This includes notifying the Governor, Attorney General, and legislative leaders of each State. Preemptive rules must be clearly identified in the Federal Register. The Federal Government's intent to preempt State or local government powers must be explicitly described in rules, but they should not override any existing State or local laws. Each agency must publish a plan in the Federal Register for periodic review of rules that preempt State or local powers to determine if changes are needed to minimize their impact. Nonbinding regulations are also mentioned. (b) Nonbinding Regulations.--Federal rules or regulations issued after January 1, 1999, inconsistent with section 559a of title 5, United States Code, are not binding on State or local governments and do not preempt their laws. (c) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, is updated to include the new section 559a. SEC. 6. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. No statute enacted after the date of enactment of this Act shall preempt any State or local government law unless there is an explicit declaration of intent to preempt or a direct conflict that cannot be reconciled. Ambiguities in this Act or any other US law shall be construed in favor of preserving the authority of the States and the people. Severability clause: If any part of the Act is deemed invalid, it will not affect the rest of the Act or its application to others. SEC. 7. Any funds received by a State under Federal law must be appropriated by the State legislature as per the law's terms. SEC. 8. An annual report on statutory preemption is required. The Congressional Research Service must provide a report on Federal statutory preemption of State and local government powers within 90 days after each Congress adjourns. The report includes a list of preempting Federal statutes, summaries of legislation, court cases on preemption, and other relevant information determined by the Director. The Congressional Research Service must provide a report on Federal statutory preemption of State and local government powers within 90 days after each Congress adjourns. The report includes a list of preempting Federal statutes, summaries of legislation, court cases on preemption, and other relevant information determined by the Director. Copies of the report shall be submitted to the President and the chairman of the appropriate committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
