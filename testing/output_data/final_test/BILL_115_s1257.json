    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act\". It includes findings related to foster care placement. The Congress finds that the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) was established in 1960 to facilitate the placement of children in foster and adoptive homes across state lines. Children waiting for placement in another state often face delays due to the outdated and burdensome ICPC process. The National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise (NEICE) was launched in 2014 to streamline the process of placing children in loving homes across state lines. States using this system have reduced administrative costs and staff time, allowing caseworkers to focus more on helping children. Since NEICE was launched in 2014, placement time for interstate foster care has decreased by 30%. States using this system have reduced the time to identify a family for a child and prepare paperwork for the ICPC process from 24 business days to 13 business days. The State Plan Requirement is outlined in Section 3. Section 471(a)(25) of the Social Security Act is amended to include the use of an electronic interstate case-processing system by October 1, 2027 for states other than Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. Additionally, Indian Tribes are exempt from the state plan requirement to have procedures for using an electronic interstate case-processing system. The amendments exempt Indian tribes from using an electronic interstate case-processing system under the Social Security Act, with an effective date set for the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter after the enactment of the Act. The State plan developed under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act must meet additional requirements imposed by recent amendments. The plan will not be considered failing to meet these requirements until after the first regular session of the State legislature following the enactment of the Act. If the State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session. Funding allocated for developing an electronic system to expedite interstate placement of children in foster care, guardianship, or adoption. Funding is provided for the development of an electronic interstate case-processing system to expedite the placement of children in foster care, guardianship, or adoption across state lines. The system aims to exchange data and documents efficiently to achieve faster placements. The funding aims to reduce time for children to find permanent living arrangements across state lines, improve administrative processes in foster care, and facilitate timely communication and placement decisions for interstate placements. Activities to be funded and sequencing are described, along with strategies for implementation. The Secretary may provide funds to States for integrating programs and services for children placed across State lines. Priority will be given to States not yet connected to the electronic interstate case-processing system. States receiving funding must use it to connect with or enhance services provided by the electronic system. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress and the public on the impact of the electronic interstate case-processing system on the time it takes to place children across State lines, as well as the number of cases processed through the system. The Secretary will report to Congress and the public on the progress of States in implementing the electronic interstate case-processing system and its impact on child safety, well-being, administrative costs, and caseworker time spent on placing children across State lines. The Secretariat for the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children and the States will assess how the electronic interstate case-processing system can better serve and protect children in the child welfare system by connecting with other data systems and simplifying reporting on sex trafficking victims and missing foster children. The curr_chunk focuses on improving state compliance with background check requirements for child welfare, including checks of child abuse and neglect registries. The curr_chunk amends sections of the Social Security Act to continue discretionary funding for safe and stable families and reserve funds to improve interstate placement of children."
