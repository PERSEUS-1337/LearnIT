    "content": "In this paper, image captioning is studied as a conditional GAN training with a context-aware LSTM captioner and co-attentive discriminator to enforce semantic alignment between images and captions. Two discrete GAN training methods, Self-critical Sequence Training (SCST) and Gumbel Straight-Through (ST), are compared, showing that SCST has more stable gradient behavior and improved results. Progress has been made in generating image descriptions using neural image captioning, with SCST producing state-of-the-art results. The text discusses the challenges of using GANs for image captioning due to the discrete nature of text generation. Despite recent advancements, bridging the semantic gap between images and captions to create diverse and human-like captions remains a challenge. In this paper, a novel GAN-based framework for image captioning is proposed to improve language composition and alignment of image and text. The approach utilizes SCST for discrete GAN optimization and compares it to the Gumbel relaxation trick. The captioner model employs an LSTM with visual attention and a visual sentinel for better caption generation. The proposed framework for image captioning includes a Context Aware attention modification that improves caption generation by incorporating visual information from previous time steps. Additionally, a Co-attention discriminator model is introduced to jointly embed image and caption features for similarity computation. The Co-attention discriminator architecture enhances image captioning by modulating image features based on the caption and vice versa. The discriminator is trained to distinguish real captions from fake ones and detect random unrelated sentences coupled with images. The optimization problem involves real and fake captions, with a focus on the discrete nature of the issue. The SCST method is proposed to address this challenge. The SCST method is proposed to address the discrete nature of the image captioning problem. It involves training G \u03b8 using SCST, a REINFORCE variant that uses the reward under the decoding algorithm as a baseline. The gradient is estimated using SCST to reduce variance in the estimate, and GAN training can be regularized with NLP metrics like CIDEr to enforce closeness to ground truth captions. The SCST method addresses the discrete nature of image captioning by training G \u03b8 using SCST, a REINFORCE variant. SCST offers advantages over other policy gradient methods in the sequential GAN context, such as global rewards at the sentence level and reduced variance in gradients. Gumbel re-parameterization can also be used to deal with the discreteness of the generator. The curr_chunk discusses the use of soft samples in Gumbel Soft and Gumbel Straight-Through approaches for image captioning. It mentions the incorporation of granular information from discriminator representations and the experimental setup on the COCO dataset using a resnet-101 encoder. The curr_chunk describes the use of spatial adaptive max-pooling and attention masks in a context-aware captioner model trained with GAN. Results on the COCO dataset show improvements in language metrics with CIDEr-RL compared to CE model. The results show a drop in vocabulary coverage with the CE model, while GANs underperform in terms of CIDEr due to their objective of creating more human-like sentences. The Co-att architecture outperforms the Joint-Emb one, emphasizing the importance of early joint embedding. SCST is a more stable approach for training discrete GAN models compared to Gumbel relaxation methods. The study demonstrates that SCST training for discrete GAN outperforms Gumbel relaxation in terms of stability and performance. Context-aware attention yields larger gains compared to adaptive sentinel or traditional visual attention. The co-attention model for discriminator also shows favorable results against joint embedding architecture."
