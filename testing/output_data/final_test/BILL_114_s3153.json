    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"TAILOR Act of 2016\" and focuses on tailoring regulation to business models and risk. The \"TAILOR Act of 2016\" defines Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies and regulatory actions, excluding actions specific to individual institutions. Regulatory actions after the Act's enactment must be considered and tailored accordingly. Each Federal financial institutions regulatory agency must consider the risk profile and business models of individual institutions when implementing regulatory actions post-enactment of the Act. The regulatory actions should be tailored to limit the impact on institutions in terms of cost, human resources, and other burdens, based on their risk profile and business model. Factors to consider include the necessity of applying such regulatory actions. When implementing regulatory actions, Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies must consider the impact on individual institutions and their ability to serve customers and local markets. Factors to consider include the necessity of the regulatory action, its impact on flexibility, and the aggregate impact on institutions. Efforts to implement the action should not undermine tailoring efforts. Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies must disclose and document how they have applied specific subsections in every notice of proposed and final rulemaking. Each agency is required to submit reports to Congress annually, detailing their regulatory actions and compliance with the statutory provisions. The Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies must report to Congress on the actions taken to tailor regulatory actions, and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council must report on the treatment of institutions with different charters. The Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies are required to review and apply regulations issued after July 21, 2010, and explain any differential treatment of institutions with different charters. Any revised regulations must be updated within 3 years of the enactment of the Act."
