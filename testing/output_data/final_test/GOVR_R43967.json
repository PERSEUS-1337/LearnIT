    "content": "This report provides an overview of FY2015 appropriations actions for accounts traditionally funded in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED). The bill provides discretionary and mandatory appropriations to federal departments and related agencies, with discretionary funds representing less than one-quarter of the total funds. The report focuses on discretionary appropriations in the L-HHS-ED bill, which is controversial due to its funding size and policy issues. It includes information on specific agencies and programs funded in the bill. The report provides an overview of major congressional actions on FY2015 appropriations, comparing proposed and enacted funding levels for the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and Related Agencies. The report focuses on FY2015 appropriations for agencies under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittees. It includes details on budget enforcement activities, the Budget Control Act of 2011, and sequestration. The report excludes funding for accounts under other subcommittees. The report covers FY2015 appropriations for federal departments and agencies including the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, and related agencies. Funding totals do not include amounts provided outside the regular appropriations process. Certain direct spending programs, such as Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and parts of Medicare, receive funding directly from their authorizing statutes. The L-HHS-ED bill includes both discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Mandatory programs funded through the annual appropriations process are referred to as appropriated entitlements, with little control by appropriators over the amounts provided. Mandatory spending programs, like Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance, receive funding directly from their authorizing statutes. Appropriated entitlements are mandatory programs funded through annual appropriations with little control by appropriators over the amounts provided. If Congress fails to appropriate necessary funds, entitled recipients may have legal recourse. The funding amounts in the report only include funds provided through appropriations acts, not direct spending budget authority outside the appropriations process. The report focuses on discretionary funding and does not include proposed changes to a program's authorizing statute that may affect total spending. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows a federal agency to spend, which may become available in the current fiscal year or future fiscal years. Advance appropriations refer to funds available in future fiscal years. The report focuses on discretionary funding and does not include proposed changes to a program's authorizing statute that may affect total spending. Budget authority is the amount of money Congress allows a federal agency to spend, which may become available in the current fiscal year or future fiscal years. Advance appropriations refer to funds available in future fiscal years, with appropriations levels in the report reflecting total budget authority provided in appropriations bills. The report also discusses current-year appropriations and 302(b) allocation ceilings for appropriations subcommittees. Scorekeeping adjustments are not included in the displayed appropriations levels. On December 16, 2014, President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), providing full-year appropriations for 11 out of 12 annual bills, including L-HHS-ED, with $164 billion in discretionary funding allocated. This amount is similar to FY2014 levels. The FY2015 omnibus provided $681 billion in mandatory L-HHS-ED funding, totaling $846 billion for L-HHS-ED. Additionally, $2.7 billion in emergency-designated funding was allocated to HHS for the Ebola outbreak in Africa, with $1.8 billion going to CDC for preparedness and overseas operations, and $238 million to NIH for clinical trials on Ebola vaccines. The FY2015 omnibus provided funding for clinical trials on experimental Ebola vaccines and treatments, as well as for drug and vaccine development and domestic hospital preparedness. The government-wide continuing resolutions funded discretionary programs at the same rate as in FY2014, with some exceptions and special provisions. The FY2015 omnibus included $88 million in new discretionary appropriations for HHS in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The Senate L-HHS-ED Subcommittee approved an FY2015 bill with $167 billion in discretionary funding, a 2% increase from FY2014 levels. The FY2015 omnibus included $88 million in new discretionary appropriations for HHS in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The House did not hold a subcommittee or full committee markup for a stand-alone FY2015 L-HHS-ED appropriations bill. Representative Rosa DeLauro introduced an FY2015 L-HHS-ED bill (H.R. 5464) which was not taken up by the subcommittee. The Obama Administration released the FY2015 President's budget requesting $164 billion in discretionary funding and roughly $681 billion in annually appropriated mandatory funding for a total of roughly $846 billion for the L-HHS-ED bill as a whole. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 provided $164 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED in FY2014. The FY2015 omnibus proposed $800 billion for L-HHS-ED, including $88 million for HHS in response to the Ebola outbreak. Table 2 shows the breakdown of FY2015 discretionary and mandatory funding levels compared to FY2014. Total budget authority provided in the bill is displayed, not just for the current fiscal year. In FY2015, HHS received 82% of total L-HHS-ED appropriations, mainly due to mandatory funds for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds. ED and Related Agencies followed with 8% each, with ED receiving mostly discretionary funds and Related Agencies focusing on mandatory payments. DOL had the smallest share at 2% in FY2015. In FY2015, HHS received 82% of total L-HHS-ED appropriations, mainly from mandatory funds for Medicaid grants and health care trust funds. ED and Related Agencies followed with 8% each, with ED receiving mostly discretionary funds and Related Agencies focusing on mandatory payments. DOL had the smallest share at 2% in FY2015. When looking at discretionary appropriations, HHS accounts for 43%, ED for 41%, and together they represent 84% of discretionary L-HHS-ED appropriations in FY2015. The Department of Labor (DOL) is a federal department that provides services related to employment, training, worker protection, income security, and contract enforcement. DOL entities primarily focus on workforce development and worker protection programs, such as the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) state formula grant programs and Job Corps. The Department of Labor (DOL) oversees income security programs like Unemployment Insurance benefits and worker protection services such as OSHA and MSHA. The Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) caters to veteran employment needs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects labor market data and analysis. The FY2015 omnibus allocated around $13.35 billion for these programs. The FY2015 omnibus allocated $13.35 billion for DOL, with $11.95 billion being discretionary funding. This is a decrease from FY2014 levels and the President's request. ETA administers federal workforce development programs and supports state unemployment operations. In July 2014, the President signed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) into law, replacing programs authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The FY2015 omnibus provided $4.8 billion for WIOA programs, $38 million more than FY2014 funding for predecessor programs. The omnibus also adjusted the governors' reserve limit for WIOA state formula grants to 10%. The FY2015 omnibus allowed the Secretary of Labor to transfer funds for WIOA Dislocated Workers' National Reserve for technical assistance. Updates on DOL's progress on OIG recommendations were required. The omnibus also continued the provision for program evaluation funding. The FY2015 omnibus altered the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) overtime provisions for certain workers, excluding insurance claims adjusters from these provisions after a major disaster. BLS was directed to report on improving data collection for Metropolitan Statistical Areas within the Current Employment Statistics program. The BLS will estimate costs for improvements based on regular L-HHS-ED appropriations only, excluding funds for HHS agencies from other sources. HHS is a large federal department with multiple agencies focused on enhancing Americans' health. Annual appropriations laws allocate funding to most HHS agencies. The L-HHS-ED bill directs funding to five Public Health Service agencies: HRSA, CDC, NIH, SAMHSA, and AHRQ, supporting various health care missions. Additionally, funding is provided for components of CMS, responsible for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP administration. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for HHS agencies focused on social services, including the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and the Administration for Community Living (ACL). ACL aims to increase access to community supports for older Americans and people with disabilities. The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for HHS agencies, including the Office of the Secretary, with a total of $692 billion in combined mandatory and discretionary funding for HHS in FY2015. This is an increase of $45.89 billion from FY2014. Discretionary funding amounts to roughly $70.97 billion, with the majority of HHS appropriations going to CMS for Medicaid benefits. In FY2015, HHS appropriations were dominated by mandatory funding, with CMS receiving the majority for Medicaid benefits. When considering both mandatory and discretionary funding, CMS accounted for 88% of all HHS appropriations. ACF and NIH received 4% each of total HHS appropriations. In terms of discretionary funding, PHS agencies received the bulk, accounting for 63% in FY2015. NIH received the largest share of discretionary funding at 41%, followed by ACF at 25%. The FY2015 HHS appropriations were mainly comprised of mandatory funding, with CMS receiving the majority for Medicaid benefits. PHS agencies received the bulk of discretionary funding, with NIH receiving the largest share at 41%. The Public Health Service Evaluation Set-Aside allows for the redistribution of eligible PHS agency appropriations for program evaluation purposes. The FY2015 omnibus maintained the set-aside level at 2.5% of eligible appropriations, rejecting the proposal to increase it to 3.0%. The tap funding has traditionally provided additional funding to HHS programs, but the FY2015 omnibus directed funds to only a few programs, breaking with recent precedents. The FY2015 omnibus directed tap funds to a few programs within three HHS agencies, with the largest share going to NIH. This shift aims to benefit NIH rather than be a liability, in response to concerns about the loss of funds to the tap. The FY2015 omnibus directed tap funds to programs within HHS agencies, with the largest share going to NIH. The ACA authorized mandatory funding for trust funds to support public health programs. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) received $2 billion in FY2015, later reduced to $1 billion by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) received reduced appropriations due to the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. PPHF funds supplement program funding and support new programs, as directed by the ACA. The Secretary distributes PPHF funds for prevention, wellness, and public health activities annually. Congress specified the distribution of PPHF funds for FY2014 and FY2015. In FY2015, PPHF funds were directed to specific accounts, with most going to CDC for various programs. The FY2015 omnibus provided $6.1 billion in discretionary funding for HRSA, an increase from FY2014 levels and the President's request. NHSC did not receive funding in the FY2015 omnibus. The FY2015 omnibus did not fund the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), which was supported by funds authorized by the ACA. $265 million was provided for the Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program, rejecting the proposal to eliminate funding. $6.0 billion was allocated for CDC, $177 million more than FY2014 levels, and $568 million more than the President's request. The FY2015 omnibus allocated $6.0 billion for CDC, with increases in budget authority for programs like Injury Prevention and Control and Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases. PHS tap funds to CDC were reduced by $211 million, but CDC received its largest share of PPHF funds to date at $887 million. Despite the elimination of some PHS evaluation tap transfers, increases in budget authority and PPHF transfers offset the losses. Additionally, CDC received $1.8 billion in total funds. The FY2015 omnibus provided $29.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for NIH, with a decrease from FY2014 funding levels. $715 million was transferred from the PHS Evaluation Tap to NIH, directed to one institute. The FY2015 omnibus allocated $707 million to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) from the PHS Evaluation Tap, offsetting a decrease in the institute's budget compared to FY2014. Additionally, NIH received $238 million for emergency Ebola funding. SAMHSA received $3.5 billion in discretionary budget authority, an increase from FY2014 levels. The FY2015 omnibus allocated $362 million in discretionary budget authority to SAMHSA's Substance Abuse Treatment Programs, representing a $51 million increase from FY2014 levels. The omnibus also provided $364 million in discretionary budget authority for AHRQ, with no PHS Evaluation Tap funds allocated for AHRQ in FY2015. The FY2015 omnibus allocated $364 million in discretionary budget authority for AHRQ, with a focus on research on health costs, quality, and outcomes. This marked the first time since FY2002 that annual appropriations were provided for AHRQ, as funding in previous years came from transfers from other sources. The FY2015 omnibus provided $4.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for CMS, which is $45 million less than FY2014 funding levels. $672 million was allocated for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities, with $361 million provided through a budget cap adjustment. The Program Management account received $3.7 billion to support program operations. The FY2015 omnibus included provisions to prevent certain funds from being used for risk corridor payments associated with health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Risk corridors are a mechanism for sharing financial risk between the federal government and insurers. HHS administers a risk corridor program for qualified health plans offered through exchanges in 2014-2016, aiming for budget neutrality. The FY2015 omnibus included provisions to prevent certain funds from being used for risk corridor payments associated with health insurance exchanges under the ACA. HHS expects the risk corridor program to be budget neutral, but may use \"other sources of funding\" if collections are insufficient. The omnibus limits funding sources for risk corridor payments by prohibiting the use of certain funds appropriated to the CMS Program Management account. The omnibus provided $17.8 billion in discretionary budget authority for ACF, which is an increase from previous funding levels. Nearly $1.6 billion was allocated for Refugee and Entrant Assistance Programs, with a focus on the Unaccompanied Alien Children program due to the rising number of children arriving in the country. The FY2015 omnibus included a provision allowing HHS to increase appropriations for the Refugee and Entrant Assistance account by up to 10%. It provided $1.7 billion for ACL, slightly more than FY2014 but less than the President's request. $8 million was designated for Elder Rights Support Activities, including $4 million for a new Elder Justice Initiative. The FY2015 omnibus included funding for innovative elder abuse prevention and response programs, marking the first appropriation under the Elder Justice Act. Additionally, $10 million was allocated for Aging Network Support Activities, with $2.5 million specifically for aging Holocaust survivors. The omnibus also included new administrative requirements for ACL, such as transferring funding for the Limb Loss Resource Center from CDC to ACL. The WIOA called for programs authorized by the Rehabilitation Act and the Assistive Technology Act to be transferred from ED to HHS/ACL. Annual L-HHS-ED appropriations often contain restrictions on controversial issues, such as limitations on using funds for abortions. The FY2015 omnibus appropriations law includes provisions prohibiting the use of L-HHS-ED funds for abortions, human embryo research, and needle exchange programs. The FY2015 omnibus appropriations law expanded provisions prohibiting CDC spending on activities promoting gun control to all HHS appropriations. These restrictions have been maintained in subsequent appropriations laws, including FY2015. Funding levels for HHS in FY2015 are detailed in tables showing agency and discretionary funding levels. Note that the figures only include regular L-HHS-ED appropriations, excluding certain direct appropriations. The federal government provides support for elementary and secondary education, with roughly 11% of overall funding coming from the federal level. States and local districts contribute the majority of funding for education, and have primary responsibility for its provision in the United States. The Department of Education (ED) performs various functions such as promoting educational standards, gathering education data, disseminating research, and administering federal programs. The Department of Education (ED) administers federal education programs for elementary and secondary schools, focusing on improving academic outcomes for disadvantaged students and those with disabilities. In higher education, ED supports student financial aid programs, including student loans and the Pell grant program. The Department of Education (ED) administers federal education programs for elementary and secondary schools, focusing on improving academic outcomes for disadvantaged students and those with disabilities. ED also facilitates college access through student loans and the Pell grant program. The FY2015 omnibus provided roughly $70.47 billion in funding for ED, with $67.14 billion being discretionary. This funding level is slightly higher than FY2014 but lower than the FY2015 request. The FY2015 omnibus provided $14.41 billion for Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which is a slight increase from FY2014 funding. The omnibus also maintained funding for School Improvement Grants at $506 million and included provisions for increased LEA flexibility in implementing alternative school improvement strategies. The FY2015 omnibus provided $1.29 billion for Impact Aid, $67 million more than the President's request. The majority of funds go to LEAs for federal activities' financial burden. $1.10 billion was allocated for the Innovation and Improvement account, with a significant increase for the Fund for the Improvement of Education, mainly for Preschool Development Grants. The FY2015 omnibus allocated $11.50 billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), Part B State Grants program, which provides federal funding for education for children with disabilities. This amount is slightly higher than the FY2014 funding level and lower than the FY2015 President's request. States receiving these funds must offer a free and appropriate public education. The FY2015 omnibus provided $22.48 billion for the Pell Grants program, which is $303 million less than FY2014 funding. The discretionary base maximum award for AY 2015-2016 remained at $4,860, with a total maximum award of $5,850. Note that figures are based on regular appropriations only and rounded to the nearest million or billion. The FY2015 omnibus provided about $70.05 billion in funding for related agencies, with $14.18 billion being discretionary. This is slightly less than FY2014 levels and the President's request. The Social Security Administration receives the largest share of funding in the L-HHS-ED bill. In FY2015, the Social Security Administration (SSA) accounted for 97% of the entire related agencies appropriation, with the bulk of funding supporting the Supplemental Security Income program for disabled individuals and the elderly. Discretionary SSA funding covers administrative expenses for Social Security, SSI, and Medicare. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) is the next-largest agency, receiving roughly 2% of all funding and 7% of discretionary funding in FY2015. The FY2015 President's request for the SSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) account was $12 billion, with $1.4 billion allocated for program integrity activities. The final appropriation for the SSA LAE account was $11.8 billion, including the full requested amount for program integrity. The budget enforcement framework under the congressional budget process has both statutory and procedural elements. The budget process includes statutory elements such as discretionary spending limits and mandatory spending sequester from the Budget Control Act of 2011. Procedural elements are linked to the budget resolution and limit discretionary spending. The Budget Control Act requires annual reductions in spending through sequestration for mandatory and discretionary spending over an extended period. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 established new limits for defense and nondefense discretionary spending for FY2014 and FY2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 set new limits for defense and nondefense discretionary spending for FY2014 and FY2015. Sequestration of discretionary spending in FY2014-FY2021 is only triggered if the statutory limits are breached. President Obama issued a sequestration order for nonexempt FY2015 mandatory spending, resulting in reductions in nondefense mandatory spending by over $17 billion in FY2015. The OMB report estimated a $702 million reduction in nonexempt defense mandatory spending for FY2015. Sequestration was implemented at the program, project, or activity level, with no required discretionary spending cuts. The BCA allows for adjustments to discretionary spending limits, including for L-HHS-ED funds. The L-HHS-ED bill includes increases in new budget authority for program integrity initiatives at HHS and SSA. It exempts certain programs from sequestration, such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income, while subjecting others to special rules, like unemployment compensation and certain student loans. Budget enforcement procedures under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 involve the allocation of discretionary budget authority through a 302(a) allocation to the Appropriations Committee, which then divides it among its subcommittees as 302(b) suballocations. These suballocations act as spending limits for each subcommittee, capping the amount of budget authority available for various agencies, projects, and activities. Budget enforcement procedures involve the allocation of discretionary budget authority through a 302(a) allocation to the Appropriations Committee, which then divides it among its subcommittees as 302(b) suballocations. Congress did not adopt a budget resolution for FY2015, instead using an alternative mechanism for procedural budget enforcement through the BBA. This allowed the Chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees to submit statements with FY2015 spending levels consistent with the discretionary spending limits set forth in the BBA. The House and Senate filed statements with spending levels for FY2015 in the Congressional Record. These levels became enforceable on the floors. Committees reported initial suballocations to subcommittees before considering appropriations bills. Suballocations may be revised throughout the year. The House and Senate most recently reported revised suballocations in June and December 2014, respectively. See Table A-1 for an overview of published suballocations for FY2015. The current-year budget authority for FY2015 is compared to the proposed FY2015 Senate subcommittee-approved bill and the enacted FY2015 omnibus. Compliance with discretionary spending allocations is evaluated based on budget authority available in the current fiscal year. Total L-HHS-ED current-year budget authority for FY2015 discretionary and mandatory appropriations is shown in Table A-2, compared to FY2014 funding levels. The amounts reflect total budget authority available for obligation in the fiscal year. The current-year budget authority for FY2015 is used to determine compliance with discretionary spending allocations."
