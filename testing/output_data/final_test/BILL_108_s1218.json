    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Oceans and Human Health Act\". The Congress finds that marine biodiversity is crucial for biomedical research, economic growth, and understanding human health. Ocean life diversity aids in studying human physiology and monitoring marine ecosystem health. Oceans also impact climate, weather, and disease distribution, affecting public health systems. The oceans play a vital role in human health by serving as a pathway for diseases through contaminated seafood and seawater. Harmful algae blooms and hypoxia have been increasing, leading to fish kills and economic losses in coastal communities. Despite existing federal support, gaps in funding and coordination hinder national progress in addressing ocean health issues. The Act aims to support and coordinate ocean science programs, develop a comprehensive research and monitoring program for oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes, and enhance understanding of the oceans' role in human health. The Act establishes an Interagency Oceans and Human Health Research Program. The President will coordinate a national research program through the National Science and Technology Council to study the oceans' impact on human health. Within a year, a plan for federal activities will be developed and submitted to Congress, consulting with the Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia. The Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia will establish goals and priorities for Federal research over a 10-year period to advance scientific understanding of the oceans' impact on human health and develop new treatments for diseases. Specific activities and funding for competitive research will be described to achieve these goals. The Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia aims to fund competitive research grants, ocean observations, scientist training, and international research efforts. It will identify relevant federal programs, use reports from expert bodies, recommend coordination with other organizations, and estimate federal funding for research activities. The program may include interdisciplinary research in ocean and medical sciences to understand processes affecting human health, explore marine organisms' potential in medicine, and address vector- and water-borne diseases, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, and marine-derived pharmaceuticals. The program focuses on interdisciplinary research in ocean and medical sciences to address marine public health problems, including harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, marine-derived pharmaceuticals, bioaccumulative contaminants, and predictive models for marine environmental health. Coordination with the National Ocean Research Leadership Council is essential for monitoring and reducing health-related data on biological populations and contaminants in marine waters and seafood. Development of new technologies and approaches for detecting and reducing hazards to human health from ocean sources, including genomics, proteomics, biomaterials, bioengineering, and sensors for detecting contaminants in marine waters and organisms. The National Science and Technology Council will prepare an annual report on the exploration of marine resources, genetic resources, adaptation of technologies, and support for interdisciplinary research in ocean life diversity. The National Science and Technology Council will provide an annual report to Congress on activities related to oceans and human health research, including achievements, progress towards goals, agency budgets, and recommendations for additional action or legislation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceans and Human Health Initiative is established. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to establish an Oceans and Human Health Initiative to coordinate research related to the role of oceans in human health. This initiative includes centralized program coordination, an advisory panel, national centers of excellence, research grants, and support for distinguished scholars and traineeships. The Secretary may establish an oceans and human health advisory panel with members having expertise in marine and biomedical sciences. The panel will assist in the Oceans and Human Health Initiative's development and implementation. Additionally, the Secretary can provide financial support for one or more centers of excellence within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to enhance its programs related to oceans' impact on human health. The Secretary can establish centers of excellence within NOAA to focus on oceans' impact on human health, including marine organisms, pollutants, toxins, pathogens, algal blooms, hypoxia, seafood testing, drug discovery, and marine mammal biology. Priority will be given to interdisciplinary proposals that promote education and partnerships among various entities. Grants may also be provided to the scientific community for extramural research. The Secretary can establish centers of excellence within NOAA to focus on oceans' impact on human health through grants for critical research and projects. Grants will be awarded through a competitive peer-reviewed process, potentially in collaboration with other agencies. The Secretary can designate scholars for collaborative work with NOAA scientists and provide traineeships for students and scientists interested in human health research related to the oceans. SEC. 5. PUBLIC INFORMATION AND OUTREACH. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a national program on ocean-related human health risks, including seafood consumption hazards. This program will collect and share information on health hazards, illnesses, and observation systems. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the NOAA Oceans and Human Health Initiative and public information program. $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2006, and $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 and 2008 for the initiative. $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2005 through 2007 for the public information program.
