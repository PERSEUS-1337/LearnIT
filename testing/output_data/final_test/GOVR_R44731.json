    "content": "Congress plays a significant role in the US relationship with Sri Lanka, beyond just overseeing policy. This includes decisions on foreign assistance funding for various initiatives. Sri Lanka's progress on reforms and reconciliation may increase congressional interest, especially in light of China's growing influence in the region. The report provides context for Congress to make decisions on Sri Lanka's political landscape, democratic reform, and geopolitical position in the Indian Ocean region. Sri Lanka, a constitutional democracy in South Asia, has high development levels and a history of migration from India. Congress may consider placing requirements on the new Administration's policy towards Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has a history of migration from India, with Indo-Aryans and Tamil Hindus establishing kingdoms on the island. Colonized by the Portuguese, Dutch, and English, it gained independence in 1948. Ethnic conflict between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority ensued, with discrimination against Tamils by the government. The Sinhalese, favored in university admissions and government jobs, viewed themselves as a minority in a larger context with over 60 million Tamils in India. From 1983 to 2009, Sri Lanka faced ethnic conflict and war with the LTTE, resulting in over 70,000 deaths. The LTTE sought a separate state in the north and east, designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US. The civil war ended violently in May 2009 when the military defeated the LTTE. After the violent end of the civil war in May 2009, international attention turned to Sri Lanka's ability to build a stable peace. President Mahinda Rajapaksa faced criticism for his response to war crimes, nepotism, media restrictions, and uneven economic development. In 2015, he was defeated in presidential elections by Maithripala Sirisena, leading to the formation of the National Unity Government. President Sirisena pledged to reduce the authority of the executive presidency. Sri Lanka is undergoing constitutional and political reform to reduce the authority of the executive presidency. The country has a unicameral parliament with MPs elected for five-year terms. The next elections are in 2020, with the president elected for a maximum of two terms. The 13th amendment calls for devolution of powers to provincial councils, but full implementation is pending. Sri Lanka is in the midst of constitutional reform with improved civil liberties and political rights noted by Freedom House in 2016. The dominant political parties are the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), forming a national unity government. The SLFP is expected to split due to a faction loyal to former President Rajapaksa. A rival faction loyal to former President Rajapaksa has formed the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, causing strains on the coalition and weakening the president. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) advocates for greater devolution of power to the provinces. The People's Liberation Front (JVP) is a Marxist-Leninist party, while the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress represents Sri Lankan Muslims in the east. The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) includes the SLFP and smaller parties. The national unity government was extended to a full five-year term in 2016, with political tensions expected to rise in the next year. Political tensions are expected to rise in Sri Lanka over the lack of devolution of power to provinces. Buddhist-Sinhalese nationalism remains a powerful force, emphasizing the need to protect Sinhalese people and Buddhism. Moderate voices are being overshadowed by nationalistic forces within the community. Many observers in the West may be unfamiliar with ethno-nationalistic forms of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, where Sinhalese-Buddhist nationalist groups like Sinha Le and Bodu Bala Sena exert political influence. Sinha Le plays on fears of cultural threats and the Tamil agenda, hindering reconciliation efforts. Sinha Le's appeal among Sri Lanka's Sinhala-Buddhist majority poses an existential threat and ethnic tension, hindering reconciliation efforts and government's transitional justice commitments. Pressure for rapid accommodation of Tamil demands may undermine political support for the government. President Sirisena campaigned on reducing executive powers and returning to parliamentary democracy. The 19th amendment passed in April 2015 limits presidential terms to five years, reintroduces a two-term limit, and establishes independent commissions. The Constitutional Council appoints members to independent commissions. Sirisena supports devolving presidential powers to parliament. Parliament acts as Constitutional Assembly to draft a new constitution, considering reforms like abolishing executive presidency. Review of Prevention of Terrorism Act allowing extended detainment without charges. Tamil National Alliance seeks federal solution in united Sri Lanka. Opposition led to removal of preamble on Tamil question resolution. Parliament passed Right to Information Bill for public access. In June 2016, Sri Lanka passed the Right to Information Bill, increasing government transparency and aiding in the fight against corruption. President Sirisena's campaign pledge included the passage of this bill. In August 2016, legislation was passed to establish an Office of Missing Persons, a crucial step in transitional justice. Former President Rajapaksa opposed the missing persons bill, claiming it would betray the armed forces. Reports suggest thousands went missing during the civil war. The Constitutional Assembly (CA) is considering reports from six subcommittees on various topics, including devolving land and police powers to provinces in the new constitution. This proposal, in line with the 13th amendment, aims to reconcile with the Tamil minority. However, it is uncertain if there is enough political support for this measure to be included in the final draft of the constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority in parliament and approval in a national referendum. Some observers believe the UNP may retain aspects of the executive presidency in the new constitution. Former President Rajapaksa, a divisive figure with a strong following, could influence constitutional reforms due to his parliamentary strength. Future reforms require a two-thirds majority in Parliament and a referendum for approval. Sri Lanka cosponsored a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on accountability for human rights abuses during the civil war. President Sirisena has shown reluctance towards involving international judges in prosecuting war crimes. The investigation into human rights abuses in Sri Lanka should be internal, with the belief in the judicial system. Human Rights Watch notes that while the proposed resolution doesn't specifically call for international involvement, it offers hope for justice. The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for a transitional justice mechanism to address past abuses. The civil war created deep divisions in society, with the current government making efforts to heal wounds, such as allowing the national anthem to be sung in Tamil and returning lands to Tamils. The Tamil community in Sri Lanka seeks recognition and increased autonomy, including the implementation of the 13th amendment, return of Tamil lands taken during the civil war, inquiry into human rights abuses, and government assistance with missing persons. While the Sirisena government has made progress in opening political debate and limiting presidential powers, Tamil groups are demanding further reconciliation of grievances for long-term peace and harmony. The Sirisena government faces challenges in addressing the concerns of Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims due to nationalist sentiment and party politics. International focus is on establishing a war crimes tribunal, with US assistance aimed at promoting economic growth and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Deforestation poses a significant problem with global implications for climate change and biodiversity. Deforestation in Sri Lanka has negative implications for global climate change and biodiversity, accounting for 10%-12% of global warming emissions. The country aims to increase its forest cover to 35% by 2020. Sri Lanka is biologically diverse, with one-quarter of tourists visiting national parks. A logging ban was implemented in 1990. Sri Lanka was also affected by the 2004 tsunami, resulting in significant economic damage and loss of life. The 2004 tsunami caused an estimated $1.45 billion in economic damage to Sri Lanka, leading to the loss of livelihood for 400,000 workers. The country's economy faced challenges in 2016, with high government debt and a budget deficit. Despite this, GDP growth was projected to be 5.1% in 2016. Sri Lanka requested IMF support and received a $1.5 billion bailout package in March 2016 to address the balance of payments crisis. The government plans to increase tax revenues and cut the budget deficit by raising the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15% by 2020. Remittances, a significant part of the economy, declined in growth from 9.5% in 2014 to 0.8% in November 2015, with a large portion coming from the Middle East. Sri Lanka's strategic location near important sea lanes in the Indian Ocean was discussed in the United States Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue. Over 60,000 ships carrying oil and container shipments transit the sea lanes near Sri Lanka annually. India has historical ties with Sri Lanka and was involved in a conflict with the LTTE in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s, India was involved in a conflict with the LTTE in Sri Lanka, resulting in over 1,200 soldiers lost. The relationship between Sri Lanka and India was strengthened by President Sirisena's visit to New Delhi in 2015 and Indian Prime Minister Modi's visit to Colombo. Modi expressed support for the Tamil community in Sri Lanka and pledged assistance in various development projects. India has been a vocal advocate for reconciliation and fair elections in Sri Lanka, hosting Tamil refugees and providing funding for railway improvements. India has been a vocal advocate for reconciliation and fair elections in Sri Lanka. Concerns have been raised in India over Sri Lanka's relationship with China, including Chinese submarine visits. Sri Lanka and China have expressed commitment to cooperation, defense relations, and participation in China's Belt and Road initiative. China's activities in Sri Lanka are part of its 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to secure interests in the Indian Ocean. China's deepening relationship with Sri Lanka includes providing weapons support during the civil war, which was crucial for the government's defeat of the LTTE. This support has given China leverage over Sri Lanka, potentially influencing Chinese foreign policy initiatives in the region. During President Rajapaksa's tenure, Sri Lanka's relationship with China grew significantly, with China becoming the country's largest donor and providing military support. Chinese submarines docking in Colombo in 2014 raised concerns in India about China's influence in the region. India worries that Chinese investments in South Asian ports could serve both commercial and military interests. The Sirisena government sought to rebalance Sri Lanka's relations with India and China by suspending the Chinese-backed Colombo Port City project, which is now going ahead with modifications. The $1.5 billion project will be built on reclaimed land in Colombo harbor, with China leasing the land on a 99-year basis. Sri Lanka's decision to resume the project was influenced by the need for financial support, with Chinese investment in the country, particularly in the development of the port at Hambantota, being substantial. China's influence in Sri Lanka has been growing significantly, with the country providing loans amounting to approximately $5 billion over the past decade. Sri Lanka's struggle to repay these loans has raised concerns that China may convert them into equity, giving them ownership of key projects and a strategic outpost in the Indian Ocean. This development prompts questions about China's motives - whether they are primarily economic or strategic - and the implications for Sri Lanka's role in China's One Belt One Road (OBOR) strategy. The United States may need to consider the rising Chinese influence in Sri Lanka and the Indian Ocean, balancing concerns with China's legitimate interests in securing sea lines of communication in the region. China's growing influence in Sri Lanka through significant loans has raised concerns about potential Chinese ownership of key projects and a strategic outpost in the Indian Ocean. This prompts questions about China's motives and implications for Sri Lanka's role in China's One Belt One Road (OBOR) strategy. The United States may need to consider the rising Chinese influence in Sri Lanka and the Indian Ocean to secure its own sea lines of communication in the region. Members of Congress have various interests related to Sri Lanka, including foreign operations budget requests, bilateral relations, democratic reforms, trade and investment, and ambassadorial confirmation hearings. The United States has shown support for Sri Lanka's unity, territorial integrity, and democratic institutions, as well as ethnic reconciliation. Over $2 billion in development assistance has been provided since 1948. Congress may oversee areas such as democratic reform, human rights, geopolitics with India and China, trade, military relations, and the environment. Sri Lanka's 2015 presidential election marked a new political era for U.S. engagement. Secretary of State John Kerry commended Sri Lanka for progress towards reconciliation during his visit in May 2015. He emphasized the importance of policies promoting reconciliation and equal rights for all citizens.

Congress may consider questions regarding Sri Lanka's strategic significance, political reforms, democracy assistance, and ethnic reconciliation. The United States and the international community may unintentionally limit the Sirisena government's political room for maneuver on ethnic reconciliation in Sri Lanka. China's strategic interests in Sri Lanka and the Indian Ocean region could potentially threaten U.S. interests and impact India's strategic interests. Congress may reevaluate U.S. assistance programs towards Sri Lanka as the new Administration develops its policy. Events in Sri Lanka may influence congressional funding decisions."
