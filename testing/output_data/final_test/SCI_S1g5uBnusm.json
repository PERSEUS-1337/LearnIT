    "content": "In this paper, deep neural networks for automated optical inspection in industrial manufacturing were studied. Transfer learning from ImageNet resulted in a significant performance improvement, producing a highly compressible network. The experimental results showed that the network learned through transfer learning maintained high accuracy even when compressed to 1/128 reduction of convolution filters, unlike networks learned from scratch. The network trained from scratch learns denser features than the network trained by transfer learning. Transfer learning allows for significant compression of the network without losing accuracy. This study is the first to link transfer learning with network compression. The TL teacher network learns sparser features compared to the Scratch teacher network, as shown in Section 2.3. This highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning in compressing the network without sacrificing accuracy."
