    "title": "AB 2206",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges California's heavy reliance on imported natural gas, which contributes significantly to the state's greenhouse gas emissions. To meet emission reduction goals, California must decrease natural gas sector emissions and promote renewable and low-carbon gas supplies. Biomethane is a sustainable gas alternative to natural gas, produced from organic waste through various conversion technologies. It offers significant greenhouse gas emission reductions if used to replace a portion of California's natural gas consumption. Investing in biomethane also brings additional benefits such as renewable electricity generation, reduced fossil fuel use, pollution reduction, and job creation. Biomethane can be used as transportation fuel or injected into natural gas pipelines. The biomethane market in California has been slow to develop due to high costs. It is seen as a key player in future natural gas and hydrogen fuel markets for reducing carbon footprint. Biomethane is a promising alternative vehicle fuel with low greenhouse gas emissions, as per California regulations. The California Council on Science and Technology, established by academic research institutions, provides expert advice to the state government on science and technology policy issues. It is important for the Public Utilities Commission to base its policies on the best available science for the benefit of the public and gas ratepayers. Section 39734 of the Health and Safety Code mandates the state board to consider adopting policies to increase renewable gas production, including biogas, to meet renewable energy and low-carbon fuel goals. This includes resources meeting California's Renewables Portfolio Standard and direct solar energy. The state board must ensure that eligible renewable gas reduces emissions of pollutants, protects state waters, and minimizes odors. Section 784.1 is added to the Public Utilities Code. The Legislature requests the California Council on Science and Technology to study regional and gas corporation issues regarding biomethane specifications for injection into gas pipelines. The study will analyze standards, biomethane sources, dilution after injection, equipment upgrades, and potential impacts on cost, volume, operation, and safety. Consideration will be given to whether different biogas sources should have varying standards. The California Council on Science and Technology is tasked with studying biomethane specifications for injection into gas pipelines, considering different sources of biogas and developing standards for heating value and siloxane levels. The study must be based on the best available science and completed within nine months to support the state's goals of reducing emissions and promoting renewable energy resources. The California Council on Science and Technology will conduct a study on biomethane specifications for gas pipelines. Gas corporations in California will contribute to the study expenses, and the commission may reallocate funds to cover costs. This applies regardless of whether the gas corporation proposed the program. The California Council on Science and Technology will conduct a study on biomethane specifications for gas pipelines. If the study is completed, the commission will reevaluate and potentially change requirements and standards for biomethane injection into pipelines based on the study's conclusions and recommendations. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as any costs incurred by local agencies or school districts would be due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
