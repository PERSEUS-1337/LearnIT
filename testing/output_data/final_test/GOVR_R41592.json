    "content": "This report provides data on key characteristics of the foreign-born population in the United States, using the 2010 American Community Survey as the primary data source. It includes information on immigration statuses such as immigrants, refugees, nonimmigrants, and undocumented individuals. The report focuses on the foreign-born population in the United States, including noncitizens and naturalized citizens. The foreign-born population is growing faster than the native-born population, especially among young people and the labor force. Policy attention is given to the estimated 11.2 million foreign-born individuals residing illegally in the country. In 1970, there were 9.7 million foreign-born individuals, accounting for 4.8% of the total U.S. population, the lowest proportion since 1850. The foreign-born population in the United States has increased to 39.9 million people, representing 12.9% of the total U.S. population in 2010. This report provides information on the characteristics of the foreign-born population relevant to immigration policy issues such as unauthorized aliens, proposed immigration policy revisions, and the impact of foreign-born workers on the U.S. economy. The report provides a detailed analysis of the foreign-born population in the United States, including their origins, settlement patterns, legal status, labor market outcomes, and economic well-being. In 2010, there were 39.9 million foreign-born individuals, representing 12.9% of the total U.S. population. The foreign-born population in the United States has steadily increased since 1970, representing 12.9% of the total population in 2010. Their contribution to population growth was disproportionate at 31.6% between 2000 and 2010. Historical factors such as the U.S. industrial revolution and affordable transatlantic travel led to high immigration flows in the late 19th century. Congress responded with the Immigration Act of 1924 to limit new immigrants by country. The Immigration Act of 1924 limited new immigrants by country and reduced overall immigration levels. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 organized existing immigration laws and introduced preferences based on family reunification and skills. In 1965, Congress amended the INA to remove discriminatory provisions and shift the ethnic composition of immigrants away from Europe. Subsequent legislation, such as the Refugee Act of 1980, Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1990, increased the number of foreign-born individuals in the United States. Factors like the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Central American political turmoil, and increased contact with foreign nationals also contributed to the growth of the foreign-born population. The proportion of foreign-born individuals in the U.S. has changed significantly since 1960, with a decline in European origins and significant increases from Latin America and Asia. Specific countries of origin have also shifted over time. The composition of the foreign-born population in the U.S. has shifted significantly since 1960, with a decline in European origins and a rise in immigrants from Latin America and Asia. The top 10 origin countries for foreign-born individuals have changed over time, reflecting immigrant diversity and legal immigration policies. The settlement of foreign-born populations in the U.S. can be categorized into the existing \"stock\" population and the recently arrived \"flow\" of immigrants. The foreign-born population in the U.S. has shifted significantly since 1960, with a rise in immigrants from Latin America and Asia. The foreign-born population is concentrated in the nation's most populous states, with a smaller proportion living in rural areas. There has been greater population dispersion to new immigrant destinations in both urban and rural areas. The geographic shift of the foreign-born population in the U.S. has been significant since 1960, with a rise in immigrants from Latin America and Asia. New immigrant destinations in the South and Mountain West have seen substantial growth, while states in the Northeast, northern Midwest, and California have experienced lower foreign-born population growth rates. This trend often corresponds with total population growth, driven by labor demand in construction and low-skilled service sectors. The foreign-born population in the U.S. has shifted to new destinations in the South and Mountain West, with a significant increase in immigrants from Latin America and Asia. Arrival data shows a large recent influx of foreign-born individuals, with a majority arriving since 2000. The legal status of the foreign-born population, including unauthorized aliens and legal noncitizens, has become a focus due to the growing size of the unauthorized population and increased border security concerns. According to recent estimates, the foreign-born population in the U.S. is divided into three main groups: unauthorized aliens, legal noncitizens (including permanent and temporary residents), and naturalized citizens. These groups make up 28%, 35%, and 37% of the foreign-born population respectively. In 2010, there were approximately 11.2 million unauthorized aliens, 14.0 million legal residents, and 14.8 million naturalized citizens. Surveys like the American Community Survey only capture noncitizen foreign-born populations, not citizens. Estimates from government agencies and private organizations provide insight into the unauthorized noncitizen population in the U.S. In 2010, around 11 million unauthorized individuals were estimated to be living in the country. Factors such as the economic downturn and increased enforcement efforts have been linked to a decline in incoming flows and unauthorized population sizes after 2007. Enforcement of immigration laws likely played a role in reducing the overall flow during this period. Legal residents in the United States include immigrants and nonimmigrants. Immigrants are legal permanent residents (LPRs) who come to live permanently, while nonimmigrants are admitted for a specific period and purpose. Immigrants have stricter admission conditions but fewer restrictions once admitted, and can apply for citizenship through naturalization after five years. Naturalization is the process of becoming a citizen in the United States, requiring applicants to meet eligibility criteria such as being at least 18 years old, having permanent residency for five years, good moral character, basic knowledge of U.S. government, continuous presence in the country, and proficiency in English. Citizenship allows the right to vote and can have political and demographic implications. In the past four decades, the total foreign-born and naturalized foreign-born populations in the United States have consistently increased. The proportion of naturalized foreign-born individuals has declined from 63.6% in 1970 to 37.0% in 2010. Prime working ages dominate the foreign-born population, with six out of every 10 individuals aged between 25 to 54. Children under 18 make up 26% of the native-born population but only 7% of the foreign-born population. The foreign-born population in the U.S. is 12.9% of the total population and contributed significantly to the population increase between 2000 and 2010. They contributed 8.8 million people, with a notable increase in the 25-54 age group. The native-born population aged into older cohorts, leading to a negative contribution to the child-age population. In 2010, children with at least one foreign-born parent accounted for 24% of U.S. children under 18. Most of these children, 86%, were born in the United States. The foreign-born population in the U.S. is relatively young, but their U.S.-born children contribute to a higher median age among the foreign-born. The foreign-born population in the U.S. has a higher median age of 40 compared to the native-born population's median age of 35. However, when native-born minor children of foreign-born parents are reclassified among the foreign-born, the median age of the foreign-born decreases to 32, which is lower than the native-born median age of 37. Differences in family and household measures between native-born and foreign-born populations are relatively modest. Native-born individuals tend to live in smaller households compared to foreign-born individuals. Foreign-born noncitizens are evenly distributed across different household sizes. Differences in household size by nativity and citizenship status reflect various factors. Native-born and naturalized citizens, with higher incomes than noncitizens, are more likely to live alone or in nuclear families. Age structure also plays a role, with young adults and the elderly more likely to live alone among the native born. Cultural preferences influence living arrangements, with multi-generational households more common among the foreign born. Educational attainment correlates positively with various public policy objectives. The educational attainment of foreign-born individuals in the United States has been increasing over time, with more recent immigrants arriving with higher levels of education compared to earlier decades. The proportion of foreign-born individuals with a bachelor's degree has risen by approximately 50% since 1950. Foreign-born naturalized citizens tend to have higher education levels than foreign-born noncitizens. The educational attainment of foreign-born individuals in the United States has been increasing over time, with recent immigrants arriving with higher levels of education. The proportion of foreign-born individuals without a high school diploma has remained unchanged, but there have been significant increases in average schooling levels in many countries. Foreign-born individuals from Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean have the lowest college graduation rates and the highest rates of lacking a high school diploma compared to those from Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The high percentage of individuals with less than a high school diploma in the United States may be due to a large number of unauthorized aliens from certain countries with lower education levels. English language ability positively impacts labor market outcomes and integration. Research shows that English proficiency improves over time, with youth having the highest proficiency as they are more likely to be enrolled in U.S. schools. In 2010, the foreign-born population in the U.S. accounted for 16.3% of the total civilian labor force, with naturalized citizens showing stronger English language skills than noncitizens. Foreign-born individuals from Mexico and Central America have lower English proficiency, while those from Africa, Western Europe, Canada, and Oceania have the highest proficiency. Labor force participation rates differ between foreign-born and native-born workers. Foreign-born male workers have higher labor force participation rates than native-born workers across all age and education categories. However, foreign-born female workers exhibit lower rates compared to native-born women, except at lower education levels. Labor force participation increases with education and age, with male naturalized citizens having lower rates than male noncitizens. Conversely, women with citizenship, higher education levels, and more U.S. experience have higher participation rates. Labor force participation slightly increases during the first 30 years of U.S. experience for men. Labor force participation increases during the first 30 years of U.S. experience for men and women, with differences in participation rates based on region and citizenship status. Foreign-born workers from Latin America and Africa have higher participation rates, while noncitizens are more concentrated in certain industries compared to naturalized citizens and native-born workers. Foreign-born workers are more concentrated in industries employing less-skilled workers, but in highly skilled sectors like professional, scientific, and management, they are slightly more concentrated than naturalized citizens and native-born workers. Job competition between foreign-born and native-born workers is a concern, especially during economic downturns. The U.S. relies on foreign-born workers in skilled sectors like science and engineering, as well as in labor-intensive agriculture. The distribution of workers in different occupation categories shows similarities between native-born and foreign-born naturalized citizens. Foreign-born noncitizens concentrate less in higher-skilled services and more in lower-skilled service and industrial occupations compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. However, in computer, science, and engineering occupations, noncitizen foreign born are comparable to naturalized citizens and the native born. Occupation and industrial sector categories can mask the dominance of native-born or foreign-born nationals in certain occupations. Selected occupations show the proportions held by native and foreign-born men and women, categorized by citizenship status. The table in the previous paragraph shows the proportions of native and foreign-born workers in various occupations, highlighting occupational imbalances by gender, nativity, or citizenship. Native-born workers dominate in heavily unionized occupations, while foreign-born noncitizens are overrepresented in less-skilled jobs like sewing machine operators and agricultural workers. However, foreign-born individuals also exceed their national average in specialty occupations requiring higher education, such as physical scientists, physicians, and computer scientists. Among foreign-born workers, naturalized U.S. citizens have higher incomes compared to noncitizens, reflecting their higher educational attainment and U.S. experience. Median incomes of native-born workers are generally higher than foreign-born workers, but this gap diminishes at higher education levels, especially for female workers with at least a bachelor's degree. The poverty threshold, set annually by the Census Bureau, is used to classify individuals or families as poor based on their income level. Poverty rates among the foreign born vary by citizenship status, with noncitizens having higher rates compared to naturalized citizens. The difference in poverty level between native-born and foreign-born noncitizens is 10%, expanding to 21% when including those near the poverty threshold. Women, younger age groups, and less educated individuals have higher poverty rates. Children have a significantly higher poverty rate compared to working-age adults. Among the foreign born in the United States, poverty rates vary by region of origin, with higher rates for more recent arrivals and those from the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Mexico. Foreign-born individuals make up one-eighth of the U.S. population and accounted for one-third of population growth between 2000 and 2010. This group includes naturalized citizens, unauthorized aliens, and children with at least one foreign-born parent. Unauthorized aliens, legal residents, and naturalized citizens make up 28%, 35%, and 37% of the foreign-born population, respectively. Between 2000 and 2010, foreign-born workers accounted for almost all the growth in the U.S. workforce between ages 25-54. Their labor force contributions range from low-skilled occupations in agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors to highly skilled occupations in science, engineering, medicine, nursing, defense, and other fields. The origins of the foreign-born population have shifted from Europe to Latin America and Asia. Two-thirds of the foreign-born population lives in California, New York, Florida, Texas, Illinois, and New Jersey, with almost two-thirds arriving after 1990. Foreign-born workers in the U.S. workforce range from low-skilled to highly skilled occupations. They have lower average educational attainment but similar proportions with at least a bachelor's degree compared to native-born workers. Income and poverty differences are partly explained by education levels and occupational distributions. Naturalized citizens among the foreign-born have higher incomes due to education levels and U.S. labor market experience. Poverty status is linked to lack of citizenship, especially among the \"near-poor.\" The age composition of the American population can impact the U.S. labor force and public policy. Political debates over immigration policy may stem from different priorities for public spending between younger foreign-born individuals and older native-born residents. Data for this report primarily comes from the 2010 American Community Survey. The American Community Survey (ACS) collects information on socio-demographic characteristics, disability, language use, income, and housing annually. It has the advantage of continuous measurement compared to the decennial census. However, ACS estimates have a greater margin of error due to being sent to fewer households. This report presents computations at a large geographic level to avoid this issue. The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) dataset contains data on native-born and foreign-born individuals, with descriptive statistics based on large sample sizes supporting statistical validity. Nativity refers to whether someone is native born or foreign born, including those born in the United States or abroad to U.S. citizen parents. The Census Bureau defines native-born persons as U.S. citizens or nationals at birth. Foreign-born individuals can become U.S. citizens through naturalization, which requires living in the U.S. for at least five years, demonstrating good moral character and English proficiency, and passing a U.S. history and government exam. Legal permanent residents can apply for naturalization to become citizens."
