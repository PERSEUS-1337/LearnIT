The tuna processing industry in American Samoa is crucial for the local economy, providing 80% of private sector employment and generating a significant portion of the territory's income. Other private sector jobs in the region are closely tied to the tuna industry, making it an irreplaceable source of employment and economic growth. The tuna processing industry in American Samoa is vital for the local economy, with direct employment growth in the fish processing sector accounting for over one-third of total job growth. A study shows that changes in employment in the tuna industry have a multiplier effect, adding or subtracting jobs in other sectors. This multiplier effect is boosted by revenue generated from visitor expenditures on vessel services. The tuna industry in American Samoa provides various services such as vessel refueling, repair, and stevedores. However, many fishing vessels no longer directly deliver their catch to American Samoa due to low-wage labor rates in other countries. This has led to a decrease in economic benefits for the region. Due to various factors such as transportation costs, energy costs, decreased direct fish deliveries, minimum wage policy changes, and foreign competition in the tuna industry, one of American Samoa's tuna canneries will close by September 2009. This closure will result in significant job losses for private sector employees and increased costs for remaining businesses and public entities. If the remaining tuna processing plant also shuts down, another 40 percent of private sector employees will lose their jobs. The closure of one tuna cannery in American Samoa will result in significant job losses, with the potential closure of the remaining plant leading to a total job loss of 44 percent. The territory heavily relies on the canneries and Federal aid, and if both canneries leave, only direct Federal assistance will remain to offset the loss of approximately $80,000,000 in private sector income. American Samoa, with its population of nearly 70,000, will be heavily reliant on direct assistance from the Federal Government as the closure of canneries will devastate the economy. The territory has a long history of strategic importance to the United States, with many residents serving in the military, and their sacrifice in the Iraq war was disproportionate to their small size. Residents of American Samoa were 15 times more likely to be killed in action in Iraq than residents of the United States as a whole. The Federal Government should provide economic assistance to American Samoa, including support for the tuna processing industry, due to severe economic conditions in the territory. The Federal Government should expand general technical assistance to American Samoa to address severe economic conditions in the territory. The Act of December 24, 1980 is amended to provide technical assistance grants to American Samoa for processing whole tuna, with a grant of $200 per metric ton for each processor. The Act of December 24, 1980 is amended to provide technical assistance grants to American Samoa for processing whole tuna at $200 per metric ton, adjusted annually based on the increase in the federal minimum wage for American Samoa compared to the prior year. This applies to fishing vessels with a US fishery endorsement authorized to fish for tuna in specific regions. The United States South Pacific Tuna Treaty provides a fee of $200 per metric ton for fishing vessels with an American Samoa Longline Limited Access Permit or those United States-documented vessels authorized to fish for tuna in specific regions. Grants under the Regional Fishery Management Council or areas covered by the United States South Pacific Tuna Treaty are $100 per metric ton. Recipients can be either sellers or processors of direct-delivered whole tuna. The grants are not considered as gross income for tax purposes and are not subject to reduction by the Secretary for operation or maintenance set aside. Additionally, annual and transfer fees are collected for the benefit of economic development in American Samoa. Annual fees of $250,000 are required for vessels meeting specific criteria, with waivers available for vessels making direct deliveries of whole tuna to processors in American Samoa. This fee collection is aimed at supporting economic development in American Samoa. Annual fees of $250,000 are required for vessels meeting specific criteria, with waivers available for vessels making direct deliveries of whole tuna to processors in American Samoa. Vessels delivering tuna for transshipment under the United States South Pacific Tuna Treaty will be subject to a fee of 6.25 percent per metric ton per delivery, payable to the United States Treasury within 30 days. Additionally, a trust fund called the American Samoa Economic Development Trust Fund is created within the Treasury of the United States. The American Samoa Economic Development Trust Fund is established within the Treasury of the United States, with appropriations equivalent to amounts received in the Treasury. The Trust Fund is administered by the Office of Insular Affairs to carry out specific purposes. The Office of Insular Affairs can use excess amounts to provide financial assistance to American Samoa. The Secretary must establish regulations within 180 days to carry out the provisions, with the Technical Assistance Division responsible for administration. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and annual sums thereafter for paragraph (1)(A) purposes. An additional $300,000 is authorized for Salaries and Expenses. The Secretary is authorized $300,000 for the Salaries and Expenses account of the Office of Insular Affairs to carry out duties under this subsection. The amount is in addition to any other appropriations for the Office of Insular Affairs. Definitions include 'direct delivery' as whole tuna caught and moved from a fishing vessel to a processing facility in American Samoa for consumption in the US and its territories. The term 'transshipment' refers to unloading fish from one vessel to another for transportation to another location for processing, excluding frozen tuna loins."
