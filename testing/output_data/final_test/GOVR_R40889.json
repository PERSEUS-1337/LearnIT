    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law on March 23, 2010, and amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The legislation addresses noncitizen eligibility and verification issues, which are complex and intertwined with immigration policy reform. This report focuses on the intersection of immigration law and health care reform in major bills under consideration. The major bills related to healthcare reform include H.R. 3200, H.R. 3962, S. 1679, S. 1796, and H.R. 3590. Noncitizens are individuals who are not citizens or nationals of the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act defines noncitizens in the United States, including legal permanent residents, refugees, students, and temporary workers. In 2009, 21.3 million noncitizens made up 7.1% of the population, with 23.4% below the federal poverty level. A significant percentage lacked health insurance, with 43.8% in 2007. Legal immigrants and unauthorized aliens faced challenges with health insurance coverage in 2007. The report discusses noncitizen eligibility for health care reform legislation, including their current health coverage, eligibility for federal benefits, employment rules, and immigration verification. It builds on previous CRS reports analyzing tax obligations, poverty levels, and health insurance coverage of noncitizens. Noncitizens in the United States are affected by key elements of health care reform legislation in the 111th Congress, including an individual mandate for health insurance, a health insurance exchange, and subsidies based on income. Legal permanent residents (LPRs) are treated similarly to U.S. citizens under these bills, being mandated to purchase health insurance, eligible for the exchange, and eligible for subsidies. The treatment of noncitizens in health care reform legislation varies based on their immigration status. Legal permanent residents are treated similarly to U.S. citizens, mandated to have health insurance and eligible for subsidies. Unauthorized aliens are not eligible for subsidies and are barred from the health insurance exchange. The major health care reform bills have nuanced policies towards nonimmigrants, considering their legal status and potential path to becoming LPRs. These bills include elements based on employer-provided insurance, federal means-tested care, individual coverage, and subsidies for low- and moderate-income individuals. The policy implications of these elements vary based on immigration and citizenship status. The policy implications of health care reform bills for nonimmigrants are complex, considering their legal status and potential path to becoming LPRs. Key questions include types of health coverage, noncitizen eligibility for federal means-tested care, employment rules, and immigration verification. The U.S. Census Bureau's March Supplement to the Current Population Survey provides valuable data on noncitizens, including income, education, and household characteristics. The CPS data distinguishes between foreign-born individuals who have naturalized and those who have not, but does not differentiate between types of noncitizens. A recent analysis found that noncitizens were more likely to be uninsured compared to native-born and naturalized citizens in 2007. Noncitizens had the lowest rate of private insurance coverage. In 2007, noncitizens had lower rates of Medicare, Medicaid, and military/veterans coverage compared to native-born and naturalized citizens. Noncitizens were less likely to have private health insurance as well. In 2009, there were approximately 36.8 million foreign-born persons in the United States, with 15.5 million being naturalized U.S. citizens and 21.3 million noncitizens. Noncitizens made up 7.1% of the U.S. population, with 23.4% below the federal poverty level and 27.8% between 100% and 199% of the federal poverty level. Eligibility for health insurance premium subsidies is based on income and immigration status, which is not captured in existing surveys. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated that there were 11.9 million unauthorized immigrants living in the United States in 2008. They found that three-fourths of legal immigrants had health insurance coverage, while most unauthorized aliens did not. Unauthorized aliens, both adults and children, have significantly higher rates of lacking health insurance compared to legal immigrants and U.S.-born individuals. Passel and Cohn's analysis shows that 59% of unauthorized adult aliens were uninsured in 2007, while 45% of unauthorized alien children were without coverage. Additionally, poverty rates are much higher among unauthorized immigrants than U.S.-born or legal immigrant residents. Unauthorized immigrants, including adults and children, have higher rates of lacking health insurance compared to legal immigrants and U.S.-born individuals. Among unauthorized immigrants, one-in-five (21%) are poor, while the poverty rate is 13% for legal immigrants and 10% for U.S.-born adults. Unauthorized immigrants make up 11% of people below the poverty level, twice their representation in the total population. This poses policy implications for health care reform, especially for mixed-immigration status families. S. 1796 would require all U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents, and other aliens lawfully present to purchase health coverage through various programs or employers. Access to the health insurance exchange is limited to citizens, permanent residents, and aliens lawfully present. The Senate-passed H.R. 3590 mandates that citizens, nationals, and lawfully present individuals obtain health insurance starting in 2014. Access to the health insurance exchange is limited to citizens, permanent residents, and aliens lawfully present. The House bill, H.R. 3962, would limit access to the health insurance exchange to citizens, nationals, and lawfully present individuals. Nonresident aliens would be exempt from the individual mandate, but noncitizens meeting the definition of resident alien would be required to obtain health insurance. The House bill, H.R. 3962, restricts access to the health insurance exchange to citizens, nationals, and lawfully present individuals. Unauthorized aliens are barred from the exchange in other bills. Unauthorized aliens are not eligible for premium and cost-sharing credits in any major bills. Unauthorized aliens are excluded from receiving premium and cost-sharing credits in major bills such as S. 1679, S. 1796, and H.R. 3962. S. 1796 specifies that no credit shall be allowed for any portion of the premium attributable to an undocumented alien. The Senate-passed H.R. 3590 and S. 1796 exclude unauthorized aliens from receiving premium and cost-sharing credits. They both address mixed status families when calculating the premium credit, offering two methods for determining household income. The Senate-passed H.R. 3590 affirms that Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) below the poverty line and ineligible for Medicaid due to alien status would qualify for premium and cost-sharing credits. Prior to 1996, LPRs were not universally restricted from federal means-tested public assistance. Under current law, most newly arriving LPRs are barred from Medicaid and CHIP for five years. After five years, LPRs are eligible for CHIP, but Medicaid coverage becomes the state's option. Longtime LPRs as of August 22, 1996, are allowed Medicaid at state option. LPRs with a substantial work history or military connection are also eligible. SSI recipients must have Medicaid coverage if they meet noncitizen eligibility tests. Refugees and asylees are exceptions to the five-year bar for LPRs. Aliens who arrive as refugees or asylees are exempt from the five-year bar for LPRs and are eligible for Medicaid for seven years in the United States. States have the option to continue providing Medicaid after the initial seven years. CHIPRA 2009 allows states to offer Medicaid and CHIP to certain LPR children, pregnant women, and battered individuals during their first five years in the country. Nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens are generally barred from federal public benefits except for emergency services. PRWORA mandates that unauthorized alien women are ineligible for prenatal care under Medicaid, but citizen children of unauthorized alien mothers must receive automatic eligibility. CHIP is a federal public benefit barred for unauthorized aliens and nonimmigrants. Major health care reform bills do not change noncitizen eligibility laws for Medicaid or CHIP. All LPRs are allowed to work and classified as resident aliens for tax purposes. Some aliens not LPRs may work and reside in the US for periods of time. Noncitizens in the United States, including those who are not LPRs, may qualify as resident aliens for tax purposes based on the \"substantial presence\" test. The Internal Revenue Code treats all foreign nationals equally, subjecting them to federal taxes as either resident or nonresident aliens. Noncitizens authorized to work in the US are eligible for Social Security numbers. Unauthorized individuals meeting the \"substantial presence\" test are classified as resident aliens for tax purposes. Noncitizens authorized to work in the US are eligible for Social Security numbers (SSNs) to receive refundable tax credits. Taxpayers must provide SSNs for themselves, spouses, and qualifying children to claim certain credits, such as the earned income tax credit (EITC). Unauthorized aliens may claim other refundable credits without providing SSNs. The federal government considers refundable tax credits as federal public benefits that unauthorized migrants are ineligible to receive. Determining immigration and citizenship status can be challenging, but foreign nationals legally in the US have documents issued by the government to establish their status. The US Department of Homeland Security maintains databases to record the status of foreign nationals in the country. The United States provides various immigration documents for foreign-born individuals to establish identity and legal immigration status. These include the U.S. passport, certificates of birth, naturalization, and citizenship, as well as state-issued driver's licenses or military records. Additional documents like adoption decrees or civil service employment records before 1976 can also be used to confirm citizenship. All individuals seeking entry into the U.S. must demonstrate their status to DHS Customs and Border Protection. Foreign nationals seeking admission to the United States must show valid immigration documents with biometric identifiers, such as visas with fingerprints stored in the Consular Consolidated Database since the early 2000s. Since 2004, all US visas include biometric identifiers like finger scans and photographs. CBP inspectors now also scan 10-digit fingerprints of foreign nationals entering the country. The green card, or permanent resident card, is a plastic document with security features like digital images, holograms, and fingerprint scans. It is tamper-resistant and features a hologram of the Statue of Liberty, \"USA,\" and a government seal. The reverse side of the permanent resident card contains an optical memory stripe with engraved information, including the cardholder's photograph, name, signature, date of birth, and alien registration number. This information is laser-etched and digitally encoded, allowing it to be read only by a specially designed scanner. Aliens eligible to work in the US may request an employment authorization document (EAD), which is often confused with a green card. Nonimmigrants with temporary worker visas do not need EADs. Nonimmigrants with temporary worker visas, such as H-1Bs or H-2A visaholders, do not require Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) as permission to work is inherent in their visa. Other aliens authorized to work in the US, such as refugees, asylum applicants, and certain nonimmigrants, apply for EADs through USCIS. EADs have security features like digital images and holograms since 1998. Applicants for federal benefits programs must provide their Social Security number. For federal benefits programs like Medicaid, applicants must provide their Social Security number and declare their citizenship status. States can verify this information with the Social Security Administration. Table A-1 categorizes foreign-born individuals based on SSN eligibility. The SSA requires evidence of age, citizenship, and identity for SSN applicants. Noncitizens' SSNs do not automatically update with visa changes or immigration status adjustments. Reporting status changes is important. LPR naturalizes as a U.S. citizen and may have Social Security cards with different inscriptions based on their status. Reporting status changes to the SSA is crucial. The Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system provides access to immigration status data for determining noncitizen eligibility for public benefits. SAVE draws on the Verification Information System (VIS) database with over 60 million records and operates under the statutory authority of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 mandates various programs to verify an applicant's immigration status. PRWORA in 1996 required fair procedures for providing citizenship information. State and local agencies can access SAVE through web-based technologies or manual verification. SAVE charges fees for web access, and agencies must have a Memorandum of Understanding. The SAVE program allows agencies to verify immigration status using Web-based Internet access without requiring a SSN. Accessing SAVE takes 3-5 seconds, with additional verification taking 3-5 days if needed. If verification is still not achieved, the G-845 Document Verification Request form can be submitted. Under S. 1679, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would have a role in the process. Under S. 1679, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would verify eligibility for premium credits through the exchange using personal data like name, social security number, and date of birth. The Senate-passed H.R. 3590 and S. 1796 would use similar data to verify citizenship and immigration status. Claim of citizenship must align with SSA data for substantiation, while lawful presence claims must also be consistent. The legislation in S. 1796 and H.R. 3590 aims to verify citizenship and immigration status using federal data. H.R. 3962 requires the Health Choices Commissioner to verify citizenship and immigration status, referencing the SAVE system. The House bill would extend citizenship verification procedures to the citizenship and immigration determination for premium and cost-sharing credits, allowing the Health Choices Commissioner to make eligibility determinations. Policy questions arise regarding coverage, eligibility, and verification in the intersection of immigration policy and health care reform. The House bill raises questions about potential underbidding in the labor market, healthcare access for uninsured individuals presumed to be unauthorized aliens, and the impact on citizen children in mixed-status families. Other issues include the five-year bar on federal benefits for low- and moderate-income LPRs, financial responsibility for health insurance coverage of newly arriving LPRs, and eligibility for premium subsidies. These questions highlight the intersection of immigration policy and health care reform. The law links the income of sponsors to immigrant's income calculations for federal benefits eligibility. Affidavits of support are required for some LPRs to prevent becoming a public charge. Exceptions include refugees and employment-based LPRs. Sponsors must meet income requirements to financially support new immigrants, as per the Immigration and Nationality Act. Joint sponsors can share liability. The SAVE system includes sponsor information. Receiving Medicaid or CHIP does not lead to deportation for noncitizen beneficiaries. Medicaid or CHIP does not result in deportation for noncitizen beneficiaries. Sponsors are financially responsible for immigrants until they naturalize or meet work requirements. States must seek reimbursement from sponsors for federal benefits. CHIPRA 2009 provided an exception to this rule. CHIPRA 2009 provided an exception to the rule that sponsors are financially responsible for immigrants, allowing certain non-LPR aliens to work and reside in the US without accruing debt under an affidavit of support. Certain nonimmigrants are permitted to work in the United States, including E treaty traders and investors, H temporary workers, NAFTA temporary workers, F foreign students with permission, J and Q cultural exchange visitors, L intracompany transfers, K fiancees of U.S. citizens, O and P extraordinary athletes, entertainers, and performers, R religious workers, U crime victims, and V family members waiting for more than three years. Additionally, unauthorized aliens with \"quasi-legal\" status, such as those with TPS, EVD, or DED status, may also be able to work in the US. Aliens with pending petitions for LPR status or asylum cases before the courts may have employment authorization. Various documents like Permanent Resident Card, foreign passport with temporary I-551 stamp, Employment authorization with photograph I-766, and others can establish identity and legal immigration status. Various documents such as Refugee Travel Document I-571, Arrival-Departure Record I-94, Advance Parole Document I-512L, and others can establish identity and legal immigration status."
