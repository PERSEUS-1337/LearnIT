The Congress finds that respirators made in the United States are crucial for protecting workers, responders, and citizens from hazardous materials and disasters. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) regulates the design and testing of respirators to ensure their effectiveness. Respirators approved by NIOSH are crucial for worker safety, but manufacturers face product liability claims. Respirators impact interstate commerce, and litigation costs may lead to manufacturers ceasing production. The United States must maintain the capacity to produce and distribute respirators to ensure availability and protect the health of workers and emergency responders. The protections in this Act are necessary to ensure the continued availability of life-saving respirators. The Act emphasizes the importance of maintaining respirator production and distribution to protect workers and emergency responders.
