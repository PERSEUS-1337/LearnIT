The Digital Coast Act findings highlight the importance of geospatial information for coastal regions due to population growth and the need for public safety and economic development. The Digital Coast Act emphasizes the significance of geospatial data for coastal areas, essential for decision-making and management. This includes flood prediction, risk assessment, emergency planning, community resilience, and local permitting. The Digital Coast Act highlights the importance of geospatial data for coastal areas, including flood prediction, risk assessment, emergency planning, community resilience, local planning and permitting, habitat and ecosystem health assessments, and landscape change detection. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"coastal region\" refers to the area of US waters from the shoreline to the territorial sea. \"Coastal state\" is defined as in the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972. The \"Federal Geographic Data Committee\" promotes national geospatial data coordination. \"Remote sensing and other geospatial\" involves collecting and sharing graphical or digital data of physical features. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce, who acts through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This involves the collection and sharing of data related to Earth's physical features, including surveys, maps, satellite data, and services provided by professionals such as surveyors and cartographers. Establishment of the Digital Coast. The Secretary will establish the \"Digital Coast\" program to provide an enabling platform integrating geospatial data, tools, training, and best practices for coastal management. The program aims to enhance resilient communities, ecosystem values, and coastal economic growth through cost-effective solutions. The program requirements include data integration, tool development, training, documentation, dissemination, and archive. The Digital Coast program aims to enhance coastal management by making integrated data accessible through various websites, developing decision-support tools, documenting data to standards, and archiving raw data at appropriate data centers. The Secretary of the Digital Coast program coordinates activities to optimize data collection, sharing, and integration, consulting with coastal managers, decision makers, coastal States, local governments, academia, private sector, and NGOs. They also consult with other Federal agencies on relevant activities. The Secretary of the Digital Coast program coordinates activities to optimize data collection, sharing, and integration, consulting with various stakeholders including Federal agencies, State and local governments, academia, private sector, and NGOs. They also participate in establishing standards for interoperability of remote sensing and geospatial data. The Secretary of the Digital Coast program coordinates with various stakeholders and federal agencies to optimize data collection and sharing. They also develop best practices and fill gaps by maximizing the use of remote sensing and geospatial data collection activities. The Digital Coast program aims to fill data gaps for coastal management issues, including underserved areas and the Arctic under US jurisdiction. It supports the improvement of key data sets for coastal management, including coastal elevation, land use, socioeconomic, infrastructure, structures, and habitat data. The Digital Coast program aims to enhance coastal management data by integrating priority data sets like structures, living resources, habitat, cadastral data, and aerial imagery. The Secretary can enter financial agreements to support non-Federal entities participating in the program. The Secretary of the Digital Coast program can enter agreements with various entities, including private sector, to collect and provide geospatial data. Fees can be assessed for training or events that support the program's goals. The Secretary of the Digital Coast program can charge fees for training, workshops, or conferences to cover costs incurred. Fees collected can be used for conducting program activities or covering related expenses. The Secretary may establish tools to track ocean and Great Lakes economy data for coastal States and is authorized $4,000,000 annually from 2018 to 2022 for the program. The Senate passed S. 110 on May 25, 2017, requiring the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program for integrating coastal data with decision-support tools and collecting priority coastal geospatial data."
