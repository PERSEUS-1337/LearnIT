    "content": "Federal funding for major disasters has increased significantly in the past decade due to hurricane seasons in 2005, 2008, and Hurricane Sandy. Congressional attention has also grown towards the amount and processes of federal disaster assistance. Despite concerns over budget deficits, disaster relief funding has not been fully offset historically. Congress has implemented measures to limit federal spending, including the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established budget-controlling mechanisms, including caps on discretionary spending. If these caps are exceeded, sequestration would occur to reduce spending. The Act also allows for disaster relief funding beyond the budget, changing how Congress approaches spending on major disasters. The report discusses the pre-BCA funding mechanism for major disaster declarations, the evolution of funding under the BCA, and how Hurricane Sandy was addressed. It also covers various issues related to disaster relief funding in the BCA-regulated environment, such as time frames for congressional action, implications of rising Stafford Act declarations, funding in severe disaster years, cost offsetting, allowable adjustments, methodology for calculating 10-year average on disaster relief spending, and excluding Stafford Act assistance for emergencies. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is a no-year account used for response and recovery from major disasters, emergencies, and Fire Management Assistance Grants. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act authorizes federal assistance for major disasters declared by the President in response to requests from governors or tribal leaders. FEMA provides most federal assistance, but other agencies also contribute. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides disaster relief assistance, with other federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Education also offering support. Assistance can be funded by the agencies themselves or requested and paid for by FEMA. Additionally, federal agencies can provide aid even without a disaster declaration under the Stafford Act. The Small Business Administration can issue declarations for loans through the SBA Disaster Loan Program. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is the primary tool for funding disaster relief efforts. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is funded through the annual appropriations process, using data points to determine budget requests. The Administration's request for the DRF from FY2002 to FY2011 was roughly $1.9 billion per year, but the average spend-out rate was $4.2 billion per year. The current budgetary practice uses a ten-year rolling average of normal disaster costs. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) faced budget shortfalls without additional funding from Congress through supplemental appropriations due to not budgeting for high-cost disasters and the unpredictability of disaster events. FEMA's annual appropriations request did not account for disasters costing over $500 million, leading to chronic shortfalls in the DRF. The guideline for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) had not been adjusted for inflation for over a decade, leading to lower budget requests and appropriations. Congress typically provides additional funding through supplemental appropriations when the DRF balance is insufficient for disaster assistance. Concerns have been raised about the use of emergency appropriations for disaster assistance, as they bypass traditional budget processes and limits on discretionary spending. The Administration's tactic of requesting lower funding levels for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to mask potential disaster costs and project smaller deficits has led to the need for supplemental appropriations in 12 out of 20 fiscal years from FY1996 to FY2015. The data also show higher appropriations for the DRF after the passage of the Budget Control Act (BCA), but it is too early to determine if this has reduced the reliance on supplemental appropriations. The Budget Control Act (BCA) has reduced the need for supplemental appropriations by allowing adjustments to the spending cap for emergencies and disaster relief. The BCA defines emergencies as situations requiring new budget authority for the prevention or response to loss of life, property, or national security threats, and are unanticipated. The Budget Control Act (BCA) distinguishes disaster relief spending as separate from emergency spending, defining emergencies as situations requiring new budget authority for the prevention or response to loss of life, property, or national security threats, and are unanticipated. The term \"unanticipated\" means the situation is sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary. The BCA allows adjustments to the spending cap for emergencies and disaster relief, creating a separate allowable adjustment for disaster relief spending. The Budget Control Act distinguishes disaster relief spending from emergency spending, with specific criteria for what constitutes disaster relief. The BCA sets a limit on adjustments to spending caps for disaster relief based on a ten-year average, excluding extreme highs and lows. If Congress spends less than this average on disaster relief, it may not be eligible for certain adjustments. The Budget Control Act sets limits on adjustments to spending caps for disaster relief based on a ten-year average, excluding extreme highs and lows. If Congress spends less than this average on disaster relief, the caps can be adjusted upward by the unspent amount in the following year. Not all activities under the Disaster Relief Fund are eligible for funding under these adjustments, with some expenses funded through ordinary discretionary appropriations. FEMA and appropriations committees developed a new approach for accounting disaster-related activity post-BCA. Requests for DRF funding fall into two categories: disaster relief cap adjustment for major disasters and base/non-major disasters for other activities like Emergencies and Fire Management Assistance Grants. FEMA's funding request for major disasters is based on past spending plans, while non-catastrophic funding is determined by a 10-year average of costs. This approach has led to higher budget requests and annual appropriations for disaster relief. The FEMA funding request for major disasters is based on past spending plans, while non-catastrophic funding is determined by a 10-year average of costs. The allowable adjustment can be used to compensate for non-DRF relief, such as disaster relief programs under various departments. Hurricane Sandy was the first case where demand for disaster relief exceeded the allowable adjustment. OMB manages the sequestration process and limits on adjustments available to raise the discretionary spending limit as required by the BCA. The OMB annually calculates the adjusted 10-year rolling average of disaster relief spending for sequestration reports under the BBEDCA. The methodology ties to the BCA's definition of \"disaster relief,\" focusing on appropriations referencing the Stafford Act. Initial sequestration reports compared similar education programs to illustrate this. OMB calculated the initial allowable adjustment for disaster relief for FY2012 as $11.3 billion. The initial allowable adjustment for disaster relief for FY2012 was $11.3 billion, with $10.5 billion used and $799 million in carryover. The recalculated rolling average for FY2013 increased the allowable adjustment to $11.8 billion. $6.4 billion went to the DRF in FY2012, impacting spending in P.L. 112-175. This adjustment left a significant balance of roughly $5.4 billion in the DRF at the start of FY2013, potentially reducing the urgency for Hurricane Sandy supplemental funding. In FY2013, the entire allowable adjustment for disaster relief was used for the first time, with $5.4 billion allocated to the DRF. Congress faces policy questions regarding disaster relief funding, including time frames for action after disasters, rising Stafford Act declarations, and offsetting costs. Prior to the enactment of the BCA, Congress quickly responded to disasters by appropriating additional funds, as seen with September 11th and Hurricane Katrina. However, Hurricane Sandy, the first disaster under the BCA, had a different timeline due to a high DRF balance from previous years. This was influenced by the BCA mechanism and interim funding based on replenishment in FY2012, reducing the urgency for additional resources legislation. The DRF's high balance from previous years reduced the urgency for additional resources legislation after Hurricane Sandy. The Administration and Congress took time to assess relief fund targeting through a supplemental appropriations bill, unlike Hurricane Katrina where funds were quickly redistributed. The increase in emergency and disaster declarations since FEMA's inception in 1979 is unclear in cause, possibly due to more incidents or an increase in requests for federal assistance. The increase in emergency and disaster declarations since FEMA's inception in 1979 is unclear in cause, possibly due to more incidents or an increase in requests for federal assistance. The costs within the declared events can drive higher disaster spending amounts, with no means in place to limit or reduce federal expenditures on disaster assistance. If declarations continue to rise, Congress may need to approve larger amounts for disaster assistance, prompting the need for policies to reduce federal expenditures for assistance. Congress has provided additional budget authority for disaster assistance in response to incidents since 2005, with substantial appropriations for recovery efforts between FY2006 and FY2010. The initial disaster relief expenditures for Hurricane Katrina and other 2005 storms will no longer impact calculations for disaster assistance adjustments after FY2017. The allowable adjustment for disaster assistance will decrease significantly in FY2017 due to the rotation out of FY2005 and FY2006. If disaster spending remains below the 10-year average, the reduction in the allowable adjustment will be more pronounced. The adjustment is projected to fall by $2.2 billion from FY2015 to FY2016 and then by another $2.9 billion from FY2016 to FY2017, a 41% reduction in two years. As spending stays under the adjustment, it could continue to decrease, potentially leading to inadequate funding for future catastrophic disaster needs. Prior to Hurricane Sandy, there were four possible outcomes for meeting disaster assistance demands beyond the allowable adjustment. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, the Administration requested over $60 billion in relief from Congress, exceeding the allowable adjustment for disaster assistance. Congress faced a fiscal challenge with sequestration and expiring tax cuts, and chose to designate the additional assistance as emergency funding without offsets. Congress faced a fiscal challenge with sequestration and expiring tax cuts after Hurricane Sandy. They designated additional assistance as emergency funding without offsets, using the Congressional Budget Office for evaluation. Examples include amendments to offset the cost of the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act faced opposition for offsets to reduce immediate disaster assistance funding. Debate arose over politicizing disaster aid and potential delays in assistance. Proponents argued for offsets to ensure fiscal responsibility. Supporters of offsetting disaster assistance argue that it does not deny aid to victims but helps avoid increasing the deficit. Efforts were made to reduce the size of the FY2013 disaster supplemental and remove emergency funding designations for mitigation programs to stay within spending limits. Opponents argued that specific offsets for disaster assistance are necessary for morale and confidence in receiving help for recovery. Some Members prefer across-the-board cuts over finding specific offsets. The potential risks of across-the-board cuts for disaster assistance should not be overlooked, especially considering the significant offset required for the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act. OMB's methodology for calculating allowable adjustments for disaster relief is based on the Stafford Act, which influences future spending caps. The Stafford Act influences OMB's methodology for calculating disaster relief funding. OMB includes amounts in the 10-year average only if the legislative text explicitly references the Stafford Act. Otherwise, the funding is omitted from the calculation. The OMB includes funding for disaster relief in its calculations only if the legislative text explicitly references the Stafford Act. Funding not specifically designated in statute for Stafford Act activities is excluded from the calculation. The OMB excludes funding for disaster relief activities not explicitly referencing the Stafford Act in its calculations, even if past practices did not always require a specific mention of the Act in supplemental appropriations for disaster response. In the Disaster Relief and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008, provisions were made for various programs under the Department of Agriculture to provide relief funds for disaster recovery operations. This included allocations for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, Emergency Conservation Program, and Rural Development Disaster Assistance Fund. The Disaster Relief and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $150,000,000 for housing, community facilities, utilities, and business activities in areas affected by natural disasters. The funds are to be used for disasters declared by the President under the Stafford Act. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to reallocate funds among the specified activities with notification to the Committees on Appropriations. The Disaster Relief and Recovery Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 allocated $150,000,000 for housing, community facilities, utilities, and business activities in areas affected by natural disasters. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to reallocate funds among specified activities with notification to the Committees on Appropriations, including $38,000,000 for single and multi-family housing activities in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The cost of direct and guaranteed loans for authorized activities of the Rural Housing Service shall be as defined in section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Only the provisions in bold would be counted by OMB for purposes of calculating the cap on the adjustment for disaster relief under the Budget Control Act. The \"minibus\" legislation, P.L. 112-55, appropriates funds for the 'Emergency Conservation Program' for necessary expenses resulting from a major disaster declared under the Stafford Act. The provisions must meet OMB's criteria for accounting for disaster relief spending. The Congress appropriates funds for the 'Emergency Forest Restoration Program' and the 'Emergency Watershed Protection Program' for necessary expenses resulting from major disasters declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The total amount allocated is $244,300,000, designated for disaster relief. The Congress appropriates $215,900,000 for disaster relief under the Stafford Act, designated by Congress for emergency assistance. This funding is to remain available until expended and is considered by OMB as disaster relief. The Congress appropriates funding for disaster relief under the Stafford Act, impacting the budget for disaster assistance. Changes could be made to ensure a more accurate calculation of the 10-year average spent on disaster relief for use as a cap adjustment under the BCA. The Congress could potentially make changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) to improve the accuracy of calculating disaster relief funding. This could involve reevaluating how disaster costs are determined and adjusting the methodology for calculating disaster relief amounts. These changes may result in a higher and more precise yearly total of disaster relief, as well as a larger allowable adjustment for disaster relief under the BCA. The BCA currently excludes certain types of assistance provided under the Stafford Act. The Budget Control Act (BCA) excludes certain types of assistance provided under the Stafford Act, such as emergency declarations and FMAGs. Emergency declarations authorize activities to help states and communities during emergencies, including pre-incident declarations to save lives. Unlike major disasters, the President can declare an emergency without a governor's request in areas of federal responsibility. Emergency declarations are considered a minor expense compared to major disaster declarations, with congressional notification required for spending over $5 million. In 2005, 68 emergency declarations were made, including 50 for individual states to assist Hurricane Katrina victims. The federal government has increased efforts to pre-position resources before hurricanes, potentially increasing costs. The spending levels on disaster relief from the DRF used in OMB's accounting may be less than the total amount expended, possibly omitting certain expenses. The difference in amount expended from the DRF in the reported years may exclude expenditures for emergency and FMAG declarations, which provide assistance for fire management. Including these declarations in the calculation for disaster relief expenses could provide a more accurate forecast of federal disaster costs. The highest amount provided in FMAG declarations was around $112 million in 2007. Excluding these declarations from the ten-year average calculation may result in artificially low disaster relief costs. The enactment of the BCA brought changes to disaster assistance funding, allowing for prefunding of disaster needs. The debate over the impact of disaster relief on the federal budget typically arises during times of crisis, such as when the DRF faced depletion. In FY2013, the federal response to Hurricane Sandy led to legislative changes and reforms to disaster assistance funding. Some argue that the intent of the BCA was to reduce the use of emergency designations for disaster relief, while opponents believe that emergency designations were still used for larger incidents like Hurricane Sandy. Some argue that emergency designations for disaster relief should be offset to lessen budgetary impact, while others believe they are still necessary for catastrophic incidents. Congress may need to evaluate if the Budget Control Act has achieved its intended results, especially in disaster relief. Understanding the costs and funding of governmental assistance for disasters is crucial, as well as addressing laws to control disaster costs effectively. Controlling disaster costs requires addressing laws that establish the federal government's role in disaster response and recovery, as well as the expectations of state and local governments and the American people."
