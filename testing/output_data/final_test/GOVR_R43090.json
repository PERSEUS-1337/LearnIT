Balancing different priorities among states, federal interests, and private groups can lead to controversial disputes. The Chesapeake Bay is an example of joint efforts to address water resource problems. This report discusses the legal authority of federal and state governments in managing water resources in interstate basins. The report examines the role of interstate water compacts in managing interstate water basins, highlighting the concurrent roles of states and the federal government. States may enter into compacts with Congress consent to establish uniform rules for basin management. The federal government historically claimed control over waterways for navigation, while states asserted authority over water resources within their boundaries. The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government broad authority over water. The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government broad authority over water resources within the United States, allowing Congress to regulate interstate commerce. This includes regulating channels, instrumentalities, and activities that affect interstate commerce, with a focus on promoting navigation throughout the nation's waterways. The federal government has authority over water resources in the United States to ensure uninterrupted navigability of all navigable streams, regardless of state boundaries. This includes the power to keep waterways open, remove obstructions, and punish offenders. Federal actions related to water cannot be restricted by states' interests in controlling waters within their boundaries. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal authority over water resources is broad and can override state programs for water development. Congress can regulate water for purposes beyond navigation, such as flood control and hydropower. States have authority over water but must defer to Congress for commerce-related purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that states own navigable waters within their borders, with ownership rights subject to federal government authority. States acquire ownership of their navigable waters upon achieving statehood, but federal rights can supersede state interests. The state may not claim absolute authority to navigable waters if the federal government has constitutional authority. Disputes over water management in interstate basins can be addressed through interstate water compacts, requiring congressional consent. Interstate compacts require consent from Congress to avoid encroaching on the supremacy of the United States. States negotiate and agree on terms, with Congress approving the compact through a joint resolution or act. Congress may also provide prior authorization for specific agreements within preapproved purposes. Interstate compacts require Congress's consent to avoid conflicting with federal authority. Congressional approval may be needed if provisions differ from preapproved ones. Congress can amend or override compacts, as seen in the Chesapeake Bay watershed example involving six states and the District of Columbia. Congress enacted the Clean Water Act to control pollution in the nation's waterways, including efforts to manage the Chesapeake Bay. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Chesapeake Bay states, and private regional interests have entered interstate agreements to address watershed issues. The Obama Administration implemented new pollution restrictions for the Chesapeake Bay states. The Clean Water Act governs pollution control in the nation's waterways, including the Chesapeake Bay states. Congress recognized the role of states in pollution control and established cooperative federalism. The Clean Water Act, also known as \"cooperative federalism,\" allows states to implement national policies for pollution control. It regulates point-source discharges into US waters through permits under the NPDES and for dredged materials. States must set water quality standards, subject to federal approval. The Clean Water Act requires states to set water quality standards for their borders, subject to federal approval. EPA establishes effluent limitations for point sources to limit pollutant discharge. Point sources must obtain permits under the NPDES program to comply with the CWA. Permits can be issued by EPA or qualified states with their own programs, which must demonstrate legal authority to do so. Under the Clean Water Act, states must obtain federal approval to set water quality standards and establish effluent limitations for point sources. Qualified states can administer their own permitting programs, with EPA retaining oversight authority. States must identify waters not meeting standards, rank them by pollution severity, and establish total maximum daily loads for pollutants. EPA can require modifications or withdraw approval. The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) sets the maximum pollutant discharges allowed to meet water quality standards. States must submit assessments of impaired waters and corresponding TMDLs for federal review. EPA takes over if a state's assessments or TMDLs are disapproved. The Clean Water Act also regulates dredge or fill discharges into waterways, requiring federal permits. The Clean Water Act regulates dredge or fill discharges into waterways, requiring federal permits. States can administer their own permit programs if approved by EPA, with the authority to withdraw approval if not consistent with the CWA. States have the authority to certify discharges under the Clean Water Act, playing a significant role in the permitting process for activities that may result in water discharges. While the Chesapeake Bay states and federal government have cooperated in addressing water resource issues, a formal interstate compact for the Bay has not been adopted, with voluntary agreements being used instead. The Chesapeake Bay states have entered voluntary agreements to address watershed restoration goals and deadlines. The Chesapeake Bay Commission was created in the 1980s to coordinate policy issues among Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. The first Chesapeake Bay Agreement in 1983 recognized the Bay's decline and the need for cooperative solutions. An interstate council was established under this agreement for regular assessments. The interstate council was established in the 1980s to oversee the implementation of plans to improve the Chesapeake Bay estuarine systems. A second Chesapeake Bay Agreement in 1987 set specific goals and objectives, including a 40 percent reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Bay by the year 2000. The agreement reaffirmed the council's role in coordinating management efforts. The parties signed an agreement known as Chesapeake 2000 in 2000, reaffirming partnership and joint responsibility for addressing the Bay's resources. Goals and specific actions were identified to improve water quality before further regulatory actions were required. Efforts to improve the Chesapeake Bay watershed have been insufficient to meet restoration goals despite decades of activity by various entities. Litigation over the past decade led to a legal agreement where the federal government took a more active role in addressing issues in the Chesapeake Bay, which has raised new legal challenges. Litigation has challenged federal oversight of state actions under the Clean Water Act (CWA), particularly regarding the development of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for impaired waterways. Environmental organizations alleged Maryland's Department of the Environment was not developing TMDLs at an acceptable pace, but the court ruled that the CWA did not specify requirements for the complaint. The court ruled that the Clean Water Act did not set specific requirements for TMDL completion by the state, including pacing and timing. While prioritization of waters for treatment is required, there are no specific deadlines for completing TMDLs. The Act's two-year deadline for listing waters for TMDL development is seen as a goal rather than a mandate for completion. Nonprofit organizations sued EPA over the sufficiency of federal actions in the Chesapeake Bay, alleging that the Anacostia River TMDL approved by Maryland and the District of Columbia did not meet statutory requirements. The court found that the TMDL did not comply with the Clean Water Act as it only focused on plant and animal life, neglecting other designated uses like recreation and aesthetic enjoyment. The court acknowledged delays in TMDL implementation but held that the TMDL must reflect all applicable water quality standards. The court recognized delays in implementing the TMDL and emphasized the government's obligation to address all statutory requirements, including designated uses, under the Clean Water Act. Various parties filed a lawsuit in 2009 to compel EPA to comply with CWA obligations and establish programs for Chesapeake Bay water quality. A settlement agreement required EPA to establish the Bay TMDL by December 31, 2010, with states providing implementation plans for review biennially. President Obama issued Executive Order 13508 (E.O. 13508), Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration, directing federal agencies to collaborate with states to restore the Chesapeake Bay and ensure coordinated efforts for water quality and ecosystem health. EPA is expected to review implementation plans biennially. EPA, in consultation with state counterparts, identified existing authorities for Chesapeake Bay restoration, including the CWA. A Chesapeake Bay TMDL was established in 2010 by EPA, involving joint planning efforts among jurisdictions in the watershed. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL was established by EPA in 2010 to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment pollution in the Bay and its tributaries. The goal is to have implementation plans in place by 2025, with reductions required by 2017. EPA mandates a 25% reduction in nitrogen, 24% in phosphorus, and 20% in sediment in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, divided among jurisdictions and river basins. EPA established the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010 to reduce pollution in the Bay and its tributaries. Jurisdictions must meet two-year milestones to track progress towards TMDL goals. EPA will take contingency actions if progress is insufficient, such as increased federal oversight, requiring additional reductions, or revising water quality standards. Legal challenges have arisen, with one lawsuit claiming EPA exceeded its authority under the CWA. Agricultural organizations have challenged the requirements set by EPA in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, alleging that EPA micromanaged waterways and circumvented state authority under the CWA. They argue that the TMDL is meant to be informational only, not to assign specific limitations to parties. The case challenges whether the federal government has authority over TMDL implementation or if it solely belongs to states. TMDLs are tools used by EPA and states to coordinate responses to pollution. The court's decision may impact future regulation efforts in the Chesapeake Bay. The court's decision on the federal government's authority over TMDL implementation could lead to potential changes in regulation efforts for the Chesapeake Bay. Congress may need to amend EPA's authority or enact new legislation to address the issue."
