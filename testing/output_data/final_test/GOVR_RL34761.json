    "content": "From 1975 to about 2000, the Agent Orange issue in Vietnam was overshadowed by various factors such as Vietnam's pursuit of trade opportunities with the United States, the U.S. demand for accounting of missing soldiers, Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, and the influx of Vietnamese refugees. Despite efforts to normalize relations, the U.S. did not fulfill Nixon's promise of reconstruction aid, leading to diplomatic challenges. President Carter showed willingness to discuss normalization, but the issue of missing soldiers remained emotional. Normalization after inauguration was hindered by emotional issues like U.S. POW/MIAs, Vietnam's \"boat people\" migration, invasion of Cambodia, and border conflict with China. Relations worsened after Vietnam-USSR defense treaty in 1978, pushing Agent Orange topic off agenda. Reagan opposed normalization until Vietnamese forces left Cambodia and full accounting of POW/MIAs was provided. President George H. W. Bush reopened communication with Vietnam in 1989 and announced a \"roadmap\" for normalization of relations in April 1991, including cooperation in locating and returning the remains of 2,200 U.S. soldiers and civilians. Vietnam allowed the U.S. to open an MIA office in Hanoi and offered assistance in locating the remains of U.S. personnel. President Bush signed H.R. 556 into law on February 6, 1991. President Bush signed the \"Agent Orange Act of 1991\" into law, providing assistance to U.S. veterans exposed to herbicides like Agent Orange during the Vietnam era. However, this assistance did not extend to Vietnamese veterans and civilians. President Clinton later ended the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam and Congress expressed support for normalization of relations with Vietnam in 1994. President Clinton advanced U.S. relations with Vietnam by appointing the first post-war ambassador in 1996 and signing the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral trade agreement in 2000. Efforts were made to address the Agent Orange issue, with Defense Secretary William Cohen pledging greater cooperation in 2000 and a joint research study established during President Clinton's trip to Vietnam in 2000. In 2002, a memorandum of understanding was signed for collaborative research on human health. In 2002, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed for collaborative research on the human health and environmental effects of Agent Orange and dioxin, creating a Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) to oversee collaboration. However, there were clear limits on U.S. willingness to provide assistance, as stated by U.S. Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Gary Vest during bilateral meetings in 2000. Vest emphasized that the U.S. military could only undertake contamination cleanup activities outside of the United States under specific conditions. Progress towards normal bilateral relations continued during the Bush Administration with the ratification of the U.S.-Vietnam BTA in October 2001. The agreement granted Vietnam conditional normal trade relations (NTR) which were renewed annually until December 2006. Congress passed a comprehensive trade and tax bill in P.L. 109-432, granting Vietnam permanent NTR status as part of its accession to the World Trade Organization in January 2007. This led to a rapid growth in U.S. trade with Vietnam and increased investment by U.S. companies in manufacturing facilities in the country. Relations between Vietnam and the United States have improved on matters of national security, with joint naval exercises and military training programs. Total bilateral trade between the two nations rose significantly from 2001 to 2011. Despite the general improvement in bilateral relations during the Bush Administration, joint U.S.-Vietnamese studies on the effects of Agent Orange were conducted. During the Bush Administration, joint U.S.-Vietnamese studies on the effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam broke down due to claims of failure to act in good faith. The Vietnamese government was unwilling to accept internationally recognized scientific methods, and the U.S. unilaterally terminated the research project in 2005. The Bush Administration was also hesitant to provide direct assistance to individuals with health issues related to dioxin exposure. During a 2006 trip to Vietnam, U.S. officials were questioned about compensation for Agent Orange victims. The U.S. offered scientific information but not compensation to Vietnamese victims. Efforts to study Agent Orange exposure involve NGOs and both governments. The U.S. and Vietnamese governments have welcomed the involvement of NGOs in addressing Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. The Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) was established in 2006 and has met annually since. The U.S. government has provided assistance for scientific research and cleanup efforts but does not acknowledge legal liability for damages related to Agent Orange. The U.S. government questions Vietnam's evidence linking Agent Orange to health issues in the population. Despite lack of scientific certainty, the U.S. participates in cleanup efforts in Vietnam. The U.S. government has provided funding for environmental remediation and health care activities related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam, with a total of $63.4 million allocated so far. Funding levels have increased since 2007, with most funds directed towards environmental cleanup efforts. The U.S. government has allocated $63.4 million for environmental cleanup and health care activities related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam. Cooperative efforts between the U.S. and Vietnam include the creation of a Joint Advisory Committee, joint workshops, a $2 million project to enhance Vietnam's laboratory analysis capabilities, and $400,000 in financial support for dioxin mitigation. The U.S. government has provided financial support for health-related programs in Vietnam, including assistance for war-related conditions like AIDS relief, landmine victims, and dioxin mitigation. Funding for Agent Orange projects totaled $40 million from 1993 to 2007 and $43 million for disability assistance from 1989 to 2007. Funding for Agent Orange projects up to 2007 amounted to $2 million, used for technical and scientific activities. The funds were expended by U.S. government officials or their contractors, not going to the Vietnamese government or citizens. The primary forum for U.S. consultation with Vietnam on Agent Orange is the JAC, with the first meeting held in Hanoi in 2006. Topics like environmental cleanup and dioxin victim care were considered outside the JAC's scope. The Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) was established as a scientific advisory committee to provide expert consultation on AO/dioxin related programs in Vietnam. The JAC held meetings in 2007 and 2008 to focus on environmental remediation efforts and health issues. Congress allocated $3 million in 2007 for environmental remediation assistance in Vietnam. The State Department took over a year to decide how to use the $3 million allocated by Congress for environmental remediation in Vietnam. The funds were to be administered by USAID, with $500,000 budgeted for an environmental health advisor in Hanoi. Half of the funds were designated for remediation planning at Da Nang airport. In February 2009, a roundtable meeting was co-sponsored by Office 33 and the United Nations Development Program on remediation standards and technology in Vietnam. Representatives from various organizations agreed on immediate containment of dioxin-contaminated soil at major \"hot spots\" and discussed pilot testing technologies for cleanup. The 111th Congress allocated $18 million for dioxin cleanup and related health services in Vietnam. In addition to previous allocations, Congress appropriated $15.5 million for remediation activities at dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and $3 million for related health services. The 112th Congress allocated $20 million for environmental remediation and health activities in Vietnam, with specific funds for dioxin contamination at Da Nang and Bien Hoa airports. This was the first legislation to appropriate funds for contaminated sites beyond Da Nang. The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012 allocated funds for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam. $16.5 million has been obligated for environmental remediation and health services, with plans for an additional $45.1 million. USAID is responsible for overseeing the funds and plans to allocate $33.4 million for environmental remediation at Da Nang airport. USAID has allocated funds for environmental remediation efforts at Da Nang airport, environmental health activities, an environmental assessment of Bien Hoa airport, and administrative oversight. Additional contracts have been awarded for dioxin remediation and health-related activities in Vietnam. Funds have been used to hire an environmental health and remediation advisor and awarded as grants to non-government organizations. CDM International, Inc. has been the main contractor for assessing dioxin contamination. TerraTherm was contracted by USAID in 2012 to design a thermal remediation project for dioxin contamination at Da Nang Airport. The total cost of thermal treatment is estimated at $43 million, with the assessment concluding that thermal treatment is the most cost-effective method for decontamination. A memorandum of intent was signed in 2010 for environmental remediation, and contracts were awarded in 2012 for the cleanup efforts. In June 2012, USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech for the dioxin cleanup at Da Nang airport. CDM Smith received an $8.34 million contract for construction management, while Tetra Tech got a $17.00 million contract for excavation and construction. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 9, 2012, with U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear in attendance. Ambassador Shear aims to complete Da Nang airport cleanup by late 2016 and continue cooperation on dioxin cleanup at Bien Hoa airport. A $9 million health and disability program was announced, with $8 million to be obligated soon. East Meets West Foundation received a $500,000 grant to improve the quality of life for disabled individuals in Da Nang Province. Funds were allocated for medical and social screening, corrective surgery, physical therapy, scholarships, and community-based rehabilitation for people with disabilities in Danang. Save the Children received a grant in 2009 to enhance employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities and their families in Da Nang. The program in Da Nang provides technical assistance to empower people with disabilities with skills and training for economic success. It aims to help PWDs access services, find employment, start businesses, and increase market awareness. The activities also focus on gaining support from local government, private sector, and communities to create livelihood opportunities and a disability-friendly business environment. USAID assistance in Danang aims to improve well-being and livelihoods of people with disabilities by increasing their integration into society through rehabilitation services and socio-economic support. The program also strengthens local service providers' ability to serve the disabled population. Key activities include establishing a model for rehabilitation services and community-based support, and improving self-help groups' capacity to access health, social services, and economic support. The use of Agent Orange in Vietnam is surrounded by uncertainty and controversy regarding the amount sprayed, the presence of dioxin, and the long-term effects on the environment and people. The lack of detailed information is partly due to the \"fog of war\" and the lack of consideration for potential consequences at the time of use. After the Vietnam War, governments did not keep detailed troop deployment information for potential health claims related to Agent Orange exposure. Indirect evidence of dioxin exposure is sought through soil and blood samples, but few studies have been conducted due to research costs. Limited research has been done on the use of Agent Orange and herbicides in Vietnam due to cost and political implications. Despite the limited scale, studies show widespread contamination with dioxin in southern Vietnam, direct exposure of millions of Vietnamese, and evidence of elevated dioxin levels in blood and tissue samples. Research in Vietnam has shown higher levels of dioxin in individuals exposed to Agent Orange, but methodological issues make data interpretation challenging. Limited studies exist on the long-term health effects of dioxin exposure, hindering the establishment of a clear link to various health problems among the Vietnamese population. Agent Orange, a herbicide used by the U.S. military in Vietnam from 1961 to 1971, contained 2,4,-D and 2,4,5-T chemicals to eliminate enemy cover in dense foliage. Agent Orange, a herbicide used during the Vietnam War, contained 2,4,-D and 2,4,5-T chemicals. It was manufactured by several companies under Department of Defense contracts. Agent Orange was the most extensively used herbicide during the war, part of Operation Ranch Hand. Other herbicides used included Agent Blue, Agent Green, and Agent Pink. Agent Orange, along with Agents Pink and Purple, contained TCDD, a dioxin believed to be responsible for health issues from exposure. TCDD levels in Agent Orange varied, with contamination levels ranging from 0.05 to 47.0 parts per million. Studies during and after the Vietnam War found TCDD concentrations in stockpile samples ranging from 0.05 to 17.0 p.p.m. Research on Vietnamese exposure to Agent Orange and dioxin has been ongoing. Research into Vietnamese exposure to Agent Orange and dioxin has followed two approaches: one analyzing the herbicide's spraying patterns and the other examining dioxin levels in blood and tissue samples. However, neither approach has provided conclusive information due to data and methodological issues. Estimates suggest 11-12 million gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed in Vietnam during the war. During the Vietnam War, between 17.7 million and 20.3 million gallons of herbicide were used, with approximately 10.6 million to 12.1 million gallons being Agent Orange. Various studies estimate different amounts of herbicide sprayed, ranging from 18.85 million to 19.4 million gallons, with Agent Orange accounting for 11 million to 11.7 million gallons. Data on exposure to Agent Orange for Vietnamese nationals is challenging to determine due to various reasons. Official records for Operation Ranch Hand exist, but it is uncertain how much herbicide was sprayed in specific locations due to combat conditions. Additionally, herbicide leakage on military bases and the difficulty in correlating Vietnamese nationals in exposed areas further complicate the issue. Unlike U.S. Vietnam veterans who served for six months, Vietnamese nationals have been living in potentially contaminated areas for years. Scientific tests on soil and tissue samples are costly, with the average cost of determining dioxin levels in one person being $1,000. The Vietnamese government lacks financial resources for comprehensive exposure studies on Agent Orange. Studies involve estimating herbicide concentrations and testing dioxin levels in tissue samples of potentially exposed individuals. Difficulty in determining distribution of Agent Orange in Vietnam leads to varying estimates on exposed individuals. A 2005 study estimated 1.7 million hectares were sprayed with herbicides containing TCDD. During the Vietnam War, approximately 12,000 square miles of the nation were sprayed with herbicides, with some areas being sprayed multiple times. Studies have shown varying levels of Agent Orange distribution in southern Vietnam, with some researchers suggesting that heavy rains may have washed most of the dioxin out of the soil over the years. Specific \"dioxin hot spots\" in Vietnam include locations around military bases like Bien Hoa, Da Nang, Nha Trang, and Phu Cat, as well as the A Luoi Valley. Soil samples from Da Nang airbase showed TCDD concentrations up to 365 times the international maximum level. The former U.S. military base in the A Luoi Valley is also identified as a \"hot spot.\" A study of soil samples from the Bien Hoa airbase found one sample with a TEQ concentration exceeding the international maximum standard. Comparatively, Love Canal, NY, had a maximum TCDD concentration of 17,200 p.p.b., and Times Beach, MO, had a maximum of 1,750 p.p.b. Tissue samples like blood, breast milk, or adipose tissue are used to determine exposure levels to Agent Orange and TCDD. A 1995 study of over 3,200 Vietnamese nationals found elevated TEQ levels in southern Vietnam, where residents were presumably more heavily exposed to Agent Orange compared to those in northern Vietnam. Average blood, breast milk, and adipose levels of TCDD were significantly higher in residents of sprayed areas in northern Vietnam compared to those in non-sprayed areas. Studies on U.S. Vietnam War veterans showed contradictory results in dioxin concentrations in their bodies, with some revealing elevated TCDD levels in veterans who reported spraying Agent Orange. Some studies on Vietnam veterans showed contradictory results in TCDD levels, with some finding higher levels in those exposed to Agent Orange while others found no significant difference. Scientists suggest that differences in exposure circumstances may explain these discrepancies. Some studies have found elevated TCDD levels in Vietnam veterans who handled or sprayed Agent Orange, while results are inconsistent for those who operated in sprayed areas. Studies suggest that discrepancies in TCDD levels may be due to the inclusion of both exposed and non-exposed individuals in the Vietnam veteran group. Additionally, research on food from contaminated areas showed low TCDD levels in some crops but high levels in duck and fish fat samples. Studies have found elevated TCDD levels in Vietnam veterans who handled or sprayed Agent Orange, with discrepancies in levels possibly due to the inclusion of both exposed and non-exposed individuals. Elevated dioxin levels have also been found in Vietnamese immigrants and children born after the war, as well as in food and soil samples from the study area. Estimates suggest 2.1 million to 4.8 million Vietnamese nationals were exposed to Agent Orange, with at least 3 million suffering health problems as a result. According to MOLISA, over 365,000 Vietnamese veterans and their descendants have health issues linked to dioxin exposure. The Vietnamese government asserts that those exposed to Agent Orange during the war suffer from higher rates of diseases. It also claims that people in areas with residual TCDD face health complications. The children and grandchildren of those exposed have increased birth defects and health problems. The Vietnam Red Cross compiled lists of diseases associated with Agent Orange exposure in 1998 and 2000. The Vietnamese Ministry of Health compiled a list of diseases and deformities related to Agent Orange exposure, including bronchial carcinoma, tracheal cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Some diseases on the list are not recognized by the U.S. government. The focus has been on the affected children and their families in recent years. The effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam have primarily impacted children and their families, leading to severe deformities and disorders that require constant care. Due to limitations in Vietnam's healthcare system, most children are cared for at home, causing financial strain and loss of household income. Cleaning up the dioxin from Agent Orange spraying is challenging due to the area affected, time passed, and limited resources. There is a belief that natural elements like sunlight and rain may have reduced dioxin levels over time. The focus of Agent Orange cleanup efforts has shifted towards identifying and cleaning up \"hot spots\" with elevated levels of dioxin in the soil, such as airbases used by Operation Ranch Hand. Both the Vietnamese and U.S. governments have reasons to avoid or delay consideration of the cleanup, with concerns about liability and responsibility. Vietnam avoided raising the issue before obtaining NTR status with the U.S. in 2006 and membership in the WTO in 2007, while the U.S. government has also avoided the issue for similar reasons. Since Vietnam obtained PNTR status and joined the WTO, the issue of Agent Orange cleanup has gained prominence in bilateral relations. In 2007, the United States pledged $400,000 for dioxin cleanup at the Da Nang airbase and provided a detailed map of herbicide storage locations from 1962 to 1971. The Joint Advisory Committee (JAC) was established in 2002 to address environmental and health effects, but disagreements delayed its first meeting until 2006. The United States and Vietnam have disagreements over the role of the Joint Advisory Committee (JAC). The seventh JAC meeting was held in September 2012 in Hanoi, with delegations from both countries. The cost and scope of cleaning up Vietnam's dioxin \"hot spots\" have increased over time. The U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin is also involved in the cleanup process. The Vietnamese government estimated the cost for detoxifying the Da Nang and Bien Hoa airbases at $10 million, which has now increased to $43 million for Da Nang. USAID plans to use thermal desorption destruction technology for cleanup. The estimated completion time for the cleanup efforts has also increased. The cleanup efforts at the Da Nang airbase have faced delays due to rising costs and size of the project. The estimated completion date has been pushed back multiple times, with the latest projection set for late 2016. The method to remove dioxin from the contaminated soil has been agreed upon by both the Vietnamese and U.S. governments. The method chosen to remove dioxin from contaminated soil at Da Nang airport is thermal remediation using IPTD technology. TerraTherm will use conductive thermal heating elements and negative pressure to circulate heat, treating 72,900 cubic meters of soil in two stages. The thermal pile will be 100m long, 70m wide, and 8m tall, heating the soil to 335\u00b0C until dioxin levels are below 150 ppt. The Vietnamese government, with the help of international agencies, is working on cleanup projects for areas contaminated with dioxin, including Da Nang airport and Bien Hoa airbase. Limited evidence of detoxification efforts in heavily sprayed areas. Financial resources are lacking for these projects. War-related projects, such as removal of unexploded ordnance, are also being addressed. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Czech government are providing financial support for cleanup projects at Da Nang, Bien Hoa, and Phu Cat airbases contaminated with Agent Orange. The estimated cost for cleaning up these hotspots is nearly $51 million. A proposed 10-year plan with an estimated cost of $300 million aims to address the legacy of Agent Orange in Vietnam, focusing on remediation efforts and services for people with disabilities linked to dioxin. The remediation efforts for hotspots contaminated with Agent Orange in Vietnam are projected to cost $97.7 million, with an additional $202.3 million allocated for services for people with disabilities. The cleanup plan is divided into three phases, focusing on different sites and reforestation efforts. Similarly, the proposed plan for disability services is also divided into three phases, including a national survey and health training. The Dialogue Group proposed a plan to improve services for people with disabilities in Vietnam, with a total estimated cost of $202.3 million. The plan includes three phases, involving a national survey, training of health care providers, establishing bio-monitoring programs, and evaluating service programs. The funding sources were not specified, but it was suggested that the U.S. government, along with public and private donors, should play a key role in meeting the costs. The Dialogue Group's Second Year Report on the Declaration and Plan of Action reviewed developments including funding for environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam. The projected costs for cleanup at various sites were detailed, totaling $150 million. Additionally, costs for health-related services for Agent Orange/dioxin victims were increased to $300 million. The group suggested the U.S. government provide $65 million annually for five years, with other groups contributing $17 million per year. Limited information is available on Vietnam's assistance program for those exposed to Agent Orange. Vietnam's assistance program for people exposed to Agent Orange is often contradictory, with differing views within the government. While some groups seek more help from the United States, others are concerned about potential problems in bilateral relations. Office 33 collaborates with various ministries to provide special assistance to those suffering from conditions related to Agent Orange exposure. Vietnam provides disability stipends to those affected by Agent Orange, with payments of up to 300,000 Vietnamese dong ($20) per month. Eligible individuals include those who have lost the ability to work, children with deformities, and orphans with disabilities. The government spends an estimated $76 million annually on these stipends for individuals affected by Agent Orange. The cost of providing a $20 per month stipend to Vietnam's estimated 2.1 million-4.8 million Agent Orange victims would be $500 million to $1.2 billion. Various national organizations and provincial funds contribute to the Agent Orange Victims Protection Fund, raising millions of dong for aid programs. The Vietnamese government allocated $3.1 million for aid programs for dioxin victims. A national action plan was approved to address the consequences of toxic chemicals used in the Vietnam War, focusing on decontamination, assistance for victims, and research. Office 33 is tasked with coordinating the efforts. The Vietnamese government's recent focus is on identifying and providing monthly stipends to people affected by Agent Orange/dioxin through the AO Central Payments Programme. Medical Test Boards determine the extent of infection and health damages, with approval leading to stipend distribution. Around half of households with disabled members receive support through the program. The Vietnamese government's AO Central Payments Programme provides monetary benefits to veterans, civilians, and children affected by Agent Orange. Over 200,000 individuals receive monthly allowances totaling 60 billion dong ($4 million). The program costs the government around $50 million annually and offers varying stipend amounts based on factors like veteran status and number of affected family members. The Vietnamese government's AO Central Payments Programme provides monetary benefits to veterans, civilians, and children affected by Agent Orange. Non-monetary benefits include humanitarian center assistance and medical treatment for orphans. Those able to work or study and already receiving state benefits are excluded from the program. The Health Insurance Card provides free or low-cost access to healthcare for those on government assistance, including victims of Agent Orange/dioxin. Voluntary health insurance cards are available for city and rural residents at an annual premium. The Ministry of Health's Health Insurance Department aims to provide healthcare access. The Ministry of Health aims to provide health insurance to 70%-80% of the population by 2010. In 2007, 14.5 million people received Health Insurance Cards, increasing to 53 million by 2010. The government commemorates \"Agent Orange Day\" on August 10 to support victims. The Vietnam Red Cross organized a month-long campaign in 2008 for Agent Orange victims. The Vietnamese government has supported a U.S. civil suit seeking compensation for victims of Agent Orange. The suit was initially met with reluctance due to potential diplomatic implications, but influential supporters pushed for it to prevent the expiration of statute of limitations. The case was ultimately dismissed by the U.S. District Court in 2005. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a ruling that manufacturers of Agent Orange were not liable for providing defective products to the government. The use of herbicides during the Vietnam War was deemed not a violation of international law. The decision was strongly criticized by Vietnamese organizations. Vietnam strongly criticized the U.S. Supreme Court's decision not to review the lawsuit regarding Agent Orange/dioxin, ending the appeal process. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Le Dung expressed regret and indignation, while VAVA also expressed disappointment. The civil suit in Vietnam mirrors a 1979 case in the U.S. District Court involving Agent Orange. The 1979 case led to an out-of-court settlement of $180 million for U.S. Vietnam veterans. The Vietnamese plaintiffs may have hoped for a similar outcome. Approximately 1.6 million Vietnamese Americans in the US, many of whom left Vietnam after the war. Some were ARVN soldiers who may have been exposed to Agent Orange. Limited information on dioxin-related health issues among Vietnamese Americans due to reluctance to publicize problems related to Agent Orange exposure. Support for individuals exposed to Agent Orange/dioxin has increased in recent years, with NGOs providing assistance and raising funds through charity events. Both inside and outside of Vietnam, organizations have been formed to provide medical care and advocacy for those affected by exposure to Agent Orange. The Vietnam Red Cross (VRC) established a fund in 1998 to support Agent Orange victims, raising over 1.5 trillion dong in 2010. The VRC provides treatment, rehabilitation, training programs, and monetary support for victims, assisting over 667,000 people. They plan to raise 10 billion dong annually and contribute 1 billion dong to support victims. The Vietnam Red Cross (VRC) established a fund in 1998 to support Agent Orange victims, raising over 1.5 trillion dong in 2010. One major contributor to the VRC's Agent Orange programs is the Rare Antibody Antigen Supply, Inc. (RAAS), which has donated over 17 billion dong to the VRC. VAVA, a social organization formed by Vietnamese AO/dioxin victims, collaborates with the VRC to advise the Vietnamese government on Agent Orange policies and aid programs for victims. VAVA, a self-supporting NGO, has over 60,000 members in 53 provinces in Vietnam. It was initially established to file a lawsuit in the U.S. for compensation for Agent Orange exposure. VAVA now provides social services, monetary assistance, and raises public awareness about Agent Orange. VAVA is a prominent Vietnamese organization advocating for Agent Orange victims in Vietnam and the United States. They have organized various charity events, raising substantial funds, with the most successful event bringing in $1-2 million. The charity events organized by VAVA have raised significant funds, with the most successful event reportedly bringing in around $1 million-$2 million. These events often feature well-known Vietnamese and international celebrities, such as Trong Tan, Khanh Linh, Peter Yarrow, and Mick Moloney. The funds raised have supported the establishment of special schools, known as \"Peace Villages,\" across Vietnam for children with disabilities, many of which are caused by AO/dioxin exposure. Notably, the Hoa Binh Peace Village and Vietnam Friendship Village provide residential facilities and healthcare services for orphaned children, disabled adults, and those affected by dioxin poisoning. The Vietnamese government has provided land grants for villages caring for Agent Orange/dioxin victims. Assistance from various sources, including the United Nations and private donors, has totaled nearly $40 million by February 2012. This funding supports dioxin remediation and healthcare services in Vietnam. The Ford Foundation, along with UNICEF and UNDP, has been a significant contributor to addressing the healthcare and environmental impact of Agent Orange in Vietnam since 2000. Their Special Initiative on Agent Orange focuses on healthcare services for disabled Vietnamese, reducing exposure, cleanup efforts, and fostering dialogue between Vietnam and the United States. They work closely with both governments and have funded various programs since 2000. The Ford Foundation has funded programs in Vietnam since 2000 to address the impact of Agent Orange and dioxin, including scientific facilities development, cleanup efforts, healthcare support, disability rights advocacy, and organizing the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group. They have provided over $17 million in grants and mobilized funding from other sources like the Atlantic Philanthropies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They are the largest international contributor to Vietnam's dioxin cleanup efforts. The Ford Foundation has been a significant contributor to Vietnam's efforts to clean up dioxin, providing grants totaling over $4.8 million from 2000 to 2007. They have also pledged $7.5 million in support for the Dialogue Group and supported the Aspen Institute in addressing the health and environmental consequences of herbicide use during the Vietnam War. Additionally, UNICEF launched a project in April 2008 to provide healthcare and education to children with disabilities in Vietnam. UNICEF, in cooperation with the government of Vietnam, initiated a pilot program in Da Nang to train health workers, educators, parents, and caregivers on monitoring the health and nutrition of children with disabilities. A fund-raising campaign matching a $1 million grant from the Ford Foundation aims to expand similar programs nationwide. The United Nations Development Program allocated $350,000 for a dioxin cleanup program in collaboration with Vietnam's ministries. The Gates Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, and MONRE are funding a $6.75 million high-resolution dioxin testing laboratory. The United States, along with MONRE, is funding a $6.75 million high-resolution dioxin testing laboratory in Vietnam. The new facility will be capable of measuring low concentrations of dioxin in food and human tissue samples, aiding in contamination studies. War legacy issues have been overshadowed by economic and trade relations between the U.S. and Vietnam, but there is still a risk of mismanagement in addressing these issues. The Vietnamese government prioritizes economic and strategic considerations over U.S. assistance in addressing war legacy issues like Agent Orange victims. Vietnam seeks acceptance into the U.S. Generalized System of Preference program and is involved in TPP negotiations. There is concern in Vietnam about living conditions and a desire to expand security relations with the U.S. due to China's influence in Southeast Asia. The living conditions of 2.1 million-4.8 million people in Vietnam exposed to Agent Orange are a major concern, especially for children with medical conditions linked to dioxin exposure. The Vietnamese government attributes 3 million medical conditions to this exposure. There is worry that the positive attitude towards the United States in Vietnam could change if the U.S. government is seen as insensitive to Agent Orange issues. The U.S. has denied legal responsibility for health effects but has provided some assistance in assessing and cleaning up dioxin in Vietnam. The Vietnamese government seeks greater U.S. support for victims of Agent Orange/dioxin exposure. Both nations welcome U.S. involvement in identifying and cleaning up dioxin \"hot spots,\" but funding may delay remediation. Once cleanup is complete, attention may shift to caring for affected individuals, potentially causing bilateral tensions. The Vietnamese government is concerned about inconsistencies in U.S. aid for Agent Orange victims. The U.S. government provides generous support programs for U.S. veterans claiming Agent Orange-related medical problems but is reluctant to aid Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange. This inconsistency in policy could strain bilateral relations. The U.S. government is hesitant to provide assistance to Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange due to concerns about implications for future military conflicts. Efforts are being made through forums like the Joint Advisory Committee and Dialogue Group to address the war legacy issues of Agent Orange in Vietnam. The U.S. government is hesitant to provide assistance to Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange due to concerns about implications for future military conflicts. Efforts are being made through forums like the Joint Advisory Committee and Dialogue Group to address war legacy issues, including scientific research, environmental remediation, public awareness, and health care. Congressional involvement may not be necessary at this time, as bills have been introduced to provide additional funds for cleanup and assistance to victims. The Department of State Appropriations Act, 2013 would allocate funds for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health/disability activities in affected areas. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for environmental remediation at hot spots and health activities in heavily sprayed areas. The House version of the appropriations bill does not include these provisions. The House version of the appropriations bill, H.R. 5857, does not include provisions for environmental remediation or health/disability activities in Vietnam areas contaminated with dioxin. Congress has not passed either H.R. 5857 or S. 3241. Oversight is needed to ensure funds are used effectively, as detailed information on fund usage and results is lacking. Congress may exercise oversight to assess USAID's progress in providing assistance for Agent Orange in Vietnam, including requesting a GAO audit. Additional funds may be considered for exposure research, dioxin remediation, and humanitarian aid. Research costs exceed Vietnam's budget, and decontamination costs are beyond their resources.
