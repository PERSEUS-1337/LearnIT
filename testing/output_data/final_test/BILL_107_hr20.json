    "content": "SECTION 1. WAIVER OF OXYGEN CONTENT REQUIREMENTS. Section 211(k) of the Clean Air Act is amended to allow the Administrator to waive oxygen content requirements for a State upon petition by the Governor. The Administrator must grant the waiver within 270 days of receiving the petition. The Administrator must grant a waiver for oxygen content requirements to a State upon petition by the Governor. If the Administrator does not grant the petition, it is deemed to be granted. The waiver takes effect 90 days after being granted or deemed granted, unless an earlier effective date is established. SEC. 2. CONTROL OF OXYGENATES. The EPA has the authority to regulate or prohibit the use of oxygenates like MTBE in motor vehicles if they contaminate drinking water and pose a risk to public health or the environment. Amendments have been made to the Clean Air Act to allow for this regulation. Amendments to the Clean Air Act give the EPA authority to regulate oxygenates like MTBE in motor vehicles to protect public health and the environment. The amendments include provisions for considering the impact on other oxygenates to prevent endangering public health, welfare, or the environment in the United States. The EPA is required to regulate the annual volume of MTBE used as a fuel additive in motor vehicles to not exceed historical levels estimated from 1986 to 1991. The EPA may allow states to enforce controls on the use of MTBE as a fuel additive to reduce its volume below estimated levels, as stated in the Clean Air Act. The EPA may permit states to establish controls or prohibitions on MTBE on an expedited schedule if it is found to cause air pollution or water contamination that endangers public health. States must submit a petition to the Administrator, who will act on it within 180 days. No state can submit a petition before one year after the enactment of this provision. The EPA allows states to regulate MTBE if it poses health risks. States must petition the Administrator, who must respond within 180 days. No petition can be submitted within a year of this provision's enactment. Subparagraph (D) does not limit states' authority to control MTBE use under other laws. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE OF EMISSION CONTROL BENEFITS. To maintain toxic control benefits in oxygen waiver areas, the Clean Air Act is amended to establish regional performance standards for reducing toxic air pollutants under the Reformulated Gasoline Program. The Administrator must propose regulations within 90 days and promulgate them within 270 days of enactment. The Administrator will establish regional performance standards for reducing toxic air pollutants in areas where oxygen content requirements are waived. Regions will be selected based on gasoline distribution networks, compliance survey data, and other reliable sources. The Administrator will establish regional performance standards for reducing toxic air pollutants in areas where oxygen content requirements are waived for reformulated gasoline. The standards will be based on average air toxic reductions and apply to gasoline sold in specific regions. Gasoline air toxics performance standards are more stringent than regulations under section 202(l). These standards do not apply in states mentioned in section 211(c)(4)(B). The EPA's Phase II Reformulated Gasoline model toxic performance standards apply in areas where the oxygen content requirement is waived. Section 211 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include criteria for conventional gasoline by October 1, 2007. The Administrator will determine if the use of conventional gasoline in 2005 and 2006 resulted in higher emissions compared to 1998 and 1999. If a significant increase is found, regulations will be implemented under subsection (c) to address the emissions increase. The Administrator will determine if the use of conventional gasoline in 2005 and 2006 resulted in higher emissions compared to 1998 and 1999. Regulations will be implemented if a significant increase is found, without applying to states with a waiver under section 209(b). SEC. 4. ASSURANCE OF ADEQUATE FUEL SUPPLY. Regulations on fuel properties must consider lead time for refinery modifications to ensure fuel supply for all states. Allowances can be traded within regions specified in the Clean Air Act."
