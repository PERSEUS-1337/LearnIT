Despite not being recognized as U.S. citizens, Native Americans from Indian tribes enlisted in the Armed Forces and played a crucial role as code talkers, with the first reported use dating back to October 17, 1918. During World War II, Native American code talkers played a crucial role in transmitting messages in their native languages to confuse the enemy. The Choctaw code talkers were the first to use this tactic in modern warfare, followed by the Comanche Nation developing a secret code based on the Comanche language. Approximately 50 Native Americans were recruited by the United States Army for special communication assignments. During World War II, the United States Marine Corps recruited Navajos for special communication assignments. Native American code talkers developed secret unbreakable codes based on their languages, crucial in winning the war. In 2001, Navajo code talkers were honored with congressional gold medals for their heroic contributions as radio operators. Code talkers, Native Americans who transmitted secret coded messages during World War I and II, played a crucial role in driving back Axis forces in the Pacific. The Congress should recognize their contributions by providing them with the Congressional Gold Medals.
