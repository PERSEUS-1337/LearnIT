    "title": "SB 1078",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1281.65 of the Code of Civil Procedure prohibits arbitrators from accepting offers of employment or new professional relationships from parties or their lawyers during arbitration. In consumer arbitration cases, arbitrators cannot accept offers of employment as a dispute resolution neutral in another case involving a party or lawyer unless all parties have agreed in writing beforehand. Section 1281.9 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires neutral arbitrators to disclose any potential conflicts of interest in arbitration agreements. This section does not apply to arbitrations conducted by self-regulatory organizations or collective bargaining agreements. The definition of \"lawyer for a party\" is the same as in Section 1281.9. The proposed neutral arbitrator must disclose any disqualifying grounds under Section 170.1 and any potential conflicts of interest as per ethics standards. The proposed neutral arbitrator must disclose prior or pending noncollective bargaining cases served as a party arbitrator, including results and monetary damages awarded, if any. Confidentiality can be preserved by using generic terms for parties not involved in the current arbitration. The proposed neutral arbitrator must disclose prior or pending noncollective bargaining cases served as a party arbitrator, including results and monetary damages awarded, if any. Additionally, any attorney-client relationships with parties or their lawyers in the arbitration proceeding must be disclosed. The proposed neutral arbitrator must disclose any professional or personal relationships with a party or lawyer involved in the arbitration proceeding. For consumer arbitration cases, any solicitation by the arbitration company to a party or lawyer within the last two years must be disclosed, with exceptions for cases before January 1, 2017. This disclosure requirement does not apply to arbitrations conducted by self-regulatory organizations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For the purpose of disclosure, \"solicitation\" includes private presentations or discussions to designate an arbitration provider or arbitrator, but excludes general advertising or communications indicating a willingness to serve as an arbitrator. Presentations at public programs or seminars are also exempt from the definition of solicitation. The proposed neutral arbitrator must disclose all relevant information to parties within 10 days of nomination. \"Lawyer for a party\" includes any lawyer associated with the hired lawyer. \"Prior cases\" refer to noncollective bargaining cases with awards within five years. \"Any arbitration\" excludes collective bargaining agreements. SEC. 3. The provisions of this bill are severable, meaning that if any part is deemed invalid, it will not affect the rest of the bill that can still be enforced."
