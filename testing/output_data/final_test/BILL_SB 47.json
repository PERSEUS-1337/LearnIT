    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Consideration of Alternatives for Artificial Turf Infill Act of 2016, added to the Health and Safety Code, acknowledges the use of artificial turf fields in schools, parks, and local governments. It highlights the benefits of using alternative infills such as coconut fibers, rice husks, cork, sand, or virgin crumb rubber to reduce synthetic turf field temperatures. The average artificial turf field uses around 20,000 ground-up used tires for crumb rubber infill, which contains various chemicals. In 2008, Attorney General Jerry Brown sued artificial turf makers for excessive lead levels. In response, the Los Angeles Unified School District banned turf fields with waste tire crumb rubber infill in 2009. In 2010, Attorney General Jerry Brown settled with artificial turf makers to reduce lead levels and establish enforceable standards for lead in artificial turf. The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment's 2010 study on used tire crumb rubber in artificial turf fields found that eight chemicals known to cause cancer were present in the air above the fields. Exposure to five of these chemicals through inhalation resulted in increased lifetime cancer risks exceeding one in one million. The highest risk was from nitromethane, potentially causing nine cancer cases in a hypothetical population of one million soccer players. Additionally, two chemicals were identified as developmental/reproductive poisons. Several studies since 2007, including those by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and the US Environmental Protection Agency, have found harmful lead levels in turf fibers and rubber crumbs. A 2011 study concluded that artificial turf can deteriorate to form dust containing lead, posing a risk to children. Another study in 2012 showed high levels of toxic chemicals in recycled rubber materials, especially those targeting play areas for children, raising regulatory concerns. The Swedish Chemicals Agency advised against using rubber granules from waste tires in artificial turf due to hazardous substances found. The US EPA's limited study on tire crumb risk was deemed outdated, with a call for future studies to draw more comprehensive conclusions. On May 19, 2015, the chair of the CPSC testified before Congress that crumb rubber may not be safe for play. New federal studies are being conducted, and an enforcement review of artificial turf products for children was ordered due to high lead levels. A June 2015 study at Yale University found that crumb rubber infill from used tires contains 96 chemicals, with some being probable carcinogens and irritants. Some of the carcinogens include 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole, Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and Phenanthrene. Irritants include respiratory, skin, and eye irritants. In June 2015, The Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery and the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment allocated $3 million for a three-year study on the health effects of using recycled waste tires in playgrounds and artificial turf. OEHHA will assess potential health impacts based on toxicity criteria and monitoring data. It is important for schools and local governments to consider different infill options for artificial turf fields while awaiting study results. Before installing a new artificial turf field with crumb rubber infill, schools and local governments must gather information from companies offering alternative infill options. This includes discussing with at least one company that offers artificial turf products without crumb rubber infill. Consider using material without crumb rubber infill in artificial turf field projects based on gathered information. Hold a public meeting to discuss crumb rubber infill installation with public comment opportunities. Exemptions apply to installations and maintenance prior to January 1, 2017. The Children\u2019s Safe Playground and Turf Field Act of 2015, Section 115810, defines synthetic turf as material containing recycled crumb rubber used on fields or playgrounds. This article will be repealed on January 1, 2020, unless a later statute extends the date. The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, in consultation with other departments, will analyze synthetic turf for potential health impacts by July 1, 2017. The study will include a hazard analysis of exposure to various chemicals found in synthetic turf. An analysis will be conducted to assess the potential health impacts of chemicals found in synthetic turf, considering factors like exposure activities, environments, and age groups. Biomonitoring of individuals exposed to synthetic turf will also be used to determine any health effects. An examination will be conducted on the potential health impacts of synthetic turf fields and playgrounds, including risks of various cancers. This will also include studying the health effects associated with different ages of synthetic turf fields and playgrounds. An evaluation will be conducted on the differences in manufacturing synthetic turf and other turf products, considering health impacts. This includes the types of materials used and the effects on health. Additionally, a review of current research on the health impacts of synthetic turf will be included. Research will be conducted to fill data gaps identified in a report on the safety of artificial turf containing crumb rubber infill made from recycled tires. This includes examining health impacts of exposures to volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in synthetic turf fields. An analysis will compare temperatures on synthetic turf, nonwaste tire turf, and grass turf during high-temperature periods in the summer, including a health impact analysis on heat-related issues. A study will analyze synthetic turf fields and playgrounds in the state. Schools and local governments must meet specific conditions to install synthetic turf without crumb rubber from waste tires. The installation of synthetic turf fields and playgrounds in schools and local governments in California must meet specific conditions, including obtaining estimates from companies not using crumb rubber and holding public meetings for comments. The law does not apply to installations made before January 1, 2016, or maintenance on existing fields before that date. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2018, unless extended by a later statute. The tire recycling program in California may include grants, subsidies, and loans for businesses and public entities involved in reducing landfill disposal and illegal dumping of used tires. It also supports research for developing technologies, planning alternative recycling programs, and shredding used tires for recycling purposes. Development and implementation of an information and education program, seminars, and conferences to promote alternatives to landfill disposal of used tires. Grants or loans awarded to tire shredding programs at authorized facilities, including the purchase of shredders. Waste tire incentive payment program to increase demand for recycled tires and higher value products. Grants for businesses producing crumb rubber from waste tires to find alternative markets. The tire recycling program does not provide funding for synthetic turf. Eligible activities for funding include polymer treatment, rubber reclaiming, retreading, shredding, and manufacturing products from used tires like rubberized asphalt, playground equipment, crash barriers, and erosion control materials. The tire recycling program funds various environmentally safe applications such as playground equipment, crash barriers, erosion control materials, nonslip surfacing, oil spill recovery equipment, roofing adhesives, and products made from recycled rubber and plastic. Additionally, a study on potential health impacts of synthetic turf is required, and funding cannot be used for tire incineration activities. Paragraph (1) does not impact the permitting or regulation of tire incineration facilities."
