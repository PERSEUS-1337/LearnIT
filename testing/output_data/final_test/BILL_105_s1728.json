The Act \"Federal Regulatory Risk Assessment Act of 1997\" adds a new subchapter on risk assessments to Chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code. Definitions under section 551 apply, including the term 'cost' referring to significant adverse effects from rule implementation, 'Director' as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and 'flexible regulatory options' allowing flexibility in achieving statutory objectives. The term 'major rule' refers to a rule likely to have a significant annual economic impact or adversely affect various aspects such as the economy, small businesses, productivity, competition, jobs, environment, public health, safety, or governments. The term 'reasonable alternative' refers to a regulatory option that achieves the statute's objective and is within the agency's authority. 'Risk assessment' is the process of estimating harm from hazards. The term 'rule' excludes certain types of rules, such as those exempt from public comment procedures or related to internal revenue laws. The curr_chunk discusses rules that pertain to various aspects such as taxes, monetary policy, and the safety of financial institutions. The curr_chunk discusses rules related to financial institutions, including banks, credit unions, and foreign banks operating in the United States. It also covers regulations on the payments system, deposit insurance funds, and brokers' financial responsibility. The curr_chunk focuses on the responsibilities and regulations of brokers, dealers, and financial institutions in safeguarding investor funds, securities, and ensuring the clearance and settlement of transactions. It also includes rules related to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and custody of assets. The curr_chunk discusses rules and regulations applicable to various agencies and entities, including rules related to government securities custody, Federal Election Commission, Federal Communications Commission, annual rule promulgation, and public debt. The term 'substitution risk' is defined as an increased risk resulting from a regulatory option. The curr_chunk outlines the applicability of major rules addressing health, safety, or environmental risk, along with the process for determining major rules and publishing proposed rulemaking notices. When an agency publishes a notice of proposed rule making for a major rule under section 624(a), they must prepare an initial risk assessment and include a summary of it in the notice. After the Director determines a rule is major, the agency must promptly prepare an initial risk assessment, publish a summary in the Federal Register, and allow for public comments as if the assessment was issued with the proposed rule. When a final major rule is published, the agency must also prepare a final risk assessment and summary, addressing changes made to the proposed rule and risk assessment, as well as considering significant comments received. A major rule may be adopted without prior compliance with certain requirements if the agency finds good cause. The agency may exempt a rule from risk assessment under this subchapter in cases of emergency or imminent harm to public health or safety. If a major rule is adopted without prior compliance, the agency must still follow this subchapter promptly unless the rule is no longer in effect. Each agency must conduct risk assessments for proposed and final major rules in accordance with this subchapter. The agency may exempt a rule from risk assessment in cases of emergency or imminent harm. Risk assessments must be conducted for proposed and final major rules in accordance with the subchapter. If a final rule is substantially similar to the proposed rule with respect to the risk being addressed, a new risk assessment may not be required. Each agency must consider reliable scientific information for risk assessments and may use reasonable assumptions when such information is not available. The agency must identify, explain, and describe alternative assumptions in the risk assessment process. Each agency must consider reliable scientific information for risk assessments and may use reasonable assumptions when such information is not available. The agency must provide an opportunity for public comment and participation during the development of a risk assessment for a major rule, including a description of the hazard of concern, populations or natural resources involved, and exposure scenarios used. The agency must conduct a risk assessment for a major rule, considering scientific information and allowing public participation. The assessment should include estimates of population at risk, likelihood of exposure scenarios, potential harm, uncertainties, and express overall risk as a range or probability distribution. The agency should also identify exposure scenarios, risks, and likelihood to the general population. The agency must consider the distribution and likelihood of risk to the general population and sensitive subpopulations, including plausible risk estimates. When quantitative estimates are not available, qualitative factors influencing possible risks should be described. Relevant comparisons of risk should be made when scientific information permits, placing the nature and magnitude of a risk in relation to other comparable risks familiar to the public. The agency must describe significant substitution risks to health, safety, or the environment in the risk assessment. Deadlines for proposing or promulgating major rules may be suspended for up to 2 years under certain conditions. The agency's compliance with the provisions of this subchapter is subject to judicial review. Any determination of whether a rule is a major rule can only be set aside by a court if there is clear and convincing evidence of error. The Director's determination of a major rule is also subject to review. The Director's determination of a major rule under section 621(4) is not subject to judicial review. Any required risk assessment is part of the rulemaking record for judicial review, and failure to perform the assessment will result in remand or invalidation of the rule. Presidential authority is not limited by this Act. The text chunk discusses the exercise of authority by the President regarding regulatory policies and programs. It also includes technical and conforming amendments to the United States Code. The text chunk outlines the analysis of regulatory functions, including regulatory flexibility and risk assessments. It covers definitions, regulatory agenda, analysis preparation, procedures for comments, periodic rule review, judicial review, and reports. Additionally, it includes principles for risk assessments, deadlines for rulemaking, and judicial review. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act will take effect 180 days after enactment, except for agency rules with a notice of proposed rulemaking published before August 1, 1997."
