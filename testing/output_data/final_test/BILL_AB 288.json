    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the effectiveness of dual enrollment in improving educational outcomes for a wide range of students, including those at risk of dropping out. Allowing more high school students to take community college courses can benefit both students and the state by reducing dropouts, increasing transfers and degree completions, and better preparing students for college-level courses. California should reconsider its policies on dual enrollment to create partnerships between school districts and community colleges. These partnerships would offer support to underachieving students, those underrepresented in postsecondary education, students pursuing advanced studies in high school, and those seeking career technical education credentials. The goal is to establish clear pathways for students to transition smoothly to college-level coursework, leading to degrees, transfers to universities, or career technical education programs. To expand dual enrollment opportunities, California should remove fiscal penalties and policy barriers that discourage partnerships between school districts and community colleges. This will save students and the state valuable time, money, and educational resources. The governing board of a community college district may enter into a College and Career Access Pathways (CCAP) partnership with a school district to offer dual enrollment opportunities for students, aiming to improve graduation rates and college readiness. A participating community college district can form a CCAP partnership with a school district through an approved partnership agreement. The governing boards of both districts must present the agreement at public meetings, gather public comments, and then approve or disapprove the agreement. The CCAP partnership agreement outlines terms such as the number of students served, courses offered, criteria for student benefit, information sharing protocols, facilities use, and parental consent. It also designates a point of contact for the community college and school district partners. The CCAP partnership agreement must be filed with the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges and the department before the partnership begins. The chancellor has the authority to void any agreement that does not comply with the requirements. Community college districts in a partnership cannot offer physical education courses to high school students unless they align with the goals listed. Partnerships cannot be formed with school districts in the service area of another community college district without authorization. In a CCAP partnership, high school pupils cannot be charged prohibited fees. Community college districts can give enrollment priority to pupils in required courses. Instructors must not have certain criminal convictions. The CCAP partnership agreement ensures that no high school teacher displaces an existing high school teacher or community college faculty member when teaching a course for college credit. It also certifies that offering college credit courses at a high school campus does not reduce access to the same course at the community college campus. The CCAP partnership agreement ensures that oversubscribed community college courses cannot be offered in the partnership. It also certifies compliance with collective bargaining agreements and reporting requirements for teachers, specifies the employer of record, and ensures no displacement of eligible adults in the community college. The CCAP partnership agreement certifies that remedial courses taught by community college faculty at a high school campus are only for students below grade level in math or English. It involves collaboration between high school and community college faculty to provide innovative remediation in junior or senior year for college readiness. The participating district assumes reporting responsibilities for federal teacher quality mandates. A community college district can limit enrollment in a course for eligible high school students at a high school campus during the regular school day through a CCAP partnership agreement. The district can receive credits for full-time equivalent students attending these closed courses. Special part-time students in a CCAP partnership can enroll in up to 15 units per term, not exceeding four community college courses. The CCAP partnership agreement allows special part-time students to enroll in up to four community college courses per term as part of an academic program awarding a high school diploma and an associate degree or certificate. Participating community college districts exempt these students from certain fee requirements and cannot receive state funding for instructional activities already compensated by the partnering district. The CCAP partnership agreement allows high school pupils to attend community college as special part-time or full-time students. The community college is credited or reimbursed for the attendance, with reporting requirements on enrolled students and courses. The chancellor will prepare a report by January 1, 2021, evaluating CCAP partnerships, trends in special admits growth, and recommendations for program improvements, including changes to the statewide cap on special admit students and additional student assistance. The chancellor will ensure that the number of full-time equivalent students from CCAP partnerships is reported. The annual report will be sent to the Legislature, Director of Finance, and Superintendent. Any community college district violating the rules will face penalties. The statewide special admit students cannot exceed 10% of total full-time equivalent students. Existing dual enrollment partnerships will not be affected by this section unless they comply with its provisions. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2022, unless a later statute extends or deletes that date."
