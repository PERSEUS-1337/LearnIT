    "content": "The \"Hurricane Katrina Fast-Track Refunds for Working Families Act of 2005\" aims to provide immediate tax refunds to working families affected by the hurricane. These families, left with minimal assets after the storm, are struggling to find new employment and meet basic needs. By receiving their tax refunds quickly, they can stimulate local economic activity and address urgent necessities. SEC. 3. ADVANCE PAYMENT OF EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR 2005 FOR VICTIMS OF HURRICANE KATRINA. This section adds a new provision for advance payment of tax credits for victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Each eligible taxpayer is considered to have made a payment against the tax for their last taxable year ending in 2004, equal to the child tax credit refund amount and the earned income credit refund amount. Eligible taxpayer is defined as someone who received a child tax credit or earned income credit for their last taxable year ending in 2004. The child tax credit refund amount and earned income credit refund amount are determined for the last taxable year if the taxpayer qualifies for individual assistance due to Hurricane Katrina. The child tax credit and earned income credit refund amounts are determined for the last taxable year if the taxpayer qualifies for individual assistance due to Hurricane Katrina. Refunds for overpayments under this section will be promptly delivered to eligible recipients, and coordination with other tax credits is ensured. The child tax credit and earned income credit refund amounts for the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning in 2005 will be reduced by the payment made under this section. In the case of a joint return, half of the payment will be allocated to each individual. No interest will be allowed on any overpayment attributable to this section. \"Sec. 6430. Advance payment of earned income tax credit and child tax credit for 2005 for victims of Hurricane Katrina. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\""
