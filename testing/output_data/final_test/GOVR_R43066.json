    "content": "Section 1311 of the ACA provides indefinite amounts for planning and establishment grants for health insurance exchanges. States can apply for grants for exchange establishment work, with one deadline remaining this year. HHS has awarded three types of exchange grants, with no grants awarded after December 31, 2014. Table 1 displays the grants received by each state in 2014 for exchange planning and establishment. Exchange planning grants were given to 49 states and DC to fund research and planning for their exchanges. Level one establishment grants provide funding for states making progress, while level two grants support states further along in the establishment process until December 31, 2014. HHS has awarded exchange establishment grants to states that are progressing in establishing an exchange, with 37 states and DC receiving a total of $4.7 billion in funding. 14 states and DC have received both level one and level two funds. Additionally, on February 16, 2011, HHS awarded grants to help \"early innovator\" states design IT infrastructure for health insurance exchanges. The ACA provides funding for states to develop IT infrastructure for health insurance exchanges. Some states have returned their early innovator grants. Exchanges must be self-sustaining by 2015, with options to charge fees or find other funding sources. HHS will charge a monthly user fee to issuers selling plans through FFEs starting in 2014. In 2014, HHS will charge a monthly user fee to issuers selling plans through an FFE, based on billable members and a fee rate of 3.5% of the plan's monthly premium. CMS incurs administrative costs for various FFE functions, including IT systems, data services hub, consumer assistance, and navigator funding. Table 2 summarizes the sources and amounts of administrative funding for exchange operations to date. From FY2010 to FY2012, $456 million was used to support exchange operations, with $331 million from annual discretionary appropriations and $125 million from the Health Insurance Reform and Implementation Fund. Total administrative costs for CMS to support exchange operations were $1,545 million. In FY2013, CMS's administrative costs for exchange operations totaled $1,545 million. Despite requesting an increase of $1,001 million for ACA implementation, Congress did not provide additional discretionary funds. CMS used funds from various sources like discretionary funds from other HHS accounts, expired funds from NEF, mandatory funds from HIRIF, and Prevention and Public Health Fund to cover administrative costs. For FY2014, CMS estimated administrative costs of $1,390 million and requested an increase of $1,397 million for its Program Management account. In FY2014, CMS requested a $1,397 million increase for its Program Management account for ACA implementation. Congress did not provide additional funding, so CMS relied on transferred departmental funds, NEF, and HIRIF funding. They projected to collect $200 million in FFE user fees. The President's FY2015 budget includes $1,788 for exchange operations, with $629 million from CMS's Program Management account and $1,159 million from FFE user fees. CMS requested a $227 million increase for its Program Management account in FY2015 for ACA implementation. The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) at CMS manages grants for ACA implementation and private health insurance reforms. Detailed grant information is available on CCIIO's website."
