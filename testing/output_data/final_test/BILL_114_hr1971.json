    "content": "The \"Climate Solutions Act of 2015\" is the short title of this Act. The Congress has findings and a sense of the importance of addressing climate issues. The Congress finds the importance of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. The objective is to reduce emissions and limit global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The risks of a temperature increase above 2\u00b0C include the disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet, leading to a 23-foot rise in global sea levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts a temperature rise of 1.8\u00b0C to 4.0\u00b0C by the end of the century, but limiting greenhouse gas emissions can keep it below 2\u00b0C. Global warming impacts like heat waves and extreme weather events have already been observed worldwide. The impacts of climate change include increases in heat waves, rise in sea level, retreat of glaciers, decline in snowpack, droughts, wildfires, stronger hurricanes, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and effects on human population. Scientists project that by 2050, 25 percent of animal and plant species will face extinction due to global warming. Decisive action is crucial to minimize the dangers posed by climate change, as greenhouse gases can persist in the atmosphere for over a century. The International Energy Agency warns that investing in zero carbon renewable energy is essential to combat this issue. The PricewaterhouseCoopers Low Carbon Economy Index Report emphasizes the need for a serious commitment to investing in zero carbon renewable energy resources to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The United States, with only 5 percent of the world population, emits approximately 20 percent of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions and must lead in addressing global warming. California has demonstrated the importance of renewable energy standards in combating climate change. Existing energy efficiency and clean, renewable energy technologies can reduce global warming pollution, save consumers money, reduce oil dependence, enhance national security, clean the air, and protect pristine places from drilling and mining. The United States should participate in negotiations under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to establish mitigation commitments by major emitters of greenhouse gases. The United States should participate in negotiations under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to establish mitigation commitments by major emitters of greenhouse gases, aiming to achieve reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous interference with the Earth's climate while protecting economic and national security interests. SEC. 610 of Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 introduces a National Renewable Energy Standard. The Secretary is required to establish regulations mandating an annual increase in the percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources sold at the retail level in the United States. By 2030, this percentage must be at least 40%, and by 2050, it must be at least 80%. The Secretary will work with the EPA Administrator on this initiative. The Secretary has the authority to increase the required percentage of electricity generated from renewable sources. State actions to enhance renewable energy generation or energy efficiency are not limited by this section. SEC. 611 of Title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 establishes a National Energy Efficiency Standard. The Secretary will set end-user savings targets for energy suppliers in consultation with the EPA. Suppliers must achieve annual savings through efficiency improvements, with targets increasing gradually from 0.25% of sales in 2018 to 1.5% in 2023 and beyond. The Secretary will set end-user savings targets for energy suppliers, increasing gradually from 0.25% of sales in 2018 to 1.5% in 2023 and beyond. Targets are cumulative, with each year's savings to be achieved in addition to previous years. After 2028, the Secretary may increase required savings percentages, and suppliers can use a market-based trading system to meet targets. State actions to enhance renewable energy or energy efficiency are not limited by this section. SEC. 301. EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency must set emission reduction targets for 2030-2050 to decrease US greenhouse gas emissions by 40% in 2035 and 80% in 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The Administrator must arrange for the National Academies to submit a report every 5 years on the progress towards avoiding dangerous climate interference, evaluating emission reduction targets and policies under the Act. The National Academies must submit a report every 5 years on emission reduction targets and policies under the Clean Air Act to avoid dangerous climate change. If targets are deemed insufficient, further reductions and additional actions will be recommended. SEC. 303. REGULATIONS. The Administrator is required to promulgate final regulations to implement emission reduction targets under section 301 within 7 years of the Act's enactment. Every 5 years thereafter, the regulations must be reviewed and revised as necessary. If a report recommends regulatory action by a Federal department or agency, the head of that department or agency must finalize a rulemaking within 2 years. The regulations under subsection (a) may include additional measures to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions from any source or sector, including market-based measures, emissions standards, technology requirements, and other forms of regulations. This authority is in addition to existing regulations on greenhouse gases. The authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions may include additional measures beyond existing regulations. SEC. 304. SAVINGS CLAUSE. This title does not preempt State actions on climate change. SEC. 305. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 305. DEFINITIONS. The term \"greenhouse gas\" includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and any other gas determined by the Administrator to contribute to global warming. \"United States greenhouse gas emissions\" refers to the total emissions reported annually to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat."
