Monthly benefits are based on career-average earnings from jobs covered by Social Security, with a formula favoring low-paid workers by replacing a greater share of their earnings. This results in relatively higher benefits for low-paid workers compared to high-paid workers, despite lower dollar amounts. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) adjusts benefits for workers with mixed careers in covered and noncovered employment to remove unintended advantages in the regular benefit formula. This modification aims to prevent a \"windfall\" for retirees or disabled workers who have lower career-average earnings due to noncovered employment. The WEP reduces initial benefits to offset advantages in the regular benefit formula for workers with mixed careers in covered and noncovered employment. Workers qualify for Social Security benefits based on their covered employment history, needing at least 40 quarters of coverage. Initial benefits are calculated using a worker's career-average earnings indexed to average wage growth, with the highest 35 years of covered earnings factored in. The Social Security benefit formula calculates a worker's initial benefit amount based on their career-average earnings. This is done by totaling the highest 35 years of covered earnings and dividing by 35 to find the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). The benefit formula is progressive, providing a greater share of earnings replacement for low-paid workers. Three factors are applied to different levels of AIME to determine the primary insurance amount (PIA), which is the worker's basic benefit before adjustments. The formula used depends on the worker's earliest eligibility year (ELY). The Social Security benefit formula calculates a worker's initial benefit amount based on their career-average earnings. The averaging provision in the formula can result in low AIMEs for workers with short careers in covered employment. This is because years of zero covered earnings are factored into the calculation, even if the worker had high earnings in a noncovered career. The Social Security benefit formula may provide a higher replacement rate for workers with split careers between covered and noncovered employment, known as a \"windfall.\" The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) reduces the 90% factor in the formula for certain workers, lowering their benefits. The WEP reduces Social Security benefits for workers with split careers, with a maximum reduction of $463 per month for those with lower Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). The reduction is capped at half of the worker's noncovered pension to protect those with low pensions from noncovered work. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) is designed to protect workers with low pensions from noncovered work. It applies to retired or disabled workers with 21 to 29 years of substantial covered employment under Social Security. The WEP does not affect survivors of deceased insured workers or federal employees hired after January 1, 1984. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) affects various groups, including nonprofit organization employees exempt from Social Security coverage before 1984, workers eligible for pensions before 1986, and those receiving foreign pension payments post-1994. As of December 2018, around 1.9 million Social Security beneficiaries were impacted by the WEP. Approximately 1.9 million Social Security beneficiaries were affected by the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) in December 2018. The majority were retired workers, with around 3% of all beneficiaries and 4% of retired workers impacted. The WEP was enacted in 1983 to strengthen Social Security financing, using a 40% formula factor as a compromise between House and Senate proposals. The 1983 provision aimed to remove an unintended advantage in the Social Security benefit formula for certain retired or disabled worker-beneficiaries with pension benefits from non-Social Security jobs. It was meant to help low-paid workers but did not differentiate between them and those who worked in non-Social Security jobs. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) aims to equalize Social Security benefits for individuals who have worked in jobs not covered by Social Security. Proponents argue that it prevents overgenerous benefits to certain workers and rarely causes hardship as those affected typically have pensions from noncovered work. The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) ensures that Social Security benefits are not reduced by more than half of the pension from noncovered work. It is less impactful for those with 21 to 29 years of Social Security-covered work and eliminated for those with 30 years or more. Critics argue that the WEP is unfair and imprecise in determining benefits, especially for low-income workers. Brown and Weisbenner highlight two reasons why the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) can be regressive. Firstly, the WEP adjustment disproportionately reduces benefits for workers with lower Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIMEs). Secondly, high earners are more likely to benefit from the provision that phases out the WEP for individuals with between 21 and 29 years of covered employment. The WEP reduces benefits disproportionately for lower-earning households and can even provide a higher replacement rate for some high-income households. The WEP adjustment affects Social Security replacement rates based on covered earnings. Legislation introduced aims to repeal the WEP and GPO, impacting benefits for spouses and widows/widowers of insured workers. The WEP and GPO may be eliminated for benefits payable after December 2019. Repealing both would increase the net long-term cost of Social Security trust funds. Legislation like S. 710 and H.R. 1205 aimed to exempt certain firefighters and police officers from these provisions. The Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2018 proposed to replace the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) with a new formula for OASDI benefits. Other bills in the 115th Congress related to the WEP included the Social Security Equity Act of 2018 and the Social Security Fairness for Firefighters and Police Officers Act. The Equal Treatment of Public Servants Act of 2018 aimed to reduce the WEP benefit reduction and exempt certain firefighters and police officers with five years of service from the WEP and GPO."
