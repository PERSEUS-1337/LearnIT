    "content": "The \"Access to Obstetric Care Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title. Medicaid demonstration projects aim to improve access to obstetric services in underserved areas. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will oversee demonstration projects in states to reduce infant mortality by improving access to obstetric services for eligible pregnant women in underserved urban and rural areas. Projects will include innovative approaches like expediting reimbursement, using global fees for services, enhancing reimbursement for prenatal care, and implementing patient referral systems. Demonstration projects aim to reduce infant mortality by improving access to obstetric services for eligible pregnant women in underserved areas. This includes subsidizing insurance premiums, settling malpractice claims, and providing liability coverage for obstetric providers. Integrated prenatal, delivery, and postpartum services are essential. Additional funding under the State plan will be provided for these projects. The Secretary has the authority to waive certain requirements of the Social Security Act to implement demonstration projects aimed at reducing infant mortality. Funding for medical assistance for these projects is subject to appropriations over a 5-year period starting in 1994. The Secretary cannot approve projects that reduce funding amounts or waive specific requirements under the Act. The Secretary can approve demonstration projects under this section that reduce medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act. A State's request for approval shall be granted within 90 days unless additional information is needed. The Secretary can approve demonstration projects under this section to reduce medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act. Projects may be conducted from enactment of the Act to December 31, 1997, with evaluation plans for provider participation effects. A report to Congress is due by March 1, 1998, on using project results to improve access to obstetric services for pregnant women in underserved areas. Healthcare providers who can participate in demonstration projects include gynecologists, family practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and certified family nurse practitioners. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Office of Rural Health Policy, will develop and publish an annual compendium of State initiatives addressing the obstetric access crisis in urban and rural areas. This compendium will include information on State laws, programs, and initiatives aimed at increasing access to obstetric care in underserved areas, addressing liability issues, retaining providers, and evaluating the effectiveness of these initiatives. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide a grant for a study on obstetrical malpractice claims comparing patients under title XIX of the Social Security Act and private insurance. The study will review medical records at selected hospitals, including rural ones, to determine rates for each group. A report on the study must be submitted to Congress within 2 years."
