    "content": "The \"Ethical Pathway Act of 2012\" aims to eliminate duplicative clinical testing of new pharmaceutical drugs, vaccines, biological products, or medical devices that goes against ethical norms. It allows for reliance on existing trials, with shared costs, during the period when regulatory test data is protected. The \"Ethical Pathway Act of 2012\" defines key terms related to the regulation of new pharmaceutical drugs, vaccines, biological products, and medical devices. It includes definitions for applicant, Commissioner, regulated product, regulatory test data, and relevant application or license. The \"Ethical Pathway Act of 2012\" defines an application or license as a new drug application or new biological product license approved by the Secretary or relevant authority. The Secretary is defined as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Act establishes a mechanism for cost-sharing arrangements for applicants to conduct clinical investigations in compliance with ethical principles. The \"Ethical Pathway Act of 2012\" requires applicants to adhere to ethical principles, including the Declaration of Helsinki, when conducting clinical investigations for regulatory approval of a product. Applicants must ensure that investigations have not been duplicated and make efforts to obtain voluntary agreements for cost-sharing arrangements. The \"Ethical Pathway Act of 2012\" mandates applicants to adhere to ethical principles like the Declaration of Helsinki during clinical investigations for regulatory approval. Efforts must be made to obtain voluntary agreements for using existing regulatory test data, with arbitration available if agreements cannot be reached. The Commissioner will determine a reasonable fee for using regulatory test data if parties refuse arbitration. Factors considered include costs of clinical investigations, risks, subsidies, and market share. The Secretary will adopt procedures for public disclosure of costs and fees related to nonvoluntary reliance on regulatory test data to enhance transparency and predictability. The arbitrator or Commissioner will make public the fees related to clinical investigations, including summary data of actual costs and factors considered. Disclosure requirements do not apply if the owner of regulatory test data rights does not assert exclusive reliance. The fee paid by the applicant for relying on data must be disclosed to the Secretary or a designee and made public."
