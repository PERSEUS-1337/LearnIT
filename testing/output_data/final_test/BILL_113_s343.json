    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Three Kids Mine Remediation and Reclamation Act\" and includes definitions for clarity. The Act defines \"Federal land\" as the 948 acres within the Three Kids Mine Project Site, \"hazardous substance\", \"pollutant or contaminant\", and \"remedy\" as per the Comprehensive Environmental Response Act, and \"Henderson Redevelopment Agency\" as the agency of the City of Henderson, Nevada. The term \"Three Kids Mine Project Site\" refers to approximately 1,262 acres of land consisting of Federal and adjacent non-Federal land, as depicted on the map titled \"Three Kids Mine Project Area\" dated February 6, 2012. The terms \"map\", \"Secretary\", and \"State\" are also defined in relation to this project. SEC. 3. LAND CONVEYANCE. The Secretary shall convey Federal land to the Henderson Redevelopment Agency within 90 days if certain conditions are met, with payment based on fair market value determined by appraisal. The Secretary determines fair market value of Federal land through an appraisal conducted according to recognized standards, excluding historical mining contamination. The Secretary will estimate costs for assessing, remediating, and reclaiming the Three Kids Mine Project Site based on a Phase II environmental site assessment approved by the State and following ASTM International Standard E-2137-06. The Phase II environmental site assessment for the Three Kids Mine Project Site must adhere to ASTM International Standard E-1527-05. The Secretary will review cost information provided by the Henderson Redevelopment Agency and the State for the estimate in the preparation of the Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessments. The Secretary, Henderson Redevelopment Agency, and the State will jointly select experts to assist in making the final estimate of costs if there is a disagreement. The Secretary must begin the appraisal and cost estimates within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The Henderson Redevelopment Agency will reimburse the Secretary for appraisal costs and the fair market value of Federal land will be adjusted based on estimates of remediation and reclamation costs. The conveyance of land is contingent on the Secretary receiving notification from the State regarding mine remediation. The Henderson Redevelopment Agency will reimburse the Secretary for appraisal costs and adjust the fair market value of Federal land based on estimates of remediation and reclamation costs. A mine remediation and reclamation agreement must be executed between the State and the responsible party, meeting specific requirements outlined in the agreement. The mine remediation and reclamation agreement obligates a party to perform necessary remediation work at the Three Kids Mine Project Site to protect human health and the environment. It includes provisions determined by the State, such as financial assurance, to ensure completion of the remedy. The Henderson Redevelopment Agency must notify the Secretary within 90 days of the mine remediation agreement's execution to accept conveyance of the Federal land. SEC. 4. WITHDRAWAL. For a 10-year period, Federal land is withdrawn from various activities under public land laws and mining laws. Any withdrawal under public land laws that includes Federal land no longer needed by the Bureau of Reclamation is relinquished and revoked to exclude the unnecessary property. The Act allows for the immediate conveyance of Federal land no longer needed and excludes unnecessary property from the withdrawal. Existing water conveyance infrastructure and facilities on Federal land remain under exclusive and perpetual use by existing rights holders. SEC. 5. ACEC BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT. The boundary of the River Mountains Area of Critical Environmental Concern is adjusted to exclude the Three Kids Mine Project Site. SEC. 6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES. On completion of the conveyance under section 3, parties to the mine remediation and reclamation agreement are responsible for compliance. If terms of the agreement are not met, the Secretary retains responsibility for additional response actions to protect public health and the environment. This Act does not modify obligations to comply with environmental laws. The conveyance under section 3 transfers responsibility for compliance with mine remediation and reclamation agreement terms. The Act does not affect obligations to comply with environmental laws."
