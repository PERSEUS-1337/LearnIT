    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act\" and includes findings related to public safety. Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the need for interoperable communications for public safety became critical. The inability of firefighters and police to communicate in the World Trade Centers resulted in preventable loss of lives. Interoperability problems and equipment shortages continue to affect first responders, requiring additional funding to address these issues and ensure readiness for future terrorist attacks. The United States is underfunding local emergency responders, putting the country at risk of being unprepared for a catastrophic attack on American soil. Immediate increases in funding are essential to address daily communication needs and ensure readiness for future terrorist attacks. SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY TRUST FUND. An amendment to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act establishes a new section for a Public Safety Trust Fund. The Public Safety Communications Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, consisting of appropriated amounts and 50% of auction proceeds from certain frequency bands. The Public Safety Communications Trust Fund includes auction proceeds from specific frequency bands, such as the 1710-1755 megahertz band and the 2385-2390 megahertz band, allocated for non-Federal use through competitive bidding. The board of directors can reduce grant needs under subsection (c) and submit a statement to Congress. The Public Safety Communications Trust Fund can reduce grant needs under subsection (c) by specifying a lower percentage to meet the needs without yielding a surplus. This lower percentage will be applied to future auctions conducted after the submission of the statement to Congress. Additionally, funds are appropriated from the Fund for grants under this section. Unused funds will revert back. The Public Safety Communications Trust Fund will revert any unspent grant proceeds to the Fund at the end of the grant period. The Fund will be administered by the NTIA Administrator with a board of directors appointed by the Secretary, focusing on grant management, communications, and public safety. The board will establish criteria for fund allocation. The Public Safety Communications Trust Fund will be administered by the NTIA Administrator with a board of directors appointed by the Secretary. The board will establish criteria for grant recipients, determine grant amounts, and review fund usage. Board members will not receive compensation but may receive travel expenses. The Trust's purpose is to achieve objectives outlined in the part. The Administrator can make grants from the Public Safety Communications Trust Fund for interoperability and modernization of communications needs for public safety agencies, giving preference to broader scope projects. Grants can be single or multi-year to facilitate implementation. Entities eligible for funds from the Public Safety Communications Trust Fund include state or local government agencies, nonprofit organizations with a public safety function, and tax-exempt entities. Funds can be used for equipment, training, planning, and research to enhance communication interoperability in public safety and fire services. The Public Safety Communications Trust Fund provides $500,000,000 annually for improving communication interoperability in public safety, fire, emergency, law enforcement, and crisis management. Grant recipients must report on fund usage and progress, while the Administrator submits an annual report to Congress on fund operations and grants. The Public Safety Communications Trust Fund allocates $500,000,000 yearly for enhancing communication interoperability in various public safety sectors. Recipients must report on fund usage and progress, while the Administrator submits an annual report to Congress on fund operations and grants. The Administrator may establish necessary regulations for implementing this section, and specific definitions are provided for terms like 'the Fund' and 'the board'."
