This report provides an overview of poverty measurement in the United States, including the official measure of poverty, the Supplemental Poverty Measure for research purposes, and the Health and Human Services poverty guidelines used in administering programs for low-income individuals. This report discusses poverty measures used in the United States for official, research, and administrative purposes. It defines poverty as the state of being poor and lacking the means to provide material needs or comforts. Poverty is characterized by limited resources, leading to hardship and deprivation. In the United States, poverty is defined as lacking sufficient financial resources to meet basic material well-being. Poverty measures are based on income levels compared to a set threshold representing economic privation. Family income below the threshold is considered \"in poverty,\" while income at or above the threshold is not. The poverty measures discussed in this report focus on economic needs and resources, while other indicators of well-being include material well-being, access to quality housing, neighborhood conditions, community services, economic mobility, and health outcomes. The poverty measures discussed in this report focus on economic needs and resources, such as the ability to move up the income distribution, access to high paying jobs, and geographic access to those jobs. These measures do not directly capture the physical, mental, or social effects of poverty, but they do illustrate economic privation. The purpose of these measures is to accurately measure economic privation, rather than describe the full range of resources needed for self-sufficiency. The poverty measures used in the United States focus on income flow rather than assets or debt as the relevant resources for meeting needs. This focus was driven by available data limitations when the official poverty measure was developed. The poverty measures in the United States focus on income flow rather than assets or debt. Poverty data are obtained from surveys and are estimates with margins of error. Different data sources will yield varying poverty estimates. The Census Bureau releases official poverty measure data every September based on the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement. The poverty measures in the United States focus on money income before taxes, using 48 poverty thresholds that vary by family size and members' ages. These thresholds are not adjusted geographically and are updated for inflation using the CPI-U. The thresholds do not increase by the same dollar amount between each family size and do not increase or decrease consistently with changes in the number of children and adults. Equivalence scales capture economies of scale in maintaining families, with fixed and variable costs. The poverty line was initially set at $3,000 for families and $1,500 for individuals during the War on Poverty in the Johnson Administration. In the early 1960s, Mollie Orshansky analyzed poverty using food costs based on the Economy Food Plan by the USDA. Orshansky's thresholds were based on recommended dietary allowances for males and females by age group, condensed into amounts varying by family size. Orshansky analyzed poverty using food costs based on the Economy Food Plan by the USDA, varying by family size and composition. She derived total family income by multiplying family food costs by three, with a factor of 3.7 for two-person families. The methodology undergirds the official poverty thresholds used today, updated annually for inflation. The official poverty thresholds are updated annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Poverty measurement involves comparing resources to a measure of need, with variations in definitions of resources and needs. The comparison is typically expressed as a ratio of resources to needs, where a ratio of less than one indicates poverty. The poverty level is determined by comparing resources to a measure of need, with a ratio of less than one indicating poverty. Different ratios, such as 200% of poverty, are used to measure low-income populations for specific programs. Income-to-poverty ratios show that economic well-being falls along a spectrum, with higher ratios indicating higher income levels and more people falling below that amount. The poverty level is not binary but falls along a spectrum, with resources and needs defined for family units. Household surveys are used to identify family relationships, with limitations on which populations can be measured. The CPS ASEC includes households and some noninstitutional group quarters, but excludes institutional group quarters like prisons and nursing homes. Persons who are homeless are only included in poverty estimates if they are living in shelters. In poverty estimates, group quarters like prisons and nursing homes are excluded, along with the incarcerated population and those in other institutions. College students in dormitories are only included if reported in an interview at their parents' home, while off-campus students are included. Military personnel are counted if living with at least one civilian adult. In the official poverty measure, related individuals by birth, marriage, or adoption are considered family. Foster children under 15 not legally adopted are excluded. Children under 15 in CPS ASEC are not asked about income unless tied to an older relative with known income. Unrelated individuals under 15, mostly foster children, are also excluded. The official definition of poverty considers unmarried domestic partners as separate family units, impacting how poverty status is calculated. It is crucial for data sources to provide family relationship information to match income with specific family units. The official poverty measure has evolved from flat amounts in the past but still faces criticism. The official poverty measure, used since 1964, has faced criticism for not adjusting for geographic cost variations, using pre-tax income as a resource measure, and not capturing all government relief programs for the poor. The official poverty measure does not capture all government relief programs for the poor, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and noncash benefits like SNAP and public housing subsidies. It also does not account for the needs and resources of unmarried partners, foster children, and changes in the prices of basic necessities. The official poverty measure does not accurately reflect the purchasing power needed to remain comparable with those at the poverty line in previous decades. There have been efforts to address these limitations by experts in various institutions, including the development of a Supplemental Poverty Measure in 2009 for research purposes only. The Supplemental Poverty Measure, developed in 2009 for research purposes, focused on aligning the definition of need with available resources. It was designed to be practical and periodically refined based on new data and research findings. Thresholds were defined by costs of basic necessities plus a bit extra to cover miscellaneous expenses. The Supplemental Poverty Measure, developed in 2009, aligns the definition of need with available resources. Thresholds for basic necessities are geographically adjusted using housing data from the American Community Survey. Equivalence scale factors adjust for family size. The Supplemental Poverty Measure aligns need with available resources by adjusting thresholds for basic necessities using housing data from the American Community Survey. The measure considers after-tax income, noncash benefits, work-related expenses, and government programs to help the poor meet their needs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure adjusts thresholds for basic necessities by considering after-tax income, noncash benefits, work-related expenses, and government programs to help the poor meet their needs. This includes subtracting medical out-of-pocket expenses from income to account for necessary costs that may not be optional. The Supplemental Poverty Measure adjusts thresholds for basic necessities by considering after-tax income, noncash benefits, work-related expenses, and government programs to help the poor meet their needs. The resource definition used in the Supplemental Poverty Measure aligns with the measure of need specified in the thresholds. Census Bureau produces reports using income data from CPS ASEC and poverty thresholds from BLS, resulting in a poverty rate approximately 0.6 percentage points higher than the official rate in 2015. The profile of the population in poverty differs between the supplemental and official measures. The official poverty measure was established through Circular A-46 in 1969 and reaffirmed as official by OMB in 1978. Federal agencies were directed to use this measure for statistical purposes, while allowing for the development of other poverty measures as long as they were distinct from the official series. The official poverty measure was established in 1969 and reaffirmed in 1978. Federal agencies use this measure for statistical purposes. Legislation requiring a count of people in poverty uses the official measure for formula grants, even if not explicitly named. Examples include CHIP and Title I-A funding for school districts. The Supplemental Poverty Measure was developed after years of research. The Supplemental Poverty Measure was developed after decades of research, with OMB overseeing the methodology recommendation. The Census Bureau releases poverty data annually in September from the CPS ASEC survey, which is also used by BLS to report the monthly unemployment rate. Additional questions are asked at the end of the labor force survey each month to gather more information without the need for a separate survey. The CPS ASEC survey, conducted annually in March, includes extra questions on income sources, health insurance coverage, and noncash benefits. Professional interviewers use computerized questionnaires for greater accuracy, but this method increases costs and limits sample size for state-level estimates. The CPS ASEC survey provides detailed national poverty estimates annually, based on income data from the previous year. This data collection frequency allows for more frequent updates compared to the decennial census. The CPS is the only nationally representative source with sufficient detail on income and family characteristics for accurate poverty measurement. Mollie Orshansky's approach to poverty measurement, based on family income and empirical need, became the official method. The CPS ASEC survey provides national poverty data but has limitations in producing accurate estimates for small geographic areas. Other datasets have been used since the 1960s for computing poverty status in smaller regions. The decennial census poverty data, collected through the long form questionnaire, provided detailed poverty information for small areas like school districts and census tracts. Despite some differences in data collection methods, poverty thresholds, and income definitions, the decennial census and CPS used the same overall poverty definition. However, decennial census poverty data was only available every 10 years up to Census 2010 when the long form was discontinued. The American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form census in 2010, collecting similar information but on a monthly basis. It provides detailed poverty estimates annually using one-year and five-year data. The ACS has a larger sample size and covers a wide range of topics compared to the Current Population Survey (CPS). The American Community Survey (ACS) provides detailed poverty estimates annually using one-year and five-year data, covering a wide array of topics. Respondents are asked to provide each person's relationship to the householder in the ACS, which may affect poverty status calculations. Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) uses Census Bureau thresholds for poverty measures in formula grants for local education agencies. The SAIPE program, initiated in the 1990s, provides poverty estimates for counties and school districts between decennial census data releases. The data are model-based, combining administrative and survey data for more precise estimates for small areas. Initially using CPS data, SAIPE now incorporates ACS estimates since 2005. Since 2005, ACS data has been used in the SAIPE model along with IRS tax returns, SNAP data, and Census Bureau population estimates. SAIPE provides more accurate current economic conditions at the local level compared to ACS five-year estimates. SAIPE focuses on poverty rates, median income, and total population counts, while SAHIE also offers model-based estimates for small areas. The SAHIE data provides model-based estimates for small areas targeting the low-income uninsured population. It breaks down estimates by income-to-poverty ratio, uninsured status, sex, age group, and selected racial and Hispanic origin groups. SAHIE data is used to estimate the target population for the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program and to monitor take-up rates. It has also been utilized to estimate the eligible population for assistance under the Affordable Care Act in certain states. The SAHIE data provides model-based estimates for low-income uninsured populations, including those eligible for assistance under the Affordable Care Act in certain states. It breaks down estimates by income level, uninsured status, demographics, and is used to monitor take-up rates for programs. The data sources are snapshots of the poverty population in a given year and are not well-suited to measure changes in individual poverty status over time or other social and economic conditions. Longitudinal poverty data from the SIPP since 1984 follow the same respondents over time to identify characteristics of short-term and long-term poverty populations, entry and exit rates, and average duration in poverty. Longitudinal data were crucial to measure the effects of welfare reform under the PRWORA. The SPD was created to track respondents before and after welfare reform. The SPD was created to track respondents before and after welfare reform. Interest in poverty dynamics and program participation continues through funding in the Health and Human Services budget. Poverty guidelines are computed annually by the Department of Health and Human Services, different from Census Bureau's poverty thresholds. The poverty guidelines, referenced in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, are used for administrative purposes to determine eligibility for programmatic assistance. Different programs use multiples of the poverty guidelines to establish eligibility criteria, such as the National School Lunch Program. These guidelines are not used to measure the poverty population. The official poverty measure discussed in this report is based on poverty thresholds issued by the Census Bureau for statistical purposes. These thresholds were originally calculated based on dietary needs and spending patterns of families in economic distress. The term \"federal poverty level\" is ambiguous and can refer to either the poverty guidelines or thresholds, depending on the context. The HHS poverty guidelines were developed to simplify the process of determining poverty levels based on family size, rather than reflecting actual family needs. The guidelines were based on earlier OEO dollar amounts, which were averages of poverty thresholds. The HHS poverty guidelines, based on OEO dollar amounts, are computed using weighted averages and rounding to the nearest $20 for each family size increment. Published annually in late January or early February, they aim to simplify determining poverty levels based on family size. The HHS poverty guidelines are computed using weighted averages and rounding to the nearest $20 for each family size increment. Published annually in late January or early February, they are inflated forward to the current year using the Consumer Price Index. This allows program administrators to use the guidelines sooner than the Census Bureau's survey estimates. Table 3 provides the 2017 poverty guidelines."
