    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small Community Visioning Improvement Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of small communities in the nation's fabric, recognizing their economic, social, agricultural, historic, and cultural significance. Many small communities are facing challenges like economic hardship, declining population, and environmental pressures, threatening their long-term viability. Revitalization efforts should involve residents articulating their vision for the future and developing action plans in areas like economic development, agriculture, tourism, and transportation. Landscape architects play a crucial role in community visioning efforts by utilizing their expertise in various areas such as land use planning, design, and environmental analysis. Expanding Federal support for small community visioning is seen as an investment in the future of these communities. Expanding Federal support for small community visioning is an investment in the future of communities, leveraging public and private sector participation. Successful visioning efforts have led to tangible results in transportation, economic development, land use policies, conservation, master plans, and recreation. The Community Visioning Pilot Initiative is introduced in Section 3. The section aims to develop innovative visions for small communities, promote coordination between communities, universities, and design professionals, encourage public-private partnerships, and translate community visions into design projects. It defines a small community as having a population less than 25,000 individuals. The term \"design professional\" refers to a landscape architect with skills in community involvement, land use planning, design, environmental analysis, and more. An \"eligible grant recipient\" can be a small community or a land grant university. The Secretary of Agriculture shall make grants to eligible recipients for small community visioning processes, with construction documents being technical plans necessary for design completion. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for grant authority. Small community visioning processes are required for grants under this section, involving public participation and needs determination. The community engages in discussions to articulate their vision for addressing needs in areas such as economic development, transportation, land use, agriculture, and community values. Design professionals help translate the vision into images and design concepts until community consensus is reached. Implementation planning involves design professionals, the public, and others developing a plan outlining specific steps for achieving the community's vision. This plan includes identifying projects that can be completed with existing resources and those requiring additional resources, as well as relevant government agencies and non-governmental organizations. The Secretary will solicit grant applications for small community visioning processes, including needs statements and descriptions of the process. The small community will involve a diverse group of residents in determining the need and visioning process. They will utilize design professionals or university programs with expertise in visioning processes. The visioning process will have multiple phases with anticipated outcomes outlined. The applicant must provide a detailed budget for the visioning process, including their contribution and steps to assess effectiveness and integrate findings into ongoing efforts. The Secretary may establish an alternative application process for eligible grant recipients to apply for funding. Eligible grant recipients can apply for funding to facilitate small community visioning processes in multiple communities without separate applications. The alternative application must include a description of the applicant's capabilities and the role of a landscape architecture program if applicable. The applicant must provide a detailed description of how they will utilize design professionals and university programs with expertise in small community visioning processes, including the phases and outcomes of the process, a projection of the number of communities they can assist with the grant amount requested, and a proposed schedule. Additionally, a detailed budget for the activities must be included. The applicant must provide a detailed budget for the activities to be carried out with the grant, as well as a description of the steps they will take to assess the effectiveness of the visioning process and support community-based efforts to implement the vision. Grant award considerations include the value of grants to communities of various sizes, geographic distribution, and giving priority to applicants with well-defined plans. Grant amounts under this section range from $25,000 to $250,000 based on the application type. Administrative expenses are capped at 10% of the total amount appropriated, with recipients allowed to use up to 25% for administration. Grants cannot be used for developing construction documents. The grantee must contribute 20% of total costs from non-Federal sources to receive a grant. In-kind contributions can be used to meet this requirement, and the Secretary can waive it if the recipient is unable to meet it. Regulations must be established within 180 days of enactment. Within 180 days of enactment, the Secretary will issue regulations for this section. Within 3 years, a report must be submitted to Congress detailing effective practices, public-private partnerships, and tangible outcomes of small community visioning processes. Authorization of Appropriations: Grants under this section can receive up to $5,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. At least 40% of the funds each year are reserved for grants assisting multiple small communities. Funds for this section can remain available until expended."
