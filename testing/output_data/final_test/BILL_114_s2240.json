    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Land Invasive Species Control, Prevention, and Management Act\" aims to effectively manage Federal land, including National Monuments and National Heritage Areas, to protect important natural resources from invasive species such as soil, vegetation, archeological sites, water resources, and rare habitats. The Act defines key terms such as \"control\" as eradication, suppression, or reduction of invasive species, \"ecosystem\" as a community of organisms and their environment, \"eligible State\" as including states, territories, and the District of Columbia, and \"invasive species\" as alien species introduced into an area. The term \"alien species\" refers to non-native species that can cause economic, environmental, or human health harm. This includes any species not native to a specific ecosystem, as determined by relevant authorities. The terms \"manage\" and \"management\" for invasive species involve actively reducing spread and preventing further infestations or harm. \"Prevent\" means hindering the introduction of invasive species onto land or water. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, responsible for Federal land administered through various agencies. The term \"species\" refers to a group of organisms with physical and genetic similarities, interbreeding among themselves, and showing differences from allied groups. Federal efforts to control and manage invasive species on federal land. Each Secretary concerned must plan and implement activities to control and manage invasive species on land managed by them, aiming to reduce populations and support restoration efforts. They are required to develop a strategic plan to achieve a 5% annual net reduction of invasive species populations, in coordination with affected states. The Secretary concerned must develop a strategic plan in collaboration with eligible States, political subdivisions, and federally recognized Indian tribes to address invasive species. Factors such as economic and ecological costs must be considered in the plan. SEC. 5. PROGRAM FUNDING ALLOCATIONS. The Secretary concerned must allocate at least 75 percent of the funds for invasive species management programs for on-the-ground control and management, including purchasing necessary products and equipment, using pest management options, biological control agents, and revegetation methods to improve ecosystems. The Secretary may allocate funds for invasive species management programs to improve ecosystems through various control methods, outreach, and public awareness efforts. Administrative costs should not exceed 10 percent of the total funds allocated. The Secretary must report on the use of funds for invasive species management programs, detailing expenditures and percentages for different purposes. SEC. 6. PRUDENT USE OF FUNDS. The Secretary prioritizes cost-effective methods for controlling invasive species, based on scientific data. A comparative economic assessment is required for compliance. Certain projects are categorically excluded from environmental assessment requirements. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires projects in high-risk areas to comply with agency procedures and land management plans within 1,000 feet of the treatment site. Projects located within 1,000 feet of various important infrastructure such as ports of entry, water projects, schools, and recreational sites must comply with agency procedures and land management plans. The Act allows the Secretary to pursue activities related to invasive species control, prevention, and management without precluding other authorities. It also specifies that the Act does not authorize the suspension of water supply systems to control invasive species. SEC. 7. USE OF PARTNERSHIPS. The Secretary may enter into contracts or agreements with other entities to assist in managing invasive species. These agreements require a memorandum of understanding outlining the partnership and activities involved. The Secretary can enter contracts or agreements with entities to manage invasive species, requiring a memorandum of understanding detailing control activities. This includes a prioritized list of invasive species, assessment of infested areas, expected post-management infestation, and descriptions of pest management options with cost assessments. The memorandum of understanding for managing invasive species includes details on control activities, coordination efforts, and compliance with the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974. Public outreach and awareness efforts are included in contracts or cooperative agreements for managing invasive species. The goals and objectives for these efforts aim to inform national, regional, State, or local audiences about invasive species control and management. Investigations under these agreements focus on developing solutions and recommendations for controlling and managing invasive species. The curr_chunk focuses on faster implementation of control and management methods for invasive species. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for coordination with affected local governments for projects under this Act, in line with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976."
