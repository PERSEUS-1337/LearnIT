It also amends the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980. The \"Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2011\" defines key terms such as \"appropriate Congressional committees,\" \"Department\" (referring to the Department of Energy), and \"rare earth materials\" including specific chemical elements. The \"Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2011\" defines key terms and specific rare earth elements like Europium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, and Lutetium. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 101. RARE EARTH MATERIALS PROGRAM. Established in the Department is a program for research, development, and application to ensure a secure supply of rare earth materials for national security and economic needs. The program includes activities to characterize stocks, explore and recover materials, and improve extraction and recycling methods. The program aims to enhance the use, recovery, and recycling of rare earth materials, improve understanding of their performance in engineering designs, identify alternative materials for specific applications, engineer applications using recycled or alternative materials, and collect and disseminate information on rare earth materials. The Secretary aims to support improved processes and technologies in the rare earth materials industry, encourage multidisciplinary collaborations, and provide opportunities for students at institutions of higher education. The program for rare earth materials industry support includes collaboration with foreign agencies and submission of a biennial plan to Congress within 180 days of enactment. The plan for the rare earth materials program must be submitted to Congress, detailing research activities, contributions to innovative technologies, evaluation criteria for loan guarantees, and the status of projects receiving support. The Secretary must consult with various industry representatives, academic institutions, national laboratories, and other entities when preparing the rare earth materials program plan. This includes details on research activities, technology contributions, loan guarantee evaluation criteria, project status, and actions taken based on assessments or recommendations. After 4 years of operation, the Secretary will contract the National Academy of Sciences to assess the rare earth materials program. The assessment will recommend either continuing the program with improvements or terminating it with lessons learned. The assessment will be shared with Congress and the public. SEC. 1706 introduces a temporary program for rare earth materials revitalization under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Secretary is authorized to make guarantees for new technologies in rare earth materials separation, preparation, and application for national security and industrial purposes. The Secretary aims to expedite loan guarantee approvals for rare earth materials applications, cooperate with private sector for US production capability within 5 years of the Act, and support the domestic supply chain. The Secretary may not award a guarantee for a project unless it supports the production of rare earth materials in the United States for domestic customers. The authority to enter into guarantees under this section will expire on September 30, 2016. Title II of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 includes a temporary program for rare earth materials revitalization under Section 1706. Additionally, Section 201 outlines amendments to the Act. Title II of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended by the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2011. This includes changes to the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology, and the removal of certain paragraphs in subsection (c). The National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended by the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2011. Changes include redesignating paragraphs, amending assessments of material supply for national security, and revising policy and implementation sections of the Act. The National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended by the Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2011. Section 4 of the Act is modified to streamline implementation by specifying the policies for departments and agencies to follow. The National Critical Materials Act of 1984, also known as Title II of Public Law 98-373, is repealed."
