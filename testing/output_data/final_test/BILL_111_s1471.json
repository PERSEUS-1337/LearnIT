    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Providing the Utmost Safety Measures to the Permanent Protection System in New Orleans, Louisiana\" or the \"PUMPPS NOLA Act of 2009\". Congress finds that section 4303 of the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 requires the Secretary to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of operating new pumping stations in New Orleans concurrently or in series with existing stations serving the canals. Prior to the required analysis, engineering concept studies were performed for the removal and configuration of new pumping stations, as well as the replacement or improvement of floodwalls and levees adjacent to each canal in New Orleans. The Secretary conducted engineering concept studies to protect against storm surges and evacuate storm water. A collaborative process was established with technical review meetings. The process was expanded with external stakeholders including the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans to evaluate technical advantages and disadvantages after Hurricane Katrina. The Secretary conducted engineering concept studies with various stakeholders, including the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans, to evaluate technical advantages and disadvantages. Reports provide background data for expedited analysis, with \"Option 2\" identified as more technically advantageous. Option 2 is considered more technically advantageous and operationally effective than Option 1, with greater reliability and reduced risk of flooding. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"project\" in this Act refers to the project for permanent pumps and canal modifications authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1965 and modified by the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense. The term \"report\" refers to specific reports mentioned in various legislative acts, including the Appropriations Act for Defense, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, and the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008. The term \"report\" refers to a specific report prepared by the Secretary of the Army, dated September 26, 2008, and revised in December 2008. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, and the term \"State\" refers to the State of Louisiana. SEC. 4. PROJECT MODIFICATION. The project is modified to construct pump stations and diversions to reduce storm water flow into canals, deepen and widen canals, and line them for gravity flow to lakefront pump stations. The project aims to construct pump stations at the lakefront and modify bridges near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue canals. Additionally, there are plans to remove existing levees and floodwalls, decommission interior pump stations, and maintain water surface differentials until a fully functional system is in place. The project aims to construct pump stations at the lakefront and modify bridges near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue canals. Plans also include removing existing levees and floodwalls, decommissioning interior pump stations, and maintaining water surface differentials until a fully functional system is in place. Additionally, there is a proposal to lower canal water surface elevation and decommission interim control structures at each canal. The implementation requirements for the project include constructing pump stations at the lakefront, modifying bridges near the 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue canals, removing existing levees and floodwalls, decommissioning interior pump stations, and maintaining water surface differentials until a fully functional system is in place. Additionally, there is a proposal to lower canal water surface elevation and decommission interim control structures at each canal. The Secretary will carry out investigations, design, and construction sequencing in line with \"Option 2\" and \"Option 2a\" as described in the report. Funding will be used to modify drainage canals and install pumps and closure structures near the lakefront. The Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006 and the Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies Act of 2008 require the State to cover 100% of costs for project maintenance and operation. The State is responsible for covering 100% of costs for project maintenance and operation. The United States is to be held harmless from any claims or damages related to the project, except for negligence by the Federal Government or its contractors."
