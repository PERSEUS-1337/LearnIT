    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Low-Level Radioactive Waste Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to low-level radioactive waste. Congress finds that the Secretary of Energy must dispose of all greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste, the Offsite Source Recovery Program is ending soon, and there are about 14,000 sealed sources of waste to be disposed of by September 30, 2010. The Department of Energy lacks resources and a permanent disposal facility for greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste. A permanent disposal facility is unlikely to be operational before the Offsite Source Recovery Program ends. The development of a disposal facility for greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste will take several years and dedicated funding. Congress must review disposal alternatives before a final decision is made. The Secretary of Energy will designate an entity within the Department of Energy to develop a facility for disposing of greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste. Consultation with Congress is required for the plan and reports on the disposal facility. The Secretary of Energy will update a report on radioactive waste disposal options, including identification of waste sources, disposal options, safety measures, cost estimates, and waste disposal assurance methods. The Secretary of Energy will provide a report on radioactive waste disposal, including identifying waste sources, disposal options, cost estimates, regulatory requirements, and coordination with relevant agencies like the EPA and NRC. The Secretary of Energy will submit a report to Congress estimating the cost and schedule for completing an environmental impact statement and decision for a permanent disposal facility for greater-than-Class C radioactive waste. Before making a final disposal decision, the Secretary must describe all alternatives under consideration to Congress and await their action. Additionally, by December 31, 2003, a plan for the recovery and storage of greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste must be submitted to Congress. The plan for the recovery and storage of greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste includes estimated cost, resource, and facility needs until a permanent disposal facility is available."
