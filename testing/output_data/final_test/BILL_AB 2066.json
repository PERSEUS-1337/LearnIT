    "title": "AB 2066",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Every service station in California must provide water, compressed air, and a gauge for measuring air pressure to customers who purchase fuel, at no cost. This is applicable to passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles with an unladen weight of 6,000 pounds or less. Every service station in California must provide free air and water for automotive purposes to customers who purchase fuel. Stations near highways must also offer free public restrooms during business hours. The public restroom at service stations in California must be permanent and include separate facilities for men and women, with toilets and sinks suitable for disabled persons. In rural areas with low traffic, a single restroom for both genders may be sufficient unless determined otherwise by local authorities based on traffic studies and tourist patterns. The single restroom exemption does not apply in certain events. It must include a toilet, urinal, and sink suitable for disabled persons as per ADA and California regulations. The restroom should have a locking mechanism, be user-operated, and maintained in a clean manner. Every service station in California must display a sign showing state and federal fuel taxes per gallon of motor vehicle fuel sold. This requirement does not apply to service stations operational before January 1, 1990, that would be required to build permanent restroom facilities. The sign at every service station in California must display the average per-gallon cost of gasoline and diesel fuel, as calculated annually by the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission in consultation with the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office. The Division of Measurement Standards of the Department of Food and Agriculture must establish a toll-free customer complaint telephone number by January 1, 2001, which should be printed on the sign required at service stations. Employees of the Division of Measurement Standards can investigate complaints against service stations for lack of free air and water. They can issue citations and collect fines of $250 per valid complaint, unless the citation is challenged in court. No citation will be issued if the equipment is in good working order upon inspection or repaired within 10 days. Additionally, citations will not be issued if the station can prove repeated vandalism of the equipment with three or more police reports within six months. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, as defined by the Government Code and California Constitution."
