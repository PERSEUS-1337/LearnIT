    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Critical Care Assessment and Improvement Act of 2013\". Congress finds that critical care medicine involves caring for patients with life-threatening conditions in specialized ICUs, with approximately five million Americans admitted to ICUs each year. This specialized care is complex and costly, consuming over 17 percent of hospital costs. According to recent studies, cancer care receives significantly more research funding than critical care, despite both placing similar economic burdens on society. The demand for critical care services in the United States is increasing due to the growing elderly population, who consume a large percentage of these services. This trend is expected to worsen an existing shortage of critical care resources. The growing elderly population in the United States is increasing the demand for critical care services, exacerbating an existing shortage of intensivists. Intensivist-led teams treat only one-third of critically ill patients, despite evidence showing improved outcomes. Strengthening the critical care medical delivery infrastructure is crucial for enhancing healthcare quality. The purpose of this Act is to assess and improve the critical care medical delivery system in the United States. SEC. 3. STUDIES ON CRITICAL CARE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will collaborate with the Institute of Medicine to analyze critical care health services in the U.S., develop recommendations to enhance capabilities, and submit a report to Congress within a year of the enactment of the Act. Analysis of the current critical care system in the United States, including capacity, resources, workforce size, health information technology, and medical equipment. Evaluation of strengths, limitations, and future challenges. Assessment of the system's ability to provide care during national health emergencies. Recommendations on regionalizing critical care systems and status analysis of critical care. The Health Resources and Services Administration will update a study on the critical care workforce in the United States, expanding to include various providers like nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists in intensive care units. Intensive care unit pharmacists and respiratory care practitioners are part of the critical care workforce in the United States. The NIH Critical Care Coordinating Council is established. The Critical Care Coordinating Council is established by the Secretary through the National Institutes of Health. Membership includes representatives from various institutes. The Council's duties are outlined. The Critical Care Coordinating Council, established by the Secretary through the National Institutes of Health, serves as a focal point for advancing research and training in critical care. Its duties include coordinating funding opportunities, developing new funding opportunities, informing investigators about funding, representing NIH in national efforts to improve critical care, and analyzing current research to identify gaps. The Critical Care Coordinating Council, established by the Secretary through the National Institutes of Health, provides an annual report to the Director on research efforts related to critically ill and injured patients. It also makes recommendations on strengthening partnerships within NIH and with public and private entities for collaborative research. SEC. 5. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Critical Care Demonstration Project. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration project to improve care for critically ill patients in intensive care units, focusing on coordination, transitions of care, and value-based purchasing methodologies. The Secretary's demonstration project aims to enhance critical care by incorporating value-based purchasing, informatics, and prediction models to improve outcomes and reduce waste. Additionally, bundled payment approaches and care redesign efforts will be utilized to streamline care delivery for high-risk patients."
