    "content": "The \"Careers Act\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. The Act includes findings related to career development. The \"Careers Act\" states that career guidance and counseling programs are essential for developing individuals' competencies and helping them succeed in a 21st-century society. It also highlights the recommendation for a student-to-counselor ratio and the role of school counselors in designing comprehensive programs for students' academic, career, and personal goals. Students at schools with highly integrated academic and career programs have higher achievement in reading, math, and science compared to schools with less integrated programs. The Career Counseling Program is authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, aimed at providing career guidance to students. The Career Counseling Program, authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, defines key terms such as 'career counselor' and 'comprehensive career counseling program' which provide students access to information on career planning, options, financial aid, and postsecondary opportunities. An educational development plan is an individualized plan for students to promote career awareness and exploration, identify career and technical programs of study, career pathways, and training services. It is implemented in schools by career counselors. The curr_chunk discusses training services leading to a recognized postsecondary credential and registered apprenticeship programs under the National Apprenticeship Act. The curr_chunk introduces a career counseling program under SEC. 2252. The Secretary will award grants to State educational agencies to address the shortage of career counselors and expand effective career counseling programs by awarding subgrants. States must submit an application detailing how they will support local educational agencies with high student-to-counselor ratios and provide professional development for all career counselors. The State must outline strategies to increase high-quality career counselors, provide technical assistance to local educational agencies, disseminate labor market trends, and assist in developing comprehensive career counseling programs. The Secretary will give special consideration to State educational agencies with high student-to-counselor ratios when awarding grants for career counseling programs. The Federal share of the grant will be 80%, with a 20% non-Federal share that can be provided in cash or in-kind. States receiving the grant can use up to 10% of the total amount for supporting activities related to the grant. The State's proposed activities for the grant must be approved by the Secretary. Up to 3% of the total amount can be used for administrative costs, while at least 87% must be used for the subgrant program. \"SEC. 2253. CAREER COUNSELING SUBGRANTS.\" \"Each State receiving a grant under this subpart shall award subgrants to local educational agencies for improving career counseling programs. Local educational agencies must submit an application describing a comprehensive career counseling program for grades 6 through 12.\" Local educational agencies must develop an educational development plan for students starting in grade 7, which is regularly reviewed and updated until graduation or leaving the school. The plan must be developed in consultation with at least two types of stakeholders, including institutions of higher education or postsecondary vocational institutions. The Education Act of 1965 requires local educational agencies to develop an educational development plan for students in consultation with various stakeholders, including apprenticeship programs, local boards, nonprofit organizations, tribal organizations, labor organizations, and trade associations. If the student-to-counselor ratio is higher than the national average, the plan should include activities to address this issue. The local educational agency must provide a description of activities to reduce the student-to-counselor ratio, promote student engagement with apprenticeship programs and work-based learning experiences, disseminate career and labor market information to parents and students, and ensure awareness of in-school career development activities. The local educational agency must engage parents in developing educational plans for students and implement strategies to incorporate career counseling into the curriculum for various student populations. Subgrant funds must be used for specified purposes. Subgrant funds under this section are to be used for developing and implementing a comprehensive career counseling program proposed by the local educational agency. Funds may also be used for purchasing software, online platforms, and training school personnel to provide students with current workforce information. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under this subpart must submit an annual progress report to the Secretary. The funds allocated under this subpart are meant to supplement, not replace, other available amounts for supported activities. An authorization of $15,000,000 is provided for fiscal year 2019 and the following 4 years."
