Congress passed four supplemental appropriations acts to provide funding, leading to the creation of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) by the USDA, offering $19 billion in relief to farmers and ranchers. Additional financial assistance may be provided later in the summer. The USDA has taken actions in response to the COVID-19 emergency, including the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) funded with $19 billion. Congress is considering additional support, with a $14 billion replenishment payment for the Commodity Credit Corporation later in the summer. The report outlines the economic harm to the U.S. agricultural sector and how USDA plans to use emergency funds to address it. The USDA has allocated $19 billion for the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to address the economic impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. agricultural sector. The report discusses CFAP producer payments, USDA's food purchase and distribution efforts, and stakeholders' positions on the pandemic's effects on their industries. It also highlights potential issues for Congress to consider in a post-COVID economy. An appendix provides estimates of economic damage to major agricultural sectors due to the pandemic. The COVID-19 emergency has impacted the U.S. food supply chain, causing disruptions in domestic and international supply chains. While there is no food shortage in the United States, bottlenecks in the supply chain have led to unmarketable surpluses for farmers and temporary shortages in retail outlets. Retail outlets experienced temporary shortages of various food and agricultural products during the early weeks of the COVID-19 shutdown in March and April. This was due to a surge in consumer stockpiling, including panic buying and hoarding, as consumers feared being locked down for an extended period. The shortages were temporary as existing supplies eventually restocked grocery store shelves. The primary factors contributing to the shortages were the sudden shift in consumer food consumption from restaurants to home and disruptions in the food supply chain. The COVID-19 shutdown led to a sudden shift in consumer food consumption from restaurants to home, causing temporary shortages in retail outlets. The food supply chain had to adapt by redirecting products to grocery stores, transforming them into consumer-ready forms, and re-engineering delivery routes. This adjustment may be temporary until the pandemic eases. The COVID-19 shutdown caused temporary shortages in retail outlets as consumer food consumption shifted from restaurants to home. The food supply chain had to adapt by redirecting products to grocery stores and re-engineering delivery routes. Shortages due to consumer stockpiling create bulges in the supply chain that may take weeks or months to eliminate. U.S. and global supplies of major agricultural commodities are in a state of relative abundance, keeping market prices low for the past five years. The ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China disrupted traditional trade patterns, leading to lower trade levels and surplus supply of major agricultural commodities globally. The Food and Agriculture Organization reports that stocks for many commodities are at or near 20-year highs, with the United States also experiencing abundant supplies of grain, oilseed crops, meat, dairy, and other products. USDA reports abundant supplies of meat, dairy, fruit, vegetable, and tree nut products in cold storage. Hog and poultry populations in the U.S. are historically large, while cattle population has rebounded. U.S. farmers intend to increase corn and soybean planted acres. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue assures no food shortage, citing a mismatch in the supply chain due to shifting demand. The food supply chain, including agriculture production, transportation, processing, and distribution, is at risk of breaking down due to various factors such as labor shortages and limited resources like trucks and shipping containers. Labor shortages at any point along the supply chain can lead to disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply chain disruptions in the food distribution network due to shutdowns of non-essential businesses and uncertainty about labor availability. Labor shortages and limited warehousing space contribute to bottlenecks and regional shortages. The closure of institutional purchasers in the food services sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a redirection of food products towards retail outlets for at-home consumption. This required processing and repackaging by food packagers and processors, resulting in oversupply and sharp declines in commodity prices. The COVID-19 pandemic caused oversupply of perishable products like fruit, vegetables, milk, and livestock due to disruptions in the food supply chain. This led to producers dumping milk, burying onions, and euthanizing hogs and poultry. The surplus worsened in mid-April when meat packing plants closed due to infections among workers. The COVID-19 pandemic caused plant closures in food processing facilities, leading to animal surpluses on farms and concerns about food supply reliability. Agriculture is deemed critical by the government, but labor shortages in the supply chain can result in temporary food shortages. Severe labor shortages could escalate to multi-state or national food shortages, especially in labor-intensive fruit and vegetable production and food processing plants. The COVID-19 pandemic caused plant closures in food processing facilities, leading to concerns about food supply reliability. A large labor force is needed for supply chain activities in food processing plants, including meat packing plants and fruit and vegetable distribution networks. Workers in these facilities are at high risk of infection due to crowded conditions and lack of healthcare or paid sick leave. The food supply chain faces challenges due to COVID-19, with labor-intensive tasks like federal safety inspection and retail labor experiencing increased stress. Grocery stores are implementing preventative measures to protect staff and customers, slowing down the supply chain's throughput rate and leading to empty or partially filled shelves. In mid-April, a surge in infections among meat processing plant workers further impacted the food supply chain. The surge in infections among workers in meat processing plants led to plant closures and unexpected surpluses of livestock. By May 1, over 20 meatpacking and 5 food processing plants had closed, affecting retail supplies. The CDC reported cases of COVID-19 among workers in processing plants, impacting prices for producers. The closure of meat processing plants due to COVID-19 led to a reduction in supply, affecting cash and futures prices for producers. USDA reported a widening price gap between farm and wholesale prices for beef. Tyson's pork processing plant closure in Iowa caused 15% of U.S. pork processing capacity to be offline. Plants still open were operating at reduced production levels due to employee absenteeism. U.S. pork processing plants normally handled 2.5 million hogs per week, but slower line speeds impacted production. President Trump signed an executive order under the Defense Production Act to ensure meat and poultry processors continue operations. Issues with reopening closed plants include the availability of personal protective equipment for workers and liability concerns. USDA will work with meat processors to ensure safe operation of packing plants, following CDC and OSHA guidelines for worker safety. Secretary Perdue stated that Trump's executive order to open plants does not remove legal liability, but adherence to CDC guidelines can provide a defense against lawsuits. Prices for agricultural commodities have dropped since mid-February. Prices for major agricultural commodities have plummeted since mid-February, led by a sharp decline in crude oil prices. This has affected the livestock sector significantly, with lean hogs down by 53.2%, live cattle by 25.1%, and milk by 20.6%. The cotton and textile industries have also been negatively impacted due to the shutdown of retail businesses and a drop in demand for clothing and apparel. The economic closure led to a collapse in demand for clothing and apparel, affecting manufacturers, cotton mills, and cotton contracts. U.S. cotton prices dropped by over 25% between January 2 and April 15. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service reduced its forecast for global cotton consumption for 2020 by 6.4% due to expected declines in global GDP. The decline in crude oil prices, reduced travel, and slowing economic activity also contributed to lower agricultural prices. The economic downturn caused a drop in demand for clothing and apparel, impacting cotton prices. U.S. cotton prices fell by over 25% from January 2 to April 15. The decline in crude oil prices and reduced travel also led to lower agricultural prices. Additionally, ethanol prices decreased by nearly 33% during the same period, with many biofuel plants idled and production volumes reduced. Corn prices, as well as prices of other feed grains and oilseeds, are closely linked to ethanol prices. The COVID-induced disruption of agricultural demand, slowing global economic activity, and lower oil prices have led to a significant decrease in commodity prices in international markets since the beginning of 2020. Trade disruptions in major food items like rice and wheat have also occurred due to protectionist policies in key producer countries. Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in agricultural demand and global economic activity, leading to a decrease in commodity prices. Major food items like rice and wheat have faced trade disruptions due to protectionist policies in key producer countries. The United States, China, the European Union, and other WTO members have pledged to refrain from imposing restrictions on food exports, which has supported rice and wheat prices in international markets. U.S. policymakers and business interests are concerned about the economic impact of the pandemic, but it is still too early to determine the full extent on the U.S. economy and agricultural sector. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy and agricultural sector are uncertain. The shape of the economic recovery is unknown, whether it will be V-shaped, L-shaped, or W-shaped. Projections suggest a significant contraction in U.S. GDP, with a 4.8% decrease reported in the first quarter of 2020. Many financial institutions have issued dire predictions on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, JP Morgan forecasted a 25% decline in 2nd quarter U.S. GDP, while the IMF projected a 5% decline in U.S. GDP for 2020. Global GDP is also expected to decline by 3%, with major economies like the Euro-zone and Japan seeing significant decreases as well. The Congressional Budget Office released an update on the U.S. economic outlook, projecting a sharp downturn due to the pandemic. The CBO projected a sharp contraction in the U.S. economy in the 2nd quarter of 2020, with a 12% decline in GDP. They also forecasted a 2.8% increase in real GDP in 2021. The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to average 11.4% for 2020 and 10.1% for 2021, with over 33 million American workers filing for unemployment benefits between March and May. This indicates that over 20% of the U.S. labor force is affected by layoffs, furloughs, or reduced hours due to the pandemic. The economic forecasts for 2020 predict high unemployment and significant declines in consumer incomes, impacting the rural off-farm economy. Industry groups in the U.S. agricultural sector have estimated economic damage for producers and ranchers, with the livestock sector being hit the hardest. Hog and cattle prices have dropped significantly, leading to sectoral losses estimated at $13.6 billion to $14.6 billion. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the agricultural sector has been significant, with estimated losses of $13.6 billion to $14.6 billion for the cattle/beef sector, $5 billion for the hog sector, and over $8 billion for the dairy sector. Other major commodity sector losses include corn, soybeans, cotton, and sheep/wool. The ethanol sector has also been affected, with nearly 46% of production capacity offline and a 33% decrease in ethanol prices. The decline in corn prices is driven by the near collapse of the U.S. ethanol sector, which consumes 38% of annual U.S. corn production. The USDA's farm economic outlook for 2020 did not consider the impact of COVID-19, with the next projections expected in September. FAPRI released a preliminary assessment in April, projecting a V-shaped recession with market recovery driven by GDP and commodity price declines. Supply chain disruptions are also a factor. FAPRI projects substantial price declines for major grain, oilseed, and livestock commodities in 2019/20 and 2020/21, leading to large declines in farm revenue. This includes -$11.9 billion in crop and -$20.2 billion in livestock cash receipts. The revenue decreases are partially offset by declines in production expenses and an increase in farm program payments under the ARC and PLC programs. However, the overall result is a significant decline in U.S. net farm income of -$20 billion for 2020. The U.S. net farm income for 2020 is projected to be -$20 billion, a significant decrease from 2019. The impact of COVID-19 on the agricultural sector is expected to vary across commodity sectors and regions, with potential effects on farm households' economic situations. The economic impact of COVID-19 in 2021 is uncertain. The economic impact of COVID-19 in 2021 is uncertain, with potential effects on asset valuations, bankruptcies, commodity price declines, and farm household income. The sharp drop in commodity prices is expected to result in reduced farm household revenue. The drop in commodity prices due to COVID-19 is expected to decrease farm household revenue. Government payments, crop insurance, and reduced input expenses may partially offset the losses, but overall farm revenue is predicted to decline compared to 2019. This could lead to financial stress for farms with high debt levels. The USDA's emergency-response payment program aims to help alleviate the revenue decline for a wider range of farm households. Farm revenues are expected to decrease due to the impact of COVID-19 on off-farm income. This has led to diminished cash flows for farm households from both on-farm and off-farm effects. The rural economy is also suffering from a decline in tax revenues, hindering the ability of governments to respond to the crisis. Federal funding has been allocated to assist the agricultural sector, with USDA programs being initiated to provide support. USDA has increased flexibilities and extensions in farm programs to support the food supply chain amid COVID-19. Congress passed four supplemental appropriations acts in response to the pandemic. The CARES Act, along with other supplemental appropriations acts, provides over $36 billion for agriculture and nutrition assistance programs. Specifically, $9.5 billion is allocated to USDA to support agricultural producers affected by the coronavirus, including specialty crops, local food systems, and livestock producers. This funding gives the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to respond to the crisis, similar to emergency appropriations for wildfires and hurricanes in previous years. The CARES Act provides $14 billion to replenish funding for the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), allowing for future obligations. This funding reimburses past spending and gives flexibility for regular farm commodity support programs. The CARES Act provides flexibility for farm commodity support programs by allowing Marketing Assistance Loans to be repaid over 12 months in FY2020. Access to food is a concern during the pandemic, with rising unemployment potentially increasing participation in SNAP and TEFAP. The FFCRA and CARES Act allocate $26 billion for nutrition assistance programs, including $850 million for TEFAP to increase USDA commodity distribution. The CARES Act provides $3 billion for a commodity purchase and distribution program called \"Farmers to Families Food Box.\" Additionally, the Act allocates $146 million for rural development, including funds for rural broadband grants, telemedicine, distance learning, and rural business loans. The FFCRA will increase SNAP policies, leading to over $21 billion in mandatory spending over FY2020-FY2021. The CARES Act provides $141 million for USDA agency operations, including funds for various agencies like APHIS, AMS, FSIS, FAS, FSA, and OIG. The funding aims to replace lost revenues, support temporary employees, and repatriate staff during the pandemic. The CARES Act provided financial relief to agriculture-related businesses through loans and grants. The Small Business Administration allocated $4.37 billion in Paycheck Protection Loans to agricultural businesses. Additionally, the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) was introduced, offering $19 billion in relief to farmers and ranchers affected by the pandemic. CFAP includes $16 billion in direct payments to producers and $3 billion in commodity purchases for distribution. The CFAP funding of $16 billion for direct payments and $3 billion for commodity purchases aims to support agriculture businesses affected by COVID-19 by offsetting revenue loss and increasing food availability. Funding sources include the FFCRA, CARES Act, and USDA authorities. Senator Hoeven highlighted the $16 billion for direct payments program. The $16 billion for direct payments program under CFAP is derived from emergency program spending authorized by the CARES Act and an existing balance in the CCC. The $3 billion for commodity purchases comes from the FFCRA. Senator Hoeven's office provided details on how the $16 billion will be allocated across different commodity groupings. The $16 billion direct payments program under CFAP is allocated to different commodity groupings, including livestock, row crops, specialty crops, and \"other\" crops. Eligibility for direct payments requires a 5% price decrease between January and April 2020. Specific prices and dates for calculation are pending. The \"other\" category is expected to include horticulture, hemp, sheep, goats, and other commodities showing revenue loss. The USDA's direct payments to producers under CFAP will be based on estimated losses from market price declines and additional marketing costs due to oversupply in 2020. Payments will be proportional to actual production and may follow a similar structure to previous programs. Payments will cover market price declines of over 5% between January and April 2020, totaling 85% of the loss. The USDA's direct payments to producers under CFAP will cover market price declines of over 5% between January and April 2020, totaling 85% of the loss. Additionally, payments will also address future marketing losses from unsold products, valued at 30% of expected losses from April 15 through the next two quarters. The USDA has not provided details on which prices will be used in the formula or how the price decline will be measured. Producers may need to self-certify losses due to social distancing measures. They should save records to demonstrate losses, especially if products were destroyed. Compensation is expected for dumped milk, but uncertainty remains regarding depopulated livestock and poultry. CFAP direct payments will be limited to producers who own the commodity or product. USDA is expediting the rulemaking process for the direct payment program under CFAP. Payment limits are expected at $125,000 per commodity grouping, with an overall limit of $250,000 per individual or entity. USDA has discretion in applying payment limits, as seen in previous programs like MFP and WHIP. Benefits received under traditional farm support programs will not be added to CFAP direct payments. The USDA announced the CFAP program with $3 billion designated for a commodity purchase and distribution program to address market disruptions. Agricultural products will be purchased from farmers and processors to support markets and reduce food waste, with products distributed to food banks and nonprofit organizations. This program operates independently from traditional farm support programs like ARC and PLC, with payment limits expected to be $125,000 per commodity grouping and $250,000 per individual or entity. The USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program purchases $100 million per month of fresh produce, dairy products, and meat products for distribution to food banks and nonprofits. The program is separate from existing USDA commodity purchase programs and is expedited due to high demand during the pandemic. The USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program has expedited its procurement-to-delivery timeline to as little as one month, with bids due on May 1 and contracts expected to be awarded on May 8. The program is set to operate through the end of 2020, with initial deliveries as early as May 15. Another significant change is the product format. The USDA Farmers to Families Food Box Program has expedited its procurement-to-delivery timeline to as little as one month, with bids due on May 1 and contracts expected to be awarded on May 8. The program is set to operate through the end of 2020. The CFAP purchase program intends for vendors to deliver household-ready boxes of produce, meat, and dairy products for more convenient distribution to support social distancing. Additionally, USDA announced a plan to purchase $470 million of commodities with Section 32 authority. The USDA plans to purchase $170 million of produce, $120 million of dairy products, $80 million of poultry, $70 million of fish, and $30 million of pork. The CARES Act provided $14 billion to replenish the CCC, with additional funding expected in July. The CCC can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury. This funding will increase opportunities for USDA to provide further assistance to agricultural producers and ranchers. The CCC's borrowing authority may increase to $50 billion or $68 billion, as proposed by Senator John Hoeven and H.R. 6728. This could provide more direct support payments to farmers. USDA has used its discretionary authority to pressure the CCC borrowing limit. The USDA has nearly used up its borrowing authority in the CCC for CFAP payments. They may use supplemental funding from the CARES Act to provide more support to the agriculture sector. After a $470 million Section 32 purchase, USDA would have about $400 million left for the fiscal year. Congress may direct USDA to provide additional support, with a proposed bill for $50 billion in funding. Several Members of Congress are advocating for an additional $50 billion in funding for COVID-related agricultural assistance programs. They are concerned about rural America's ability to handle the pandemic and have proposed the establishment of a Rural COVID-19 Task Force to address rural needs. The Task Force would include experts from various sectors, such as agriculture, healthcare, and the private sector. The Rural COVID-19 Task Force aims to address challenges in rural healthcare, including mental health, and the private sector. Members of Congress highlighted that rural areas face issues such as lack of insurance, advanced age, pre-existing conditions, and limited healthcare resources. Additionally, people of color in rural areas are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with limited internet access hindering remote work and education. Many industry groups in the U.S. agricultural sector requested federal assistance due to economic damage from COVID-19. Following USDA's announcement of CFAP, targeted industry groups expressed appreciation for the aid. However, some agriculture-related industries like ethanol, poultry, sheep, lamb, specialty livestock, and horticultural products are not eligible for CFAP support. Industry groups in the agriculture sector appreciate the aid provided by CFAP, but some sectors like ethanol, poultry, sheep, lamb, and specialty livestock are not eligible for support. Concerns have been raised about the payment limits associated with CFAP direct payments, with calls to remove the $125,000 limit to ensure adequate aid to individual producers. Congressional focus is on directing assistance to industries affected by COVID-19. The government is considering ways to provide assistance to industries affected by COVID-19, including identifying affected industries, measuring losses, and providing compensation. There are concerns about monitoring taxpayer money and potential moral hazards with self-certification of losses. Congress may investigate institutional rigidities in the food supply chain and evaluate the need for less reliance on just-in-time supply chains. The government is exploring ways to assist industries impacted by COVID-19, including evaluating losses and providing compensation. There are concerns about monitoring taxpayer funds and potential moral hazards with self-certification of losses. Congress is looking into institutional rigidities in the food supply chain, considering less reliance on just-in-time supply chains, and proposing actions to expedite the food assistance supply chain through programs like \"farm-to-food bank\" initiatives. Additionally, new federal programs may be introduced to increase demand during certain market conditions. The government is considering new payment programs to assist industries impacted by COVID-19, such as offering early partial payments for ARC and PLC to address short-term cash flow problems for farm households. These programs could better reflect local market conditions and disparities in regional economic harm, relying on market conditions to trigger and determine payment sizes. The government is considering new payment programs to assist industries impacted by COVID-19, such as trigger payments designed to address short-term cash flow problems for farm households. These payments could be set at catastrophic levels and made before or shortly after harvest. Congress may also need to consider long-term effects, including heightened indebtedness, potential bankruptcies, industry consolidation, altered consumption patterns, and a slower recovery for rural America. Prolonged depressed market conditions in rural areas due to layoffs and limited employment opportunities may hinder agriculture's recovery. Rural banks are smaller and less well-capitalized than urban banks. Discussions include farm loan debt forgiveness and loan repayment flexibilities. Slow rural economic recovery could reduce confidence, leading to decreased spending and investment. Studies project deep losses across major commodity sectors due to COVID-19. The impact of the price decline on commodity sectors is being assessed, focusing on unsold production and surplus products due to institutional buying shutdown."
