    "content": "Since 1903, the INA has provisions addressing public charge grounds of inadmissibility and deportability for aliens seeking visas, admission, adjustment of status, or already in the United States without inspection. Aliens found inadmissible on public charge grounds may be barred from entering, denied status adjustment, or subject to removal. The INA provisions address public charge grounds of inadmissibility and deportability for aliens. It specifies that any alien who becomes a public charge within five years of entry is deportable. The INA does not define what it means for an alien to be a public charge, but factors must be taken into account when determining inadmissibility or eligibility for adjustment of status on public charge grounds. The 1996 amendments authorize consular and immigration officers to consider various factors, including age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education, and skills of an alien. Certain family-sponsored and employment-based immigrants may be inadmissible without the requisite affidavit of support. The public charge ground of deportability is still assessed based on a three-part test, which is narrower than the grounds of inadmissibility due to differences between deportation and exclusion. The deportation statute in the United States must be strictly construed, while the INA's provisions regarding inadmissibility lack statutory guidance. Immigration officers consider factors to determine if aliens are inadmissible or deportable on public charge grounds, with decisions subject to review by the BIA and federal courts. Numerous decisions dating back to 1903 address the applicability of public charge grounds to aliens. The BIA established a three-part test in 1948 to determine if an alien is deportable on public charge grounds. This test requires the State to impose a charge for services rendered to the alien. The BIA established a three-part test in 1948 to determine if an alien is deportable on public charge grounds. The alien in question was found not to be a public charge because the Illinois statute provided free maintenance, care, and treatment at the state hospital. The BIA emphasized that the state or municipality paying for services accepted by the alien is not the sole determinant of public charge status. In 1974, the BIA reaffirmed the \"totality of the circumstances\" test for determining an alien's inadmissibility on public charge grounds in Matter of Harutunian. The case involved a 70-year-old alien relying on state \"old-age assistance benefits\" who was deemed ineligible for adjustment of status. The BIA rejected the alien's argument based on the precedent of Matter of B, citing differences in the interpretation of public charge between Sections 212 and 237 of the INA. The Board emphasized that deportation dislodges established residence in the US, while aliens outside the country have no constitutional right to enter. Grounds of deportability must be strictly construed compared to inadmissibility. Legislative history supports considering age, financial status, and family support for public charge inadmissibility. Physical and mental condition, economic circumstances are also factors. The BIA found the alien inadmissible on public charge grounds due to receiving welfare assistance, being aged, unskilled, uneducated, and lacking family support. This led to the conclusion that the alien could be deemed a public charge. The Board found the alien inadmissible as a public charge due to receiving welfare assistance, being aged, unskilled, uneducated, and lacking family support. The enactment of PRWORA in 1996 led to restrictions on noncitizens receiving public benefits, but certain exemptions exist, such as emergency medical assistance and disaster relief. PRWORA exempts certain qualified aliens from the general prohibition on receiving public benefits, including refugees, asylees, and victims of domestic violence. Questions have been raised about whether taking advantage of these benefits could make aliens removable. In 1999, the INS proposed regulations defining public charge and how receipt of public benefits could impact immigration status. The proposed regulations would have defined public charge as an alien primarily dependent on government assistance for subsistence, including cash assistance like SSI and TANF. Other forms of cash benefits not intended for income maintenance would have been excluded from consideration. The proposed regulation would have outlined the role of public cash assistance in determining an alien's admissibility or deportability on public charge grounds, considering various factors such as age, health, family status, assets, and education. Public charge determinations are based on the \"totality of the circumstances.\" The proposed regulation outlines factors for public charge determinations, stating no single factor controls except lack of affidavit of support. Deportability on public charge grounds requires proof of repayment demand for public cash assistance within five years of entry. The INS proposed regulations on public charge grounds, but never finalized them. Instead, they issued a field guide known as the \"Pearson memorandum\" which is still considered authoritative. The public charge grounds are currently discussed in the regulations of both DHS and DOS, as well as in DOS's Foreign Affairs Manual. The DHS and DOS regulations address inadmissibility and deportability for aliens. Consular officers issue visas outside the US, while DHS officials determine admission at ports of entry and removal within the US. INS never finalized proposed public charge regulations, and DHS has not proposed similar regulations. Instead, specific regulations were promulgated regarding \"special rules\" for certain adjustment applicants. The DHS regulations include \"special rules\" for certain adjustment applicants, such as special agricultural workers who may not be excluded for public charge grounds if they have a consistent employment history showing their ability to support themselves and their families. Past acceptance of public cash assistance within a history of consistent employment will be considered in public charge determinations, with the length of time receiving such assistance being a significant factor. The weight given to public cash assistance acceptance depends on various factors, and the analysis is prospective based on the applicant's history. Based on the applicant's history, immigration officials determine if they are likely to become a public charge. Special rules apply to certain adjustment applicants, like special agricultural workers. DHS regulations do not address public charge grounds of deportability. The Pearson memorandum guides public charge determinations. USCIS's 2011 fact sheet defines public charge similarly to the Pearson memorandum. The fact sheet is available on the DHS website. The DOS regulations, unlike the DHS regulations, broadly address the public charge grounds of inadmissibility, emphasizing the role of the alien's circumstances in determining inadmissibility. Consular officers can issue visas to aliens subject to the affidavit of support requirement if they provide a bond or undertaking in accordance with INA 213 and INA 221(g). Consular officers can issue visas to aliens subject to the affidavit of support requirement if they provide a bond or undertaking in accordance with INA 213 and INA 221(g). The officer must be satisfied that the bond or undertaking removes the likelihood of the alien becoming a public charge, and the alien must be otherwise eligible for a visa. Additionally, aliens relying solely on personal income to show they are not likely to become a public charge must demonstrate an annual income above the federal poverty line and have other adequate financial resources. The DOS guidance in the Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) defines public cash assistance for income maintenance as \"means tested benefits.\" The FAM defines institutionalization for long-term care as care for mental or other health reasons for an indefinite period, not temporary. Public charge determinations consider factors like age and health, with past receipt of cash benefits factored in if it was the primary means of subsistence. The FAM does not base inadmissibility solely on prior receipt of public benefits or institutionalization at public expense. The INA does not define public charge or directly link it to receipt of public benefits, but some guidance from DHS and DOS suggests a potential connection. The guidance emphasizes that determinations for admissibility and deportability regarding aliens potentially encompass those who receive certain public benefits, but prior receipt of benefits alone is not sufficient for removal on public charge grounds. Admissibility decisions are based on projections of future likelihood of becoming a public charge, considering various factors including prior benefit receipt. Deportability determinations follow a three-part test to assess if government assistance payment was legally required, demanded, and could be made. The case law interpreting public charge grounds suggests that receiving certain public benefits could lead to inadmissibility or deportability for aliens, but prior benefit receipt alone is not enough for removal. For example, in Matter of A\u2014, an alien's appeal was sustained despite receiving public cash assistance for four years without working. The Board disagreed with the district director's view that the alien was unable to support herself without public assistance, noting that she was young, had no physical or mental defects affecting her earning capacity, and had recently started working after caring for her children. In another case, the BIA reversed the denial of permanent residence for a mother and child, stating that the mother was capable of earning her own livelihood and the child had training in a field with wide employment opportunities in the country. The Board's focus on aliens' ability to earn a living, even without the contributions of the husband/father, is illustrative in cases involving receipt of public benefits. Receipt of public assistance is just one factor in determining deportability, with the presence of a legal obligation to repay, a demand for repayment, and a failure to repay also being necessary. If there is no legal obligation to repay the assistance, the alien is not found deportable on public charge grounds. In cases where aliens received public assistance, deportability on public charge grounds was not found if there was no legal obligation to repay the assistance. This was exemplified in various cases where no demand for repayment was made, or the alien or their relatives had the ability to pay. In determining aliens' deportability on public charge grounds, only causes predating their entry are considered. Congressional interest in this area persists due to the interplay between INA provisions on aliens' removability and benefits they can receive. Aliens may be deported if they are or likely to become a public charge, while certain public benefits are also available to noncitizens. The interplay between INA provisions on aliens' removability and benefits they can receive raises questions about noncitizens receiving benefits without being subject to removal, despite certain public benefits being exempt from restrictions under PRWORA."
