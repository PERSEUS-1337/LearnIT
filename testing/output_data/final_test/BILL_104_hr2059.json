    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1996\" and includes findings. The Congress emphasizes the importance of a balanced civil space program as a critical investment in research and development, even during deficit reduction. NASA needs consistent funding for the next 5 years to support initiatives in human space flight, science, aeronautics, and technology. International cooperation is key to maximizing American investments in space exploration. NASA should focus on reducing institutional costs through various measures like management restructuring and procurement reform. NASA should focus on reducing institutional costs through management restructuring, procurement reform, personnel base downsizing, and convergence with other defense and private sector systems. The term \"Administrator\" in this Act refers to the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Authorization of appropriations for human space flight is outlined in Title I. For fiscal year 1996, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is authorized the following amounts for Human Space Flight: $1,833,600,000 for the Space Station, $129,200,000 for Russian Cooperation, $3,171,800,000 for the Space Shuttle, and $315,000,000 for Payload and Utilization Operations. Additionally, $14,800,000 is authorized for the construction of a Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at Johnson Space Center, with an option to purchase the Clear Lake Development Facility for $35,000,000. The Act authorizes funds for various facilities at Kennedy Space Center: $7,500,000 for the Chemical Analysis Facility, $4,900,000 for the Space Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility, and $5,000,000 for the Firex System modernization on Pads A and B. SEC. 102. SCIENCE, AERONAUTICS, AND TECHNOLOGY. For fiscal year 1996, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is authorized the following amounts:\n- $1,972,400,000 for Space Science, including funds for Physics and Astronomy projects like the Space Infrared Telescope Facility and the Gravity Probe B Relativity Mission.\n- $504,000,000 for Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications.\n- $1,287,460,000 for Mission to Planet Earth. For Space Access and Technology, $557,300,000 is authorized, including funds for Reusable Launch Vehicle technology, Spacecraft and Remote Sensing, and Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative. Aeronautical Research and Technology is allocated $877,300,000, with funds for Research and Technology Base activities. Technology Base activities include funding for High Speed Research, Advanced Subsonic Technology, and High Performance Computing and Communications. Mission Communication Services are allocated $461,300,000, while Academic Programs receive $102,200,000. Construction of facilities includes $3,000,000 for an addition to the Microgravity Development Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center and $17,000,000 for the Earth Systems Science Building at Goddard Space Flight Center. $5,400,000 authorized for modernization of Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Complex at Ames Research Center. SEC. 103. MISSION SUPPORT. For fiscal year 1996, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is appropriated the following amounts for Mission Support: $37.6 million for Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance, $299.4 million for Space Communications Services with $175.8 million for the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite Replenishment program, $2.1 million for Research and Program Management, and $166.4 million for Construction of Facilities including restoration projects. For restoration and replacement projects in various NASA centers, the following amounts are authorized: $3,000,000 for Chilled Water Distribution System at Goddard Space Flight Center, $4,800,000 for Chillers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, $1,100,000 for Electrical Distribution System at White Sands Test Facility, $4,200,000 for Main Substation Switchgear at Johnson Space Center, $1,800,000 for 15KV Load Break Switches at Kennedy Space Center, and $9,000,000 for Central Air Equipment Building at Lewis Research Center. Authorized restoration and repair projects at various NASA centers include: restoration of High Pressure Air Compressor System at Marshall Space Flight Center, Information and Electronic Systems Laboratory at Marshall Space Flight Center, Canal Lock at Stennis Space Center, Primary Electrical Distribution System at Wallops Flight Facility, and repair of facilities at various locations not exceeding $1,500,000 per project. Additionally, $35,000,000 is authorized for rehabilitation projects. Authorized funds for facility projects include $35,000,000 for rehabilitation and modification, $3,800,000 for minor construction, $10,000,000 for planning and design, and $37,000,000 for environmental compliance and restoration. In fiscal year 1996, $17,300,000 is authorized for the Inspector General of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The total amount authorized for Construction of Facilities under this Act is capped at $214,000,000. Additionally, there are limitations on the use of funds for construction projects. Funds appropriated for construction projects by NASA must not exceed $500,000 without notifying the relevant committees. Title to facilities purchased or constructed with funds from NASA grants to institutions of higher education or nonprofit organizations for research purposes will be vested in the United States unless the Administrator decides otherwise to serve the national aeronautical and space program best. Grants will be subject to conditions ensuring benefits to the U.S. justify the grant. Subtitle A appropriations authorized may remain available without fiscal year limitation. Reprogramming for construction of facilities is allowed. SEC. 113 allows for variations in appropriations for construction of facilities, with increases of up to 10% or 25% for unusual cost variations. The total amount authorized for appropriations shall not be increased as a result of these actions. SEC. 114 pertains to consideration by committees. No amount appropriated to NASA can be used for programs denied funding by Congress, exceeding authorized amounts, or not presented in the President's budget without a 30-day waiting period. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration must wait 30 days after notifying the relevant congressional committees before taking any proposed action. NASA is required to keep the committees informed about its activities and responsibilities. Federal agencies must provide requested information to the committees regarding NASA's activities. SEC. 115. Use of funds up to $35,000 for scientific consultations or extraordinary expenses with Administrator authorization. The Administrator can enter multiyear contracts for infrared astronomical data services by airborne platforms, including aircraft and support equipment. Contracts may include termination liability paid from Science, Aeronautics, and Technology appropriations. Transactions are calculated for the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office will score contracts under the Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 as if they were entered into on September 30, 1990. SEC. 202. FACILITIES CLOSING COMMISSION.
