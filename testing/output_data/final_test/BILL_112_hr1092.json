    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Retirees Health Care Protection Act\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that career uniformed service members and their families endure unique and extraordinary demands and sacrifices during their decades-long career protecting freedoms. These sacrifices are most evident during wartime, including the Global War on Terrorism and past conflicts. Few Americans are willing to accept these demands for a multi-decade career, and the primary offset is a system of extraordinary retirement benefits, including health care. The grateful Nation provides extraordinary retirement benefits, including superior health care coverage, to career uniformed service members who sacrifice much of their personal life for the national interest. Many private sector firms are reducing health benefits, leading retired service members to rely more on TRICARE coverage earned through military service. The Department of Defense aims to control TRICARE costs by shifting more of the burden to retired service members. The Department of Defense's proposed beneficiary cost increases fail to acknowledge the sacrifices made by career service members. TRICARE faces challenges with health care providers refusing new patients due to lower payments and unique administrative requirements. The Department of Defense's decision to count accrual deposits against its budget goes against previous legislation. Leaders have informed Congress about this budgeting issue. Congress believes that counting deposits against the Department of Defense budget impacts readiness needs, including weapons programs, which goes against previous legislation. Congress emphasizes the obligation to provide health benefits to retired service members and urges the Department of Defense to explore alternative cost-saving measures instead of imposing large fee increases on beneficiaries. Prohibition on health cost increases and benefit adjustments for uniformed services members and dependents. Prohibition on health cost increases and benefit adjustments for uniformed services members and dependents under various sections of title 10, United States Code. Prohibition on health cost increases and benefit adjustments for uniformed services members and dependents under various sections of title 10, United States Code, from April 1, 2006, to September 30, 2011. Premiums for TRICARE Standard coverage for certain members in the Selected Reserve and Retired Reserve cannot be increased starting October 1, 2011, beyond the amount in effect for September 2011."
