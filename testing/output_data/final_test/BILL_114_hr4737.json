The Congress recognizes that the States have delegated certain powers to the national government, while reserving all other sovereign powers to themselves. States have the authority, resources, and competence to govern in most areas, allowing for diversity in public policies based on their own conditions and needs. Federal action limiting the policymaking discretion of States should only occur when constitutional and statutory authority is clear, and the issue is of national scope. Federal agencies must distinguish between national problems warranting federal action and those that can be effectively handled by individual States. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection outlined potential rulemakings for payday, vehicle title, and similar loans on March 26, 2015. They recognized that these markets are regulated by various state, tribal, and municipal laws, with some jurisdictions imposing usury limits on high-cost credit. Some states have specific laws authorizing these products as exceptions to general credit regulations. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection aims to establish a federal floor for consumer protection on payday and vehicle title loans, despite the existing variation in state, tribal, and local laws regulating these markets. This variation reflects a dynamic legal environment where elected representatives respond to the needs of their constituents. The Bureau's proposals for consumer protection on payday and vehicle title loans would infringe on State and tribal sovereignty, violating federalist principles designed to protect the liberty of the American people. The Bureau failed to show that States or tribal governments lack the legal authority or capability to enact similar laws for consumer protection. The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is prohibited from issuing rules on payday loans, vehicle title loans, and similar loans for 24 months. The term \"payday loan\" is defined under the Consumer Financial Protection Act. Additionally, the Act aims to protect State and tribal government sovereignty.

The Consumer Financial Protection Act prohibits the Bureau from regulating payday loans, vehicle title loans, and similar loans for 24 months. The Bureau must conduct a study on its authority to preempt state, tribal, and local laws, the impact of regulations on different jurisdictions, and propose alternatives to mitigate risks associated with these types of loans. The Consumer Financial Protection Act prohibits the Bureau from regulating payday loans, vehicle title loans, and similar loans for 24 months. The Bureau must conduct a study on its authority to preempt state, tribal, and local laws, and issue a public report containing all findings, determinations, comments, and advice received during consultation with officials. The Bureau proposes to preempt state, tribal, and local laws by rule or regulation, identifying entities lacking legal authority and providing reasoning for such determinations. The Bureau may waive regulations for states or federally recognized Indian tribes deemed incapable of protecting citizens from risks associated with payday loans, vehicle title loans, or similar loans. The Director may grant a 5-year waiver to a State or federally recognized Indian tribe upon request to waive regulations on payday loans, vehicle title loans, or similar loans. The State or tribe can renew the waiver at the end of each 5-year period."
