    "content": "Wahhabism is a puritanical form of Sunni Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, less rigidly enforced in the latter. Named after scholar Muhammad bin Abd al Wahhab, it seeks to purify Islam of deviations from seventh-century teachings. Believers may prefer to call themselves \"Unitarians\" or \"Salafiyyun.\" Muhammad bin Abd al Wahhab founded Wahhabism in the 18th century in Saudi Arabia to purify Islam and return to its fundamental teachings, denouncing popular beliefs as idolatrous. Wahhabism, founded by Muhammad bin Abd al Wahhab in the 18th century, emphasizes the \"fundamentals\" of Islam based on the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. It led to a close political relationship between the Al Saud dynasty and Wahhabi descendants. Wahhabism's puritanical beliefs have caused conflicts with other Muslim groups, opposing popular Islamic practices and traditions. This has led to confrontations with non-Wahhabi Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims, and non-Muslims in neighboring areas. Since the 18th century, Wahhabism, founded by Muhammad bin Abd al Wahhab, has emphasized the fundamentals of Islam based on the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. This led to a close political relationship between the Al Saud dynasty and Wahhabi descendants, causing conflicts with other Muslim groups and non-Muslims. The first Saudi kingdom was destroyed by Ottoman forces in the early 19th century, and Wahhabi-trained Bedouin warriors played a key role in the modern Saudi kingdom's foundation in 1932. The Saudi ruling family has maintained a close relationship with the Wahhabi religious establishment, with Wahhabi clerics integrated into the kingdom's religious structure. Wahhabism, founded by Muhammad bin Abd al Wahhab in the 18th century, influenced the formation of the modern Saudi kingdom in 1932. Wahhabi clerics were integrated into the kingdom's religious and political establishment, shaping its laws and policies. Saudi Arabia has faced criticism for restricting religious freedom and promoting Wahhabist beliefs through its educational system. The government has taken steps to promote religious tolerance and combat extremist ideology. The report highlights efforts by Saudi Arabia to protect religious freedom, curb discrimination against non-Muslim minorities, and empower its Human Rights Commission. It also mentions ongoing discrimination against Shiite Muslims and the interchangeability of the terms \"Salafiyya\" and \"Wahhabism.\" Salafiyya, considered by some as the Saudi form of Salafiyya, is a reform-oriented movement that emphasizes the Quran and the Prophet's practices as the ultimate religious authority in Islam. It is not a unified movement but appeals to many Muslims seeking religious renewal. Violent jihad is not inherently associated with puritanical Islamic beliefs. Among certain puritanical Muslims like Salafis and Wahhabis, advocacy of jihad is a recent and disputed phenomenon. The rise of militancy within the wider Salafi community is often traced back to the war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, which mobilized thousands of volunteer fighters. Radical beliefs spread through mosques and madrasas on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, funded by Saudi Arabia and other Western countries. The rise of militant Salafis and the Taliban movement can be traced back to the funding of mosques and madrasas by Saudi Arabia and other Western countries during the war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. This led to the emergence of violent Salafist-inspired groups like Al Qaeda, advocating for the establishment of puritanical Islamic states enforced under strict Islamic law. Analysts note that some groups in the Muslim world are drawn to anti-U.S. political messages preached by Bin Laden and his supporters, despite differing religious beliefs. Allegations against Wahhabism and the Saudi Arabian government include support for spreading Wahhabist ideas globally, raising concerns of terrorism and Islamic militancy. Saudi funding of mosques, madrasas, and charities linked to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda has fueled these concerns. Some reports suggest that Saudi teachings in domestic schools may promote intolerance of other religions and cultures. A 2002 study by CSIS found that Saudi textbooks contain hate literature towards Jews and Christians. The global spread of Wahhabist teachings is seen as a threat to moderate Islamic beliefs, including in the United States. Recent focus on Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia has raised concerns about their harsh ideology. Recent attention to Wahhabi clerics in Saudi Arabia has raised concerns about their harsh sectarian rhetoric towards Shiite Muslims, accusing them of apostasy and disloyalty. Saudi officials deny allegations of exporting extremism and have initiated educational reforms to promote tolerance and remove divisive material from curricula. The Saudi government faces political challenges from confrontations with religious figures over problematic remarks and activities. Critics call for a reevaluation of the US-Saudi relationship amid allegations against Wahhabism, while others argue for continued ties due to economic and security interests. The Bush administration praises Saudi counter-terrorism cooperation and denounces groups that have \"hijacked a great religion.\" The 9/11 Commission Report highlights the influence of Wahhabism on Islamist terrorism, particularly in Saudi Arabia. It mentions the role of Wahhabi-funded organizations in supporting violent jihad against non-Muslims. The Commission recommends a reevaluation of the US-Saudi relationship due to these findings. The 9/11 Commission Report emphasizes the impact of Wahhabism on Islamist terrorism, especially in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the role of Wahhabi-funded organizations in supporting violent jihad. Congressional hearings have scrutinized the connection between Wahhabi beliefs and terrorist financing, as well as alleged ties to intolerance spread. Legislation in the 108th Congress criticized Saudi-funded religious institutions for backing anti-Western terrorism and called for increased dialogue and collaboration with Saudi Arabia to promote tolerance and counter support for extremist groups. The 9/11 Commission Report highlighted Saudi Arabia's uneven record in fighting terrorism, including support for extremist groups and restrictions on religious freedom. Legislation in the 110th Congress called for engagement with Saudi Arabia to promote political, economic, and social reforms, including greater religious freedom. The Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2007 aimed to address extremism and incitement, requiring the President to certify Saudi Arabia's actions. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to address extremism and incitement in Saudi Arabia, with bills requiring the President to certify the government's actions regarding the spread of radical Wahhabi ideology."
