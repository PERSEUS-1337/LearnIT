Incumbents have the option to elect to be treated according to the Act's amendments or as if the Act had never been enacted. Under the Act, incumbents must make a timely election to be treated according to the amendments or as if the Act had never been enacted. Failure to elect on time is treated as a late election.

Retroactive effect applies to all service performed by an incumbent who elects the option under subsection (d)(1)(A). All service performed by an individual as a Federal prosecutor shall be treated according to applicable provisions of title 5, United States Code, with retroactive effect for those who elect the option under subsection (d)(1)(A).
