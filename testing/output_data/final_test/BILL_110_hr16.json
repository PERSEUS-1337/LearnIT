Section 117(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define key terms related to the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including the Chesapeake Bay watershed itself, the Local Government Advisory Committee, and the tributary strategy. The term 'tributary strategy' refers to one of 36 cleanup plans in the Chesapeake Bay watershed approved by the State, aimed at removing nutrient and sediment impairments. A 'tributary basin' is an area that drains into one of the 36 Chesapeake Bay tributaries and is managed through these strategies. SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING GRANTS.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to require reporting on projects funded by the Federal or State government in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. \n\nSEC. 4. FEDERAL FACILITIES AND BUDGET COORDINATION. Section 117(f) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include activities carried out by agencies in Chesapeake Bay restoration in the annual budget plan submitted by the President. The amendment to Section 117(f) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires the inclusion of a detailed budget plan for Chesapeake Bay restoration activities, accounting for funds received and obligated by Federal agencies, and outlining the specific roles of each agency involved in the restoration efforts. SEC. 5. ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING NUTRIENT AND SEDIMENT REDUCTION GOALS. Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include a new subsection (g) regarding achieving and maintaining nutrient and sediment reduction goals. The Administrator is required to evaluate activities and progress in achieving these goals based on monitoring and modeling data. The report, based on a baseline agreement from December 2003, will include the total allocation of nutrients and sediment for each tributary basin, as well as any changes in quantities from the previous fiscal year. The evaluation report will include a ranking of progress in reducing pollutants in tributary basins, identification of pollution sources, and use of monitoring data for analysis. The Administrator will submit a report to relevant committees detailing the effects of drought and wet weather conditions on water quality parameters, and make it available to the public in electronic format. SEC. 6. ACTIONS BY STATES. Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require certain states and the District of Columbia to submit information annually on nutrient and sediment contamination levels, sources of pollutants, and reduction technologies used in tributary basins. The amended Section 117 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act mandates states and the District of Columbia to report annually on nutrient and sediment contamination levels, pollution sources, and reduction technologies in tributary basins. This includes details on best management practices, sewage treatment upgrades, funding sources, and projects contributing to Chesapeake Bay Agreement goals. Failure to comply may result in the denial of grants. SEC. 7. CHESAPEAKE BAY PROGRAM. In amending Section 117(i) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the changes include ensuring tributary strategies, approval, and implementation, involving local government in setting measurable goals through the Local Government Advisory Committee.

The Administrator will prioritize projects led by or partnered with local governments for grants to support tributary basin restoration programs and habitat enhancement in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The Administrator, in cooperation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will provide capacity building assistance to enhance technical and environmental planning capabilities of local governments for protection and restoration programs in tributary basins. Assistance grants will be provided to implement tributary strategies for quantifiable reduction. The text discusses strategies to reduce nonpoint source pollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed through innovative and cost-effective methods. It also mentions incorporating load allocations into permits until total maximum daily loads are established. Additionally, there are conforming amendments to the Small Watershed Grants Program. The text discusses strategies to reduce nonpoint source pollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed through innovative and cost-effective methods.
