It serves the purpose of creating a pilot project for brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. The Congress finds that brownfields, older abandoned commercial sites with contamination, face challenges in redevelopment due to cleanup costs and lack of financing, making them less attractive than undeveloped greenfield sites. States have established remedial action programs to facilitate voluntary response to hazardous substance releases at low and medium priority facilities, streamlining regulatory requirements for timely and cost-effective site cleanup. States can leverage Federal funds to create revolving loan funds for local cleanup and redevelopment projects. The purpose of this Act is to revitalize distressed communities by providing loans for redevelopment projects. The project aims to revitalize distressed communities by providing loans for cleanup of eligible brownfield facilities and properties that are remediated through State voluntary cleanup programs, attracting private investment, fostering clean manufacturing, and creating jobs for local residents. The pilot project aims to provide a revolving loan fund for cleanups under State voluntary cleanup programs. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a pilot project to provide capitalization loans to States for creating or expanding revolving loan funds for voluntary environmental cleanups. Loan applications must demonstrate State participation in a voluntary cleanup program for eligible facilities. The Environmental Protection Agency will establish a pilot project to provide capitalization loans to States for voluntary environmental cleanups. States must demonstrate minimum public participation, technical assistance, oversight, resources for cleanup, and certification from the State. States must also show evidence of providing a matching share of at least 20 percent of cleanup costs and describe their revolving loan program. The State's revolving loan program must provide loans for voluntary cleanups to parties unable to secure financing elsewhere. Borrowers must show credit worthiness and ability to carry out the cleanup, with priority given to facilities planned for industrial reuse with environmentally sound practices and job creation. The State's revolving loan program provides loans for voluntary cleanups to parties unable to secure financing elsewhere. Borrowers must demonstrate creditworthiness and ability to carry out the cleanup. The loan repayment will begin within 5 years, and the State must show the ability to repay. The loan cannot be used for new construction at undeveloped sites, environmental fines, speculative assessments, or rehabilitation at facilities with little economic potential. Other elements may be included as deemed necessary by the Administrator. The Administrator will determine the distribution of funds among eligible States for capitalization loans. The maximum loan amount for a State is 15% of the total available each year. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998, and $7,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 1999 and 2000. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"eligible facility\" in this Act refers to a property with environmental contamination that hinders its use, redevelopment, or reuse, but is limited in scope and easily assessable. It excludes facilities undergoing abatement actions under certain environmental laws or federal response actions. An eligible facility under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act includes facilities on the National Priorities List, those requiring permits under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, land disposal units with closure requirements, and facilities undergoing corrective action. Facilities subject to corrective action under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, eligible for response assistance under the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund, or owned by a US department, agency, or instrumentality are considered eligible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act."
