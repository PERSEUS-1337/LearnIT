    "content": "The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets is a key part of the Bush administration's homeland security strategy. It requires government agencies and private sector partners to identify and prioritize assets essential to the US well-being. The definition of critical infrastructures and key assets is crucial for implementation. The concept of \"critical infrastructure\" in public policy has been evolving for decades and is still debated. This report reviews the definition of \"critical infrastructure\" in federal reports, legislation, and regulation since the 1980s. The report reviews the evolution of the definition of \"critical infrastructure\" in federal reports, legislation, and regulation since the early 1980s. It focuses on changes in public policy debates from infrastructure adequacy to protection, and current policy issues related to critical infrastructure identification by federal agencies and the private sector. The report is limited to definitional issues and categorization of infrastructure. For a broader discussion on national policy regarding critical infrastructure protection, refer to CRS Report RL30153. The definition of \"infrastructure\" in U.S. public policy has evolved over the years, with debates focusing on the adequacy of public works. Twenty years ago, infrastructure was seen as deteriorating and of insufficient capacity, including roads, bridges, water, and other public facilities. The definition of infrastructure is broad and subject to interpretation, depending on the context in which the term is used. The definition of \"infrastructure\" in U.S. public policy has evolved over the years, with debates focusing on the adequacy of public works. Infrastructure includes roads, bridges, water and sewer systems, airports, ports, public buildings, schools, health facilities, jails, electric power production, fire safety, waste disposal, and communications services. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) defines infrastructure as facilities critical to the nation's economy, including highways, public transit systems, wastewater treatment works, water resources, air traffic control, airports, municipal water supply, schools, hospitals, prisons, and industrial capacity. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has narrowed its definition of \"infrastructure\" to exclude certain facilities like public housing, government buildings, private rail service, and schools. Congress has enacted legislation affecting infrastructure sectors but rarely comprehensively. In 1984, Congress established the National Council on Public Works Improvement to report on infrastructure systems. Analysis included any physical asset capable of producing services for years, such as roadways or bridges. The National Council on Public Works Improvement defined \"infrastructure\" as facilities with high fixed costs, long economic lives, and strong links to economic development. These facilities provide the underpinnings of the nation's defense, economy, and health and safety, including highways, airports, public transit, and intermodal transportation. The National Council on Public Works Improvement defined \"infrastructure\" as facilities crucial for national defense, economy, and safety, including streets, airports, public transit, and water resources. In the 1990s, policy makers shifted focus from infrastructure adequacy to protection due to the threat of terrorism, leading to a reconsideration of the definition of \"infrastructure\" in a security context. The Executive Order 13010 defined \"infrastructure\" as interdependent networks and systems essential for defense and economic security. It prioritized specific sectors and assets based on national importance. The Executive Order 13010 defined vital infrastructure as essential for defense and economic security, listing critical sectors such as telecommunications, power systems, transportation, and emergency services. This expanded the concept of critical infrastructure beyond previous policy debates. E.O. 13010 expanded the definition of critical infrastructure to include sectors owned by private companies like telecommunications, energy, and financial services. President Clinton's PDD-63 aimed to protect these \"critical\" infrastructures from intentional disruption, emphasizing the importance of cyber-based systems. PDD-63 focused on protecting critical infrastructures, including cyber systems, by directing federal agencies to lead security efforts and identify private sector liaisons. It defined critical infrastructures as vital systems and assets essential for national security, economic security, and public health and safety. The National Plan for Critical Infrastructure emphasized the importance of cyber-security for the federal government. Following the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, President Bush signed Executive Order 13228, establishing the Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Council. The Office was tasked with coordinating efforts to protect various critical infrastructures, including energy, utilities, telecommunications, information systems, transportation, airports, agriculture, and water and food systems. Executive Order 13228 established the Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Council to protect critical infrastructures like energy, utilities, telecommunications, transportation, agriculture, and water systems. President Bush also created the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board through Executive Order 13231, focusing on information infrastructure. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 was passed by Congress to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States. The PATRIOT Act was passed to deter and punish terrorist acts in the US and globally, enhance law enforcement tools, and protect critical infrastructures vital to national security and economic stability. It defines critical infrastructure as systems essential to the US, with their incapacity having a severe impact on security, economy, public health, or safety. This definition was later referenced in the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security and introduced the concept of \"key resources\" essential to the economy and government. The President's National Strategy for Homeland Security expands on the definition of critical infrastructure provided in the PATRIOT Act, emphasizing the importance of protecting specific infrastructure sectors. Our critical infrastructure, including agriculture, food, water, public health, emergency services, government institutions, defense industrial base, information, telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking, finance, chemical industry, and postal sectors, are vital for national security and economic growth. The effects of a terrorist attack on these complex systems can have far-reaching consequences beyond the immediate damage. The National Strategy identifies critical infrastructure sectors such as Agriculture, Food, Water, Public Health, Emergency Services, Government, Defense, Industrial Base, Information and Telecommunications, Energy, Transportation, Banking and Finance, Chemical Industry, and Postal and Shipping. Chemical industry and postal and shipping services were added due to their economic importance and potential security risks. The National Strategy prioritizes protecting critical infrastructure sectors and introduces the concept of \"key assets\" as individual targets that could create local disaster or damage national morale. Key assets include symbols like monuments and icons. The Strategy also emphasizes the importance of safeguarding cyber infrastructure. The Bush Administration's National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets (NSPP), released in February 2003, identifies key assets such as national monuments, symbols, and icons that represent the nation's heritage, traditions, values, and political power. These assets deserve special protection due to their significance to the local community and national morale. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets identifies key assets representing the nation's heritage, traditions, values, and political power. These include historical attractions, monuments, economic facilities, commercial centers, and nuclear power plants. President Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 to clarify protection measures for these assets. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) clarifies executive agency responsibilities for protecting critical infrastructure, requiring collaboration with private sector entities. It supersedes PDD-63, adopts definitions from the Homeland Security Act, and revises lead federal agencies. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) specifies a list of critical infrastructures that can be expanded over time. Identifying essential assets and prioritizing protection strategies is crucial, but the complexity of infrastructure sectors makes it challenging to determine critical assets. The U.S. domestic transportation system is highlighted as an example of this complexity. The U.S. domestic transportation system, a critical infrastructure, includes 4 million miles of paved roadways, 45,000 miles of interstate freeway, 600,000 bridges, 300,000 miles of freight rail networks, 10,000 miles of commuter and urban rail systems, and 500 commercial-service airports. This system also encompasses various fixed facilities like terminals, navigation aids, and maintenance bases. The evolution of \"key resources\" in U.S. homeland security policy has led to a focus on refining and prioritizing critical assets. The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) established a program in 1999 to help federal agencies identify and assess their critical assets, understand dependencies, and prioritize protection measures. The Homeland Security Act also emphasizes the need to identify priorities for protective measures within critical infrastructure sectors. The National Strategy for Homeland Security emphasizes the importance of prioritizing critical assets within the nation's infrastructure sectors to focus protection efforts on the highest priorities. This includes identifying key assets, functions, and systems that are vital for national security. The Bush Administration's Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures reaffirms the need to prioritize critical assets and calls for a prioritized master list to guide national protection efforts. The Strategy emphasizes prioritizing critical assets in infrastructure sectors for protection efforts. It calls for a comprehensive assessment of national-level critical facilities and acknowledges that criticality can change over time. HSPD-7 continues the policy of prioritizing and protecting critical assets with an emphasis on infrastructure and key resources. The Strategy emphasizes prioritizing critical assets in infrastructure sectors for protection efforts, with an emphasis on health and safety. Private companies and federal agencies have shared responsibility for identifying critical assets since PDD-63 in 1998, requiring collaboration to assess vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attacks. The private sector collaborates with federal agencies to identify critical assets in infrastructure sectors for protection efforts. Different sectors have varying approaches for identifying their critical assets, such as the National Petroleum Council's guidance for oil and gas infrastructure. This involves valuing key assets and estimating the impact of loss for each asset. In a risk management system, the value of an asset and impact of loss can be measured using a rating system or monetary units. Factors considered include original cost, replacement costs, revenue loss, human life, environmental resources, and regulatory costs. The NPC's guidance emphasizes the need to identify critical assets but leaves it to individual companies to determine criticality in security assessments. The NPC emphasizes the need for companies to identify critical assets in security assessments, but there is a challenge in defining \"key assets\" based on potential loss to the company rather than broader impacts. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets requires DHS to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities and build a comprehensive database. The Homeland Security Act assigns responsibility for the critical asset catalog to DHS's IAIP. Developing a uniform methodology for identifying critical assets has been challenging, with confusion among partners about what constitutes a critical asset. IAIP compiled a list of 1,700 critical assets, but inconsistencies arose when compared to lists developed by state agencies. The 9/11 Commission's final report highlighted concerns about the identification of critical assets in the United States, with discrepancies between lists developed by state agencies and IAIP. Recommendations from the Commission indirectly address critical infrastructure protection. The 9/11 Commission's report emphasizes the importance of infrastructure protection, calling for a systematic risk management approach to prioritize and allocate resources. While the report does not specifically define critical infrastructure, it does address transportation security issues. The Commission's recommendations could accelerate implementation in certain areas, reflecting a renewed sense of urgency. The U.S. government's definition of \"critical infrastructure\" has evolved over time. The definition of \"critical infrastructure\" has expanded over the years, encompassing a wide range of economic, defense, government, social, and institutional facilities. The evolving list may lead to inefficient security policies and require more resources for protection. This fluid understanding could impact homeland security policy and necessitate increased attention from the federal government. The federal government is required to interact with critical infrastructure, maintain a database of vulnerabilities, integrate it with threat analyses, monitor incidents, and issue warnings. Allocating resources efficiently is crucial, but arbitrarily limiting the number of critical infrastructures due to resource constraints may miss dangerous vulnerabilities. Various private sector representatives emphasize the need for clear and stable definitions of asset criticality to avoid protecting too many or the wrong facilities, which could increase costs without security benefits and divert resources from other important uses. This is crucial as federal agencies consider implementing security regulations related to critical infrastructure. The ongoing efforts of DHS to define and prioritize critical and key assets in infrastructure security raise questions about how critical infrastructure identification fits into the nation's overall strategy. Congress may need to assess if asset criticality is clearly defined to ensure that increasing resources for security inspections by DHS officials are valuable. U.S. infrastructure security involves various groups, including federal agencies, industry associations, and asset owners, highlighting the importance of reviewing these processes. The oversight challenge for Congress lies in reviewing how large and small asset operators, as well as critical and non-critical asset owners, work together to achieve common security goals."
