Differences in data collection methods, exclusions, and the inclusion of temporary employees can lead to variations in statistics reported by sources like OPM and OMB. The federal workforce, consisting of 2.1 million civilian workers, is tracked by various federal agencies using different methodologies, including exclusions and frequency of data collection by OMB and OPM. One key methodological distinction is between \"full-time equivalents\" (FTEs) and on-board personnel, which can result in different workforce totals. FTEs are calculated based on total regular straight-time hours worked divided by compensable hours per fiscal year, with one FTE equivalent to 2,080 hours of work. This method can show discrepancies between the actual number of people and FTEs working the same total hours. The FTE employment numbers are used by OMB to manage employment in departments and agencies. Reporting requirements for FTE employment in the President's Budget are outlined in OMB Circular No. A-11. FTE data is published annually in the Budget of the United States Government. On-board employment is defined by OPM as the number of employees in pay status at the end of the quarter, providing employee headcount in most departments and agencies. OPM's Employment and Trends report and FedScope database provide on-board employment headcounts, including full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees. The number of on-board personnel can vary based on work schedules and specific counting dates. OPM is responsible for collecting and publishing data on federal employee headcounts. OPM collects and publishes data on the federal civilian workforce through the Enterprise Human Resources Integration-Statistical Data Mart (EHRI-SDM). This system provides access to personnel data for 96% of nonpostal federal civilian executive branch employees. Despite some exclusions, EHRI-SDM is considered the most comprehensive resource on the federal workforce, with over 100 data elements collected for each employee. FedScope website offers public access to this data. FedScope is a website providing public access to EHRI-SDM data on federal employees from 120 agencies. Data is categorized into cubes covering different subjects and time spans, including employment and accession details like age, gender, occupation, pay grade, and location. Employment data is published quarterly for the past eight fiscal years, with September data available from 1998 onwards. The FedScope website provides public access to EHRI-SDM data on federal employees from 120 agencies. The cubes cover various subjects like employment, accession, separation, employment trends, and diversity. These cubes contain data on the federal civilian workforce, including hiring, transfers, separations, and employment trends over the past 14 fiscal years. The diversity cube sorts data by ethnicity. The cubes on the FedScope website provide data on federal employees from 120 agencies, including employment, accession, separation, and diversity. The Diversity cube sorts data by ethnicity and race indicators for 13 categories of groups over the past eight years. Employment and Trends publication from OPM offers data on executive departments, independent agencies, and branches of government, with detailed statistical tables and information on workforce totals. The most recent resources available from OPM include the Common Characteristics of Government publication and the Sizing Up the Executive Branch report, which provide data on federal workforce totals, types of employment, and other relevant information. These reports offer insights into the executive branch's size and composition. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the largest component of the Executive Office of the President, reporting directly to the President. OMB assists executive departments and agencies in implementing presidential priorities and commitments. It produces the Budget of the United States, which includes federal employee statistics using the FTE counting method. The President's Budget is a comprehensive set of documents with detailed financial information on programs and appropriations accounts, including data on direct civilian FTEs. The President's Budget includes federal employee statistics using the FTE counting method. The Analytical Perspectives volume provides information on the federal workforce, including occupations, trends, education level, age distribution, and other factors. The Appendix volume typically includes an estimate of federal employment data. The President's Budget includes federal employee statistics using the FTE counting method. The Appendix volume provides estimates of agency FTEs based on the President's proposal and historical employment counts. The Historical Tables volume contains data on budget, receipts, outlays, deficits, and historical employment counts. These resources are valuable for Members and congressional staff, but users should be aware of differences in methodology and data collection frequency when using federal workforce statistics from these sources."
