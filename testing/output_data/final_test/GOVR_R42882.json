The global economy's uneven recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe present challenges. Developing countries also play a significant role in the global economy. The global economy is facing challenges due to uneven recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Developing countries, such as Brazil, India, and China, are gaining influence in the global economy. The U.S. economy is slowly recovering from its worst recession in eight decades, with productivity gains and moderate output expansion, but still struggling with high unemployment and a large federal debt. International economic tensions persist, including large U.S. trade deficits and rising foreign holdings of U.S. debt. The United States faces challenges such as a large trade deficit, foreign countries holding U.S. debt, and pressure on the dollar. To address this, there is a call for \"global rebalancing\" which involves increased saving, reduced spending, and a rise in net exports. Trade surplus countries would need to increase domestic demand and decrease saving. The 113th Congress may address trade policy issues such as reauthorization of trade promotion authority and implementing legislation for trade agreements like TPP, TTIP, and TISA. This could lead to changes in exchange rates and a fall in net exports. President Obama's National Export Initiative aims to double U.S. exports in five years to boost economic growth. Foreign demand is crucial due to consumer debt and fiscal deficits. Trade policy alone may not be enough to achieve this goal, requiring global economic growth and a competitive dollar. Global trade has slowed recently, with foreign country policies not aligning easily with U.S. priorities. The European Union and Japan are facing financial crises and slow growth, while rising economic powers are adopting less expansionist macroeconomic policies. Many countries are backtracking on trade liberalization despite U.S. efforts to open markets. Despite U.S. efforts to promote trade liberalization and open markets, the global economic recovery still relies on a balance of increased domestic investment and demand. Policy-driven currency misalignments and discussions about coordinated exchange rate policies highlight the need for reevaluating the role of international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank. Emerging economies are seeking a more equitable system to address global imbalances and potential threats of competitive currency devaluations. The current concern is the threat of competitive devaluations, particularly from China, which could increase trade tensions and hinder global economic stability. Globalization has led to transformative changes in the global economy, with advances in technology and lower trade barriers driving tremendous growth in trade, especially of intermediate goods. This has also contributed to rising incomes. Globalization has increased trade and economic growth, but also exposed U.S. firms to greater competition from lower-cost producers and state-owned enterprises. This may lead to costly adjustments for U.S. firms to remain competitive, potentially resulting in worker dislocation. Adjustments to remain competitive in an interconnected global economy may involve worker dislocation and shifts to production abroad, raising concerns over distributional issues. The debate now includes domestic and foreign macroeconomic policies, foreign state participation in markets, U.S. firms' competitiveness, value-chain implications, and financial stability. The overarching goal for the United States is to maintain its high standard of living while safeguarding stakeholders in a fast-changing global economy. The fast-changing global economy may lead to worker displacement and production shifts abroad, prompting the need for complementary domestic policies. Congress, with its constitutional mandate for overseeing international trade, is in a unique position to address new trade policy issues. The 113th Congress may focus on major international trade and finance issues, given its authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations. For the first 150 years of the United States, Congress set tariff rates on imported products, leading to debates between northern manufacturing regions supporting high tariffs and southern raw material exporting regions advocating for low tariffs. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 raised U.S. tariff rates, causing a decline in world trade during the Great Depression. Congress then delegated trade authority to the executive branch through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal agreements without additional legislation. The Trade Act of 1974 aimed at opening markets and addressing nontariff barriers, requiring congressional approval for changes in U.S. law. Congress has renewed and amended the 1974 Act multiple times, including granting trade promotion authority. Congress also oversees trade policy and enacts laws for trade programs. Congress plays a crucial role in overseeing trade policies, agreements, tariffs, nontariff barriers, and trade remedies. It also has authority over international investment, finance, bilateral investment treaties, and financial commitments to multilateral development banks. Additionally, Congress authorizes the activities of agencies like the Export-Import Bank and Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and has oversight responsibilities over institutions such as the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. During the first session of the 113th Congress, trade and trade policy issues were actively monitored, including potential trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). The second session may see legislative action on issues such as renewal of trade promotion authority (TPA) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). During the second session of the 113th Congress, trade issues such as renewal of trade promotion authority (TPA), Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), U.S.-China trade relations, international finance, export control regime review, Export-Import Bank reauthorization, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection reauthorization will be addressed amidst a globalizing economy and emerging economic powers. President Obama requested TPA reauthorization in July 2013. During the second session of the 113th Congress, trade issues such as renewal of trade promotion authority (TPA) will be addressed. TPA allows implementing bills for trade agreements to be considered under expedited legislative procedures, with limited debate and no amendments, to preserve Congress's role in considering implementing legislation for trade agreements requiring changes in domestic law. TPA has been renewed multiple times since first enacted in 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 renewed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) multiple times, with the latest expiration on July 1, 2007. TPA's special provisions for trade agreement implementing bills are seen as necessary for approving new agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Some argue TPA renewal is crucial for the US to be a credible negotiator in future trade agreements. The United States is engaged in negotiations with various countries and regions to establish trade agreements, including the TPP, TTIP, and TISA. Congress has not formally expressed new legislative objectives for trade agreements, despite efforts to renew TPA. Trade agreements aim to reduce barriers to trade and establish fair rules for international commerce. The TPP is a regional FTA that has evolved to include countries like the United States, Australia, Peru, and Vietnam. President Obama endorsed the negotiations in 2009, with Malaysia, Canada, Mexico, and Japan joining in subsequent years, increasing the economic significance of the potential agreement. The TPP is a significant trade agreement for the United States, with negotiations aiming to reduce trade barriers and create a high standard FTA. The participants are discussing new trade issues such as supply chain management and digital trade, with some aspects of the negotiations proving controversial. The TPP negotiations aim to create a high standard FTA, addressing controversial issues like market access, intellectual property protection, and environmental rights. Despite narrowing outstanding issues, a conclusion was not reached in 2013, with a possible agreement in early 2014. Congress must pass implementing legislation for the agreement to take effect in U.S. law. The World Trade Organization (WTO) administers trade rules and agreements negotiated by 160 parties, with the US playing a major role in its establishment in 1995. It succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947. The WTO Doha Round of negotiations began in 2001 but has been deadlocked. However, at the 9th Ministerial Conference in 2013, members agreed to trade facilitation, agriculture, and development measures. The WTO's 2013 accord includes trade facilitation, agriculture, and development measures. It imposes binding disciplines on trade processes to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, especially for developing countries. Wealthy donor countries and organizations have pledged funds to help least-developed countries implement reforms, but there is no obligation for member states to provide assistance. Members agreed to a compromise on food security issues, exempting food stockpiling programs from dispute settlement until a permanent solution is negotiated. They also agreed on provisions for tariff-rate quotas and the elimination of export subsidies. Additionally, a package of measures was agreed upon to enhance trade with least-developed countries, including simplified rules-of-origin, greater access to services markets, and duty-free, quota-free access. The WTO agreement in Bali included commitments to improve market access for least-developed countries, negotiate duty-free access, and develop a work program to complete the Doha Round. Persistent differences among major countries remain on issues like agriculture, tariffs, services, and trade remedies. The success of the Bali accord is seen as a positive step, but the momentum for broader agreement on the Doha Round agenda is uncertain. Work has also begun to expand WTO agreements beyond the Doha Round, involving 46 developed and advanced developing countries. Negotiations are ongoing for various trade agreements, including the TISA, GPA, and ITA. The TTIP is a proposed FTA between the US and EU to enhance trade disciplines and market access. The TTIP is a trade agreement between the US and EU aimed at reducing barriers to trade and investment. Negotiations began in 2013 with a focus on reducing tariffs, regulatory cooperation, government procurement, and new rules in various areas. Regulatory compatibility has been a contentious issue, but both parties aim to conclude negotiations in two years. TTIP is seen as a significant FTA involving the two largest advanced economies in the world. The TTIP is a trade agreement between the US and EU aimed at reducing barriers to trade and investment. It involves the two largest advanced economies in the world, representing a significant portion of global trade and GDP. Views on TTIP vary among stakeholders, with supporters seeing economic growth opportunities and job creation, while opponents are concerned about adverse effects on import-sensitive sectors and sovereignty issues. Congress has a direct interest in the negotiations as it establishes U.S. trade objectives. Negotiations for the TTIP trade agreement could be influenced by the renewal of Trade Promotion Authority. Congress may assess the impact of increased transatlantic trade on the US economy, compare TTIP with other trade agreements, and consider expanding it to include other countries. Services play a significant role in the US economy, accounting for a large portion of GDP and civilian employment. Services are crucial for the economy, acting as the \"lifeblood\" of transportation and financial sectors. Despite challenges like intangibility and direct contact requirements, advances in technology have made a wider range of services tradable globally. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) under the WTO addresses trade policy issues for various economic activities. The GATS under the WTO is the main set of rules for trade in services. Efforts to expand GATS have been hindered by stalled negotiations. To address this, a group of WTO members, led by the US and Australia, initiated talks in 2012 for a Trade in International Services Agreement (TISA). The US formally notified Congress in 2013 about engaging in negotiations for a plurilateral TISA. The objective is to enable US service providers to compete based on quality and competence. Negotiations for a Trade in International Services Agreement (TISA) began in 2013 to allow US service providers to compete based on quality and competence. The talks include various countries besides the US, with China expressing interest in joining. Members of Congress are interested in trade agreements that could impact important sectors like services. Since China's economic and trade liberalization in 1979, U.S.-Chinese economic ties have grown extensively. Total U.S.-China trade rose from $2 billion in 1979 to $536 billion in 2012, projected to increase to $555 billion in 2013. China is the United States' second-largest trading partner, largest source of imports, and third largest export market. China's large population and growing economy make it a huge market for U.S. exports, benefiting U.S. consumers with lower-cost imports. China is also crucial in the global supply chain for many U.S. companies, serving as a final point of assembly for their products. China's economic ties with the U.S. have grown extensively since 1979, with total trade reaching $536 billion in 2012. China serves as a crucial final point of assembly for many U.S. companies' products. Despite the growing commercial ties, the bilateral economic relationship is complex and often tense, with trade tensions stemming from China's state-directed policies that distort trade and investment flows, potentially undermining U.S. economic interests. This ongoing issue is a major focus for Congress. China's policies to promote domestic industries and reduce dependence on foreign technology have caused trade tensions with the United States. Despite China's denial of discrimination against foreign firms, many U.S. business leaders remain skeptical. U.S. firms have also faced pressure to establish production facilities in China. U.S. firms have complained about Chinese pressure to share proprietary technology and establish production facilities in China as a condition for market access. The Obama Administration has initiated WTO dispute settlement cases against Chinese industrial policies, including export subsidies and lack of protection for U.S. intellectual property rights. U.S. firms face significant challenges with intellectual property rights (IPR) in China, despite improvements in IPR protection. Piracy rates in China remain high, with concerns raised about cyber-attacks and theft of U.S. IPR. Studies estimate the annual cost of global IPR theft to the U.S. economy, with China accounting for a significant portion of those losses. The U.S. economy faces challenges with intellectual property rights in China, including high piracy rates and cyber-attacks. Reports by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence and Mandiant document extensive economic cyber espionage by Chinese actors, with alleged links to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. China's extensive cyber espionage campaign is supported by the government. President Obama warned about the economic impact of cyber security issues and theft of U.S. property. Critics accuse China of manipulating its currency to benefit exporters. Some U.S. policymakers argue that China's undervalued currency acts as a subsidy for Chinese exporters and hinders U.S. exports. China began to liberalize its currency policy in 2005, allowing the RMB to appreciate by 21% until halting it during the global financial crisis. The Chinese government halted RMB appreciation during the global financial crisis but allowed it to appreciate again in June 2010. The RMB has appreciated 12.2% against the dollar from June 2010 to November 2013. The Department of the Treasury reported in October 2013 that the RMB remained significantly undervalued. Several bills have been introduced to address China's currency policy, with some proposing increased tariffs on Chinese products. Supporters argue for pressure on China to adopt a more market-based currency regime, while opponents disagree. The US has been pressuring China to adopt a more market-based currency regime to rebalance its economy towards consumer demand. This involves policies to boost household incomes and reduce distortive government practices like maintaining an undervalued currency. Many economists argue that boosting Chinese domestic consumption and eliminating distortive economic policies would greatly increase China's demand for imports, promote greater competition, improve living standards, and reduce trade tensions with the United States. The 3rd Plenum of China's 18th Party Congress in 2013 resulted in the initiation of extensive new economic reforms, with the market now playing a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources. The 3rd Plenum of China's 18th Party Congress in 2013 initiated extensive economic reforms, with the market now playing a \"decisive\" role in resource allocation. Concerns have been raised over China's commitment to maintaining the dominance of the public ownership system and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The extent of China's economic reforms post-Plenum remains unclear. Treasury Secretary Lew noted China's \"ambitious agenda\" post-3rd Plenum, emphasizing the importance of the pace of change. Congress will closely monitor China's economic rise and trade relations with the U.S. Differing opinions exist on engaging with China, with some advocating for dialogue forums like S&ED and JCCT, while others suggest a mix of engagement and WTO dispute settlement procedures. China's perceived threat is also a point of contention. Some Members may press the Administration to boost efforts to induce China to abide more fully by its WTO commitments, including bringing more trade dispute settlement cases in the WTO. They may also introduce new bills that seek to address China's currency, industrial, and IRP protection policies. The federal government promotes U.S. exports and investments through providing finance and insurance programs administered by various agencies. Additionally, the Department of Commerce supports U.S. exports and inward investment through trade missions, advocacy, and market research. The National Export Initiative (NEI) is a broad-based framework for U.S. trade promotion and financing, aiming to double U.S. exports worldwide in five years. Some question whether this goal can be achieved as the NEI nears its end, while others believe it has elevated federal export promotion as a U.S. policy priority. The 113th Congress could oversee and legislate on issues related to federal trade, including targeted initiatives supporting trade and investment with specific regions and economic sectors. Congress could oversee and legislate on issues related to federal trade promotion, including the effectiveness of NEI and other initiatives to boost U.S. exports, funding adequacy, reorganization proposals, and policy options. Ex-Im Bank and OPIC are trade finance agencies whose authorities will expire in September 2014 unless renewed by Congress, providing support for U.S. exports and investment in developing countries. The Ex-Im Bank and OPIC are U.S. agencies with government backing to support U.S. businesses in competing against foreign companies. They are self-sustaining through fees and other sources, with Congress setting limits on their expenses and reauthorizing their authority. In 2012, legislation extended Ex-Im Bank's authority until September 30, 2014. In 2014, legislation increased Ex-Im Bank's lending authority to $140 billion and mandated more reviews of its operations. The 113th Congress may oversee the implementation of reauthorization requirements. Congress will likely debate renewing Ex-Im Bank's authority as its expiration date approaches. In contrast, OPIC was last reauthorized in 2003 and has been extended through annual appropriations. Some argue that the 113th Congress should consider reauthorizing OPIC to address broader policy issues. The 113th Congress may consider reauthorizing Ex-Im Bank and OPIC, weighing in on broader policy issues and deciding on the length of reauthorization. Congress could examine economic rationales, implications for the U.S. government, and alternative organizational structures for trade finance functions. Debates may arise on multi-year vs. shorter-term renewals for enhanced planning capacity and congressional oversight. Congress may consider broader issues related to U.S. economic competitiveness in the international context, examining trade finance disciplines and the role of agencies like Ex-Im Bank and OPIC in supporting U.S. policy goals. Legislative proposals have called for increased support for trade and investment with Africa. Congress has authorized the President to control exports for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons. The export of various items is controlled by separate programs and statutes for national security, foreign policy, and economic reasons. Licenses are required for exports under different programs administered by the Departments of Commerce, State, and Defense. Congress also legislates country-specific sanctions to address policy concerns. The Obama Administration initiated a review of the U.S. export control system in 2009. In the 113th Congress, balancing foreign policy and national security objectives with commercial interests may pose challenges. The U.S. export control system is undergoing a comprehensive review to create a single licensing agency, adopt a unified control list, integrate information technology systems, and establish a single enforcement coordination agency. The reform agenda is divided into three phases, with the final phase requiring legislative action. Efforts have been made to harmonize the Commerce Department's role in export control. Efforts have been made to harmonize the Commerce Control List (CCL) with the U.S. Munitions List (USML) through a category-by-category review and migration of less sensitive items. Congressional notification is required for items moved from the munitions list to the dual-use list. Rulemakings have transferred categories of USML items to the CCL, with changes to four categories in 2013. The President determined that transitioning certain satellites from the USML to the CCL was in the national interest. An Export Enforcement Coordination Center was established within the Department of Homeland Security. An integrated information technology system based on the Defense Department's USXports platform is being adopted by the Departments of State and Commerce. The 113th Congress may scrutinize this effort through oversight and may be asked to approve certain changes proposed by the Administration, including the creation and placement of the proposed licensing agency. Congress may also attempt to reauthorize or rewrite the currently expired Export Administration Act, the statutory basis of dual-use export controls. Economic sanctions may be defined as coercive economic measures taken against a target to bring about a change in policies. The United States applies trade and aid sanctions based on various factors like human rights, terrorism, and proliferation of weapons. Robust sanctions are in place against countries supporting terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and human rights violations. Bills introduced in Congress could impact relationships with Cuba, Brazil, Sudan, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. The United States' bilateral relationships with Cuba, Brazil, Sudan, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, and Pakistan are being influenced by Congress. Key issues being debated include weapons proliferation programs in Iran, North Korea, and Syria, rule of law matters in Russia, trade relations with Burma, and stability in the Sudan-South Sudan border region. Democracy in Egypt and nuclear proliferation by Iran are major concerns that Congress may address through legislation, impacting U.S. foreign policy and national security interests. Economic objectives, foreign policy interests, and political considerations shape U.S. policies on imports, with arguments for supporting freer trade and open markets. The case for supporting freer trade and open markets is based on the economic benefits it brings to participating countries. However, some industries and workers may be negatively impacted by import competition. International trade rules allow for temporary protection through \"trade remedies\" for groups affected by import surges or unfair imports. Congress is directly interested in trade remedy policies, trade preferences, border security, tariffs, and trade facilitation. Additionally, efforts to strengthen ties with developing countries may lead to more open policies and preferential access to the U.S. market. The United States and its trading partners use trade remedies to address the impact of unfair trade practices on domestic industries and workers. The most common U.S. trade remedies are antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguards, enforced by the Department of Commerce and the United States International Trade Commission. These remedies involve additional duties to offset dumping or subsidies. In safeguard cases, the remedy may include an import quota or tariff. WTO agreements impose obligations on member countries like the United States. Concerns in the 113th Congress include under-collection of AD and CVD duties, and China's currency intervention policy potentially being treated as a subsidy in CVD investigations. Congress has created six trade remedies since 1974. Since 1974, Congress has established six trade preference programs to assist developing countries, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), Andean Trade Preference Act (APTA), Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA), Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA), African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and Haitian Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act. These programs provide temporary duty-free access to the U.S. market for select exports from eligible countries, with regular oversight and authorization by Congress. The GSP and ATPA programs expired in 2013, with potential legislation for extension or revision in the 113th Congress. Colombia and Bolivia's statuses have changed, leaving Ecuador as the only beneficiary country. AGOA, set to expire in 2015, has garnered increased Congressional interest. Agency evaluations are being requested for the program's potential renewal. The potential reauthorization and reform of AGOA, a cornerstone of U.S.-Africa trade policy, may focus on two-way U.S.-Africa trade. AGOA is a non-reciprocal preference program that currently focuses on African exports to the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for ensuring smooth trade flow through U.S. ports of entry. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforces laws to protect consumers, collect customs revenue, and prevent illegal items from entering the country. Congress plays a role in organizing CBP's trade functions and may consider legislation to reauthorize and fund modernization efforts like the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) and the International Trade Data System (ITDS). Trade facilitation aims to improve the efficiency of international trade by harmonizing customs procedures and streamlining import processing for U.S. agencies. Multilateral efforts to streamline trade facilitation procedures were addressed at the 9th WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2013, with provisions including rules for advance customs rulings and expedited release for goods through air cargo facilities. Congressional oversight into CBP's efforts to enhance cargo security may also be considered as part of a possible CBP reauthorization bill. Cargo screening and importer requests for tariff suspension are key issues that may be addressed in the 113th Congress. Many Members of Congress introduce bills supporting importer requests to temporarily suspend tariffs on non-domestically-made components to reduce costs for domestic producers. This could become the focus of additional legislation, along with other trade facilitation efforts, in a possible CBP reauthorization bill. The United States Manufacturing Enhancement Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-227) expired on December 31, 2012. Legislation in the 113th Congress may propose to renew duty suspensions, enact new ones, or make procedural changes to the MTB process. Controversy may arise due to past congressional moratoriums on \"earmarks\" related to duty suspensions. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) was created in 1962 to help workers and firms adjust to trade liberalization. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) was created in 1962 to assist those affected by trade liberalization. It is seen as an alternative to import restrictions, providing aid while promoting freer trade. Critics debate TAA's effectiveness on equity, efficiency, and budgetary grounds. The Obama Administration and Democratic leaders viewed TAA renewal as crucial for passing free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Congress reauthorized TAA with bipartisan support (P.L. 112-40), extending programs for workers, firms, and farmers until December 31, 2013. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program was not reauthorized before January 1, 2014, causing it to revert to a more limited program. Some enhanced programs from a previous reauthorization were continued, including eligibility for services workers and firms, increased income support for workers in training, and expanded funding for training benefits. Funding was reduced for some aspects of the program. Senator Baucus introduced the Trade Adjustment Assistance Extension Act of 2013 (S. 1357) to extend and reauthorize TAA at current funding levels through 2020. President Obama supported TAA reauthorization linked to Trade Promotion Authority. International protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights are crucial in U.S. trade policy. The United States prioritizes intellectual property rights (IPR) in trade policy through various mechanisms like the WTO, FTAs, and domestic laws. IPR protection is a key focus in trade negotiations and oversight of implementation is important. Congress could review IPR commitments in FTAs with Colombia, South Korea, and Panama, as well as in current trade negotiations. The United States focuses on intellectual property rights (IPR) in trade policy through mechanisms like the WTO, FTAs, and domestic laws. Key issues in TPP negotiations include pharmaceutical patents and copyright enforcement. TTIP negotiations may involve pharmaceuticals, geographical indications, and digital concerns. The 113th Congress could monitor the resolution of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was negotiated by the United States and other developed countries outside of the WTO to address new intellectual property rights issues. Despite being concluded in 2010, the ACTA has not entered into force, but the United States is still working to bring it into effect. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows the U.S. International Trade Commission to block imports that infringe on U.S. intellectual property. In the 112th Congress, efforts were made to address jurisdictional issues related to holding foreign websites accountable for piracy and counterfeiting. The 113th Congress may revisit issues related to U.S. intellectual property protection and innovation, including concerns about CBP's enforcement of Section 337 exclusion orders. The United States is a major player in global foreign direct investment, highlighting the importance of international investment policies. Congress plays a role in shaping these policies to protect U.S. economic interests. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. foreign investment policy, with the President having discretionary authority to block investments that threaten national security. After 9/11, there were debates on the impact of foreign direct investment on the economy's structure and industrial capacity. In July 2007, Congress expanded its oversight role in foreign investment policy with the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-49). This law includes homeland security and critical infrastructure as components of national security to be considered in evaluating foreign investment transactions. The United States promotes international investment agreements to reduce restrictions and protect investor rights. The Obama Administration reviewed the U.S. Model BIT in 2012 to ensure foreign investment protection, investor-state arbitration, and balance U.S. policy interests. The 2012 Model BIT maintained core investor protections, clarified obligations for state-owned enterprises, limited performance requirements, and expanded transparency obligations. The Model BIT review in 2012 addressed foreign investment protection, investor-state arbitration, and transparency obligations. It may lead to concluding negotiations with countries like China and India, or launching new investment negotiations with other U.S. trading partners. Investment policy issues are significant in U.S. trade negotiations, including the proposed TPP and potentially in the TTIP negotiations. BITs are submitted to Congress as treaties. The 113th Congress may consider new BITs, TPP, and TTIP with investment chapters. U.S. investment policy focuses on attracting investment through programs like SelectUSA, which provides information and assistance to potential investors. President Obama announced a plan to enhance SelectUSA in 2013, making investment promotion a formal part of U.S. ambassadors' responsibilities. The 113th Congress may review funding levels and effectiveness of SelectUSA in supporting U.S. investment policy. The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) include the IMF and several multilateral development banks, of which the U.S. is a member. The United States is a member and major contributor to International Financial Institutions (IFIs) like the IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank. IFIs and the G-20 major economies played a key role in responding to the 2008 financial crisis by increasing lending to help developing countries. Efforts have shifted towards resolving the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis to maintain global economic stability. Congressional attention has focused on ensuring resources for IFIs to support macroeconomic stability and development mandates. The IMF's role in the stability and growth of the world economy has been a focus of recent congressional attention. Key areas of concern include the use of IMF resources since the 2008 global economic crisis, proposed governance changes, and the IMF's involvement in the Eurozone debt crisis. Three Eurozone countries are currently receiving IMF-budget support, and Congress is expected to continue oversight of events in Europe. Institutional reforms were agreed upon in December 2010 to increase the IMF's core funding and representation of major emerging market countries. Approval by the United States is crucial for these reforms to take effect. The United States controls 16.75% of the voting power in the IMF, requiring congressional authorization for any changes to its quota. Approval from the U.S. is crucial for IMF reforms, with tensions arising due to U.S. inaction. U.S. participation in MDB capital increases is seen as important due to its veto power as the largest shareholder. The Obama Administration supports capital increases at MDBs tied to policy reforms for transparency, accountability, and governance. Congress may evaluate effectiveness and future appropriations for MDBs. The G-20 is a forum for international economic cooperation with major economies like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, and China. The G-20 is a forum for international economic cooperation involving major economies like Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union. Discussions focus on economic and financial issues, with a rotating presidency held by different countries each year. Russia hosted the 2013 summit in St. Petersburg, where economic issues like trade, investment, jobs, financial regulation, and corruption were addressed. The G-20 forum, consisting of major economies, focuses on economic and financial issues. Foreign policy discussions, particularly on Syria, were prominent. Some analysts suggest a formal foreign policy track in the G-20, while others argue it may divert attention from key economic matters. The 113th Congress may oversee the Administration's G-20 participation. Australia assumed the G-20 presidency in December 2013. Australia assumed the G-20 presidency in December 2013 and is set to host the next summit in Brisbane in November 2014. The Eurozone has been facing an economic crisis since late 2009, with concerns about high levels of debt in countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Cyprus. This crisis has led to political turmoil and protests, as well as challenges in the banking system, slow growth, high unemployment, and trade imbalances within the Eurozone. The European Central Bank and Eurozone governments implemented policies to address the economic crisis in Europe. Market pressure decreased in 2013, with improvements seen in countries like Ireland. However, analysts warn that long-term challenges persist, including high debt levels and issues with growth and unemployment. Some believe the crisis is over, but others disagree. The Eurozone crisis has raised concerns about its impact on the U.S. economy, particularly through reduced demand for U.S. exports. Some Members of Congress question the IMF's role in providing loans to Eurozone countries like Greece and Ireland. Argentina's financial crisis in 2001 resulted in the largest sovereign debt default in history. After unsuccessful negotiations, Argentina made bond exchange offers in 2005 and 2010, accepted by 92% of creditors, leaving debt held by hedge funds and the Paris Club in default. This led to prolonged litigation with holdout creditors, judgments, and attachment orders. Argentina's policies have strained relations with foreign states and companies, including failure to pay judgments, nationalization of a Spanish-owned oil company, protectionist trade measures, and capital controls. The United States has taken financial actions against Argentina due to its reluctance to settle with U.S. stakeholders and failure to adhere to international economic norms. This includes suspension of GSP benefits, voting against loans in international banks, and denying bilateral aid. Previous congresses have introduced resolutions to condition Argentina's G-20 membership on adherence to economic norms and proposed legislation to pressure Argentina. There is disagreement on the best approach to address these issues. The legislation's effectiveness is questioned due to committee jurisdiction and pending federal court actions.
