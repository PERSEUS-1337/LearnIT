Congress finds that immigration and cultural diversity are key factors in defining American identity, with a significant number of citizens tracing their ancestry to immigrants. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a surge in immigration to the United States, particularly in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in New York City stands as a testament to the humble buildings that housed immigrants during that time. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in New York City is owned and operated as a museum dedicated to interpreting immigrant life in the neighborhood. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994 and found to be nationally significant by the National Park Service. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in New York City is suitable for inclusion in the National Park System to preserve immigrant life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, interpret tenement architecture, and enhance the interpretation of other national monuments in the area. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street on Manhattan Island in New York City is designated as a national historic site and is managed by the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. The Secretary of the Interior oversees this historic site. The Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in New York City is designated as a national historic site and affiliated with the National Park System. The site's operation and interpretation are coordinated with other national monuments related to the immigrant experience in the United States.

Financial and technical assistance can be provided for preservation-related improvements. A management plan will be developed to define roles and responsibilities for interpretation and preservation.
