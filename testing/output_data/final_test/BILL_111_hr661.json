    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that delaying the digital television transition will confuse people and jeopardize spectrum needed for public safety officials. The delay in the digital television transition could jeopardize spectrum needed for public safety officials and hinder broadband deployment, job growth, and economic stimulation. The coupon program for analog-to-digital converter boxes still has half of its funds remaining, leading to a waiting list for coupons. The coupon program for analog-to-digital converter boxes has a waiting list due to expiring coupons. The Commerce Department suggested resuming coupon distribution with additional funding. Industry has spent over $1 billion educating consumers about the digital transition. In November 2008, 93 percent of TV households were prepared for the digital transition. Approximately 83 percent had all their TVs ready. Only households relying on over-the-air antennas without a digital TV or converter box were at risk. Around 14.3 million households were exclusively over-the-air, with 13.5 million receiving coupons for converter boxes. Based on the data, around 800,000 over-the-air households still need coupons, with 600,000 on the waiting list. Allocating an extra $250 million should help them before the transition. Only 200,000 households might lose service, which is less than 2% of over-the-air households and less than 0.2% of all TV households, not a significant enough reason to delay the transition. The government and industry can assist households with coupons and converter boxes for the transition, but some may still be unprepared. Converter boxes cost $40 to $80, and households have other options for television service. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL COUPONS.\n\nAmends the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 to increase funding for coupons. Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to adjust funding for the transition.\n\nSEC. 3. EXPEDITING DELIVERY. SEC. 3. EXPEDITING DELIVERY.\n\nThe Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce will expedite coupon distribution via pre-sorted first class mail service until February 17, 2009. This may continue post that date if it improves redemption rates without affecting funds.\n\nSEC. 4. EXTENSION OF AUCTION AUTHORITY.\n\nAuction authority under the Communications Act of 1934 is extended from 2011 to 2012."
