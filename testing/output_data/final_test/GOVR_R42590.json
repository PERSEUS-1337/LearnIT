    "content": "President George W. Bush signed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) in 2006, which revamped the U.S. Postal Service to operate independently. The USPS is expected to function like a business while serving public purposes. The current financial struggles of the USPS have prompted the 112th Congress to consider major postal reforms, including service reductions and changes to pension and healthcare plans for postal employees. The USPS has faced significant financial losses, including a $25.4 billion loss between FY2007 and FY2011. Congressional action reduced a required payment to the Retirees Health Benefits Fund, preventing an additional $9.5 billion loss. In FY2012, the USPS had an operating loss of $6.4 billion, with a $6.1 billion charge for RHBF payments. The agency's debt has increased to $13 billion, with $11.1 billion due to the RHBF by the end of FY2012. The USPS lacks sufficient cash for these payments, with only $818 million in cash at the end of the second quarter of FY2012. The USPS had $818 million in cash, which is low considering its weekly operating expenses. There are concerns that the USPS may run out of cash by October 2012, but Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe believes operations can be maintained until late next year. Declining revenue and rising costs have led to recent deficits, with revenues falling 12.2% in the past five years due to a 20.9% decrease in mail volume. The USPS has seen a decline in mail volume and revenues in the past five years, leading to recent deficits. Despite downsizing its workforce, the agency's operating expenses still exceed revenues. The USPS relies on self-funding through postal service sales, with only minimal annual appropriations for specific purposes. The USPS has reduced its workforce by 21.9% to about 544,000 employees. It has increased productivity and reduced workhours, while also closing post offices and reducing operating hours. The agency may close 146 mail processing plants and eliminate overnight service for some mail categories to cut costs. Congressional assistance is needed to address financial problems, with requests to abolish the annual RHBF payment and move workforce off the FEHB program. The USPS is seeking to make significant changes including moving its workforce off the FEHB program, recalculating contributions to retirement systems, authorizing layoffs, allowing price increases, and offering more products and services. Postal reform bills like H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 have made progress in Congress. H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 are postal reform bills that have progressed towards enactment. Representative Darrell E. Issa introduced H.R. 2309 in 2011, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman introduced S. 1789 in 2012. The House and Senate committees reported amendments to the bills, with the Senate passing S. 1789 in April 2012. H.R. 2309 includes the establishment of a base realignment-type commission. H.R. 2309 would establish a commission to reduce USPS's annual facilities costs by $3 billion, with $1 billion from retail facilities and $2 billion from mail processing plant closures. It also allows for non-mail delivery days and a transition to five-day mail delivery. Additionally, it would create a financial authority in case of USPS default. The proposed financial authority under H.R. 2309 would be appointed by the President to advise the USPS for two years, with the power to take control if deficits persist. It would require USPS to shift 75% of deliveries to curbside or centralized boxes and develop a budget for annual surpluses within two years. Additionally, the authority could revise the workers' compensation program to move injured employees of retirement age onto retirement. The proposed financial authority under H.R. 2309 would revise the workers' compensation program to move injured employees of retirement age onto retirement benefits, transfer the $11 billion FERS overpayment to the USPS, control employee compensation costs, increase postage rates for some mail classes, end annual appropriations to the USPS, and reduce the USPS's FY2011 RHBF payment. The USPS's FY2011 RHBF payment would be reduced from $5.5 billion to $1.0 billion, with FY2015 and FY2016 payments increased by $2.25 billion each year. H.R. 2309 is estimated to save about $20 billion over 2012-2022, mainly from allowing five-day mail delivery. S. 1789 would transfer the $11 billion FERS overpayment to the USPS for employee incentives and compensation costs. The USPS's RHBF costs would be reduced over 10 years by implementing a 40-year amortization schedule. The bill also allows the USPS to negotiate with unions for its own health plan, requires arbitrators to consider USPS's financial condition, prohibits service standard revisions to slow mail delivery for three years, and limits USPS's authority to close mail processing facilities. The bill requires the USPS to consider various factors before closing post offices, develop retail service standards, and imposes a one-year moratorium on rural post office closures. The bill S. 1789 requires the USPS to consider multiple factors before closing rural post offices, including surveying affected customers and assessing the impact on community access to essential services. The USPS must also ensure that communities continue to have access to essential items before closing a post office. The bill S. 1789 requires the USPS to consider multiple factors before closing rural post offices, including surveying affected customers and assessing the impact on community access to essential services. The Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) would have the power to reverse a rural post office closure. Additionally, the bill prohibits the USPS from moving to five-day mail delivery until two years after enactment, with restrictions on reducing mail delivery days. The USPS would also be allowed to offer nonpostal products and services with approval from the PRC. The bill S. 1789 requires USPS approval from the PRC for new nonpostal products or services to avoid unfair competition. It also allows USPS to contract with state agencies, deliver alcohol, and adjust postage rates. The CBO estimates that enactment of S. 1789 would result in $11.7 billion in net costs to the unified budget between FY2012 and FY2022. Congress has imposed mandates on USPS appropriations since 1982, such as maintaining six-day mail delivery and conducting studies before closing mail processing plants. The Senate Appropriations Committee's FSGG bill for FY2013 would continue six-day mail delivery and prevent certain mail closures. The House Appropriations Committee approved legislation to require the USPS to maintain six-day delivery in FY2013 and prevent the closure of certain mail processing facilities before FY2014. President Obama's FY2013 budget proposes changes to postal law, including returning USPS's FERS overpayment in two installments and restructuring RHBF payments. The USPS is facing financial challenges and has proposed reforms to improve its condition, including increasing collaboration with state and local governments, aligning postage costs with mail delivery costs, and implementing a 1.8% price increase. These reforms could provide over $25 billion in cash relief over two years and save $25 billion over 11 years. H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 incorporate some of these proposals to address the USPS's short-term liquidity crisis and long-term structural deficit. The USPS is facing financial challenges due to a liquidity crisis and long-term structural deficit. To address these issues, Congress needs to improve liquidity, fortify long-term revenues, control long-term costs, and maintain universal postal service. H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 propose provisions to achieve these objectives, with H.R. 2309 offering more immediate liquidity and S. 1789 focusing on long-term revenue improvements. H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 propose measures to address USPS financial challenges. H.R. 2309 aims to cut costs by reducing delivery days and closing facilities, while S. 1789 focuses on reducing annual RHBF outlays and employee cohort. Both bills aim to reduce operating costs by cutting employment expenses. Both H.R. 2309 and S. 1789 aim to reduce USPS operating costs by cutting employment expenses. H.R. 2309 focuses on immediate cost-cutting measures like reducing delivery days and closing facilities, while S. 1789 proposes incremental reforms while maintaining current postal services levels."
