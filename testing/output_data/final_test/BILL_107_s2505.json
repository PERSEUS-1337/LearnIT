    "content": "The \"Cultural Bridges Act of 2002\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to cultural connections. Congress finds that educating international students, especially from the Islamic world, is crucial for promoting cross-cultural understanding and goodwill for the United States. There is a significant underrepresentation of students from the Islamic world among the 500,000 international students studying in the US annually. The exchanges between the US and the Islamic world are low compared to other regions, despite their effectiveness in building people-to-people ties. The Future Leaders Exchange Program for high school students from the former Soviet Union has shown success in this regard. The Future Leaders Exchange Program, administered by the Department of State, has shown the positive impact of engaging international students at the secondary school level, introducing them to American culture, and promoting democratic values. Increasing mutual understanding and respect between the US and the Islamic world is crucial in the fight against terrorism. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. \"From the Islamic world\" pertains to individuals from countries in the Islamic world or with ties to the West Bank or Gaza. The term \"Islamic world\" includes member countries of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, excluding observer countries. The term \"United States sponsoring organization\" refers to a non-governmental organization with US citizenship designated by the Secretary to carry out a program authorized under section 5(a) of the Act. The Act aims to promote national security through educational and cultural exchanges between the US and the Islamic world, providing opportunities for students to study in the US, fostering mutual respect, and enhancing mutual understanding for a more peaceful world. Additionally, a new exchange visitor program for secondary school students from the Islamic world is established. The Secretary is authorized to establish an international exchange visitor program for eligible secondary school students from the Islamic world to attend a public secondary school in the US, live with an American host family, and participate in activities promoting understanding of American and Islamic values and culture. The program will be implemented through the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. Eligibility criteria for foreign students in the international exchange visitor program include being from the Islamic world, aged 15 to 18 and 6 months, enrolled in secondary school, having completed up to 11 years of education, and demonstrating maturity and scholastic aptitude. The program authorized for secondary school student exchange in the United States requires eligible students to not have participated in a similar program before and must meet certain academic criteria. Sponsoring organizations must recruit students based on guidelines ensuring diversity. The program for secondary school student exchange in the United States emphasizes diversity in geographic, gender, and socio-economic aspects. English language proficiency is assessed through standardized testing, with additional training provided if needed. Preference is given to full academic year exchanges, and participants must comply with \"J\" visa requirements. The program for secondary school student exchange in the United States must meet requirements for nonimmigrant aliens under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Sponsoring organizations are required to report regularly to the Secretary on information obtained from students, host families, and schools. The Secretary is authorized to establish new educational and cultural exchange programs involving persons from the Islamic world, excluding certain countries listed in the Freedom Support Act. SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary must submit a report within 3 months of the Act's enactment to congressional committees outlining plans for implementation. This includes identifying priority countries in the Islamic world, estimating student participation, listing US sponsoring organizations, and providing a schedule for program implementation.
