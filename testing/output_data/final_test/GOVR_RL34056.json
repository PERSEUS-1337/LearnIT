In 1991, President Bush restored Mongolia's most-favored-nation trading status, which became permanent in 1999. Mongolia transitioned to a democratic government in 1990 with U.S. assistance, experiencing government reshufflings since then. The report provides background information on Mongolia, including political and economic conditions, U.S.-Mongolian relations, and key security issues. Mongolia gained independence in 1921 with Soviet support after being part of the Chinese empire. The Communist MPRP ruled for almost 70 years until public demonstrations in 1990 led to a transition to a democratic government. Several government reshufflings occurred, with the MPRP winning a majority in 2008-2009. Mongolia transitioned from a one-party Communist state to a parliamentary democracy in 1991. The country has been working to improve its legal and financial institutions, but government corruption remains a significant issue. Despite passing a land ownership law in 2002, the enforcement of laws protecting private property is limited. Mongolia's legislative processes are still developing, with the State Great Hural passing measures in 2004 to give parliamentary committees separate budgets and staff. The formerly communist MPRP continues to hold a dominant political role despite the official demise of Communism in 1990. In 1990, Mongolia's formerly communist MPRP won 80% of parliament seats and elected P. Ochirbat as the first president. The MPRP maintained control until 1994 when Ochirbat lost party support and won as an opposition candidate. In 1996, the first effective opposition challenged the MPRP's long rule in parliamentary elections. The \"Democratic Union,\" formed by a coalition of eight opposition parties, achieved a stunning electoral victory in the 1996 Mongolian parliamentary elections, ending the MPRP's 75-year rule. With 91% voter turnout, the Democratic Coalition won 50 out of 76 seats, gaining majority in parliament and the support of President Ochirbat. The victory was attributed to help from U.S. political strategists and study of American political devices. Economic issues, political reform, and foreign relations were key campaign topics. In the 1996 election campaign, foreign relations were a major focus. The MPRP offered no clear solutions for Mongolia's political issues or international relations, leading to their downfall. In contrast, the Democratic Union coalition had specific policies such as transparency in government, privatization of state-owned media, pension plans, salary increases for teachers, and judicial reform. They also emphasized friendship with the West, particularly the United States.

Bagabandi had to give up his parliamentary seat to become president, which was then won by MPRP member Nambaryn Enkhbayar. Political analysts saw Bagabandi's election as a symbol of public frustration over economic reforms imposed after the 1996 elections to cope with the collapse of Soviet subsidies.

In 1998, Mongolia faced political turmoil with Prime Minister Enkhsaikhan resigning and being replaced by Tsakhiagiyn Elbegdorj, who later resigned after a no-confidence vote for allowing a bank merger. The MPRP criticized the merger decision, leading to a power struggle with President Bagabandi over the appointment of a new Prime Minister. The Democratic coalition government faced scandals and collapsed in 2000, paving the way for the MPRP to win a majority in parliamentary elections. Nambaryn Enkhbayar became the leader of the MPRP. In December 2000, remnants of the former Democratic coalition merged to form the Democratic Party (DP). President Bagabandi was re-elected in May 2001. In the 2004 parliamentary elections, the Motherland Democracy Coalition (MDC) won 34 seats to the MPRP's 38. A coalition government was formed with DP leader Elbegdorj as Prime Minister. The government faced challenges of unemployment, corruption, and factional differences, leading to popular disillusionment. In May 2005, Nambaryn Enkhbayar of the MPRP won the presidency with 53.4% of the vote, leading to the collapse of the government in January 2006 due to ineffective governance and public support loss. The resignation of all 10 MPRP cabinet members sparked protests in the capital, with accusations of government corruption and power seizure attempts. Miyeegombo Enkhbold was chosen as the new leader by the parliament on January 25, 2006. In January 2006, Miyeegombo Enkhbold became the new Prime Minister after the collapse of the government. The Democratic Party declined to join a \"national unity\" government and instead acted as opposition.

Demonstrations erupted after the elections, leading to a state of emergency declaration. In July 2008, election results were upheld but contested by the Democratic Party, leading to a state of emergency in the capital. The newly elected parliament was sworn in on August 26, 2008, forming a fragile coalition government. Sanjaaglin Bayar was elected as the new prime minister, known for favoring economic reforms.
