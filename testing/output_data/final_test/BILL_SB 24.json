    "title": "SB 24",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code applies to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans. Compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and California Constitution is required for administration. The article excludes certain entities and public employees from its application, protecting their existing retirement plans until specified conditions are met. The article excludes certain public employees from its application if the Secretary of Labor determines it precludes certification under Title 49. Additionally, the article does not apply to a multiemployer plan regulated by ERISA if the public employer joined before January 1, 2013. The benefit plan applies to new members as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and who switch to a new public employer after that date, will be under the retirement plan of the new employer if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity within the previous six months. This is governed by specific provisions outlined in various sections of the law. An individual employed before January 1, 2013, who changes positions within the same employer and moves to a different retirement plan will be subject to the new plan as if they were first employed before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower benefit factor before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new plan after January 1, 2013, it must conform to certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the new plan. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a formula approved by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they may continue to do so. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the retirement system's chief actuary, board, and the Legislature. New members can only join the defined contribution plan in place before January 1, 2013, or a plan that meets the article's requirements. The subdivision does not prohibit an employer from offering a defined contribution plan on or after January 1, 2013, with or without a defined benefit plan, regardless of previous offerings. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they may offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before joining the authority. This applies to employees from the City of Brea, City of Fullerton, or other specified cities who are not new members and are hired by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the city exercising a common power. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members joining after January 1, 2013, must adhere to the requirements of the defined benefit plan. If the Belmont Fire Protection District, Estero Municipal Improvement District, and City of San Mateo form a joint powers authority, employees may receive the same defined benefit plan as before, within 180 days of the joint powers authority being established. The formation of a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, must not exempt new employees or members from the requirements of the article. New members can only participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the article. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System is not required to adopt certain benefit formulas or compensation limitations. The article does not provide membership in a public retirement system for ineligible individuals. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013. The Legislature deems a special law necessary to clarify benefit eligibility rules under the California Public Employees\u2019 Pension Reform Act of 2013 and maintain its integrity and purpose."
