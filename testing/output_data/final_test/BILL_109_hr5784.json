The United States and the Caribbean have strong relations, with the Caribbean being an important trade partner. The region was negatively impacted by a decrease in tourism after 9/11. A 2005 World Bank Report highlighted high unemployment rates, especially among youth, leading to poverty and drug issues. The report also emphasized the need for better alignment between Caribbean education and job market demands. Many Caribbean leaders emphasize the importance of increased educational opportunities for students to address crime and economic challenges. Enhancing cultural and educational exchange programs with the United States can improve regional security by expanding human resources and promoting economic growth. Numerous Caribbean leaders have studied in the US before returning to contribute to democracy, the economy, or social services. (9) From 2003 to 2005, 217 Caribbean leaders participated in US exchange programs focusing on governance, drug trafficking, anti-corruption, and regional issues. The Department of State runs public outreach programs in the Caribbean, including cultural and academic exchanges. In some countries, the US Agency for International Development coordinates the Center of Excellence for Teacher Training, emphasizing teacher training for a competitive workforce. In the Caribbean, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs sponsors educational advisors to promote study in the United States, with approximately 14,000 Caribbean students enrolled in US universities in the 2004-2005 academic year. The Act aims to create educational initiatives for the Caribbean, including an exchange program and teacher training. The Secretary will ensure no duplication of efforts and credible partnerships. The Secretary of State can establish the Shirley Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Program for Caribbean students to attend schools in the US, learn about US culture, and stay with host families. Additionally, Caribbean scholars can attend colleges in the US under this program. The Shirley Chisholm United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Program allows Caribbean students to attend US colleges, engage in cultural activities, and live with host families. At least 75% of participants must be from CARICOM member countries. The Secretary will collaborate with Caribbean counterparts to create similar opportunities for US students and scholars. Collaboration with US agencies is also required for program development. The cooperating agencies involved in the Program are eligible for federal funding and can seek assistance from private donors. They may offer scholarships based on merit and need to eligible participants from the United States and the Caribbean. The Administrator will develop a program to enhance education in the Caribbean by providing teacher training and increasing community involvement in schools. Funding may be solicited from private sources for implementation. Reporting requirements are also specified. SEC. 9. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\nThe Secretary must submit an initial report within three months of the Act's enactment detailing plans for implementing sections 6 and 7, including the number of participating students, cooperating agencies, and a schedule for the program.
