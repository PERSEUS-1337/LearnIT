    "title": "AB 888",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature of California enacts Chapter 5.9, Plastic Microbeads Nuisance Prevention Law, to address the environmental and health hazards of plastic pollution. Plastic does not biodegrade but photodegrades into smaller pieces causing pollution. Microplastics in the marine environment are ingested by marine organisms. Microplastics, including PAHs, PCBs, and PBDEs, attract harmful pollutants and transfer to fish tissue when ingested. Fish consumed by humans have been found to ingest microplastics, which are then consumed by humans. Personal care products like facial scrubs contain microplastics that are not recoverable through wastewater treatment and can be released into the environment. Plastic microbeads found in US surface waters and marine life. Alternatives like biodegradable materials exist in personal care products. Definitions of \"person\" and \"personal care product\" provided. On January 1, 2020, the sale of personal care products containing plastic microbeads for exfoliation or cleansing in rinse-off products will be prohibited in California. Exceptions apply for products with plastic microbeads less than 1 part per million by weight. Violators may face injunctions in court. A person who violates Section 42362 may face a civil penalty of up to $2,500 per day for each violation, in addition to any other penalties. The court will consider various factors when assessing the penalty, including the nature of the violation, the number and severity of violations, and the economic impact on the violator. Good faith efforts to comply and the deterrent effect of the penalty will also be taken into account. Other relevant factors may also be considered for justice. Actions under this section can be initiated by the Attorney General, district attorney, city attorney, or city prosecutor. Civil penalties collected will be paid to the respective office that brought the action. This chapter does not change existing legal obligations and any penalties imposed are in addition to those already prescribed by law."
