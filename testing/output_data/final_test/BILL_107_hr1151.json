The Voting Opportunity Through Technology and Education Act of 2001 establishes voluntary accessibility standards for polling places and voting equipment. The Office of Election Administration must revise and expand voting system standards to include accessibility standards for all individuals, including the elderly and individuals with disabilities. The Office of Election Administration must consult with officials and organizations to develop revised and expanded accessibility standards for polling places and voting systems. The standards will be posted on the Internet for public dissemination. The Office of Election Administration will serve as a clearinghouse of information on the accessibility of voting systems, equipment, and polling places for the elderly and individuals with disabilities. Additionally, a grant program will be established to promote accessibility in voting activities. After revised voting system standards are issued, the Federal Election Commission will provide grants to eligible States to ensure compliance and promote accessibility for elderly and individuals with disabilities in voting systems and facilities. States must submit an application outlining planned activities to receive a grant. The State must describe activities to be carried out with grant funds, ensure compliance with revised voting system standards, and provide additional information as required by the Commission. Funds can be used for educational activities to educate poll workers, election officials, and voters on accessible voting technology. Each State must report as required by the Commission. The Commission requires States receiving grants to submit reports on activities funded, with details as needed. The Commission will operate through its Office of Election Administration. Appropriations are authorized for grants and administrative expenses for fiscal years 2002-2005. The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act is revised to ensure no citizen is denied the right to vote due to age or disability. Reporting requirements are restored, effective from 2002."
