    "content": "The House and Senate have rules to separate money and policy decisions, stemming from the principle that government activities and funding should be distinct. Authorizations establish government entities, while appropriations provide budget authority. Legislative provisions and appropriations must align with authorized purposes. These rules were established in the mid-1800s to address delays in enacting appropriations. The House and Senate have rules dating back to the mid-1800s to prevent delays in enacting appropriations by separating money and policy decisions. House Rule XXI and Senate Rule XVI prohibit legislative provisions in appropriations bills unless germane to existing law. Enforcement is through points of order on the House and Senate floor. Limitation provisions within appropriations measures negatively restrict the use of funds without changing existing law. They cap or deny funds for specific purposes, different from legislative provisions. These limitations define the purposes for which budget authority may not be used without affecting recipient discretion under other laws. Limitation provisions in appropriations bills restrict fund use without changing existing law. Congress can specify purposes for which funds are not to be used, even if previously authorized. The distinction between legislative provisions and funding limitations has been refined over time. Limitation provisions in appropriations bills restrict fund use without changing existing law. Recent parliamentary determinations have focused on principles related to new duties, agency discretion, and actions contrary to law. The goal is to clarify the legislative process regarding limitations in appropriations. The report clarifies the legislative process for including limitations in appropriations bills, discussing procedural contexts, forms of limitations allowed, challenges in structuring limitations, and the burden of proof for proponents. The report discusses the legislative process for including limitations in appropriations bills, highlighting examples of proper and improper limitations. Precedents regarding limitations are more numerous in the House than the Senate due to the lack of specific rules in the Senate. The Senate occasionally allows legislative language in appropriations acts if deemed germane by a majority of Senators. Senate has relied on House precedents for defining acceptable limitations in the past. The report relies on House precedents to define proper limitation provisions in appropriations bills, noting differences between the House and Senate approaches. It does not cover every ruling or contingency and mentions the use of unanimous consent agreements and special rules to set aside chamber rules. The House and Senate parliamentarians advise presiding officers on limitations in appropriations. Rules are enforced during floor consideration of appropriations, encouraging separation of policy and money decisions. Chambers differ in procedural approach regarding limitations and legislative provisions. The House and Senate differ in procedural approach regarding limitations and legislative provisions in appropriations. House rules allow appropriations bills to be brought directly to the floor or through a special rule waiving points of order. The House rules govern the consideration of appropriations measures and amendments, with restrictions on legislative provisions in appropriations bills. Legislative language in appropriations bills can be stricken by a point of order during floor consideration. Amendments containing legislative language are not allowed in general appropriations bills. During floor consideration, amendments with legislative language, even if structured as limitations, are not allowed and can be challenged by a point of order. These points of order must be raised by a Member to trigger a ruling from the chair. Separate procedures exist for limitation amendments, which can be offered during consideration in the Committee of the Whole. Limitations not in existing law are not allowed while the bill is being read for amendment. During floor consideration, limitations in amendments are restricted. The majority leader can preempt new limitations by offering a motion to rise and report, which ends further consideration of amendments. Special rules for appropriations measures can also affect limitation amendments by waiving points of order. Open rules allow for the offering of amendments during consideration. Clause 2(c) and 2(d) of Rule XXI allow for open rules permitting amendments during floor consideration in the Committee of the Whole. Limitation amendments can be offered once the bill has been read for amendment, and can also be included in amendments made in order by a structured rule. \"Self-executing\" provisions in special rules can automatically adopt a limitation amendment upon passage. Clause 5(b) of Rule XXII prohibits House conferees from agreeing to Senate amendments violating Rule XXI. Special rules can waive points of order related to this clause in conference reports. Rules waive points of order related to legislative language in conference reports on the House floor. Senate Rule XVI addresses appropriations legislation but does not specify limitations, except that they cannot be contingent. Points of order can be raised against legislative language in general appropriations bills, but such provisions can be allowed as amendments if they are germane to House-passed legislative language in the bill. The presiding officer determines if there is any House language that the amendment could be germane to before ruling on the point of order. The Senate allows amendments to be considered if they are germane to House-passed legislative language in the bill, with a majority vote needed to determine germaneness. Limitation amendments can be offered at any point during floor consideration of appropriations measures. Limitation amendments can be offered at any point during appropriations measures in the Senate, with two forms commonly proposed: a total ban on fund use for a specific purpose or a \"not to exceed\" limit on fund usage. Limitation amendments in appropriations bills can include restrictions on fund usage, such as a total ban on funding for specific purposes or setting \"not to exceed\" limits on fund usage. These limitations can impact policy by specifying where federal funds cannot be used or placing maximum spending limits in certain areas. Previous allowances have included prohibitions on funding for specific activities, recipients, and earmarks, as well as establishing funding ceilings for certain activities or total amounts. Limitations in appropriations bills can restrict fund usage, including bans on funding for specific purposes or setting spending limits. Previous allowances have included prohibitions on funding for certain activities and recipients, as well as establishing funding ceilings. An example is a House floor amendment prohibiting funding for a specific rule in the FY1944 Independent Offices Appropriations Act. The engineers' reports shall be mandatory for the sale of oil and gas royalties and leases under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A provision may prevent funds from being spent on certain regulations, as seen in a House amendment to the FY1980 Treasury Appropriations Act. Limitations on funds have been used to prevent agency rulemaking and other specified activities. For example, a House amendment to the FY1974 Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act prohibited funding for the development or construction of a reusable space transportation system or space shuttle. The House amendment to the FY1981 Treasury and Postal Service Appropriations Act limited federal funds from being used for health plans with abortion coverage for federal employees after a certain deadline. An 1896 House precedent allows limitations on appropriations based on recipient qualifications. The ability to prohibit funds for certain recipients based on qualifications has been used in various ways, such as a Senate amendment to the FY1955 State, Judiciary, and Commerce Appropriations Act. This includes limitations on funds for individuals or recipients with specific characteristics, as seen in a House amendment to the FY1973 Labor, and Health, Education, and Welfare Act. The House amendment to the FY1973 Labor, and Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act restricted funds for government suppliers exceeding compensation limits for their employees. It also limited funds for salaries of individuals involved in specific actions, as shown in a House amendment to the FY1943 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act. In FY2007, an attempt was made to cancel earmarked spending for dairy education in Iowa by inserting a provision in the appropriations act. In FY2007, an attempt was made to cancel earmarked spending for dairy education in Iowa by inserting a provision in the appropriations act. The Senate committee report recommended $100,000 for a farm-raised catfish grading system, but an amendment was proposed to prevent the expenditure of these funds. The House amendment to an Interior appropriations bill for FY1943 aimed to limit funds for specific activities related to journal article reproduction and procurement, with a $100,000 budget reduction. Restrictions on fund availability have been commonly used to cap expenditures for certain purposes. The bill includes provisions to limit the total amount to be spent on printing, binding, and other reproduction services to $450,000. Any unspent funds within this limit will be returned to the Treasury. Limitations are also placed on the amount of funds that can be spent on specific services or from certain sources. The Act limits funds for naval vessel repair to $646,704,000. Similar limitations have been used before to specify maximum spending amounts for authorized purposes. For example, funds for passenger-carrying vehicles were capped at $45,000 under the Federal Highway Act. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on expenditures under appropriations acts, including a specific example from the FY1954 Mutual Security Administration appropriations bill. It mentions a ceiling on total aggregate net expenditures of all agencies not exceeding $5,500,000,000. This type of limitation provision can also set a cap as a percentage of the amount appropriated. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on expenditures under appropriations acts, including \"not to exceed\" restrictions and restrictions on transfer authority. An example is provided from the FY1950 Treasury and Post Office Appropriations Act, where 95 percent of funds provided by appropriations shall not be exceeded. Another example is from the FY1951 Labor and Federal Security Agency appropriations bill, where only 5 percent of any appropriation can be transferred. Additionally, more general bans on transfers have been achieved through limitation provisions, as seen in a House amendment to the FY1974 Treasury appropriations bill. The House and Senate distinguish between limitations and legislative provisions in appropriations acts. Limitations must be phrased as negative prohibitions and can only prohibit funding for activities, not the activities themselves. An example of a proper limitation is the House amendment to the FY1965 Defense Appropriations Act. The House and Senate distinguish between limitations and legislative provisions in appropriations acts. Limitations must be phrased as negative prohibitions and can only prohibit funding for activities, not the activities themselves. An example of a proper limitation is the House amendment to the FY1965 Defense Appropriations Act. The evaluation of a provision as legislative or a proper limitation is based on principles such as the scope of the provision, whether it waives current law and agency discretion, imposes new duties on a government official or agency, and if funding is provided based on a contingency. Limitations in appropriations acts must be phrased as negative prohibitions and only apply to the funds in the pending measure for a specific period. If a limitation extends beyond the bill, it becomes legislative in nature. The House and Senate consider factors like the scope of the provision and impact on existing law to determine admissibility. The amendment sought to restrict funds for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board from being used for relocation or supervision outside of Greensboro, North Carolina. The point of order against the amendment was sustained as it exceeded the scope of the appropriations bill. The chair sustained a point of order against a provision in the Foreign Assistance Act that could be seen as limiting funds beyond the appropriations bill. An example was given of a House amendment restricting Army funds for real estate purchases. The chair sustained a point of order on an amendment regarding Indian schools' appropriations, as it violated the scope principle by being permanent legislation and applying to all appropriations, not just those in the bill itself. The amendment offered during House consideration of the FY1938 District of Columbia Appropriations Act, which prohibited funding for advertising in newspapers outside of the District of Columbia, was deemed out of order as it would have waived a requirement of existing law. Limitations on appropriations can restrict funds but cannot change an agency's authority under current law. The House Practice and Deschler's Precedents explain that appropriations cannot grant new discretionary authority or curtail executive discretion. Limitations on appropriations cannot expand the authority of an official or agency beyond what is currently authorized by law. For example, an amendment to the FY1950 Military Establishment Appropriations Act was deemed improper for attempting to change existing law. The FY1950 Military Establishment Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for repair, purchase, or acquisition of naval vessels from private contractors if the work can be done in government shipyards without significant cost increase, unless it is deemed advantageous for national defense. The FY1950 Military Establishment Appropriations Act prohibits using funds for repair, purchase, or acquisition of naval vessels from private contractors if government shipyards can do the work without significant cost increase, unless it is advantageous for national defense. The point of order against an amendment was sustained as it would grant the Secretary authority beyond current law. Proper limitations on appropriation bills may impose some extra duties on federal officials. The FY1950 Military Establishment Appropriations Act prohibits using funds for repair, purchase, or acquisition of naval vessels from private contractors if government shipyards can do the work without significant cost increase, unless it is advantageous for national defense. Proper limitations on appropriation bills may impose some extra duties on federal officials. When an amendment places new duties on officers of the government, it assumes the character of legislation and is subject to a point of order ruling. The House amendment to the FY1960 Defense appropriations bill is an example of a proper limitation, restricting funds from being used to contract with retired military officers within 5 years of service. The House amendment to a FY1980 supplemental appropriations bill imposes limitations on the use of funds for trade readjustment benefits for certain retired or inactive military members. The point of order on this amendment was overruled as the duties were deemed incidental. The House amendment to a FY1980 supplemental appropriations bill imposes limitations on the use of funds for trade readjustment benefits under the Trade Act of 1974. The point of order on this amendment was overruled as the determinations required were deemed to be the same as those required by existing law. The House amendment to the FY1974 Departments of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act imposed limitations on funds for local educational agencies. The point of order was sustained due to the requirement of making a new distinction between children whose parents work within certain school districts and those who work outside. Such limitation provisions that impose new duties not required by existing law are not allowed. The House amendment to the FY1982 Labor and Health and Human Services appropriations bill imposed limitations on grant funding for businesses, unions, and trade associations. The point of order was sustained because it would have required the agency to establish new procedures for determining program effectiveness. Limitations that require new duties not required by existing law are not allowed. Limitations subject to contingencies not existing in current law are generally not in order in appropriations bills. In the Senate, limitations based on contingencies are prohibited by Rule XVI, paragraphs 2 and 4. In the House, limitations that could change existing law are not allowed, and limitations with words like 'unless,' 'except,' 'until,' 'if,' 'however' are viewed with suspicion. Limitations subject to contingencies not existing in current law are typically not allowed in appropriations bills. These limitations can alter agency discretion or impose new duties to receive funds, essentially acting as legislative measures. For example, a House amendment to a FY1909 Post Office appropriations bill restricted the use of funds for straps unless letter carriers could use other straps at their own expense. The chair sustained a point of order as it would have given the postmaster general the ability to allow letter carriers to choose their straps at their own expense. An example of a similar provision was seen in a House amendment to the FY1920 Army appropriations bill, which required the reinstatement of former civilian flying instructors. The point of order on this amendment was sustained due to infringement on agency discretion provided in law. The chair sustained a point of order against a House amendment to the FY1938 Agriculture Appropriations Act, as it would have conditioned funds on a determination by the Secretary of Agriculture not required by existing law. The House sustained a point of order against a provision in a FY1959 appropriations act that would delay land acquisition for an access road to a public airport near the District of Columbia until consultations and public hearings were held with Fairfax County officials and affected property owners. The House sustained a point of order against an amendment that would have required the agency administrator to consult with the board of supervisors or hold hearings to receive funds, as it was not mandated by existing law. Another example was an improper limitation in the FY1942 Interior appropriations bill, where no funds could be used until the agency certified that no employee was required to join or pay any sum to an organization. The House sustained a point of order against an amendment that would have required the agency administrator to consult with the board of supervisors or hold hearings to receive funds, as it was not mandated by existing law. An example of such a limitation is the below House amendment to the FY1968 Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act. The House sustained a point of order against an amendment in the FY1968 Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act that would have required an apportionment formula contrary to existing law. Precedents show limitations cannot impose new duties on federal officials, but are less clear on nonfederal officials. The focus is on whether new duties are imposed on federal officials in limitations involving state and federal officials. An example is the House amendment to the FY1950 Interior appropriations bill. The House sustained a point of order against an amendment in the FY1968 Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act that would have interfered with federal officials' discretion in decision-making for projects. Another example involved limitations on funds for abortions in the FY1978 Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare appropriations bill. The FY1968 Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act sustained a point of order against an amendment regarding federal officials' discretion. The FY1978 Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare appropriations bill imposed limitations on funds for abortions, with exceptions for cases necessary to save the mother's life. The House Practice guidelines state that funds in a general appropriation bill cannot be contingent on determinations by nonfederal officials not required by existing law. It is permissible to deny funds to nonfederal recipients not in compliance with federal law. The ruling of the chair on the House amendment to the FY1972 Agriculture and Environmental and Consumer Protection Appropriations Act addresses the issue of compliance with federal law by nonfederal recipients. It also discusses the division of duties between local, state, and federal officials in the administration of federal funds. The amendment prohibits the use of funds for stream channelization unless certain conditions are met. The House amendment to the FY1972 Agriculture and Environmental and Consumer Protection Appropriations Act addresses compliance with federal law by nonfederal recipients and the division of duties between local, state, and federal officials in the administration of federal funds. It prohibits the use of funds for stream channelization unless specific conditions are met, including certification by the Governor of the State where the channelization is to be located. House rules regarding legislation containing tax or tariff measures also impact limitations allowed. The House amendment to the FY1972 Agriculture and Environmental and Consumer Protection Appropriations Act prohibits the use of funds for stream channelization unless specific conditions are met. A ruling clarified that a limitation on IRS funding can be considered a \"tax or tariff measure\" if it imposes additional duties on imports not required by existing law. The restriction on IRS funding for the fiscal year may prevent revenue collection under the Internal Revenue Code. A new rule in the 108th Congress included limitation amendments on appropriations bills affecting tax administration. In FY2004, a point of order was made against using funds to assess or collect taxes on assistance payments for property or business damage. The chair upheld a point of order on a new rule in the 108th Congress that imposed limitations on funds for revenue collection related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The burden of proof is on the proponent to show that the limitation does not change agency discretion or impose new duties. If a limitation provision is deemed legislative, it can be revised to comply with chamber rules. In the House, the proponent of a limitation amendment must demonstrate that it is not legislative in nature, as seen in an example with the FY1981 Defense Appropriations Act. The amendment was objected to for imposing new duties on the Secretary of Defense. No funds appropriated shall be used for price differentials on contracts unless approved by the Secretary of Defense for national security reasons. The proponent of the amendment argued that the new provision would not impose additional duties on the Secretary, but failed to provide evidence of existing laws requiring such determinations related to national security and price differentials. The chair sustained the point of order due to lack of cited provisions in existing law. If a limitation provision is challenged as legislative, evidence of existing law mandating the determinations can support overruling the point of order. For example, in the FY1977 Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare Appropriations Act, an objection was raised for creating new duties for school administrators. The appropriations committee chair defended a provision in the Act that prohibits using funds to transport students to schools other than the nearest one offering their courses, citing the Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1974. This provision does not impose new duties on school administrators as they are already required to determine the closest comparable schools to students' homes. The Equal Educational Opportunity Act requires school administrators to determine appropriate grade levels and education types for students. A House amendment to the FY1921 Agriculture appropriations bill was challenged for potentially limiting the Secretary of Agriculture's discretion. The point of order against the provision was sustained based on evidence provided by a member objecting to it. The order against the provision was sustained based on evidence provided by a member objecting to it, citing the Secretary of Agriculture's discretion in making rules for forest preservation and setting user fees. If a point of order is sustained against a legislative amendment, a new compliant amendment can be offered, with the option to modify it with unanimous consent. In the Senate, Rule XVI allows points of order against expenditure restrictions. Rule XVI in the Senate allows points of order against expenditure restrictions, with a strict interpretation in favor of the point of order. Amendments must be modified before action or ruling, or a new compliant amendment can be offered if there is no unanimous consent agreement in place."
