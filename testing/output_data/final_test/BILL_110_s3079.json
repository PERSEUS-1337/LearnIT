Individuals legally separated under a divorce decree are not considered married for tax purposes. If a qualifying individual maintains a household for more than half the year and covers over half the cost, and their spouse is not part of the household for the last 6 months of the taxable year, they are not considered married for tax purposes. Special rules apply for dependent children under certain circumstances. Payments made to related individuals will not qualify for a tax credit if the individual is eligible for a deduction for personal exemptions as a dependent.
