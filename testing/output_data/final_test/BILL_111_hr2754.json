Congress finds that nurse-managed health clinics (NMHCs) provide primary care and wellness services based on the nursing model, with over 200 clinics in operation in the US conducting 2,000,000 client encounters annually. NMHCs offering primary care services are considered safety-net providers by the Institute of Medicine. Nurse-managed health clinics (NMHCs) provide care to uninsured, Medicaid recipients, and other vulnerable populations. A recent study found that 45% of NMHCs' payor mix is uninsured, and 37% are Medicaid recipients. NMHC patients are diverse, with 46% Caucasian, 29% African-American, and 20% Latino. 45% of the US population has at least 1 chronic disease, leading to high hospital admissions and prescription rates. Nurse-managed health clinics (NMHCs) play a crucial role in providing care to uninsured, Medicaid recipients, and other vulnerable populations. These clinics offer a wide range of health care services, including primary care, wellness services, and behavioral health care, to residents in rural and urban underserved communities. Chronic disease management programs offered by NMHCs have the potential to reduce costs and improve outcomes for chronically ill patients, making them valuable partners with the Federal Government in reducing health disparities. Nurse-managed health clinics (NMHCs) in rural and urban underserved communities provide primary care and wellness services, connecting patients to a medical home through referral networks. These clinics are crucial in addressing health disparities and play a key role in increasing health coverage. Nurse-managed health clinics (NMHCs) offer primary care and wellness services to meet the demand from newly covered individuals and alleviate primary care physician shortages. Despite their benefits, NMHCs have limited access to funding from Federal and State sources. Initially established through grants from the Division of Nursing, NMHCs recognized the need for primary care and wellness services for medically underserved populations. NMHCs struggle to cover costs for uninsured and underserved populations, leading to closures. Congress urged BPHC to consider a grant program for NMHCs in Senate Report 109-103. The Nurse-Managed Health Clinics Act aims to establish a grant program to support nurse-managed health centers in providing primary care and wellness services to underserved communities, reducing health disparities. The Nurse-Managed Health Clinics Act aims to establish a grant program to support nurse-managed health centers in providing primary care and wellness services to underserved communities, reducing health disparities and improving healthcare access for vulnerable populations. The Nurse-Managed Health Clinics Act establishes a grant program to support nurse-managed health centers in providing primary care services to underserved communities. The Nurse-Managed Health Clinics Act defines a nurse-managed health clinic as a primary care facility for underserved populations managed by advanced practice nurses. It also defines medically underserved and vulnerable populations. The Nurse-Managed Health Clinics Act defines a nurse-managed health clinic as a primary care facility for underserved populations managed by advanced practice nurses. It also defines medically underserved and vulnerable populations. Behavioral health care services include identifying, assessing, and defining mental health problems, while comprehensive primary health care services cover health care for adults, families, and children. The curr_chunk discusses primary care services related to adult, family, and pediatric health, provided by various healthcare professionals. Services include preventive health, prenatal care, cancer screening, well-child services, immunizations, lead level screenings, communicable disease screening, and cholesterol screenings. The curr_chunk discusses additional services such as pediatric eye and ear screenings, emergency medical services, diagnostic laboratory and radiologic services, care navigation services, pharmaceutical services, and voluntary family planning. Wellness services are defined as interventions aimed at reducing health risks and promoting healthy behaviors to prevent or manage chronic conditions. The curr_chunk discusses services like chronic disease self-management training, health screenings for various conditions, patient education, immunizations, outreach services, case management, interpretation services, weight control programs, and smoking cessation programs. The curr_chunk discusses grants for the operation of NMHCs providing services like smoking cessation programs, physical activity programs for vulnerable populations, occupational safety and health, and cognitive behavioral services. To be eligible for a grant, an entity must be a NMHC and provide client-centered nursing services with access to other healthcare services. The NMHC must have an APN in an executive management position overseeing daily operations, continue to offer primary care or wellness services, and establish a community advisory committee within 90 days of receiving a grant. The nurse-managed health clinic must demonstrate non-Federal matching funds, provide care regardless of insurance status or income, and may request a waiver for the matching funds requirement. Funds awarded under a grant for a nurse-managed health clinic can be used for primary care services, wellness services, management of programs, salaries for personnel, training, acquiring and leasing buildings and equipment. The grant amount is determined based on financial need, operational funding, and other factors. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance to nurse-managed health clinics to help them meet the requirements of the section. Assistance may include fiscal and program management support. The Secretary will provide assistance to nurse-managed health clinics, including fiscal and program management support, training, operational and administrative support, and information on available resources. Evaluations will be conducted to monitor performance and service quality. $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010, with additional funding for fiscal years 2011 through 2014."
