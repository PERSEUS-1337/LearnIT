    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Comprehensive Peace for Sudan Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Government of Sudan has committed genocide in Darfur, resulting in thousands of deaths, millions displaced, and urgent need for humanitarian aid to prevent further casualties. The report identified massive human rights violations in Darfur by the Government of Sudan and its proxy militia, potentially constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity. President Idriss Deby of Chad played a crucial role in facilitating a humanitarian cease-fire and allowing humanitarian aid to reach refugees. The SPLM's cooperation is essential for a political settlement between the Government, Sudanese Liberation Army, and rebel groups in Darfur. Practical implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement between the SPLM and the Government of Sudan is dependent on a peace agreement for Darfur involving various rebel groups. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The term \"SPLM\" stands for the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR. The sense of Congress is that the UN Security Council should pass a resolution condemning Sudan's actions in Darfur and outlining steps to avoid sanctions. The US Ambassador for War Crimes should investigate allegations in Sudan, a new Special Envoy should be appointed, and the SPLM should utilize the protocols signed in May 2004. The protocols signed in May 2004 aim to broker a political settlement in Darfur. Executive Order 13067 restrictions should remain until peace is achieved in Darfur. Once a peace agreement is implemented, discussions to normalize relations with Sudan, including lifting sanctions, should begin promptly. Assistance for Sudan is addressed in Section 5. The President is authorized to provide $200,000,000 in humanitarian assistance for Chad and Darfur in fiscal year 2005. Additionally, $800,000,000 is authorized to support a comprehensive North-South peace agreement in Sudan, including commercial assistance, infrastructure rehabilitation, and disarmament efforts. The President is authorized to provide humanitarian assistance for Chad and Darfur in fiscal year 2005. The Government of Sudan must meet certain criteria, including demobilizing and disarming the Janjaweed in Darfur, to receive certification. If the President fails to submit the required certification, assistance authorized for Chad and Darfur in fiscal year 2005 will not be provided. If the Government of Sudan stops taking required actions, assistance will be suspended until they resume. SEC. 6. SANCTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PEACE IN DARFUR. Measures and Sanctions in Support of Peace include implementing measures from the Sudan Peace Act and prohibiting visas for senior members of the Government of Sudan or military officials if certification is not submitted within 120 days. Restrictions against the Government of Sudan will continue as imposed under title III. The Government of Sudan sanctions imposed under the Foreign Operations Act will remain until the President certifies that there have been no attacks on civilians and humanitarian access is allowed in Darfur. SEC. 7. MULTILATERAL EFFORTS. The Secretary of State will direct the US Representative to the UN to pursue a Security Council Resolution condemning Sudan for atrocities in Darfur. This includes holding accountable those responsible, freezing assets of Sudanese officials, stopping oil imports, restricting travel, and banning Sudanese aircraft. The US will direct the UN to condemn Sudan for atrocities in Darfur, freeze assets of officials, stop oil imports, restrict travel, ban Sudanese aircraft, and cease selling arms to Sudan. SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The President must submit a report within 30 days of this Act's enactment to congressional committees detailing plans and resources for Sudan's reconstruction, contingency plans for humanitarian aid in Darfur, and assessment of military requirements if other efforts fail. The President must submit a report within 30 days detailing plans and resources for Sudan's reconstruction, contingency plans for humanitarian aid in Darfur, and a strategy for providing medical and psycho-social assistance to victims of torture and sexual violence in Darfur. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and $800,000,000 for fiscal years 2005 through 2008 to carry out specified activities. If certification is not made within 180 days, funds will be reduced by $50,000,000."
