Some suggest disallowing these techniques through tax reform or separate legislation. Others argue that the high U.S. corporate tax rate encourages profit shifting and suggest reducing the rate as a solution. The issue of profit shifting by American corporations is not limited to the U.S. Foreign policymakers are also concerned about tax strategies used by U.S. corporations in their markets. For example, in 2012, British lawmakers questioned Amazon, Google, and Starbucks about their tax strategies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande have also called for global action to curb corporate profit shifting. The OECD was tasked by G20 finance ministers to develop an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) in response to global concerns about tax avoidance by multinational corporations. The plan aims to create 15 detailed actions to reduce tax avoidance worldwide, requiring coordination between governments and major economies. The report analyzes data on profit shifting by U.S. and foreign corporations to tax-preferred countries, potentially leading to significant tax revenue losses. It discusses methods used for profit shifting and the need for congressional action. The United States taxes American corporations on their worldwide income under a worldwide tax system. However, taxes on income earned abroad can be deferred until repatriated, allowing for reduced tax expenses. This deferral could potentially result in American corporations avoiding U.S. taxation on foreign source income if the income is never repatriated. American corporations can defer overseas income held abroad or reinvested, except for subpart F income like interest, dividends, and royalties. Subpart F income must be taxed in the year generated to prevent tax avoidance through overseas subsidiaries. The active financing exception allowed American corporations to defer taxes on income earned abroad, specifically for banking, financing, and insurance operations. This exception was extended through 2014 and has been regularly extended in recent years. When repatriating income from foreign subsidiaries, it may have already been taxed by another country. When operating abroad, corporations may have income taxed by a foreign country. They can claim a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for foreign taxes paid, known as the foreign tax credit, to avoid double taxation. The credit is limited to the U.S. corporate tax rate multiplied by the income earned abroad. Separate credits are calculated for passive and non-passive income. If the U.S. tax rate is higher than the foreign country's rate, the foreign tax credit should result in the corporation owing the same total amount in taxes. The foreign tax credit aims to ensure corporations pay the same total taxes (U.S. plus foreign) as they would in the U.S. When the foreign tax rate is higher, total world taxes paid can exceed the U.S. rate. Excess foreign credits can be used for tax reduction in low-tax countries through \"cross crediting.\" American corporations' tax returns are private, making it challenging to study profit shifting directly. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis collects data on American MNCs' financial operations, including profits, investments, and activities. In 2012, American companies reported earning over $1.2 trillion abroad, with 65% coming from the top 10 reporting jurisdictions, many of which are considered tax havens. In 2012, American companies reported earning over $1.2 trillion abroad, with 65% coming from the top 10 reporting jurisdictions, including tax havens like the Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Bermuda. The distribution of profits reported abroad is divided into tax-preferred and non-tax-preferred countries, with tax-preferred jurisdictions accounting for 50% of all profits. The tax-preferred jurisdictions accounted for 50% of profits reported outside the US, compared to 15% in non-tax-preferred jurisdictions. Despite the smaller GDP of tax-preferred countries, they have a larger share of profits. There is a disconnect between where American firms report profits and where they have a physical presence. The location of employees and tangible capital for American MNCs shows a disconnect with reported profits. Tax-preferred countries account for 5% of employees and 11% of property, while non-tax-preferred countries like Canada, Norway, and the UK have 20% of employees and 29% of property. Foreign direct investment (FDI) behavior can reveal profit-shifting activities, with FDI encompassing various types of investments, including physical capital and financial flows within a company group. Foreign direct investment (FDI) captures financial flows within a company group, including reinvested earnings and intra-company loans. Economists believe that financial flows not tied to real investment may indicate profit shifting. To qualify as FDI, the parent corporation must have a minimum 10% ownership stake in the foreign entity. Ownership can be direct or indirect, such as through a foreign holding company owning multiple foreign affiliates. American MNCs engage in foreign direct investment (FDI) through ownership of foreign affiliates, with tax planning as a possible motivation. The top 10 countries for U.S. FDI include tax-preferred locations like Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Bermuda, accounting for a significant portion of American FDI positions. American companies are increasingly using holding companies for foreign investments, with the share of U.S. FDI owned through holding companies rising from 9.4% to 46.2% over the last 30 years. Holding companies allow U.S. parents to have indirect ownership in jurisdictions where their subsidiaries are located. The use of holding companies for foreign investments by American companies has significantly increased, with the share of U.S. FDI owned through holding companies rising from 9.4% to 46.2% over the last 30 years. Holding companies offer advantages such as streamlining management, operations, financing, and tax minimization opportunities. This includes transferring funds between subsidiaries without triggering U.S. tax and utilizing low-tax jurisdictions for intellectual property licensing to reduce tax liabilities. The use of holding companies for foreign investments by American companies has significantly increased over the last 30 years. Holding companies offer advantages such as streamlining management, operations, financing, and tax minimization opportunities. Current data limitations prevent definitively determining whether multinational companies are increasingly using the holding-company structure for non-tax business reasons or to minimize taxes. In 2013, the amount of the U.S. FDI position abroad that was held through holding companies was approximately $2.2 trillion, with a significant portion held in tax-haven or tax-preferred locations. In 2013, the U.S. FDI position abroad held through holding companies was distributed across various locations, including the Netherlands (27%), Luxembourg (16%), Bermuda (9%), Ireland (5%), U.K. Caribbean Islands (5%), Singapore (4%), and Switzerland (2%). Data from the IMF shows that corporate profit shifting is a global issue, with the 10 largest economies having an inward FDI position equal to 25% of their GDP on average. Japan has the smallest FDI position (4% of GDP), while the U.K. has the largest (63% of GDP). The U.K. has the largest FDI position at 63% of GDP, while the United States has 17%. The 10 most popular direct investment destinations are tax-haven countries, with an average inward FDI position equal to 961% of their economies. Ireland, the least popular tax-preferred country, has an FDI position equal to 156% of GDP, more than twice that of the U.K. Luxembourg has the largest FDI position at 5,434% of GDP, followed by the Netherlands with a $4.3 trillion inward FDI position. The combined FDI positions of the Netherlands and Luxembourg account for 27% of worldwide inward FDI, surpassing the United States and China. The United Nations and IMF data show a disproportionate amount of FDI in certain countries. The two datasets show a disproportionate amount of FDI in tax-haven and tax-preferred countries. The top 10 countries with the highest inward FDI position to GDP ratios in 2013 include the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, and the Marshall Islands. Profit shifting may be occurring through special purpose entities (SPEs) like financing subsidiaries, holding companies, and shell companies. Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) are entities created by parent enterprises in different jurisdictions mainly for capital raising and asset holding purposes. They have little to no employment or physical presence in the jurisdiction where they are established. Data on SPEs are limited, but in 2013, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had significant inward FDI stock held through SPEs, surpassing the United States. In the Netherlands, 83% of inward FDI is held through SPEs, while in Luxembourg, the figure is 96%. This has sparked a debate on reducing profit shifting. The debate over reducing profit shifting and reforming the international tax system involves various policy considerations and tradeoffs. Proposals include moving towards a pure-form worldwide system, a pure-form territorial system, adopting a minimum tax or formula apportionment, or modifying the current system's rules. The completion of OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative is also on the horizon. Calls have been made for the United States to change its approach to taxing American MNCs. Calls have been made for the United States to change its approach to taxing American MNCs, which currently follows a hybrid system with features of both worldwide and territorial taxation. The implications of moving closer towards either system are discussed. Moving closer towards a pure worldwide tax system would eliminate deferral while still allowing a credit for foreign taxes paid. This would result in U.S. investments being taxed at the same total tax rate regardless of location, leading to investment decisions based on real economic returns. U.S. corporations would allocate capital more productively globally, with reduced incentives to shift profits or hold cash overseas. A pure worldwide tax system would reduce profit shifting incentives and simplify tax administration. However, implementing a per-country foreign tax credit limit could lead to profit shifting to lower-tax countries. The shift towards a pure worldwide tax system raises concerns about corporations avoiding taxes through inversions. Recent regulatory changes and proposed legislation aim to prevent this practice. Moving from the current hybrid tax system to a pure worldwide system may require strengthening to prevent inversions. Concerns have been raised about the impact on America's international competitive position. The concept of competition in international tax policy is complex and can have conflicting implications on promoting or reducing the flow of U.S. capital abroad. Policies should aim to keep capital within the United States for domestic use, but promoting foreign investment and employment can also benefit domestic investment. Countries do not compete economically; instead, they trade based on comparative advantages to increase overall production. Economists question the competitiveness as a tax policy objective for a country, favoring economic efficiency and optimal resource allocation. Transitioning to a territorial system would mean forgoing taxing income earned outside the country, leading to investment decisions based on after-tax returns varying by country. This could result in U.S. corporations allocating more investment to lower-tax countries. A territorial-based tax system would lead to U.S. corporations investing more in lower-tax countries without tax consequences for repatriating income. Some argue that this system would enhance the competitiveness of U.S. firms compared to foreign competitors, but economists are skeptical of using competition as a criteria for evaluating international tax policy. Analysts already believe that the U.S. tax burden on foreign earned income is low. The U.S. tax burden on foreign earned income is considered low due to income shifting to low-tax countries. A territorial system could increase profit shifting without anti-abuse provisions. Income earned abroad would be exempt from U.S. tax, incentivizing attributing income outside the U.S. Anti-abuse provisions focusing on intangible asset transfers could help curb profit shifting. The distinction between worldwide and territorial tax systems is relevant for policy debates. Major economies have hybrid systems, with varying degrees of taxation on foreign source income. The effectiveness of each system depends on specific differences in international tax regimes, such as deferral options and base erosion provisions. The effectiveness of worldwide and territorial tax systems is debated, with major economies having hybrid systems. Analyzing and comparing these systems can be complex due to mislabeling and heterogeneity within country groups. Pairwise comparisons may be more accurate in understanding nuances. A worldwide minimum tax could help balance concerns over tax burdens and profit shifting by multinational corporations. A worldwide minimum tax could address tax burdens and profit shifting by multinational corporations. Income below a specified threshold would be subject to immediate U.S. taxation at the threshold rate, with a credit for foreign taxes paid to prevent double taxation. A worldwide minimum tax could prevent double taxation and profit shifting by multinational corporations. Various proposals for a minimum tax have been suggested, including one by Senator Enzi in the 112th Congress and options in former Senator Baucus's tax reform discussion draft. The minimum tax would apply to specific types of income, such as passive income or income related to intellectual property. The minimum tax proposals aim to prevent profit shifting by multinational corporations. Different approaches have been suggested, such as a 19% minimum tax on American corporations' overseas income. However, setting the minimum tax rate too low could still incentivize profit shifting to countries with slightly higher tax rates. To address this, the minimum tax rate should be set high enough to deter profit shifting. Concerns have been raised about the complexity and consistency of implementing a minimum worldwide tax to prevent profit shifting by multinational corporations. Questions include whether to use each country's statutory tax rate or each company's effective tax rate for the minimum threshold. Another suggestion to reduce profit shifting is the adoption of a formula apportionment approach to taxation. One way to reduce profit shifting by multinational corporations is through the adoption of a formula apportionment approach to taxation. This method involves pooling profits earned globally and allowing countries to tax a share of the total profits based on real business activity conducted in each country. For example, under a sales-based approach, if a U.S. company earned $100 million worldwide with 60% of sales in the U.S., the U.S. would tax $60 million while the remaining $40 million could be subject to taxation. The formula apportionment approach to taxation involves pooling global profits and allowing countries to tax based on business activity. This method considers factors like sales, assets, and employees to determine taxable income in each country. There is a debate among economists on the effectiveness of this approach in reducing profit shifting. The impact of profit shifting may be limited if a sales-based formula is used, but without proper recordkeeping, multinational corporations (MNCs) could still manipulate profits by setting up subsidiaries in low-tax countries. Determining how to treat intermediate sales in the allocation formula could be complex. Alternatively, MNCs could enter into sales contracts with foreign distributors in low-tax countries to allocate profits there. Proposed legislative and regulatory language aims to address these issues. The increasing role of intangible assets may limit a formula apportionment regime's capacity to reduce profit shifting. A sales-based approach could result in taxable income being apportioned to foreign locations instead of the United States, where initial R&D investment was made. Investment subsidized by the U.S. government could argue that associated income should be taxable in the United States. Formula apportionment incorporating assets may not fare better due to valuing intangible assets. Formula apportionment may lead to more income being taxed in multiple jurisdictions, requiring international cooperation to avoid double taxation. Harmonizing tax systems could help prevent lapses in the global tax system. Instead of targeting low-tax countries, Congress could focus on income types used for profit shifting, as seen in the Subpart F rules. The active financing income exception allows deferral for certain types of passive income earned by American corporations operating abroad. This income has been taxed only when repatriated to the United States. Congress could consider modifying this exception. Congress could modify the active financing exception for American corporations operating abroad, potentially expanding the definition of Subpart F income to include \"foreign base company digital income.\" Reducing the 35% top statutory corporate tax rate has been a key topic in corporate tax reform debates. Reducing the top statutory corporate tax rate would decrease profit shifting incentives by narrowing the gap between U.S. and low-tax countries' rates. However, even with a reduced rate of 25% to 28%, the U.S. would still be considered high-tax compared to tax havens, maintaining profit shifting incentives. Lowering the tax rate may lead to reduced federal revenue, but combining it with a broader tax base and anti-base erosion measures could help offset any losses. The OECD is developing an Action Plan on Base erosion at the request of G20 finance ministers. The OECD is developing an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting at the request of G20 finance ministers. The goal is to reduce double non-taxation of income and prevent double taxation, leading to a more transparent international tax system. Success will depend on widespread participation and coordination between governments. The OECD is developing an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting for G20 finance ministers. The plan includes deliverables endorsed by G20 heads of government, with a finalized 15-point Action Plan scheduled for December 2015. The OECD emphasizes that many strategies used by multinational corporations are legal. The OECD's BEPS project aims to address aggressive tax planning by multinational corporations, which can distort investment and create unfair competitive advantages. The project is not primarily driven by concerns over legality but rather focuses on directing capital to locations based on real economic returns. The OECD's BEPS project aims to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations to ensure fairness in the tax system. Congress should consider the implications of the BEPS Action Plan, which aims to create a more coherent international tax system. The Treasury Department represents the US in BEPS negotiations, with potential modifications to existing tax treaties. Several proposed actions under the BEPS project may require modification of existing tax treaties, which would need Senate ratification. This could involve a shift towards a multilateral approach, impacting U.S. tax laws and potentially requiring congressional approval. Even without U.S. implementation, U.S. multinationals may still be affected by unilateral actions taken by other countries to preserve their tax bases. This could conflict with the OECD's goal of international tax system coherence. The U.K.'s diverted profits tax, effective since April 1, 2015, aims to curb profit shifting by MNCs, particularly American MNCs with U.K. operations. Referred to as the \"Google tax,\" it imposes a 25% tax on income shifted out of the U.K. American MNCs could be subject to base erosion rules even if the U.S. does not adopt them, impacting their operations in other countries. The OECD's efforts to reduce profit shifting may lead to concerns over stifling trade and international investment. Some commentators worry that the extra revenue collected may not offset potential negative impacts. The OECD's efforts to reduce profit shifting may not fully compensate for the decline in economic activity. The OECD set deadlines for producing \"deliverables\" leading to the finalized proposed Action Plan, with the first set endorsed by the G20 Finance Ministers in September 2014. This included addressing tax challenges in the digital economy, hybrid mismatch arrangements, harmful tax practices, and transparency. The OECD has recommended rules to prevent tax treaty abuse, transfer pricing involving intangibles, and country-by-country documentation requirements. They are also developing a multilateral mechanism for implementing BEPS measures. Remaining deliverables include strengthening Controlled Foreign Companies Rules and limiting base erosion through interest deductions. The OECD has recommended various actions to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), including measures to limit interest deductions, expand participation to non-OECD members, prevent artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status, and improve transfer pricing rules. Additionally, recommendations have been made for collecting data on BEPS, disclosing aggressive tax planning arrangements, and enhancing dispute resolution mechanisms in tax treaties. The OECD has recommended actions to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), including measures to counter harmful tax practices, develop a multilateral instrument, and complete the full 15 item Action Plan."
