    "content": "The Federal Real Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (Property Act) allows the General Services Administration (GSA) to dispose of federal agencies' real property that is no longer needed. Agencies conduct annual surveys to identify excess properties, which are then inspected and appraised by GSA. Information about these properties is shared with other agencies and posted on the Property Disposal Resource Center website. Federal agencies can identify unneeded assets for transfer through the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) database. If an agency wants to acquire excess property, they must respond to the Notice of Availability within 30 days and submit a formal request within 60 days. Fair market value must be paid for excess property, but exceptions can be approved. If no federal agency wants the property, it is declared \"surplus\" and made available to state and local governments and non-profits at a discount of up to 100% of fair market value. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act allows surplus properties to be transferred for public benefit, with priority given to serving the homeless. HUD reviews surplus properties for suitability, publishing notices in the Federal Register. State and local governments, as well as non-profits, have 60 days to express interest in using the property for homeless services. The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act allows surplus properties to be transferred for public benefit, with priority given to serving the homeless. If HHS receives an expression of interest within the 60-day window, the property may not be made available for any other purpose until action on the request is complete. Surplus property may also be conveyed to state and local governments and qualified non-profits for various eligible uses overseen by federal agencies. State and local governments have the right of first refusal to purchase surplus property before it is offered to the general public. Negotiated sales can occur for public benefit, such as economic development, if a competitive sale would not achieve the same result. Surplus properties not transferred through public benefit conveyance or negotiated sale may still be available for other uses. The government offers surplus properties for public sale through various methods such as sealed bids, auctions, and online auctions. However, weaknesses in the disposition process have led to a large inventory of unneeded properties costing millions of dollars to operate annually. Hindered by statutory disposal requirements, preparation costs, and conflicts with stakeholders, agencies struggle to dispose of these properties efficiently. The real property disposal process is hindered by statutory requirements, conflicts with stakeholders, and the need to offer properties to state and local governments. Agencies incur operating costs for months while properties are being screened, with the McKinney-Vento Act adding up to two years to the disposal process. Despite some properties being deemed only fit for demolition, they still have to go through the screening process due to public benefit conveyance requirements set in law. The disposal process for real property is delayed by statutory requirements and conflicts with stakeholders. Agencies incur maintenance costs for properties that need to be screened, even if they are deemed unfit for use. Environmental and historic preservation laws also contribute to delays in the disposal process. Agencies may need to invest in costly repairs and renovations before disposing of older properties. Federal agencies may need to invest in repairs and renovations before disposing of certain properties. For example, the VA estimated it would need $3 billion to repair buildings in poor condition, some of which were vacant. Demolishing vacant buildings can be costly, with deconstruction and cleanup expenses sometimes exceeding maintenance costs. Compliance with environmental regulations is a major disincentive to disposal, as agencies are required to assess and pay for any needed cleanup. Before disposing of properties, federal agencies must assess and pay for environmental cleanup, which can involve significant upfront costs. Disposal efforts can be complicated by stakeholders with competing agendas, such as local and state governments, historic preservation offices, and veterans groups opposing disposals that may lead to new development or unrelated uses. The Department of State has faced challenges in disposing of properties. The Department of State faces challenges in disposing of surplus real property overseas due to disputes with host governments. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by GSA collects data from 24 major landholding agencies annually. The Federal Real Property Council (FRPC) determines data elements reported by participating agencies. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) managed by GSA contains data on excess and surplus properties held by major agencies, maintenance costs, and disposition actions. GSA controls access to the data, only providing results to requestors and releasing limited aggregated data in annual summary reports on their website. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) reports are of limited use due to highly aggregated data and lack of agency-specific information. This hinders Congress's ability to monitor individual agency performance, compare agencies, and make informed decisions based on incomplete or incomparable data. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) reports have limited usefulness due to aggregated data and lack of agency-specific information. The reports may miscategorize disposal methods, with a high number of assets classified as \"other\" without explanation. This raises concerns about agencies misreporting disposal data. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) reports may have limited usefulness due to agencies potentially misreporting disposal data and omitting valuable information that Congress might find useful. The summary reports only provide the number and annual operating costs of disposed assets, omitting important details such as the number of excess properties held by each agency and the ongoing operating costs associated with unneeded properties. Agencies also estimate repair needs for their buildings and structures as part of their FRPP reporting. H.R. 1205, the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Mike Quigley, aims to improve reporting on executive branch real property assets. The bill requires GSA to submit an annual report to Congress with details on property assets, including market value, deferred maintenance costs, and ongoing operating costs for surplus properties. This information can help inform funding decisions and address obstacles to property disposal. The bill H.R. 1205 aims to improve reporting on executive branch real property assets by requiring GSA to submit an annual report to Congress with details on surplus properties, including size, location, value, and method of disposal. It would provide new financial resources for agency disposal activities and allow agencies to retain net proceeds for real property activities. GSA would have the authority to pay for preparing properties for disposal and agencies would reimburse GSA from sale proceeds. The bill H.R. 1205 aims to establish a demonstration program exempting certain properties from the McKinney-Vento Act for quicker demolition. It includes provisions to increase real property data available to Congress, requiring GSA to report on excess properties' maintenance costs, proceeds from disposition, and establish a publicly accessible database. The bill H.R. 1205 requires GSA to establish a database with detailed information on federal real property, including location, size, utilization rate, and replacement value. Net proceeds from property disposal must be used for deficit reduction. By FY2015, 50% of construction and demolition materials must be diverted from landfills for reuse. GSA will issue recommendations to identify excess property and evaluate it. H.R. 665, the Excess Federal Buildings and Property Disposal Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Jason Chaffetz, aims to establish a pilot program for expedited disposal of unneeded real property. Executive agencies would be required to identify, report, and dispose of excess property promptly, with goals and incentives for reducing excess real property in their inventories. The pilot program for expedited disposal of unneeded real property under H.R. 665 aims to generate $19 billion in proceeds over nine years. The OMB Director would establish criteria for identifying unneeded properties, with agencies recommending properties for disposal. Properties selected for the pilot program would be sold at fair market value, exempt from certain requirements to speed up the sale process. The Civilian Property Realignment Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Jeff Denham, aims to expedite the disposal of unneeded real property. Agencies participating in the pilot program would be reimbursed for administrative expenses from the sale proceeds. 80% of the net proceeds would go to the Treasury, while 20% would go to the owning agency. The funds could be used for real property activities without further appropriation until the pilot program concludes. The Civilian Property Realignment Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Jeff Denham, aims to establish a centralized process for decision-making on federal real property. It draws on the BRAC model and applies to all executive branch agencies and government corporations, excluding military installations subject to BRAC legislation and properties for national security reasons. The first step in the process is for federal landholding agencies to develop recommendations. The CPRA process involves federal landholding agencies developing recommendations for realigning their property portfolios and reducing costs. These recommendations are reviewed by the Administrator of the General Services Administration and the Federal Real Property Council before being submitted to the Civilian Property Realignment Commission. The Commission, composed of nine members appointed by the President, holds public hearings and submits a final list of recommendations to the President for potential submission to Congress. The Civilian Property Realignment Act (CPRA) process involves federal agencies developing recommendations for realigning their property portfolios. The President must take action on the recommendations within a specified timeframe, or they gain the force of law. CPRA establishes two accounts for funding the Commission's administrative costs and implementing recommendations. The Commission has the authority to transfer funds and sell properties to generate proceeds for the Asset Proceeds and Space Management Fund (APSMF). The Commission would have the authority to transfer amounts to cover costs associated with implementing recommendations or actions for operational efficiencies and outplacement assistance for employees. 60% of net proceeds would be deposited into the general fund, with the remaining distributed among APSMF and federal agencies for real property management activities. CPRA properties would have an abbreviated conveyance process without screening for public use. The Commission would select certain CPRA properties for PBC screening, posting the list on its website and sending a copy to HUD. Non-profits and governments interested in homeless services would submit a notice of interest to HUD within 30 days. If recommendations gained force of law, HUD would convey the property to the most meritorious applicant. The CPRA would require executive agencies to acquire leased space through GSA, potentially limiting GSA's leasing authority delegation. Three proposals (H.R. 1205, H.R. 665, H.R. 1734) vary in scope and consequences. H.R. 1205 allows agencies to retain proceeds from property dispositions, addressing obstacles like budgetary disincentives and lack of data access. H.R. 1205 permits agencies to use proceeds from property dispositions for property preparation, sale, or maintenance. Reinvesting in disposal can reduce inventory and maintenance costs. Agencies can also apply proceeds towards repairs to extend building systems' life and lower operating costs. Failure to repair building components can decrease building value and lead to increased future repair costs. The pilot program established by H.R. 1205 aims to reduce the time it takes to dispose of buildings scheduled for demolition, potentially saving on future repair costs. In FY2009, demolition was the most common method of disposition for government buildings, with thousands more properties eligible for the pilot program. The pilot program established by H.R. 1205 aims to speed up the demolition process for government buildings, potentially saving on operating costs. The program could identify unneeded properties, calculate their costs, and monitor disposition timelines, addressing concerns about the lack of comprehensive real property data. The annual report required by H.R. 1205 would provide additional data for congressional oversight on excess and surplus properties, including market value and disposal costs. However, it does not mandate improvements in data quality, potentially limiting the database's usefulness. H.R. 665 allows agencies to retain 20% of net proceeds from property disposition, unlike H.R. 1205 which requires all proceeds to be retained. H.R. 665 proposes an expedited disposal program for unneeded properties, potentially reducing administrative burden by exempting them from public benefit conveyance requirements. This may face opposition from state and local agencies and non-profits preferring public conveyance to access surplus federal property. These exemptions could shorten the disposal process, cutting maintenance costs. The bill H.R. 1734 aims to streamline the disposal process for federal properties, potentially reducing maintenance costs and generating revenues sooner. Some agencies may object to transferring proceeds to the Commission instead of their own accounts, which could impact their incentive to dispose of properties promptly. H.R. 1734 aims to streamline the federal property disposal process by reducing administrative burden, establishing an independent decision-making apparatus, and facilitating cost savings through consolidation recommendations. The bill may also allow for a broader range of opportunities for agencies to share space. The bill aims to streamline federal property disposal by reducing administrative burden and establishing an independent decision-making process. However, there are concerns about the lack of public data on properties not recommended for disposal and the bill's limitations on agencies' ability to sell unneeded properties. Congress may need to consider expanding agencies' authority to enter into Enhanced Use Leases. Enhanced Use Leases (EULs) are special authorities that allow agencies to lease federal property to public and private entities. The scope of authority granted by EULs varies among agencies, with some able to retain proceeds and use them for non-real property activities. While EULs can generate revenue for agencies, the process of drafting and implementing agreements can be complex and time-consuming. If Congress considers expanding EUL authorities, issues related to revenue allocation and process efficiency will need to be addressed. If Congress expands EUL authorities, issues to consider include requiring congressional approval for agency use of proceeds and limiting proceeds to specific purposes like disposal or agency activities."
