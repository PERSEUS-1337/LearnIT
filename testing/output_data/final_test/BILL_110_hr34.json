    "content": "PILOT PROGRAM IN CERTAIN DISTRICT COURTS. Establishment of a program in designated United States district courts where district judges can hear cases related to patents or plant variety protection. Cases are randomly assigned to judges regardless of designation. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall designate senior judges in district courts to hear patent or plant variety protection cases. Judges assigned under this section can decline a case, which will then be randomly reassigned to another designated judge. The right to transfer cases is preserved, allowing judges to request reassignment according to court rules. The United States Courts must designate at least 5 district courts to carry out a program for patent and plant variety protection cases within 6 months of this Act. The designated courts must have a minimum of 10 district judges appointed by the President and at least 3 judges who have requested to participate in the program. The program established shall have a specified duration. The program for patent and plant variety protection cases will terminate 10 years after its establishment. It will only apply to cases initiated after the court designation. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will report to Congress on the pilot program at specified times. The pilot program for patent and plant variety protection cases will terminate after 10 years. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will report to Congress on the program's success in developing expertise among district judges, improving court efficiency, and comparing the rate of reversal by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit between designated and non-designated judges in patent cases. The pilot program for patent and plant variety protection cases will be evaluated by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The evaluation will focus on issues of claim construction, time elapsed from case filing to trial, evidence of forum shopping, and the potential extension of the program to other district courts. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will provide periodic reports to relevant committees regarding the pilot program for patent and plant variety protection cases. The reports will cover various matters outlined in the program, and specific timelines are set for these reports. Additionally, authorization for training and clerkships is granted in addition to the evaluation of the pilot program. Authorization for training and clerkships is authorized with a minimum of $5,000,000 annually for the education of district judges in patent and plant variety protection, as well as compensation for law clerks with technical expertise in these cases. Passed the House of Representatives on February 12, 2007. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
