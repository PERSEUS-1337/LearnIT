The General Services Administration mandates bird-safe building materials and design features to prevent collisions, including UV patterned glass, the '2 X 4 rule' for glass patterns, and opaque or translucent glass options. Buildings must have at least 60 percent of the exposed facade material above 40 feet meeting specific standards, no transparent passageways or corners, bird-safe glass near atria or courtyards, shielded and minimized outside lighting, and monitoring of bird mortality at public buildings. Existing buildings should reduce exterior lighting where practicable. The Administrator will reduce exterior building and site lighting for public buildings using automatic control technologies like timers, photo-sensors, and motion detectors. Certain buildings are exempt from this requirement, including historic buildings of national significance, the White House, Supreme Court building, and the United States Capitol.
