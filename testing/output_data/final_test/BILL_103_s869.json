The Congress acknowledges the serious threats of domestic violence and sexual assault to women's health and well-being in the United States. These forms of violence lead to severe physical injuries, mental health issues, and even fatality. Approximately 4,000,000 women are victims of domestic violence annually, with one in two women experiencing such violence in their lifetime. Battering is identified as the primary cause of injury to women, and it is estimated that 1 in 6 pregnant women are affected. Domestic violence affects 1 in 6 pregnant women, leading to increased rates of miscarriage, stillbirths, and low-birthweight babies. It may also account for one-third of emergency room visits by women, with estimates showing 21,000 hospitalizations and 99,800 days of hospitalization annually. However, fewer than 5 percent of injured women are correctly diagnosed as victims of domestic violence, highlighting the lack of uniform protocols in hospitals and clinics for identification and referral of victims. A national surveillance system should be established to monitor the health effects of domestic violence and sexual assault in the United States. The Surgeon General has identified domestic violence as a public health problem that all healthcare providers must actively address. Estimates show that 50-75% of male batterers also abuse their children. Establishment of health programs regarding domestic violence and sexual assault is added to Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary may award grants for demonstration projects to train health care providers in identifying and referring victims of domestic violence and sexual assault to relevant services.

The Secretary may award grants for training health care providers to identify and refer victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Applicants must show willingness to collaborate with local groups with expertise in treatment and prevention. Considerations for awarding grants include the number and diversity of providers to be trained, as well as hospitals' compliance with standards for recognizing and treating abuse victims. The Secretary may award grants for training health care providers to identify and refer victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Applicants must collaborate with local groups with expertise in treatment and prevention. The program includes public education on the consequences of domestic violence and sexual assault, as well as epidemiological research. The Secretary will conduct epidemiological research on domestic violence and sexual assault, collecting data on incidence, costs of healthcare, injuries, victims seeking treatment, and common circumstances. The Secretary will establish a national system for collecting data on domestic violence and sexual assault, including common circumstances, types of medical facilities used by victims, and demographic characteristics of individuals. Data collected will be confidential as per standards outlined in section 308(d). The Secretary will report data on domestic violence and sexual assault every 2 years to Congress. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for 1995-1997. At least 60% of the funds will be allocated for grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements for demonstration projects."
