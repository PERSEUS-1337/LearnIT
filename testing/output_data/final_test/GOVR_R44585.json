    "content": "The Clean Water Act governs pollution of the nation's surface waters, prohibiting unauthorized discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. It requires permits for discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters, defined as \"waters of the United States.\" This definition applies to various aspects of the law, including NPDES permits, Section 404 program, water quality standards, oil spill liability, and enforcement. The Act does not further define \"waters of the United States,\" leaving it to the Corps and EPA to interpret. The Corps and EPA have expanded on the definition of \"waters of the United States\" through agency guidance and regulations, which have been challenged in court for not meeting statutory or constitutional requirements. Federal authority to regulate these waters comes from the Commerce Clause, limiting the scope of laws and regulations. Legal challenges to this interpretation have followed trends in Commerce Clause interpretation, with courts initially giving the Clean Water Act broad jurisdiction but more recently narrowing it. In recent decades, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the authority granted to Congress under the Commerce Clause is not unlimited. The evolution of the definition of \"waters of the United States\" is outlined, starting with laws like the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The jurisdiction over waterways has shifted over time, with Congress using different phrases to define its authority. The Clean Water Act of 1972 expanded federal jurisdiction over water pollution by defining \"navigable waters\" as \"the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\" This change had significant implications for the Act's scope. The 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act broadened its jurisdiction beyond traditionally navigable waters, encompassing all water bodies for water quality purposes. The Corps and EPA are responsible for administering the Act. The Corps and EPA share responsibility for administering the Clean Water Act, with EPA primarily handling most programs in partnership with states. Initially, their definitions of \"navigable waters\" differed, but in 1973, EPA issued regulations defining six categories of waterbodies under the Act. EPA's definition was influenced by a prior opinion from their general counsel. The Corps and EPA initially had different definitions of \"navigable waters\" under the Clean Water Act. EPA's 1973 definition, influenced by their general counsel, included interstate lakes, rivers, and streams for interstate activities. The Corps' implementation in 1974 differed, acknowledging the need for a broad constitutional interpretation of navigable waters. The Corps initially defined \"navigable waters\" under the Clean Water Act with a broad constitutional interpretation but limited its jurisdiction to waters regulated under preexisting laws. The United States District Court later struck down these regulations as too narrow and inconsistent with the Act, ordering the Corps to produce new regulations. The court ordered the Corps to produce new regulations that acknowledged the full regulatory mandate of the Clean Water Act, leading to proposed regulations offering alternative methods of redefining jurisdiction. This sparked public and media attention, a disagreement between the Corps and EPA, and congressional hearings. In response to public and congressional scrutiny, the Corps issued interim final regulations in 1975 that revised the definition of \"navigable waters\" for the Clean Water Act's Section 404 program. The regulations included wetlands, mudflats, swamps, marshes, and shallows adjacent to navigable waters, as well as artificial channels and canals connected to navigable waters. Additionally, federal regulation was extended to other waters deemed necessary for water quality protection based on technical standards and evaluation criteria. The Corps reorganized the definition of \"waters of the United States\" in 1977, with the most expansive jurisdictional waters category. This category included all other waters that could be regulated under the Commerce Clause. Despite attempts by some Members of Congress to limit the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction, the proposed legislation did not become law. The Clean Water Act of 1977 amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act but did not change the jurisdictional phrase \"waters of the United States.\" The legislation included exemptions for certain activities like farming and ranching. Disagreement arose between the Corps and EPA over final authority. Disagreement between the Corps and EPA over final authority on determining waters subject to Section 404 permits was resolved in 1979 by the U.S. Attorney General, stating that EPA has the final administrative authority. In 1989, a Memorandum of Agreement was executed, designating EPA as the lead agency for developing guidance on jurisdictional waters. In 1979, the U.S. Attorney General resolved a disagreement between the Corps and EPA by stating that EPA has final administrative authority on determining waters subject to Section 404 permits. The Corps and EPA streamlined the regulatory definition of \"waters of the United States\" by issuing regulations in 1980 and adopting EPA's definition in 1982. The Supreme Court reviewed a legal challenge to the Corps' application of \"waters of the United States\" in 1985. In 1985, the Corps applied the definition of \"waters of the United States\" in United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. to enforce regulations on wetlands near Lake St. Clair in Michigan. The Sixth Circuit narrowly interpreted the Corps' definition to avoid violating the Fifth Amendment. The Sixth Circuit narrowly interpreted the Corps' regulations on wetlands near Lake St. Clair in Michigan to avoid violating the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that adjacent wetlands are inseparably bound up with the 'waters' of the United States. The Supreme Court concluded that adjacent wetlands are inseparably connected to the 'waters' of the United States, citing legislative history from the Clean Water Act. The Court emphasized that it did not express an opinion on regulating fill material in wetlands not adjacent to open water. The Corps and EPA interpreted the Act to cover all waters used by migratory birds. The Migratory Bird Rule clarified the definition of \"waters of the United States\" without redefining it. In the late 1980s, adjustments were made to exclude certain water bodies like drainage ditches and artificial ponds. In 1993, regulations were revised to exclude prior converted cropland from jurisdictional waters. Disputes also arose over technical standards for delineating jurisdictional waters. In the late 1980s, technical standards for delineating jurisdictional waters, including wetlands, were established. The Corps and EPA issued separate manuals with differing methodologies, leading to the creation of the Federal Manual in 1989. Criticisms of the Federal Manual's methodology and scope of federal wetlands regulations resulted in congressional action in 1991 to prohibit the Corps from using it. In the late 1980s, technical standards for delineating jurisdictional waters were established, leading to the creation of the Federal Manual in 1989. Congress mandated the Corps to use the 1987 Manual until a new one was published after public notice and comment. However, the proposed revisions to the Federal Manual were never finalized, and no interagency wetlands manual was created. Court cases in the late 1990s caused the Corps and EPA to modify their interpretation of \"waters of the United States.\" In the 1995 case of United States v. Lopez, the Supreme Court struck down a federal statute for exceeding Congress's powers under the Commerce Clause. The Court categorized Congress's commerce power into three categories and ruled that the Commerce Clause did not provide a constitutional basis for federal legislation criminalizing possession of a firearm in a school zone. This decision set the backdrop for opinions limiting Congress's commerce power. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued a decision limiting the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act in 1997, following the landmark case of United States v. Lopez which set the backdrop for opinions limiting federal jurisdiction under the Act. The defendants in United States v. Wilson were convicted of violating the Act by discharging fill material into wetland property, challenging the Corps' regulatory definition of \"waters of the United States\" as exceeding statutory and constitutional authority. The Fourth Circuit limited the Clean Water Act's jurisdictional reach in United States v. Wilson, citing the Commerce Clause and the Corps' statutory authority. The court ordered a new trial, stating that the regulated conduct must \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce to invoke the Commerce Clause power. The Fourth Circuit found that the Corps exceeded its authority by regulating waters that \"could affect\" interstate commerce without actual substantial impact. Ultimately, the court invalidated the regulations for exceeding congressional authorization under the Clean Water Act. The Fourth Circuit's decision in United States v. Wilson limited the Clean Water Act's jurisdictional reach, stating that regulated conduct must \"substantially affect\" interstate commerce. The court found that the Corps exceeded its authority by regulating waters that \"could affect\" interstate commerce without actual substantial impact, leading to the invalidation of the regulations for exceeding congressional authorization. The decision only applied in the Fourth Circuit and remained in effect until the release of the 2015 Clean Water Rule. The 2000 guidance clarified nontraditional waters considered part of the \"waters of the United States,\" including intermittent and ephemeral streams. Drainage ditches in jurisdictional waters were subject to the Clean Water Act, except when drainage converted the area to dry land. In 2001, the Supreme Court revisited Clean Water Act jurisdiction in SWANCC, evaluating the reach of the Act. In SWANCC, the Supreme Court ruled that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not extend to isolated waters solely based on their use by migratory birds, citing constitutional limitations on Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause. The SWANCC Court concluded that the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction does not cover isolated waters based on migratory bird use, citing constitutional limits on Congress's authority. The Court emphasized that Congress intended to regulate traditional navigable waters, not invoke the outer limits of the Commerce Clause. The SWANCC Court limited Clean Water Act jurisdiction to navigable-in-fact waters, emphasizing the Corps' original interpretation of the 1972 amendments. It found that ponds in abandoned gravel pits lacked a \"significant nexus\" to navigable waters, unlike wetlands adjacent to them in the Riverside Bayview Homes case. This decision highlighted constitutional limits on Congress's authority in regulating isolated waters based on migratory bird use. The SWANCC Court limited Clean Water Act jurisdiction to navigable-in-fact waters, emphasizing the Corps' original interpretation of the 1972 amendments. It found that ponds in abandoned gravel pits lacked a \"significant nexus\" to navigable waters, unlike wetlands adjacent to them in the Riverside Bayview Homes case. SWANCC's rationale called into question the Corps and EPA's jurisdiction over intrastate isolated waters, leading to post-SWANCC debate and a joint memorandum issued by the general counsels for the Corps and EPA. The Corps and EPA concluded that they could maintain jurisdiction over isolated waters if their use, degradation, or destruction could impact other \"waters of the United States,\" based on the \"significant nexus\" concept from SWANCC. Despite initial efforts in 2003 to address jurisdictional issues, uncertainties remained after SWANCC, prompting the agencies to explore alternative bases for defining \"waters of the United States.\" The EPA and Corps sought alternative bases for defining \"waters of the United States\" after uncertainties following SWANCC. The Rapanos case involved a dispute over Clean Water Act jurisdiction regarding \"adjacent\" wetlands. The Rapanos case did not provide a clear standard for jurisdictional disputes over wetland property. A plurality opinion by Justice Scalia and an opinion by Justice Kennedy proposed two alternative tests. Lower courts interpreting Rapanos struggled with applying a consistent analysis in Clean Water Act jurisdictional disputes. The Rapanos case left ambiguity in determining jurisdiction over wetlands. Lower courts have varied in their interpretation of Justice Kennedy's \"significant nexus\" test as the narrowest grounds for jurisdiction. Some criticize this test as vague and difficult to apply. In 2007, the EPA provided guidance on Rapanos, which was revised in 2008 to include the view that jurisdiction exists over waterbodies meeting certain criteria. The 2008 guidance categorized waters into three groups for jurisdictional analysis. In 2011, proposed changes to the guidance were discussed, potentially expanding the number of waters regulated under the Clean Water Act, leading to congressional attention. In 2011, proposed changes to the guidance on jurisdictional waters under the Clean Water Act sparked congressional attention. 41 Senators signed a letter urging agencies to abandon the effort, but funding prohibitions were not enacted. Instead, the agencies shifted focus to the 2015 Clean Water Rule to clarify jurisdictional waters after SWANCC and Rapanos. The rule was based on scientific reports and public comments, maintaining a three-tier structure for categorizing jurisdictional waters. The agencies aimed to clarify jurisdictional waters under the Clean Water Act by identifying categorically jurisdictional waters, those with a significant nexus, and those excluded from jurisdiction. The Clean Water Rule faced debate and opposition in Congress, with a resolution of disapproval passed in 2016. In January 2016, the Senate and House passed a resolution seeking to nullify the Clean Water Rule, but President Obama vetoed it. Legal challenges were filed by 31 states and 53 plaintiffs, arguing the rule exceeded authority and did not comply with the APA. An impasse arose over the proper court for litigation. Some plaintiffs filed suit in federal district courts while others argued for U.S. circuit courts of appeals to have direct appellate-level review over challenges to the Clean Water Rule. The District Court for the District of North Dakota ruled it had jurisdiction to review the rule and granted a preliminary injunction, temporarily barring its implementation in several states. In the appellate-level litigation, the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay on the Clean Water Rule and claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the challenges. The Supreme Court later disagreed, stating that the Clean Water Act did not grant direct appellate-level jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Water Act does not provide direct appellate-level jurisdiction over challenges to the rule defining \"waters of the United States.\" The Court stated that such challenges must first be reviewed in federal district court. This decision resolved the issue of which courts can hear challenges to the Clean Water Rule, but did not address the merits of the challenges themselves. The Trump Administration opposes the Clean Water Rule and aims to replace it with new regulations defining \"waters of the United States.\" President Trump issued an Executive Order directing EPA and the Corps to revise or rescind the rule to promote economic growth while keeping navigable waters free from pollution. EPA and the Corps plan to interpret the Clean Water Act in line with Justice Scalia's opinion in Rapanos. They aim to repeal the Clean Water Rule and redefine \"waters of the United States\" through a two-step process. In 2017, they proposed a rule to rescind the Clean Water Rule, followed by a supplemental notice in 2018 explaining the legal basis for the repeal. The EPA and the Corps provided a supplemental notice justifying the repeal of the Clean Water Rule, stating that it exceeded statutory authority and created legal uncertainty. The public comment period for the repeal closed in August 2018, and a second proposed rule (Step Two Proposal) was introduced in December 2018 to complete the repeal process. The Step Two Proposal aims to redefine \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act, providing clarity and consistency while eliminating the \"significant nexus\" evaluation. It includes six categories of waterbodies and aligns with the Act's objectives of water quality restoration and state/tribal authority. The Step Two Proposal aims to redefine \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act by improving the definitions of \"adjacent wetland\" and \"tributary\" to eliminate the need for case-specific significant nexus tests. Wetlands are considered adjacent if they touch or have a direct hydrological connection with jurisdictional waters, while tributaries must contribute flow to traditionally navigable waters. The Trump Administration is working on a two-step plan to redefine \"waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act. This includes redefining \"tributary\" as any water contributing flow to jurisdictional waters with a bed, bank, and high water mark. Additionally, there is a third rulemaking process to suspend the Clean Water Rule until February 2020, citing the NAM v. Department of Defense decision as a factor. EPA and the Corps have published an Applicability Date Rule setting a new effective date of February 6, 2020 for the Clean Water Rule. After challenges to the Clean Water Rule were dismissed by the Sixth Circuit, the Applicability Date Rule was implemented by EPA and the Corps to suspend the Clean Water Rule while undergoing a repeal and revise process. Litigants have contested this rule in federal courts, with two district courts ruling against EPA and the Corps in late 2018. The Applicability Date Rule was found to be non-compliant with administrative rulemaking requirements by two federal district courts in late 2018. This led to orders vacating the rule nationwide, leaving no barrier to the application of the Clean Water Rule on a nationwide basis. The legal challenges surrounding \"waters of the United States\" have created a complex legal landscape for the 116th Congress. The Trump Administration's proposed rules are still in process, while the Obama Administration's Clean Water Rule remains in effect. The Obama Administration's Clean Water Rule is currently the regulation defining waters of the United States, with legal challenges leading to injunctions in 28 states. The Trump Administration's proposed rules may bring uniformity but are likely to result in new litigation. The Trump Administration's proposed rules on defining \"waters of the United States\" are expected to lead to new litigation. Critics may challenge whether EPA and the Corps considered enough scientific data and provided a sufficient rationale for departing from prior guidance. The debate hinges on the meaning of a statutory term, and Congress could potentially enact legislation to define the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act. Congress could enact legislation to define the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act more clearly, with proposed bills in the 115th and 116th Congress aiming to amend or repeal the Clean Water Rule. The debate involves environmental protection, statutory interpretation, federalism, and constitutional law. The debate over the \"waters of the United States\" involves confusion and legal challenges, with the Obama and Trump Administrations attempting to clarify the Clean Water Act. The 116th Congress faces a fragmented legal landscape, with different interpretations of the term across the nation. Congressional legislation could provide clarity by defining the jurisdictional reach of the Clean Water Act. The debate over the \"waters of the United States\" involves confusion and legal challenges, with the Obama and Trump Administrations attempting to clarify the Clean Water Act. Congress could amend the Act to define its jurisdictional scope more clearly, but legislative proposals have not been enacted."
