Congress finds that free and open elections are essential to our republican form of government. It is Congress's responsibility to ensure elections are free from corruption and the appearance of corruption. The excessive flow of money in politics is corrupting and damaging to the public perception of government. High levels of election spending threaten the fairness and integrity of democracy, and Congress must uphold a republican form of government for the States. Congress has the authority to regulate campaign expenditures to promote integrity, prevent corruption, and ensure public trust in elections, dating back to the Tillman Act of 1907 and the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. This is crucial to preserving our democracy and ensuring fair elections. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, prohibiting corporations and labor unions from making independent expenditures in Federal elections. The Watergate scandal led to the enactment of the Federal Elections Campaign Act in 1974, establishing the Federal Elections Commission and imposing limits on campaign contributions. The Supreme Court's 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo further shaped campaign finance regulations. The Buckley v. Valeo case established that money equals speech and overturned FECA limitations on independent expenditures. This decision can lead to wealthy individuals having undue influence on elections. In 1990, the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan law banning corporations from making independent expenditures in elections in the Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce case. In Austin, the Court established that corporate wealth can unfairly influence elections through independent expenditures. The government has an antidistortion interest in regulating political speech to prevent the distorting effects of immense wealth. Congress passed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, banning political parties from raising \"soft money\". Excessive spending in presidential elections has been a growing concern over the last decade. Excessive spending in presidential elections has been a growing concern over the last decade, with a significant increase in outside political spending following the Citizens United v. FEC decision. Super PACs spent approximately $90.4 million in the 2010 elections, with $60 million explicitly advocating for or against a candidate. Super PACs dominated spending in the 2010 elections, with ten Super PACs accounting for 75% of the total expenditure. American Crossroads alone spent $25.8 million, representing 28.7% of Super PAC spending. In 2012, Super PACs spent over $152 million, with $8.93 million spent in a single week. These groups can hide the sources of their donations, leading to decreased transparency and accountability. The influence of corporations on elections through Super PACs has raised concerns about accountability and transparency. Polls show a majority of Americans support new campaign finance laws and oppose the Citizens United decision. Congress is urged to consider these findings. Congress is concerned about the unfairness of unlimited spending in elections and is taking action to protect democracy by reinstating the ban on corporate political expenditures and placing limits on donations to Super PACs. This move aims to restore faith in democracy and respond to calls for campaign finance reform. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF CORPORATE AND LABOR DISBURSEMENTS FOR ELECTIONEERING COMMUNICATIONS. The amendment prohibits corporate and labor disbursements for electioneering communications, defining applicable electioneering communication and specifying rules related to it. The term 'applicable electioneering communication' excludes certain communications by section 501(c)(4) or political organizations under specific conditions related to funding sources. Special operating rules define electioneering communication as made by an entity described in subsection (a) if they disburse any amount for the communication. An exception applies to section 501(c)(4) organizations that use funds from business activities or entities in subsection (a), unless the communication is paid for from a segregated account for individual contributions. Definitions and rules for section 501(c)(4) organizations under subsection 304(f)(2)(E) include organizations exempt from taxation, those with pending status determination, and the definition of a disbursement. The subsection outlines rules for section 501(c)(4) organizations, including restrictions on activities prohibited by the Internal Revenue Code and special rules for targeted communications. Targeted communication refers to electioneering communication distributed from a television or radio broadcast station. The subsection outlines rules for section 501(c)(4) organizations, including restrictions on activities prohibited by the Internal Revenue Code and special rules for targeted communications. The amendments made by this subsection shall take effect immediately after the enactment of subsection (b), which repeals sections 203 and 204 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. SEC. 4 prohibits independent expenditures by corporations and labor organizations. SEC. 5 applies contribution limits and source prohibitions to contributions made to Super PACs. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to include new limitations on contributions made to political committees that accept non-compliant donations. This amendment applies to contributions made after the enactment of the Act."
