    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Katrina Aftermath Relief Effort Tax Credit Act\". The Congress finds that Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast States in 2005, forcing 1,000,000 Americans to flee their homes. Many displaced victims are currently in temporary shelters across various states, with some also being welcomed into American homes. Many Americans have opened their homes to welcome victims of Hurricane Katrina, providing expenses for their needs. Due to the devastation, finding intermediate and long-term housing for Gulf Coast victims is necessary. Locating long-term housing can be challenging and time-consuming, making intermediate-term housing a suitable option until a permanent solution is found. The Act aims to provide incentives and tax credits for Americans who open their homes to Hurricane Katrina victims, offsetting expenses for food, clothing, transportation, and personal items. The Act provides a new tax credit, the Katrina Aftermath Relief Effort Credit, to incentivize Americans opening their homes to Hurricane Katrina victims. The Katrina Aftermath Relief Effort Credit allows individuals to claim a tax credit for qualified housing support expenses paid for Hurricane Katrina victims, with a maximum credit of $1,000 per year. Qualified individuals are defined as those displaced by Hurricane Katrina, and qualified expenses include food, clothing, school supplies, transportation, and personal items. The Katrina Aftermath Relief Effort Credit allows individuals to claim a tax credit for qualified housing support expenses paid for Hurricane Katrina victims. The taxpayer must substantiate the amount, time, place, purpose of the expense, and the name of the qualified individual. The credit applies to expenses incurred between August 29, 2005, and December 31, 2006. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to redesignate section 36 as section 37 and add a new item before it. Section 36, Katrina aftermath relief effort credit, amends section 1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code. The effective date for these amendments is on or after August 29, 2005."
