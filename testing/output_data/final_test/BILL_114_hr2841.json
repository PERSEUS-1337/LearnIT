    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fair Access for Safe and Timely Generics Act of 2015\" or the \"FAST Generics Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that reference product license holders are restricting competitive access to drugs, generics, and biosimilars, deterring development by extending patent monopolies. Enforcement provisions have not been sufficient to prevent anti-competitive practices. The lack of regulatory structure deters access to reference products needed for developing affordable drugs, generics, and biosimilars. License holders impede negotiation and development of a shared system of elements. License holders are required to comply with competitive access requirements for their products and develop a shared system to ensure safe use. Failure to do so may result in liability, without imposing undue burdens on the courts. SEC. 3. Competitive access to covered products for development purposes is added to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure compliance and safe use of products. In this section, a covered product refers to any drug approved under section 505 or biological product licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, including combinations thereof, and any product marketed or intended for use with such drug or biological product for purposes of demonstrating sameness, biosimilarity, or interchangeability. The term 'eligible product developer' refers to a person seeking approval for a product under specific applications. The Secretary may exclude drugs or biological products in shortage from certain provisions, based on the duration of the shortage or other determinations. The term 'license holder' refers to the holder of an approved application for a covered product under specific sections of the Public Health Service Act. 'REMS' stands for risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, while a 'REMS product' is a covered product subject to this strategy. The Secretary requires that the license holder of a covered product must not impose any conditions or restrictions on the sale, resale, or distribution as a condition of approval or licensure. This applies to products subject to a REMS impacting product distribution. The REMS for a covered product must not restrict supply to eligible product developers for development or testing purposes. Additionally, the REMS product's license holder cannot prohibit or limit the supply of the product to developers at market-based prices for development and testing. The REMS for a covered product must not restrict supply to eligible product developers for development or testing purposes. License holders must not impede the development of a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use under section 505-1 for eligible product developers seeking approval under 505(j). License holders must provide competitive access to covered products for testing purposes within 30 days of receiving a request from an eligible product developer. License holders must provide the quantity requested within 30 days at a market-based price. Eligible product developers can seek authorization for individual covered products subject to REMS for development and testing purposes. Eligible product developers can seek authorization for development and testing, with or without human clinical trials, by complying with necessary conditions determined by the Secretary. This includes submitting a protocol with safety protections comparable to approved products or satisfying the Secretary in other ways. Eligible product developers can obtain covered products for development and testing purposes by obtaining an authorization from the license holder. Each license holder must publicly designate the process for obtaining the product. Each license holder must designate a wholesaler or distributor to receive requests for covered products. An eligible product developer can acquire products by submitting a written request to the license holder, specifying the quantity needed for development or testing purposes. The request must state that the developer has authorization to obtain the product. The wholesaler or specialty distributor must provide the requested quantity of the covered product at a market-based price within 30 days of receiving a request from an eligible product developer. They are not allowed to disclose the developer's identity to the license holder but can inform them that a request has been made. The Secretary may prohibit a transfer of a covered product to an eligible product developer if it poses an imminent hazard to public health, providing specific information for the determination. The Secretary can prohibit the transfer of a covered product to an eligible product developer if it poses a public health hazard. An eligible product developer aggrieved by a violation by a license holder can sue for injunctive relief and treble damages. The Act does not affect antitrust laws. The term 'antitrust laws' is defined for paragraph (1) as given in the Clayton Act, including section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The holder of an approved application or license for a covered product is not liable for claims arising from an eligible product developer's failure to follow safety measures during development or testing. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows for a waiver of the single, shared system requirement for an abbreviated new drug application if the applicant attempted in good faith to create or negotiate entry into a single, shared system but was unable to finalize terms with the holder of the listed drug within 120 days. The certification must include a description of the efforts made. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires applicants for an abbreviated new drug application to describe efforts made to create or negotiate entry into a single, shared system. Effective immediately, this applies to all approved applications regardless of approval date."
