    "content": "The FDA regulates the safety of foods, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, and medical devices, as well as tobacco products. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill provides FDA's annual funding, which includes direct appropriations and user fees. The bill specifies funding for FDA's major program areas and agency-wide support areas. The FDA is funded through the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, which includes direct appropriations and user fees. The appropriations committees use report language to recommend specific activities within major programs. Congress has often passed omnibus or consolidated appropriations legislation instead of the standard procedure of passing 12 annual regular appropriations acts. The FDA is funded through appropriations bills, with the process starting each year when the President releases a budget request to Congress. The annual FDA Justification of Estimates provides program-level details and highlights for the upcoming year. Analysts cannot track exact changes over time due to varying discussion topics, but the detail offers insight into the agency's operations. The President's FY2011 request for FDA funding is $4.032 billion, 22.8% higher than FY2010-enacted appropriations. The request includes a 6.2% increase in budget authority and a 33.7% increase in user fees for various programs. Tobacco product fees contribute significantly to the overall increase as FDA expands its regulatory authority. The FY2011 FDA budget request is $4.032 billion, a 22.8% increase from FY2010. The requested increase in user fees, excluding tobacco product fees, is 14%. An additional $290 million in proposed new user fees includes generic drug user fees, food export certification fees, reinspection fees, and food inspection and facility registration fees. The total user request is $1.523 billion, a 65.2% increase over FY2010. Major initiatives planned for FY2011 are described in the budget justification documents. The FDA's FY2011 budget request includes a 22.8% increase to $4.032 billion. Major initiatives include Transforming Food Safety, Protecting Patients, and Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health. These initiatives aim to set safety standards, enhance surveillance, modernize supply chain safety, and expand regulatory science efforts. The FDA's third initiative, Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health, aims to build scientific infrastructure, develop standards for new technologies, modernize product evaluation standards, and accelerate medical therapy development. Specific activities include integrating with state and local governments, collaborating with foreign public health organizations, enhancing risk assessment tools, improving food safety systems, participating in nanotechnology initiatives, and hiring more laboratory staff. The budget justification narrative for the Human Drugs program includes expanding involvement with nanotechnology, implementing a risk-based program for clinical site inspections, improving human subject protection, and validating a new electronic drug registration system. Activities for the Biologics program in FY2011 involve increasing outreach to improve industry practices and capacity building to reduce disease transmission risks. The FDA is focusing on reducing disease transmission risks through various initiatives such as using nanoparticles in analytic tests, developing tests with stem cells, hiring and training investigators for medical product inspections, and evaluating vaccine safety. For the Animal Drugs and Feeds program, efforts include regulating new animal biotechnology products, expanding antimicrobial resistance monitoring, improving food safety inspection capacity, and enhancing state surveillance activities. The Devices and Radiological Health program also has specific activities outlined. The FDA's Devices and Radiological Health program is involved in developing a national strategy for health-related electronic data, integrating pediatric data, enhancing surveillance, analyzing postmarket device information, overseeing foreign manufacturing facilities, setting standards for CT scanners and fluoroscopes, and recruiting scientists. The Tobacco Products program, funded by user fees, focuses on research and evaluation to understand how FDA regulations and tobacco control programs protect public health. The FDA's Tobacco Products program focuses on research and evaluation to understand how regulations and control programs protect public health. This includes developing a comprehensive framework for research, education programs, and inspections conducted by states and territories. The National Center for Toxicological Research is involved in developing rapid detection tests, training staff, and engaging in collaborative research. Funding for these initiatives comes from direct congressional appropriations and user fee revenue. The subcommittees on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies handle FDA appropriations. The process involves subcommittee consideration, hearings, bill markup, full committee review, and House and Senate passage of the appropriations bills. If discrepancies exist between House and Senate versions, a conference is convened to reconcile differences. The annual appropriations process for FY2011 began in February 2010 with the President's proposed budget. The Senate amended and approved the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, as no agriculture appropriations bill for FY2011 had been approved by either chamber. The House passed H.R. 3081, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011, allowing federal operations, including the FDA, to continue at FY2010 levels from October 1, 2010, through December 3, 2010. The next steps for FDA's FY2011 appropriations will likely occur within congressional negotiations for an omnibus bill or continuing resolutions. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg testified at a hearing on the President's FY2011 Request for FDA. Chair Rosa DeLauro held a markup of a bill for FDA's budget authority, including additional funding for various FDA programs. The bill also proposed creating an independent office of post-market drug evaluation. The Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies of the Senate Committee on Appropriations discussed FDA's budget for FY2011, including the proposal to establish an independent office for post-market drug evaluation. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg testified, and the bill would allocate $2.516 billion in budget authority and $1.233 billion in user fees for a total FDA program level of $3.75 billion. The committee did not include $290 million in Administration-requested user fees for generic drug review, reinspection, export certification, and food inspection. They recommended increasing funding for food safety, drug safety, and regulatory science in agreement with the President's request. The committee also urged FDA to develop a program with states to increase inspection of imported shrimp for banned antibiotics and directed FDA to report on progress towards developing guidance on clinical trials. The committee recommended FDA activities on antimicrobial resistance, critical path spending, pediatric device availability, and drug supply chain reporting. They directed FDA to use $22 million for critical path initiative, with $6 million for partnerships, including $2 million for tuberculosis research. FDA was also directed to report on critical path spending semi-annually and on the status of the drug supply chain. The committee directed FDA to report on the status of its work with electronic track-and-trace technologies for the drug supply chain. It recommended funding increases for various programs, including $97 million for the generic drugs program and $16 million for orphan product development grants. Additionally, the committee supported the expansion of nanotechnology research and allocated funds for Mammography Quality Standards Act activities. The committee recommended funding increases for various programs, including $6 million for the Office of Women's Health and a $1 million increase to hire staff for drug development. They also encouraged FDA to combat fraud in the seafood industry and initiate traceability projects on food products linked to outbreaks."
