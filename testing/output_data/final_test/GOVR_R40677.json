Some prizes reward past accomplishments, while others aim to achieve scientific and technical goals. These goals include identifying new ideas, demonstrating technologies, promoting development, addressing societal challenges, and educating the public. This report focuses on federally-funded \"innovation inducement\" prizes that aim to address societal challenges and educate the public about research and innovation. Prizes offer an alternative to traditional methods like grants and contracts, encouraging risk-taking and engaging a wider community of problem solvers. Prizes in innovation programs vary in intentions, funding sources, competition mechanisms, and participants. Concerns include inhibiting information exchange, design challenges, and duplicative work. Prizes can take the form of recognition, cash, marketing monopolies, or other means, with non-monetary rewards also considered important. Prizes in innovation programs are valued for more than just financial rewards. Competitors consider flexibility in rules, risks, and incentives. Federal agencies like DOE, DOD, HHS, and NASA conduct prize competitions. The DOD Wearable prize was authorized by the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act of 2007. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 authorized the Department of Defense to award cash prizes for outstanding achievements in research and technology development. The first competition focused on developing a long-endurance, lightweight power pack for warfighters. The goal was to inspire innovative solutions, engage non-traditional performers, and encourage collaboration across academia, industry, and private inventors. The DOD Wearable Power Prize competition aimed to inspire innovative solutions in developing a lightweight power pack for warfighters. The winning system had to weigh 4 kg or less and meet energy requirements. The competition successfully reached technological targets and expanded the network of interested parties. DOD officials are now discussing next steps to advance the technology with winners and participants. The DOD Wearable Power Prize competition provided benefits to both winners and participants. It validated DOD investments, identified new approaches, raised national awareness on wearable power, and facilitated collaboration between the Pentagon and military Services. Competitors had access to DOD-paid testing and received feedback from DOD professionals. The DOD Wearable Power Prize competition provided benefits to winners and participants through validation of investments, new approach identification, and national awareness on wearable power. Competitors had access to DOD-paid testing, feedback, and opportunities for collaborative discussions and networking. Lessons learned included choosing topics of broad public interest, involving stakeholders from the beginning, setting competition metrics, addressing joint-service needs, lowering entry barriers, and prudent screening of concepts. The DARPA Grand Challenges were authorized in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, allowing for cash prizes to promote science, mathematics, engineering, or technology education in support of the missions of the U.S. Department of Defense. Discussions are ongoing for additional competitions on different technological challenges as part of the DOD prize program. The DARPA Grand Challenges were authorized to promote science, engineering, and technology education for the U.S. Department of Defense. DARPA focused on autonomous robotic ground vehicles to achieve the goal of fielding unmanned combat vehicles by 2015. The Grand Challenges aimed to enable the autonomous operation of these vehicles to navigate intelligently and avoid obstacles during field tests. The DARPA Grand Challenge program aimed to promote innovation in autonomous robotic ground vehicles by setting performance goals for distance and speed. The program offered cash prizes for first, second, and third place winners. Participants were responsible for the cost of developing and fielding their vehicles. DARPA did not provide funding for entry or participation. Teams underwent a qualification process to demonstrate their vehicle's capabilities. The DARPA Grand Challenge program involved a qualification process called the National Qualification Event (NQE) where participants submitted technical papers and demonstrated their vehicle capabilities. The NQE led to the selection of semifinalists for the Grand Challenge Event. In 2004 and 2005, DARPA held Grand Challenges, and in 2007, they hosted the Urban Challenge, an autonomous vehicle race through traffic. Participants in 2004 failed to complete the course, while in 2005, five teams finished the 132-mile desert terrain course. In 2007, teams had to build autonomous vehicles capable of driving in traffic and performing complex maneuvers. The DARPA Urban Challenge showcased breakthrough advances in autonomous vehicle capability, with eleven teams competing and three winners. DARPA has no immediate plans for another Grand Challenge event, but if held, it would likely focus on a different topic. Teams are now identifying transition targets and partners, with Oshkosh Truck planning logistics demonstrations for the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy on various vehicle platforms. The DARPA Urban Challenge program successfully achieved its goals and attracted joint investment from participants in the defense and automotive industries, academia, and smaller organizations. The technical challenge was well-defined, leading to cross-fertilization among competing groups. The DARPA Urban Challenge program attracted investment from defense and automotive industries, academia, and smaller organizations. It successfully accelerated autonomous ground vehicle technology for deployment on the battlefield. The DOE Grand Challenges, authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, include the Freedom Prize, Hydrogen Prize, and Lighting Prize to encourage breakthrough achievements in research and technology with potential battlefield applications. The Freedom Prize and Hydrogen Prize, part of the DOE Grand Challenges, aim to promote innovation in technologies to enhance national security, economic prosperity, and reduce dependence on foreign oil. The Freedom Prize focuses on various sectors like industry, military, schools, government, and community, with plans to award $1.5 million in prizes. The Hydrogen Prize, established in EISA 2007, aims to advance hydrogen energy technologies through competitive cash prizes.

Companies must have 2,000 product samples ready for testing to officially enter the competition. The winning entry will be determined by a technical review committee, with opportunities for federal purchasing agreements and other incentives. If no submissions are received by June 2010, the DOE may close the competition or revise its standards. The L-prize competition, managed by the DOE, aims to develop ultra-efficient lighting products to replace traditional lamps. There are approximately 23 partners involved in marketing winning technologies across 29 states. The Progressive Automotive X PRIZE, sponsored by Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, seeks to inspire super-efficient vehicles to reduce oil dependency and combat climate change. The federal government often collaborates with other organizations to administer prizes. An alternative approach for the federal government is to support a competition managed by a private or philanthropic organization, rather than administering the prize itself. The competition offers a $10 million purse for developing clean, super fuel-efficient vehicles exceeding 100 MPG equivalent fuel economy. The focus is on production-capable cars for purchase, with no specified technology but clear technical boundaries. The goal is to attract both existing automobile manufacturers and newcomers, along with private investment, donors, sponsors, and partners to help competitors succeed. The competition offers a $10 million purse for developing clean, super fuel-efficient vehicles exceeding 100 MPG equivalent fuel economy. Over 100 teams with 136 vehicles and 14 fuel sources have passed the first judging stage. The next stage involves judging vehicle designs for features, production capability, safety, and business plans. Teams will compete in a long-distance stage competition to assess vehicle performance. The DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy provided a $3.5 million grant to the Progressive. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy granted $3.5 million to the Progressive Automotive X PRIZE for educational activities related to the competition, including a website called Fuel Our Future. Plans for the funds also include a national high school student contest and educational events in host cities of the race series. The competition aims to encourage manufacturers to develop and introduce vehicles with \"green\" principles. The Green Challenge Award sponsored by the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) with EPA, DOE, and the SAE as co-sponsors, encourages manufacturers to develop \"green\" technologies for auto racing. The competition focuses on the fastest car with the smallest environmental footprint, promoting efficiency, renewable fuels, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. EPA, DOE, and SAE created rules for the competition, which includes testing technologies during the 1,000-mile Petit Le Mans race in the 2008 season. The 2008 racing season saw the creation of rules and regulations for the Green Racing Work Group competition by EPA, DOE, and SAE. The ALMS funded the competition, with auto companies supporting the research and development of cars. Thirty-seven cars competed for a trophy, with winners announced for prototype and grand touring classes. The competition showcased diesel injection technology's ability to reduce emissions while maintaining high performance. The Michelin Green X Challenge competition, sponsored by ALMS and Michelin, continued in 2009. The NASA Centennial Challenges were authorized in 2005 to award cash prizes for innovation in aerospace technology. The competitions began in 2009 at each ALMS race, with Green Challenge awards presented to vehicle manufacturers with the highest scores at the end of the season. The NASA Centennial Challenges, authorized in 2005, aim to encourage participation in aerospace research and development through competitions with prizes ranging from $300,000 to $2 million. The astronaut glove challenge, managed by Spaceflight America, seeks to improve glove design for tasks in space. The 2009 Astronaut Glove Challenge consisted of two competitions, with a $200,000 prize won by an aerospace engineer who started his own company to produce spacesuit gloves. The other $50,000 prize for a mechanical counter pressure glove went unclaimed. The challenge aimed to promote the development of highly dexterous and flexible gloves for astronauts. The general aviation technology competition, managed by the CAFE Foundation, focuses on reducing the environmental impact of aircraft.

The Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge, managed by the X PRIZE Foundation, offers $2.0 million in prize money for building and flying a rocket-powered vehicle under Moon-like conditions. In 2008, the competition's level one winner received $350,000. In 2009, competitors will vie for the remaining $1.65 million in level two of the Space Elevator Games competition between July 20, 2009, to October 31, 2009. Nine teams, including five veteran and four new teams, have registered. The Power Beaming and Tether prize, managed by the Spaceward Foundation, involves two competitions where teams demonstrate wireless power transmission and build devices to climb a vertical cable. Previous competitions in 2006, 2007, and 2008 had no winners of the $2 million prize. Another competition is planned for July 2009. The MoonROx Challenge, managed by the California Space Education and Workforce Institute, aims to extract breathable oxygen from lunar regolith. The NASA Centennial Challenges drive progress in aerospace technology and encourage participation from independent teams, inventors, student groups, and companies. The next competition is scheduled for October 2009. NASA's Centennial Challenges program aims to find solutions to technical challenges through competition and cooperation. The program evaluates its success based on awarding prizes and communicating technology advancements. Team diversity and technology variety exceeded expectations, with increased participation and technical maturity as prize purses grow. Previous competitions had participating teams investing $50,000 - $100,000 each for $300,000 prizes, while teams invested $250,000 - $500,000 each for a $2 million prize. NASA's Centennial Challenge competitions with a $2 million prize purse saw teams investing $250,000 - $500,000 each. The competitions have spurred new businesses and products, encouraging diverse participation and multiple solution paths. Participants ranged from individual inventors to university students and professors, showcasing innovations like pressure suit gloves and reusable rocket engines. At the Challenge event, sixteen prototypes were demonstrated for NASA, developed at no cost to the government. Prizes have a high return on investment as NASA only provides prize money, with administration handled by non-profit organizations. During the Lunar Lander Challenge, private teams invested 70,000 hours and $12 million to win $2 million. Prizes generate public interest, create new businesses, and partners for NASA. For example, the winner of the 2007 Astronaut Glove Challenge started a new business manufacturing pressure suit gloves. NASA is considering future challenges focused on energy storage systems, renewable energy technologies, laser communications, near-Earth object survey and deflection strategies, and aviation safety and efficiency. They will consult widely for topic selection and aim to balance challenges across various fields while broadening competitor teams and host venues. Armadillo Aerospace partners with NASA for reusable rocket engines and commercial sales. BARDA manages Project BioShield, which accelerates research, development, and purchase of medical countermeasures against CBRN agents. Project BioShield Act of 2004 authorizes the project with provisions including a government-market guarantee for purchasing countermeasures in development. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act modified the Project BioShield Act to allow milestone-based payments for countermeasure development. Awards range from less than $1 million to almost $900 million, with products added to the Strategic National Stockpile. However, some awards were cancelled or unfilled due to immaturity and excessive risk associated with awarding contracts. Members of Congress interested in federally-funded innovation inducement prizes may wish to create new prizes or modify current programs. Policymakers should seek input from stakeholders including participants, sponsors, partner organizations, and users to explore the possibility of additional prizes. Studies have examined whether prizes are an appropriate policy mechanism compared to alternatives. Prizes are a policy mechanism to achieve societal goals, with discussions on prize design, administration, financing, and other considerations. Goals of prizes include achieving scientific or technological advancements, promoting publicity for technologies, addressing societal challenges, educating the public about research and innovation, and stimulating research efforts. Prizes are a policy mechanism to achieve societal goals, with discussions on prize design, administration, financing, and other considerations. Agencies also discussed the benefits of prizes for expanding the network of researchers and enhancing communication among researchers. Policymakers may wish to identify broader goals and encourage mechanisms for achieving them, such as using prizes for educating students about science and engineering. Policymakers interested in prizes should consider studies on innovation inducement prizes, which show that well-designed prizes can reach a wider community of problem-solvers than grants. Prizes are useful when the desired output is not patentable, R&D funding mechanisms are too risk-averse, or there is an inadequate private market. They can focus attention on innovation goals and be tailored more precisely than other reward systems. Prizes can be beneficial for reaching a wider community of problem-solvers compared to grants, but they may not be as effective in achieving certain societal goals. For example, prizes may not be suitable for enhancing basic scientific understanding or educating the next generation of researchers. Participation in prize competitions may also be limited by insufficient funds. Design is crucial for the success of prizes, and interested parties should carefully consider their approach. Interested parties should carefully consider how their resources and goals align with different prize design elements. Design elements include the institutional setting, technological target, financial award, and victory conditions. It is important to understand the effectiveness and efficiency of prize programs when implemented experimentally. McKinsey & Company emphasizes the benefits of prizes in driving excellence, innovation, and societal impact, but acknowledges the challenges in designing successful prize programs. Prizes are most effective when there is a clear goal, a large pool of potential solvers, and defined success criteria. Brookings Institution highlights that prizes are suitable for goals that can be concretely defined. Prizes are effective for goals with clear definitions, allowing for innovative solutions and private sector investment. However, challenges include funding for entrants and defining victory conditions in advance. Multiple teams working on the same project may not be the best use of resources. Innovation inducement prizes are a powerful mechanism for encouraging competition and innovation, but may have high administrative costs. Administering a prize involves various factors such as deadlines, financing, competitor selection, judging procedures, intellectual property, liability, and public relations. The cost of administration may exceed the financial reward for winners. Policymakers should consider whether a federal agency, a nonprofit organization, or another entity should administer the prize competition. Some experts suggest that a growing prize industry could improve outcomes by professionalizing the prize process with more formal knowledge and experience. However, challenges include less control over judging quality and difficulty integrating prize activities with other organizational events. Prize financing includes the prize purse for competitors and administration costs, which can sometimes exceed the prize amount. Prizes are financed through various mechanisms, with some funded and staffed by federal agencies, while others receive support from outside nonprofit organizations. Competitors do not receive funding from the federal agency or private organizations involved in the prize competition and must seek financial sponsorship on their own. This can be a challenge for universities, small companies, or nonprofit organizations participating in prize competitions. The availability of financing can determine the competitiveness of companies or organizations in prize competitions. Without specific funding, authorized competitions may not take place. Agencies may need to request funding or set aside funds from existing programs. Difficult economic conditions can limit financial support from non-governmental partners. When developing legislation for federally-funded innovation inducement prizes, policymakers should consider the availability of financing, potential limitations on financial support from non-governmental partners, and the handling of prize funding if no competitor meets the technological conditions to win within a specified timeframe. Policymakers may need to decide whether to revise conditions and prize funding annually or make policy decisions on the continuation of the competition. When developing legislation for federally-funded innovation inducement prizes, policymakers must decide on the level of detail to include, such as prize goals, participant eligibility, administration, and evaluation. They also need to consider the flexibility agencies have in determining prize goals and administration. Key questions include the prize topic, program goals, timeframe, monetary award, and publicity associated with winning the prize. When developing legislation for federally-funded innovation inducement prizes, policymakers must consider key details such as prize goals, participant eligibility, administration, and evaluation. Questions arise regarding the level of detail needed, including the prize topic, program goals, timeframe, monetary award, and publicity. Other considerations include intermediary prizes, eligibility of participants like federal employees or foreign entities, and the administration of the program by federal agencies or non-federal organizations. When developing legislation for federally-funded innovation inducement prizes, policymakers must consider key details such as prize goals, participant eligibility, administration, and evaluation. Questions arise regarding the level of detail needed, including the prize topic, program goals, timeframe, monetary award, and publicity. Congress may decide that an existing program needs modification to meet national goals, with legislation authorizing prizes varying in specificity. The guidance of the science and technology community and experienced administrators is crucial in addressing challenges like determining contest rules, judging criteria, appeal processes, and program evaluation. Flexibility in prize legislation is essential due to the evolving nature of science and engineering. Some federally-funded innovation inducement prizes have specific legislation governing their management and winner determination, while others leave decisions to the administering agency. Members of Congress may want to adjust the timeframe and conditions of prizes based on stakeholder input. Stakeholders can include universities, schools, science societies, trade associations, and more. Policymakers interested in increasing oversight may focus on the management of prizes. The effectiveness of federally-funded innovation inducement prizes should be evaluated based on whether goals were achieved, objectives clearly communicated, and program well administered. Policymakers can use oversight mechanisms to determine if existing prizes should be continued, enhanced, or new ones authorized. Evaluation criteria include whether the contest led to advanced innovation, identified new ideas, demonstrated technology feasibility, solved challenging problems, and highlighted best practices. The curr_chunk discusses how innovation inducement prizes can address societal challenges, promote technology development, educate the scientific community, raise public awareness, and attract private funding. It emphasizes the impact of prizes in setting standards, driving competition, and celebrating community achievements. In the 111th Congress, federally-funded innovation inducement prizes were supported through the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. NASA was allocated funds for its Centennial Challenges program in the FY2010 appropriations process. Legislation was introduced to establish prizes on various science and engineering topics. H.R. 41 in the 111th Congress would establish prizes for self-powered farms and the Voting Integrity and Verification Act of 2009 (S. 48) would award cash prizes for voting system advancements. The New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence Act (H.R. 513) aims to award prizes for the development of energy technologies like hybrid vehicles, solar power plants, biofuels, and nuclear fusion reactions to enhance accessibility and independence for persons with disabilities during voting. The Department of Energy would administer a prize program to advance research, development, and commercial application of these technologies. The Nanotechnology Innovation and Prize Competition Act of 2009 (S. 596) directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a program to award prizes for achievements in nanotechnology applications, including improving the environment and following the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry. The Nanotechnology Innovation and Prize Competition Act of 2009 (S. 596) aims to award prizes for achievements in nanotechnology applications, including environmental improvement and adherence to the Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry. The bill would establish a board to oversee the program and could provide financial awards or recognition for outstanding achievements in nanotechnology. The Cybersecurity Act of 2009 (S. 773) aims to establish cybersecurity competitions and challenges with cash prizes to attract talented individuals for the Federal IT workforce and stimulate innovation in cybersecurity research and technology development. The program targets different groups including students and academic institutions, with competition topics developed by the NIST Director. Advisory committees may provide guidance, and $15 million is allocated for the program. The New Options Petroleum Energy Conservation Act of 2009 (H.R. 1794) would authorize $15 million for NIST annually from FY2010 to FY2014. The Act also mandates the Secretary of Energy to establish a program awarding a $1 billion prize to the first U.S. automobile manufacturer to produce and sell 60,000 midsized sedans in the U.S. that can travel 100 miles per gallon on gasoline."
