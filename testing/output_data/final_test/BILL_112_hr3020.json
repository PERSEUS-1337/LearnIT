The Puerto Rico Investment Promotion Act of 2011 allows qualified Puerto Rico corporations to be treated as domestic corporations for tax purposes if at least 50% of their gross income is derived from sources within Puerto Rico. An election under this section can be revoked by the Secretary if the corporation fails to meet the requirements, and the revocation applies to the year revoked and subsequent years. The election may not apply to any taxable year before the 4th taxable year following the most recent preceding taxable year for which the election was in effect. Making the election treats the corporation as transferring all assets to a domestic corporation, while termination of the election has implications under section 367. Under section 367, if a corporation makes an election for a taxable year and then stops applying it for subsequent years, it will be treated as transferring all its property to a foreign corporation. Any election made under this section will be disregarded for intangibles. Additionally, a qualified Puerto Rico corporation with an election under this section cannot be included in any consolidated return. Under section 367, a corporation's election for a taxable year may not be included in any consolidated return. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D. The amendments allow Puerto Rico corporations to be treated as domestic corporations for taxable years starting after September 30, 2011."
