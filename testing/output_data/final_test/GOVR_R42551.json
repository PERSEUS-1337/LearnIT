    "content": "The U.S. sugar program provides a price guarantee to sugar beet and sugarcane producers and processors. The USDA administers the program to limit sugar supply for food use in the U.S. market. Tools include price support loans, marketing allotments, import quotas, and a sugar-to-ethanol backstop. The U.S. sugar program provides price guarantees to sugar beet and sugarcane producers and processors, with tools like price support loans, marketing allotments, import quotas, and a sugar-to-ethanol backstop. Producers and processors support extending the program, citing reliable supplies of sugar at reasonable prices and an economic safety net, all achieved at zero cost to taxpayers. The American Sugar Alliance represents sugar crop producers and processors. Sugar crop producers and processors, represented by the American Sugar Alliance (ASA), are supported by two large farm organizations in continuing the current sugar program without changes. The American Farm Bureau Federation believes the sugar program should remain intact, while the National Farmers Union encourages Congress to work with sugar producers for a strong program in future farm bills. A coalition of 17 developing countries benefiting from U.S. sugar market access also favors maintaining the current policy. Sugar users support making changes to the U.S. sugar program. Manufacturers of sugar-containing food products and beverages support changes to the U.S. sugar program, citing excessive government intervention leading to high sugar prices, job losses, and inequity in benefits for sugar growers. Sugar users, represented by the Coalition for Sugar Reform, advocate for reform. The Coalition for Sugar Reform (CSR) includes food and beverage companies, consumer and trade advocacy groups, and business organizations. Three trade associations representing food manufacturing firms placed U.S. sugar policy at the top of their legislative agenda. Congressional opponents introduced bills in 2013 to revise U.S. sugar policy, proposing to retain the current structure but modify price support and marketing. Efforts to revise U.S. sugar policy in 2013 aimed to maintain the current structure but make changes to price support, marketing, and import quota provisions. The bills sought to provide flexibility to the USDA in managing sugar supplies while ensuring the program operates at no cost. Congressional action on an omnibus farm bill post-2012 elections was unsuccessful, leading to a focus on extending existing authorities for agricultural commodity programs, including sugar, through the \"fiscal cliff\" bill. The \"fiscal cliff\" bill extended 2008 farm bill provisions for one year, including the sugar program authority for the 2013 sugar crops. The Senate had previously considered a farm bill that would have continued existing sugar program authorities, with proposed amendments to phase out the program within three years being defeated. S.Amdt. 2433 aimed to revert program authorities to pre-2008 levels and repeal the sugar-to-ethanol program. The House and Senate proposed bills to maintain the sugar program without changes, with an unsuccessful attempt to amend it during Senate debate. The House also debated future sugar policy but did not consider the proposed changes. The Senate Agriculture Committee proposed reauthorizing the 2008 farm bill sugar program without changes through 2018. An amendment to revise the sugar program provisions was defeated during floor debate on S. 954. Senator Shaheen's amendment, S.Amdt. 925, aimed to reduce sugar price support levels and make changes to USDA's administration of sugar marketing allotments and import quotas to ensure sugar availability at reasonable prices. The amendment was defeated on a 45-54 vote. The House Agriculture Committee proposed reauthorizing the 2008 farm bill sugar program without changes through crop year 2018. The bill also called for reauthorizing the sugar-for-ethanol program in the Energy title. The House Agriculture Committee proposed reauthorizing the sugar program without changes through 2018, including the sugar-for-ethanol program. Representative Goodlatte filed an amendment to revise the sugar program but withdrew it. A scaled-back farm bill without a nutrition title was considered, reauthorizing sugar program authorities indefinitely but the sugar-for-ethanol program only through 2018. This measure passed the House on July 11 by a 216-208 vote. On October 11, 2013, the House debated H.Res. 378 to instruct House farm bill conferees to \"advance provisions to repeal\" a sugar program requirement added by the 2008 farm bill. This requirement limits USDA's ability to increase sugar imports under a quota until after April 1, unless there is an emergency shortage. Members supporting food manufacturers sought a return to the previous discretionary authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to manage sugar supplies throughout the marketing year. The House defeated a resolution to manage sugar supplies, with sugar producers and processors applauding the continuation of current policy. Food manufacturers expressed disappointment over the failure to reform the sugar program, citing costs to taxpayers and job losses. During the 113th Congress, supporters of current sugar policy proposed a resolution urging the President to eliminate other countries' sugar subsidies. If all covered countries comply, a \"zero for zero\" sugar subsidy policy would be implemented. Opponents introduced measures in H.R. 1567 and S. 956 to eliminate sugar price support and import quota provisions. The Congressional Budget Office projected that the continuation of current sugar policy would result in budget outlays of $39 million over 5 years and $188 million over 10 years. The projection assumed that USDA may need to activate the sugar-to-ethanol program in some years. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute estimates that sugar policy as enacted by the 2014 farm bill would result in outlays. The Sugar Reform Act amendment, as projected by the CBO, would result in outlays of $133 million over 5 years and $446 million over 10 years. The savings from the amendment would amount to $27 million over 5 years and $82 million over 10 years. The repeal of the sugar-to-ethanol program would lead to USDA incurring outlays for administering the sugar program's price support operations. Opponents argue that the sugar program is not cost-free, citing federal outlays in recent years, while supporters highlight the directive in the 2008 farm bill for USDA to operate the program at no cost. The 2008 farm bill directs USDA to administer the sugar program at no cost to taxpayers. Non-recourse price support loans guarantee minimum prices for sugar processors. USDA took actions to prevent loan forfeitures in 2012, leading to $259 million in budget outlays for the sugar-to-ethanol program. The sugar policy debate in recent years has focused on the price level for domestic sugar. Sugar growers and processors wanted the highest possible price, while users of sugar in food products wanted lower prices. Processors aimed to maintain minimum price guarantees, while users sought to reduce them by 4% to 5%. The program was designed to accommodate uncertainties around sugar imports from Mexico. The USDA sought more flexibility in managing the sugar program to lower market prices for raw cane and refined sugar. Domestic sugar prices are expected to remain stable for the rest of FY2014 due to lower production, reduced imports from Mexico, and increased demand. The USDA aims to comply with Congress' mandate to run the sugar program without taxpayer expense. Food manufacturers plan to continue fighting for reform by working with House and Senate leaders. Supporters and opponents anticipate ongoing battles over the sugar program's future due to foreign sugar subsidies. The U.S. sugar policy is deemed necessary due to trade-distorting policies of other countries. The sugar industry advocates for an end to current U.S. sugar policy once these trade policies are disciplined through WTO negotiations. However, progress in WTO negotiations has been slow, indicating that changes to U.S. sugar policy may not happen for some time. The sugar industry seeks joint management of sugar by the US and Mexican governments to balance supply and demand. The industry defends the sugar program's cost, stating it was less than 3% of commodity program spending in FY2013."
