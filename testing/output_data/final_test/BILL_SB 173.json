    "title": "SB 173",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 10721 of the Water Code is amended to provide definitions for terms related to groundwater adjudication actions and basins, as outlined in Bulletin 118. The Water Code defines terms related to groundwater adjudication actions and basins, including coordination agreements between groundwater sustainability agencies, de minimis extractors, governing bodies, groundwater extraction facilities, and groundwater recharge. Groundwater recharge is the augmentation of groundwater, while a groundwater sustainability agency implements provisions for managing groundwater. A groundwater sustainability plan is proposed or adopted by the agency, and a groundwater sustainability program benefits a basin. Local agencies with water supply, water management, or land use responsibilities within a groundwater basin are involved in these activities. The definitions of \"Operator,\" \"Owner,\" \"Personal information,\" and \"Planning and implementation horizon\" are provided in relation to groundwater extraction facilities and sustainability planning. The operator is presumed to be the owner unless proven otherwise to the governing body. Personal information is defined as per the Civil Code, and the planning horizon is a 50-year period for implementing sustainability measures in a basin. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to groundwater management, including terms like \"public water system,\" \"recharge area,\" \"sustainability goal,\" \"sustainable groundwater management,\" and \"sustainable yield.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding and implementing groundwater sustainability plans. The curr_chunk defines \"undesirable results\" related to groundwater conditions, including chronic lowering of groundwater levels, reduction of groundwater storage, seawater intrusion, degraded water quality, and land subsidence interfering with surface land uses. The curr_chunk provides definitions related to water management, including terms like \"water budget,\" \"watermaster,\" \"water year,\" and \"wellhead protection area.\""
