    "content": "The U.S. strategy of engagement with China includes trade as a key component to achieve national security goals and promote economic growth. Trade with China is seen as beneficial for both countries, allowing for efficient resource allocation and opportunities for U.S. businesses in the rapidly developing Chinese economy. The Chinese economy presents a rare opportunity for U.S. businesses due to its rapid growth and market expansion. China's membership in the WTO enforces international trading rules, fostering market forces. Foreign trade and investment create dependencies that strengthen China's relations with the Western world and exert a moderating influence on Beijing's policies towards national security. The Chinese economy's rapid growth and market expansion present opportunities for U.S. businesses. China's WTO membership enforces international trading rules, fostering market forces and exerting a moderating influence on Beijing's policies towards national security. Challenges from the U.S. strategy of economic engagement with China include adjusting to economic competition, responding to unfair trade practices, and dealing with a more assertive China in global affairs. The U.S. trade deficit with China is influenced by Beijing's undervalued currency and poor record on working conditions and environmental regulations. Economic engagement with China may strengthen its socialist government and military. Trade disputes are typically resolved bilaterally before involving the WTO. The United States is considering taking the case to the WTO for dispute resolution regarding China's alleged violations of international labor and environmental standards. Policy options include improving China's compliance through various means such as bilateral consultations, international organizations, and the threat of trade sanctions. In response to unfair trade practices, the U.S. has taken actions while China has made some incremental steps to address U.S. demands. In December 2006, the first China-U.S. Strategic Economic Dialogue was held to discuss issues related to trade. The U.S. Treasury Department did not accuse China of currency manipulation for trade advantage. The Bush Administration applied military catch-all rule to exports to China. The U.S. and China reached a textile trade agreement in 2005. The China WTO Textile Safeguard, lasting through 2008, covers over 30 products with quotas starting at low levels. In 2005, China revalued its currency and the US imposed safeguard quotas on Chinese apparel. Additionally, anti-dumping duties were imposed on Chinese bedroom furniture in 2004. In 2004 and 2006, the U.S. government rejected Section 301 petitions filed against China, urging for currency revaluation and addressing unfair trade practices. The Bush Administration also filed a complaint against China under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism in 2004. In 2004, the U.S. government filed a complaint against China under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism for unfair taxation on imported semiconductors. In 2006, Representative Sander Levin supported policies to address China's trade advantage through currency manipulation. Senator Max Baucus called for greater flexibility in China's currency. Several bills in Congress aimed to reduce the U.S. trade imbalance with China. Several bills in the 109th Congress aimed at addressing the U.S. trade imbalance with China, focusing on issues such as currency practices, unfair trade practices, intellectual property rights, and WTO compliance. Selected bills included H.R. 4808 to equalize tariff rates on motor vehicles, S. 2267 to withdraw normal trade relations with China, and H.R. 3283 amending trade regulations. Several bills in the 109th Congress aimed at addressing the U.S. trade imbalance with China, focusing on issues such as currency practices, unfair trade practices, intellectual property rights, and WTO compliance. H.R. 3283 (English: Introduced July 14, 2005) amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to impose countervailing duties on certain merchandise from nonmarket economy countries, including China. H.R. 1498 (Ryan: Introduced April 6, 2006) clarifies that exchange-rate manipulation by China is actionable under U.S. trade laws. S. 377 (Lieberman: Introduced February 15, 2005) requires negotiation and appropriate action with countries engaging in currency manipulation. S. 295 (Schumer/Graham: Introduced February 3, 2005) authorizes a 27.5% tariff on goods imported from China unless China revalues its currency. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to address the U.S. trade imbalance with China, focusing on currency practices, unfair trade practices, intellectual property rights, and WTO compliance. One bill urged the President to adopt recommendations to correct the trade imbalance with China, highlighting China's significant role in U.S. trade. China's trade with the EU and the US in 2005 was valued at $217.3 billion and $211.6 billion respectively. China is a major player in international trade, with the US being its largest export market. China has become the second largest source of US imports after Canada, accounting for over 14% of imports in 2005. The trade imbalance with China is also present in Europe and Japan, with China running a surplus with all three major economic centers. The U.S. had a bilateral deficit in 2005, larger than that of the EU-15 and Japan. The U.S. trade deficit with China is increasing, constituting 26% of its global trade deficit in 2005. China's share of the overall U.S. merchandise trade deficit fluctuated between 1996 and 2004. The data shows that U.S. exports to China have grown significantly, surpassing exports to Canada, Mexico, and Japan. China became the 4th largest market for U.S. goods in 2004, replacing Germany and the United Kingdom. Japan was the largest overseas supplier to China in 2005, followed by South Korea and the EU-15. In 2005, the U.S. and Japan were the top exporters to China with $69.8 billion and $61.9 billion in exports. The U.S. faces import competition from China in labor-intensive sectors, while China is advancing in technology. China exports mainly low-end manufactures to developed countries, while importing capital-intensive machinery and electronic goods. The U.S. runs trade deficits with China in some high value-added sectors like office and data processing. China is a major player in high value-added sectors such as office and data processing machines, telecommunications, and electrical machinery. It became the third largest car market in 2003 and the fourth largest car maker in 2005. Despite its significant car production, China heavily relies on foreign technology in this sector. The country's trade data show smaller bilateral deficits compared to its trading partners, with discrepancies attributed to products passing through Hong Kong and different accounting systems. China's trade data show discrepancies due to products passing through Hong Kong and different accounting systems. The U.S. and China have differing methods of counting exports transshipped through Hong Kong, leading to disagreements in trade deficit calculations. The U.S. Department of Commerce may overstate the deficit by 21% due to entrepot trade calculations. China reported a trade surplus of $114 billion with the U.S. in 2005, lower than U.S. figures. According to PRC data, China's trade surplus with the United States in 2005 was $114 billion, lower than the $201 billion reported by the United States. China also ran deficits with several major trading partners in 2005, including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Brazil, and Iran. Some trade specialists suggest that the increase in U.S. imports from China does not pose a significant threat to U.S. industries and workers as it represents a shift of investment and production from other Pacific Rim countries. In 2005, U.S. imports from East Asian NICS fell or barely rose. The rapid growth of the Chinese economy is increasing world demand for commodities like crude oil, copper, and soybeans. China has had a global trade surplus in goods since 1990, reaching a peak of $43.3 billion in 1998 before declining to $22.6 billion in 2001. China's global trade surplus peaked at $43.3 billion in 1998, declined to $22.6 billion in 2001, and surged to $102 billion in 2005. The current account surplus exceeded the merchandise trade surplus since 2002, with a current account surplus of $160.8 billion in 2005. Projections suggest China will maintain a surplus due to high foreign investment, strong exports, and excessive savings. In 2005, China reported smaller bilateral trade deficits compared to claims by its trading partners. The United States claimed a $201 billion trade deficit with China, while China reported a $114 billion trade surplus. Japan reported a $28.5 billion deficit with China, while China claimed a $16.3 billion deficit with Japan. The European Union's deficit with China was $121.8 billion, according to Chinese data. The \"world\" reported a $342 billion deficit with China, 3.3 times China's global merchandise trade deficit of $102 billion. China's imports have significantly impacted global commodity markets, with a notable increase in demand for machinery and mineral fuel. This surge in imports has led to rising world prices, especially for commodities like crude petroleum. Despite China's growing manufacturing prowess and trade surplus with the United States, the country continues to heavily purchase from neighboring trading partners. In 2004, China's imports rose by 35%, including machinery and raw materials. China's imports rose by 35% in 2004, including machinery, raw materials, and components for manufacturing. The growth in imports slowed to 17% in 2005. Over half of China's exports are produced by foreign-owned companies, with 70% of exports to the United States containing foreign components. China has become the largest trading partner of Taiwan and the second largest trading partner of Japan. Taiwan had a trade surplus of $31.9 billion with China in 2005, while South Korea had a surplus of $31.2 billion. China is a significant buyer of raw materials, agricultural commodities, industrial machinery, and electronics. China is a major buyer of raw materials, agricultural commodities, industrial machinery, and electronic components from Southeast Asia. It is also the second largest source of foreign tourists in the region. ASEAN agreed to establish a free trade zone with China in 2004, despite concerns about economic competition. China's top exports to Southeast Asia include machinery, electronic goods, iron and steel, mineral fuels, textiles, and medical equipment. China's economic growth and open trade policies present both challenges and opportunities for its trading partners in Asia. China's export production continues to grow rapidly, with ASEAN accumulating a trade surplus with China in 2005. Trade specialists suggest that the surge of U.S. imports from China is offset by declining imports from other East Asian countries. This shift of investment and production to China includes countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Macao, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan in sectors such as footwear, handbags, apparel, and furniture. China's share of U.S. imports grew significantly from 3% in 1990 to 14% in 2005, displacing imports from Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Mexico. Mexico's share of U.S. imports also grew but then declined. China has maintained a trade surplus with the United States since 1993, with discrepancies in reported figures between the two countries. China has had a trade surplus with the United States since 1993, while the US has had trade deficits with China since 1983. Japan has also experienced a trade deficit with China since the 1980s. Japan's trade deficit with China peaked at $26.5 billion in 2001, growing to $28.5 billion in 2005. Japan's exports to China include electronics, machinery, iron and steel, and chemicals. The European Union had a trade deficit with China of $947 million in 1988. In 2005, the European Union had a trade deficit with China of $121.8 billion, while the U.S. had the largest deficit at $201 billion. Germany, the U.K., and France also had significant trade deficits with China. China's trade statistics show smaller European deficits or even surpluses.

The top U.S. imports from China in 2005 were office machines, telecommunications equipment, manufactured articles, apparel, electrical machinery, and furniture. The value of U.S. imports of office and data processing machines from China exceeded total U.S. exports to China in 2005. The most significant percentage changes have been in sectors like office and data processing machines (up 284%), telecommunications and sound equipment (245%), and general industrial machinery (234%). Trade patterns in modern economies are based on comparative advantage, with the US strong in high-technology goods, food, and capital intensive products, while China excels in cheap labor and low capital intensity. China's trade advantage lies in abundant cheap labor and a mix of technology in manufacturing and agriculture. This results in strong exports of labor-intensive goods like textiles, apparel, and electronics. Trade patterns show unbalanced sectors based on comparative advantage, with the US running a surplus in aircraft but a deficit in apparel. Intra-industry trade is common among industrialized countries like North America, the European Union, and Japan. The United States engages in intra-industry trade with countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, involving products with brand names and intellectual property rights. This trade includes items such as automobiles, machinery, electronic devices, prepared food, and pharmaceuticals. A significant portion of U.S. intra-industry trade occurs within multinational corporations. Trade deficits in competitive sectors may indicate import barriers used by trading partners to favor their trade balance. The U.S. balance of trade with China by major sectors is shown in Table 4. The United States runs trade deficits with China in sectors like toys, furniture, footwear, and machinery, reflecting China's low-cost labor and technological advancements. Surpluses are seen in aircraft, agricultural products, and cotton fabrics, showcasing U.S. competitive advantages. Trade surpluses in aircraft, copper, iron ores, and iron and steel with China increased in 2005. Imports from China in aircraft, copper, iron ores, and iron and steel rose significantly. Data on U.S. imports from China by selected industrial sectors are presented in charts comparing imports from other major exporting countries. The data is categorized according to two-digit standard international trade classification (SITC) codes. Industries with rising imports from China include iron and steel and automobiles. China has a significant role in the iron and steel industry, becoming a major exporter to the United States. In 2005, China was the fourth largest foreign supplier of iron and steel products to the US, surpassing several other countries. The US had a trade deficit with China in the iron and steel category but a trade surplus in primary form iron and steel products. China is a key supplier of industrial machinery, including machine tools and sewing machines, but lags behind other countries like the EU, Japan, and Canada. However, China has become the largest supplier of office machines and data processing equipment to the US, surpassing ASEAN. Imports from China in this category have increased significantly, accounting for 42% of US imports. Other East Asian countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have seen a leveling off or decrease in exports in this category.

China's share of U.S. imports in these categories increased significantly, surpassing other major suppliers like the EU, Japan, and ASEAN. Additionally, China became a significant supplier of electrical machinery and parts, including semi-conductors, accounting for 18% of U.S. imports in 2005. Mexico remained the leading foreign supplier in this category. China is a major player in the global automobile sector, with heavy foreign investment and joint ventures dominating the market. In 2005, China became a net exporter of vehicles, with exports mainly going to the Middle East, North Africa, and South America. Chinese auto makers are also looking to export passenger cars to the United States. Currently, China is not a significant player in the U.S. car market, with imports mainly consisting of auto parts, bicycles, and motorcycles. China has become a key supplier of auto parts to the United States, with $2 billion in selected auto parts in 2005. They also exported $290 million worth of motorcycles to the U.S. in the same year.
