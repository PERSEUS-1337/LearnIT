    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Organ Donation Awareness and Promotion Act of 2015\". Congress finds that there is a significant need for organ donation, with over 123,400 individuals on the waiting list in May 2015. In 2014, 14,413 individuals became organ donors, leading to 29,531 transplants, while 6,198 individuals died while waiting for a transplant. On average, 21 people die every day while waiting for an organ donation. Despite over 100,000,000 registered organ and tissue donors in the US, the demand still exceeds the supply. Many people are unaware of their donation options or have not communicated their wishes to their families. Organ and tissue donation can provide hope to those on the waiting list by allowing up to eight individuals to receive life-saving organs from a single deceased donor. Living donors can also save lives by donating a kidney, lung, or liver. The Sense of Congress is stated in Section 3. The Sense of Congress in Section 3 emphasizes the importance of public education on organ donation, honoring individuals who pledge to donate, and recognizing the generosity of deceased organ donors and their families.
