    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to establish procedures for seamless coverage transitions between Medi-Cal and the California Health Benefit Exchange. Section 14005.37 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require counties to conduct eligibility redeterminations for Medi-Cal beneficiaries annually and promptly when circumstances change. Loss of eligibility for cash aid under the CalWORKs program will not trigger a redetermination for Medi-Cal unless the reason for the loss would require a redetermination. A loss of contact, indicated by undeliverable mail, will prompt a redetermination according to specified procedures. Medi-Cal eligibility continues during redetermination process unless clear evidence shows beneficiary is no longer eligible. MAGI-based financial methods are used to determine eligibility, including exemptions. The county assesses potential eligibility for Medi-Cal benefits based on exemptions from MAGI-based financial methods, such as age, blindness, disability, or need for long-term care services. The beneficiary can request a determination of eligibility under these exemptions. The county gathers relevant information for Medi-Cal eligibility redeterminations from various sources, including beneficiary's file, case files of immediate family members, databases, and other available sources. In the case of an annual redetermination, the county notifies the beneficiary of their eligibility status and required information. The county makes efforts to avoid sending multiple notices at the same time and includes additional information such as enrollment in a new Medi-Cal program. In the case of an annual redetermination, if the county cannot determine eligibility based on provided information, the beneficiary will receive a prepopulated renewal form with additional required information. The beneficiary must submit the necessary information within 60 days of receiving the form. The beneficiary can respond to the county via Internet, mail, telephone, or in person. If returning the form in person or by mail, the form must be signed. The county will try to contact the beneficiary through various electronic means if necessary information is not provided within 60 days. The county will terminate Medi-Cal benefits if the beneficiary does not respond to a written request for information within 60 days. If the information provided is incomplete, the county will work with the beneficiary to complete it. The required form will be developed by the department in consultation with counties, eligibility workers, and consumers. The county may use existing renewal forms for beneficiaries not determined by MAGI-based methods until prepopulated renewal forms are developed by the state by January 1, 2015. In cases of redetermination due to a change in circumstances, if a county cannot obtain sufficient information, they must send a prepopulated form to the beneficiary with necessary renewal information. The form should only request information related to the change and not duplicate previously provided information. The Medi-Cal beneficiary must provide necessary information to the county within 30 days using various methods. Failure to respond within the specified time frame will not affect Medi-Cal eligibility. If a redetermination is needed due to loss of contact with the Medi-Cal beneficiary, a return of undeliverable mail will result in immediate termination of Medi-Cal eligibility. Beneficiaries must report any changes affecting their eligibility within 10 days. If a Medi-Cal beneficiary does not respond to a request for information within 30 days, their eligibility may be terminated after a 10-day notice. If a Medi-Cal beneficiary's eligibility is terminated or changed, they have 90 days to submit required information for redetermination by the county. If eligibility is confirmed or unchanged, termination is rescinded. If eligibility cannot be confirmed, benefits may be terminated following due process. The department, in collaboration with counties and consumer representatives, will establish a timeframe for redetermination of Medi-Cal eligibility based on disability. Forms and procedures will be made consumer-friendly for people with disabilities, with a reasonable opportunity to submit necessary information. Blindness will be considered ongoing until a physician determines otherwise. The county will consider disability as ongoing until a review team determines otherwise. If a beneficiary remains eligible for Medi-Cal benefits after a redetermination, a new 12-month eligibility period will begin. Ineligible individuals will be assessed for other insurance affordability programs, and if eligible, their electronic account will be transferred securely. If eligible for a qualified health plan through the California Health Benefit Exchange, Medi-Cal benefits will not be terminated until 20 days after receiving notice. Renewal forms and notices must be accessible to limited-English proficient and disabled individuals as required by federal and state laws. The requirements for providing information and reporting changes can be submitted through various modes as allowed by regulations. Forms must be signed under penalty of perjury, and electronic, telephonic, or handwritten signatures are accepted. The section defines \"MAGI-based financial methods\" for income calculation, specifies preferred contact methods for beneficiaries, and seeks federal approval to extend redetermination dates for certain Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The department will implement this section through various instructions until regulations are adopted, due by July 1, 2017. Status reports to the Legislature will be provided every six months until regulations are in place. Section 15927 of the Welfare and Institutions Code outlines procedures for individuals transitioning from a qualified health plan to Medi-Cal through CalHEERS. Referrals must be made to the individual's county of residence within three business days for eligibility determination. County processing timelines are established for effective Medi-Cal eligibility. The Welfare and Institutions Code outlines procedures for transitioning individuals to Medi-Cal through CalHEERS. Referrals must be made within three business days for eligibility determination. County processing prioritizes referrals based on timing to ensure effective Medi-Cal eligibility. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as outlined in the Government Code."
