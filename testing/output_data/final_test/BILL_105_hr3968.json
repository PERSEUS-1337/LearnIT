The Congress finds significant economic implications of the Year 2000 technology challenge for critical national infrastructures, with estimated private sector costs of roughly $50 billion. There is a lack of national and international frameworks to ensure the interdependent nature of these infrastructures. The General Accounting Office recommended that the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion quickly formulate a comprehensive picture of the Nation's Year 2000 readiness and establish public-private partnerships to resolve the crisis. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines the \"Year 2000 computer problem\" as any issue that hinders information technology from accurately processing date or time data between the 20th and 21st centuries, or with leap year calculations. The \"Year 2000 Conversion Council\" refers to the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. Before the end of the 90-day period, the Chairperson of the Year 2000 Conversion Council must submit a national assessment of the Year 2000 computer problem to Congress, covering critical national infrastructures and key sectors of the economy. This includes banking, finance, energy, telecommunications, transportation, vital human services, public health and safety, water supply, and environment. Additionally, a national strategy to address the Year 2000 computer problem will be developed. The Chairperson of the Year 2000 Conversion Council will prepare a national strategy for critical services to be ready for the Year 2000 date change, including banking, financial services, power, fuel, telecommunications, transportation, public health, safety, water supply, and environment. The Chairperson of the Year 2000 Conversion Council will include a plan for ensuring an adequate supply of technical personnel to address the Year 2000 computer problem in both the private sector and Federal Government before December 31, 1999. Recommendations may be made regarding the need to raise immigrant visa ceilings for this purpose. Additionally, recommendations will be made regarding the capacity of the Federal Government to attract and retain technical personnel. The Chairperson of the Year 2000 Conversion Council will consider establishing a Federal technology information service and submit a report to Congress within 6 months. Efforts at International Financial Institutions to solve the Year 2000 computer problem will include goals and strategies pursued by the United States. The United States will pursue goals and strategies at various international organizations to ensure readiness for the Year 2000 at financial institutions. Representatives are engaging international development banks to provide funding and technical assistance to developing countries for addressing the Year 2000 computer problem. The Chairperson of the Year 2000 Conversion Council is required to submit quarterly progress reports to Congress on solving the Year 2000 computer problem in critical infrastructures and key sectors of the economy, as well as developing a contingency plan. The final report will assess ongoing Year 2000 and other date-related problems. No reports will be required after December 31, 2001. The Federal Acquisition Regulation may be revised to impose penalties on contractors who knowingly provide non-Year 2000 compliant goods or services to a Federal agency. Such contractors may be ineligible for future contracts, but waivers may be granted if the new goods or services are Year 2000 compliant."
