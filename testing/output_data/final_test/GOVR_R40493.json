Taiwan decided not to seek full U.N. membership but to participate in specialized institutions. Typhoon Morakot caused significant damage and fatalities in Taiwan. U.S. policy on Taiwan aims to maintain the \"status quo\" for peace. The United States interprets the \"status quo\" in the Taiwan Strait as preserving peace and stability until Taiwan's political status is resolved peacefully. Changes in Taiwan and the PRC have shifted the military and economic balance, leading to speculation about future developments. The United States faces challenges in its Taiwan policy due to evolving economic interests and unresolved political issues. Key questions include how to balance PRC sensitivities with support for Taiwan's democracy, managing provocative actions, and reassessing policy in changing circumstances. The United States' Taiwan policy has evolved due to changing circumstances since World War II. After Mao Tse-tung's victory in 1949, the ROC government fled to Taiwan, leading to competing claims of sovereignty with the PRC government. In 1979, the US established diplomatic relations with the PRC as the sole government of China, impacting its relations with Taiwan. The United States' Taiwan policy has evolved since World War II, with the establishment of diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1979. Despite no formal diplomatic relations, the US maintains economic and security relationships with Taiwan, including selling military weapons. Current developments in Taiwan are influencing US policy choices towards the island. The United States' Taiwan policy has evolved since World War II, with the establishment of diplomatic relations with the PRC in 1979. Despite no formal diplomatic relations, the US maintains economic and security relationships with Taiwan, including selling military weapons. Current developments in Taiwan are influencing US policy choices towards the island, including historical complexities and tensions under previous administrations. The evolution of the \"one-China\" policy and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have been key aspects of U.S. policy towards Taiwan since the Nixon opening to China in 1971. This policy framework includes the Taiwan Relations Act and three U.S. communiqu\u00e9s with China, shaping the relationship between the U.S., China, and Taiwan. The United States has maintained a \"one-China\" policy since the Nixon opening to China in 1971, recognizing the PRC government as the sole legitimate government of all China. The U.S. has reaffirmed its interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question and has no intention of pursuing a \"two-China\" policy. Additionally, the U.S. has provided policy assurances to Taiwan and set guidelines on Taiwan to further nuance its approach. In the 1980s, the U.S. adopted guidelines on Taiwan to define its actions, with periodic initiatives by Congress to influence policy. In 1979, the Carter Administration recognized the PRC as the legitimate government of China, leading to concerns among Members of Congress about the minimal proposals for continued dealings with Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA\u2014 P.L. 96-8 ) was passed in 1979 as a result of extensive congressional debate. It established the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) as the unofficial U.S. representative for interactions with Taiwan. The TRA does not mandate the U.S. to defend Taiwan in case of attack. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) does not mandate the U.S. to defend Taiwan in case of attack, but there are questions about potential U.S. involvement based on past actions. Section 2 and Section 3 of the TRA are relevant for U.S. policy regarding Taiwan's strategic interests and arms sales commitments. The Taiwan Relations Act emphasizes U.S. interests in a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan question and maintaining the capacity to resist coercion. It allows for the sale of defense articles and services to Taiwan to maintain self-defense capability, with Congress playing a role in determining Taiwan's needs. Debate often arises between Congress and the White House on the necessary capabilities and quantities of these defense items. In the mid-1980s, Taiwan transitioned from a one-party system under martial law to a more liberalized political environment. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) advocating for Taiwan independence emerged, and government positions were opened to native Taiwanese. The ROC legislature elected on mainland China was replaced in 1992, and Taiwan held its first direct presidential election in 1996. In 1996, Taiwan held its first direct presidential election, won by KMT leader Lee Teng-hui. During his presidency, Lee emphasized Taiwan's distinct culture and identity, distancing from the idea of \"one China.\" The KMT dynasty was broken in 2000 when DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian won the presidency, ending the party's 50-year tenure in power. President Chen narrowly won re-election in 2004, ending the KMT's long-standing dominance in Taiwan. The KMT's legislative majority was reduced, leading to coalitions formed by both the DPP and KMT with smaller parties to gain strength. The political landscape was divided between the \"Pan-Green\" coalition led by Chen and the \"pan-Blue\" coalition of the KMT, each with differing ideologies and similar political strength. The political landscape in Taiwan shifted in 2008 when the KMT regained momentum, leading to the DPP losing power in both legislative and presidential elections. President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT pursued a more conciliatory approach towards the PRC and aimed to improve relations with the United States. However, Ma's popularity declined due to various issues such as the government's response to Typhoon Morakot, economic challenges, and rising energy prices. The return of the KMT to power in Taiwan under the new government poses challenges for the United States, including concerns over cross-strait policies and domestic political tensions. The DPP opposition has been weakened by political scandals and there are reports of key figures considering forming a separate party. Hsieh may be considering forming a separate political party, potentially impacting DPP's future. DPP leadership is shifting focus towards social and political reform over Taiwan sovereignty. Concerns arise over KMT's potential return to authoritarianism with their strong control of the government. Criticisms include handling of former President Chen's corruption case. Critics questioned the government's handling of former President Chen's corruption case, citing irregularities in the trial process and his lengthy detention before sentencing. President Ma faced criticism for winning the KMT chairmanship, despite earlier assurances that he would not seek the position. His new role gives him more control over party nominations and helps him counter the influence of old-time KMT leaders, potentially boosting his stature in cross-strait relations. President Ma's election as KMT chair has increased his stature in cross-strait relations. He has sought to improve ties with China, leading to cross-strait improvements on various levels, including joint disaster relief efforts after the Sichuan earthquake. Leaders in Beijing have been receptive to Ma's efforts. Taiwan and China have engaged in cross-strait talks since 2008, resulting in agreements on various issues such as transportation, food safety, and investment. These talks have led to improved relations, including joint disaster relief efforts after the Sichuan earthquake. President Ma's efforts to improve ties with China have been well-received. Taiwan and China have engaged in cross-strait talks since 2008, resulting in agreements on various issues such as transportation, food safety, and investment. President Ma's efforts to improve ties with China have been well-received. Despite some criticism in Taiwan, there have been discussions about expanding economic cooperation between Taiwan and China through the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA). The opposition party has raised concerns about the rapid pace of cross-strait initiatives and the potential vulnerability of Taiwan's economy to PRC pressure. The Chairman of the U.S. American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) has also commented on the United States' stance on these developments. The United States is supportive of Taiwan's engagement with China, including its participation in international health organizations. Taiwan was included in the International Health Regulations in 2009, allowing it to receive updates on global epidemics. Taiwan was also invited to attend the 2009 World Health Assembly meeting as an observer for the first time. Taiwan was invited to participate in a U.N. specialized agency meeting for the first time since 1971, using the name \"Chinese Taipei.\" President Ma Ying-jeou credited his approach towards Beijing for the invitation. Despite PRC objections, Taiwan's bid for \"meaningful participation\" in U.N. activities was not included on the agenda for the 63rd General Assembly. Taiwan's efforts to gain membership or non-member status in the U.N. and its affiliates, including the WHO, have been unsuccessful in the past. The U.S. government has been vocal in its opposition to some of Taiwan's previous U.N. application efforts. The U.S. government has been vocal in opposing Taiwan's past U.N. application efforts, stating that Taiwan is not recognized as a state in the international community. However, the U.S. supports Taiwan's participation in the WHO and other international organizations where it is a full member. In 2004, the 108th Congress enacted legislation requiring the Secretary of State to seek Taiwan's observer status in the World Health Organization (WHO) at its annual meeting. Former President Chen Shui-bian was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009 for corruption and money laundering during his presidency. Taiwan argues that its observer status in international bodies like WHO is a non-political solution. Chen Shui-bian was arrested on corruption charges in 2008 and indicted in December of the same year. His trial began in March 2009, with criticism towards the Taiwan government for judicial proceedings, including the replacement of the presiding judge and Chen being ordered back to detention in fear of collusion or evidence tampering. The court's decisions in Chen Shui-bian's corruption case led to growing criticism, including concerns about his ongoing detention without bail violating his human rights and political interference in the trial process. The corruption charges against Chen dated back to 2006, with new money-laundering allegations in August 2008 further plunging the Democratic Progressive Party into crisis. Chen Shui-bian faced corruption allegations dating back to 2006, with new money-laundering accusations in August 2008. He admitted to receiving campaign funds but failing to report them, leading to his resignation from the DPP. Prosecutors began investigating his potential involvement in corruption charges after he stepped down as president. President Ma declassified documents implicating Chen in the corruption scandal. Chen Shui-bian faced corruption allegations dating back to 2006, with new money-laundering accusations in August 2008. He admitted to receiving campaign funds but failing to report them, leading to his resignation from the DPP. President Ma declassified documents implicating Chen in the corruption scandal, which Chen claimed were undeclared campaign funds legally acquired, not government funds embezzled or bribes. Investigations and indictments for corruption have been a recurring feature of political life in Taiwan, with some suggesting political partisanship fuels the allegations more than real reform efforts. Investigations into the misuse of \"special expense accounts\" have been a recurring issue in Taiwan's political landscape. Several senior officials, including President Ma Ying-jeou, former foreign minister James Huang, and current DPP chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, have been investigated and cleared of such charges in the past. Other officials, such as former Vice President Annette Lu and former education minister Tu Cheng-sheng, have also faced scrutiny for similar infractions. Taiwan's economy grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, but growth declined in the 1990s. The economy experienced a serious slowdown in the global financial crisis starting in 2008, with a significant drop in exports. Taiwan is the United States' ninth-largest trading partner, with two-way trade valued at $61.6 billion in 2008. Taiwan's exports to the United States include electronics and consumer goods, with the U.S. being Taiwan's third-largest trading partner. The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan in 2008 was $11 billion. Taiwan was removed from the U.S. Special 301 Watch List in 2009 after implementing new laws to protect intellectual property rights. Taiwan improved copyright legislation, targeted illegal Internet file sharing, and established an Intellectual Property Court in 2008. The U.S. Trade Representative removed Taiwan from the \"Priority Watch List\" in 2004 but remained on the \"Watch List.\" The U.S. business community was divided on Taiwan's IPR improvements, with some supporting removal from the Watch List and others recommending staying on pending further progress. Property Alliance recommended that Taiwan remain on the Watch List for further IPR improvements. Taiwan has been seeking a U.S.-Taiwan Free Trade Agreement without success. U.S.-Taiwan trade discussions have been held under a 1994 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), which has been suspended due to Taiwan's restrictions on imports of U.S. beef. Taiwan argues its status as a major trading partner of the United States. Taiwan has been seeking a U.S.-Taiwan Free Trade Agreement, citing its status as a major trading partner of the United States. However, obstacles such as Taiwan's record on intellectual property rights and political issues with the PRC have hindered progress. The PRC strongly opposes a U.S.-Taiwan FTA, and restrictions on trade and economic investment relations across the Taiwan Strait have been in place since 1949. Taiwan's economic interconnectedness with China has led to increasing pressures on Taiwan governments to ease restrictions on direct travel and investment. Taiwan-China trade has grown significantly, with China surpassing the United States as Taiwan's top trading partner. Bilateral trade between Taiwan and China in 2008 was $105.4 billion. Initiatives under President Chen and the DPP included the start of non-stop direct charter flights between the two countries in 2005. The resumption of cross-strait talks in June 2008 led to the first non-stop direct charter flights between Taiwan and China in 55 years. President Ma's administration aims to expand economic cooperation with China through agreements like the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) or the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which has sparked controversy in Taiwan. Critics fear the economic inter-dependence that such agreements could create. President Ma's initiatives have raised concerns among DPP members and pro-independence advocates in Taiwan for being overly ambitious. President Ma's initiatives in Taiwan are seen as overly ambitious by DPP observers, who are concerned about compromising Taiwan's economic security and political autonomy. The United States is obligated to provide defense support to Taiwan, which the PRC opposes. There were delays in notifying Congress about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan in 2008, with some Senators urging swift action. In 2008, delays in arms sales notifications to Taiwan were linked to Beijing's hosting of the Summer Olympic Games. The United States hinted at a freeze on weapons sales, but eventually resumed sales. Contracts were awarded for Harpoon missiles and other equipment worth millions, with a possible Foreign Military Sale totaling billions. The policies of P.L. 96-8 included upgrades for E-2T Aircraft, AH-64D Block III APACHE Longbow Attack helicopters, PATRIOT PAC-3 missiles, HARPOON Block II missiles, spare parts for various aircraft, JAVELIN guided missile rounds, and F-16 C/D fighters. The Obama Administration faced a sensitive issue regarding Taiwan's desire to purchase F-16 fighters. The U.S. AIT Director in Taiwan, Stephen Young, mentioned that the Administration would consider the F-16 sale after key officials were settled, but no announcement was made by October 2009. Any arms sale announcement is unlikely before President Obama's visit to China in mid-November 2009. The PRC strongly opposes U.S. arms sales, with the PLA threatening to suspend military exchanges. Taiwan also seeks coverage under the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. Taiwan seeks to join the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, which would provide reciprocal privileges to its citizens with machine-readable passports. Congress enacted amendments in 2007 that may allow for a waiver of the non-immigrant refusal rate, a key requirement for Taiwan to qualify. Participation in the program is seen as a way to enhance Taiwan's international stature and demonstrate close ties with the United States. Taiwan's chances of joining the U.S. Visa Waiver Program are subject to political difficulties with China. The Obama Administration's Taiwan policy is expected to maintain continuity with the Taiwan Relations Act. Recent history suggests that policy changes can occur within this framework. The Bush Administration in 2001 shifted from \"strategic ambiguity\" to \"strategic clarity\" in support of Taiwan, approving arms sales and showing less concern for China's views. This change reflected growing U.S. Congress concerns about Taiwan's defense capabilities compared to China's. The Pentagon supported the conclusion that the military balance in the Taiwan Strait was favoring China. The Bush Administration reshaped its policy towards Taiwan and China, emphasizing cooperation with China on various strategic goals. Trust issues between Taiwan's President Chen and U.S. officials led to a significant deterioration in bilateral relations during the Bush Administration. The Bush White House balanced criticisms of China's military buildup against Taiwan with warnings to Taiwan about conditional U.S. support. The one-China policy is seen as crucial for U.S. interests in the evolving U.S.-Taiwan-PRC relationship. Lawmakers are considering various options for U.S. policy towards Taiwan. The one-China policy is crucial for U.S. interests in the evolving U.S.-Taiwan-PRC relationship. Advocates stress the importance of maintaining the Taiwan Relations Act and current policy approach to avoid diplomatic problems and potential military conflict with China. Maintaining the current one-China policy is crucial for U.S. interests in the evolving U.S.-Taiwan-PRC relationship. Some proponents argue that any change in this policy would pose the greatest risk to U.S.-PRC relations and could be damaging to Taiwan's security. Others believe that the current U.S. policy framework on Taiwan is outdated and out of step with global democratization efforts. Some argue that the one-China policy has become irrelevant and should be replaced with a one-China, one-Taiwan policy. They believe the U.S. should work towards normalizing relations with Taiwan, as they doubt the PRC would attack Taiwan or that the U.S. would not come to Taiwan's aid if needed. Some suggest replacing the one-China policy with a one-China, one-Taiwan policy and normalizing relations with Taiwan. The United States may need to review its Taiwan policy, including the 1979-1980 Taiwan Guidelines, to maintain credibility and influence in Asia. Since the 1993-1994 policy review, Taiwan has transitioned into a fully functioning democracy with multiple political parties and competitive elections. The PRC has increased military buildup along the coast opposite Taiwan, adopting an anti-secession law in 2005, suggesting hostile intent. The anti-secession law adopted by Beijing in 2005 suggests hostile intent towards Taiwan, prompting calls for a new Taiwan Policy Review in the U.S. to make necessary changes for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Proposed changes include more transparent interactions, higher-level visits, and better coordination within the U.S. government. Greater coordination within the U.S. government on Taiwan policy issues, including support for Taiwan's participation in international organizations. A Taiwan policy review could impact U.S.-PRC relations depending on its nature, with potential concerns from both sides. Alternative approaches are being suggested. There is a suggestion for a more active U.S. role in cross-strait matters, which may require changes in long-standing U.S. assurances to Taiwan and objections from the PRC. U.S. officials note changes in how both governments talk about Taiwan. U.S. officials are facing pressure from both the PRC and Taiwan to get more involved in cross-strait issues. The PRC suggested cooperation with Washington during Taiwan's Chen Administration, while Taiwan sought U.S. support for constitutional reform and increased official interaction. Observers believe it may be time for the U.S. to take a more active role in the situation. The United States is urged by both Taiwan and the PRC to get more involved in promoting cross-strait dialogue, but each side wants U.S. involvement only for its own interests. U.S. officials are willing to help if both sides can agree on the type of assistance needed, but some believe that one-sided U.S. involvement could escalate tensions rather than ease them. The United States is encouraged to exert more pressure on the PRC to reduce its hostile military posture towards Taiwan and promote cross-strait concessions. Suggestions include pressuring Beijing to reduce its military buildup and revisit the 2005 Anti-Secession Law. Additionally, there is support for greater U.S. involvement in Taiwan's democratic institutions. Proponents suggest greater U.S. support for Taiwan's democratic institutions to improve governance effectiveness, address infrastructural weaknesses, and prevent preemptive capitulation to PRC initiatives. They propose initiatives like limited constitutional reforms to enhance Taiwan's governance. Proponents recommend increased U.S. support for Taiwan's democratic institutions, including closer dialogue between the U.S. Congress and Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, emphasizing Taiwan's global role in democratic capacity building, and offering rhetorical support for Taiwan's leaders. The United States supports Taiwan's democratic process and values, despite not officially endorsing Taiwan's independence from China. Taiwan poses a unique challenge for U.S. policy due to its democratic government and trade relations, while also being claimed by the PRC. The United States faces challenges in its relations with Taiwan, including decisions on arms sales, visits by Taiwanese officials, and economic ties. President Ma's initiatives towards China pose new challenges for U.S. interests, raising questions about Washington's role in Taiwan-China relations. The United States is under pressure from both sides regarding cross-strait ties. PRC officials urge the U.S. to influence Taiwan to halt referendum plans, while Taiwan seeks more U.S. support for democracy and pressure on Beijing. U.S. officials strive to balance the relationship and navigate President Ma's new approach towards China. The U.S. is urged by both the PRC and Taiwan regarding cross-strait ties. U.S. officials support greater conciliation between Taiwan and the PRC, but are silent on the speed and depth of reconciliation. Concerns exist that the KMT government may prioritize economic interests over political considerations in its dealings with China. President Ma faces multiple balancing acts in his PRC policy, including improving cross-strait relations and Taiwan's economic opportunities while addressing concerns about selling out Taiwan's political interests. He must navigate between different factions in Taiwan regarding unification with China, defense, and relations with Beijing, all while considering the delicate issue of U.S. arms sales in the context of improving Taiwan-PRC ties. In the context of improving Taiwan-PRC ties, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan can serve as a policy lever in U.S.-Taiwan-PRC relations. The approval or freeze of weapons sales can have symbolic significance for both sides, with potential implications for cross-strait ties. The PRC objects to these sales, and future U.S. arms sales may impact cross-strait relations. U.S. policymakers must consider the signals sent by specific arms sales under current circumstances. Military exchanges could provide Beijing with an opportunity to learn sensitive U.S. military technology sold to Taiwan, potentially jeopardizing future U.S. arms sales. Ma's policy approach will test the PRC's intentions of seeking a win-win result in cross-strait issues. The PRC faces a decision on whether to pursue creative initiatives with a KMT government. Rebuffing a conciliatory Taiwan government could damage the PRC's credibility in seeking a peaceful solution for cross-strait ties. Beijing has shown willingness to make gestures towards Taiwan, such as restarting cross-strait talks and considering Taiwan's participation in the WHO. There have been hints of a more flexible approach towards Taiwan in multilateral organizations like APEC. Other potential steps could include suspending military exercises focused on Taiwan. The 2008 election in Taiwan was seen as a validation of the country's democratic development, with the Democratic Progressive Party gracefully accepting defeat. The electorate was praised for its maturity and sophistication in making pragmatic election decisions. Some suggest that political pluralism in Taiwan may be in trouble due to the overwhelming KMT electoral victories in 2008, leaving the opposition demoralized. The DPP, once a powerful opposition party, has been further weakened by scandals involving former President Chen. Despite warming U.S.-Taiwan relations under the KMT, concerns remain about the viability of Taiwan's democracy. Under the KMT, concerns arise about Taiwan's democracy being compromised if the opposition remains weak. S. 1390 (Levin) National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010 requires a report on Taiwan's air force capabilities and U.S. obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act. The Senate passed the bill on July 14, 2009. The Senate passed H.Con.Res. 18 on July 23, 2009, calling for the U.S. to resume diplomatic relations with Taiwan and support its membership in international organizations. H.Con.Res. 55 recognizes the 30th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act and reaffirms U.S. commitment to Taiwan's democratic development. The House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific introduced a measure on February 23, 2009, supporting Taiwan's democratic development and deepening U.S.-Taiwan ties. The bill was amended and forwarded to the full Committee on March 19, 2009.
