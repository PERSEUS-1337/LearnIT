    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Amendment to Section 18602 of the Business and Professions Code establishes the State Athletic Commission within the Department of Consumer Affairs with seven members appointed by the Governor, Senate Committee on Rules, and Speaker of the Assembly. Members appointed by the Governor require Senate confirmation and cannot have been licensed under this chapter in the last two years. The State Athletic Commission is established with seven members appointed by the Governor, Senate Committee on Rules, and Speaker of the Assembly. At least four members must have expertise in areas such as medicine, financial management, public safety, or past experience in regulated activities. The board is subject to review by the Legislature's policy committees. The State Athletic Commission appoints an executive officer and other necessary personnel for administration. The appointment is subject to approval by the Director of Consumer Affairs. This section is effective until January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. Section 18645 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to create an Advisory Committee on Medical and Safety Standards within the State Athletic Commission. The committee consists of six licensed physicians and surgeons appointed by the commission to study and recommend standards for boxing, wrestling, and martial arts contests. Appointments are at the pleasure of the commission for up to four years, with a majority vote required for each appointment. A quorum is constituted by a majority of the appointed members. Section 18649 is added to the Business and Professions Code. Section 18649 of the Business and Professions Code prohibits the use of drugs, alcohol, stimulants, or injections by licensed boxers or martial arts fighters. The commission may conduct testing at any time to ensure compliance. The commission has the authority to collect blood and urine samples from licensed boxers or martial arts fighters to detect prohibited substances. If a prohibited substance is found, the individual will be in violation and subject to penalties. Section 18843 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to allow fines up to $2,500 for violations of the commission's rules. Additionally, fines of up to 40% of the total purse can be imposed for violations related to prohibited substances. Section 18852 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require managers of boxers or martial arts fighters to keep accurate records of training expenses, money paid to contestants, money received from the purse, and money owed to the manager. Fines can be imposed without a hearing, but the licensee can request a hearing within 30 days to contest or modify the fine. Managers of boxers or martial arts fighters must keep accurate records of money owed to them by contestants. The manager's records must be documented, available to the fighter and commission, and kept for five years. Promoters can advance up to $1,000 plus necessary expenses before a contest, not exceeding 20% of the fighter's purse. Section 18854 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require all payments to fighters be made in the presence of a commission representative. Any violations will be reported to the executive officer. Failure to enforce these rules may result in disciplinary action. Additionally, a new section 18855 is added to the code. The commission enforces contracts between boxers or martial arts fighters and managers or licensed clubs, using approved printed forms. Disputes are arbitrated by the commission, with cost recovery possible. The commission has the authority to order a promoter to withhold funds from a contestant or manager if there are suspicions of dishonest competition or violations of regulations. The commission can order a promoter to withhold funds from a contestant, which must be delivered to the commission upon demand. Contestants can request a hearing within 10 days to determine the money's disposition. If no hearing is requested, the commission will decide how to handle the funds. This rule does not apply to non-competitive exhibitions. Section 18861 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to give the commission the power to withhold 10 percent of a contestant's purse if their manager fails to provide an itemized statement of expenses. The withheld money will be held in trust for the contestant or manager upon submission of the statement. Any licensee involved in a fake contest will face disciplinary action, excluding exhibitions. SEC. 14. Section 18868 of the Business and Professions Code is amended and renumbered to 18859. The commission can review criminal history information to determine if an applicant or licensee has been convicted of an offense. Conviction may lead to denial of application or disciplinary action. The commission may require applicants to submit fingerprints for background checks. The Department of Justice will send one set to the FBI and keep one set for searching California criminal history. Nothing in this chapter prohibits counties or cities from banning contests or exhibitions. No reimbursement is required by this act under the California Constitution as any costs incurred by local agencies or school districts are due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
