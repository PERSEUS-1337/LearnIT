    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 13172.6 of the Water Code requires a report to the Legislature by June 1, 2017, on the suction dredge permitting program. The report must include information on permits issued, costs, requirements for obtaining permits, and details of public workshops. The report must comply with Section 9795 of the Government Code. Section 13260 of the Water Code is amended to require certain persons to file a discharge report with the regional board, including those discharging waste that could affect state waters and those operating injection wells. This section will be repealed on June 1, 2021. Persons operating injection wells must file a report of waste discharge with the regional board, including any changes in the discharge. Annual fees must be submitted to cover costs related to waste discharge requirements. The state board may impose fees on confined animal feeding operations based on factors like the size of the operation. These fees cover costs related to waste discharge monitoring, compliance enforcement, and administrative actions. The state board may impose fees on confined animal feeding operations based on factors like operation size, permit status, discharge type, pricing mechanism, compliance costs, participation in quality assurance programs. Fees collected are deposited in the Waste Discharge Permit Fund for state board use. Fees collected from stormwater dischargers under NPDES permits are separately accounted for in the Waste Discharge Permit Fund. A portion of this money is available for regional boards to use for stormwater programs, with a requirement to spend at least 50% on inspection and compliance issues related to industrial and construction stormwater programs. A waiver of the annual fee for solid waste discharge requirements is granted to those paying the fee for waste management units regulated under Division 30 of the Public Resources Code, upon verification of payment of the required fee. This waiver is contingent on the revenue generated by the fee being sufficient to fund specified programs and not being reduced by the Legislature. Each person discharging waste regulated by this section must pay an annual fee to the state board, with a refund possible if the discharge does not impact water quality. The state board sets annual fees based on Budget Act revenue levels, adjusting them as needed to match actual revenue collected. The state board adopts emergency regulations for annual fees without review by the Office of Administrative Law, ensuring immediate public safety and welfare. The state board shall set time limits for regional boards to review waste discharge reports, which must be sworn to or submitted under penalty of perjury. Annual fees under the national pollutant discharge elimination system will not be imposed until they are due, at which point they become due annually. A person operating an oil, gas, or geothermal injection well regulated by the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources may be exempt from paying fees. Before discharging mining waste, they must submit required reports to the regional board. The report on the physical and chemical characteristics of mining waste must include test results for toxic substances and potential pollution. Another report should assess the long-term risks of acid mine drainage, heavy metal discharge, and release of hazardous substances. A report of waste discharge is not required for users of recycled water supplied by a permit-holding supplier or distributor."
