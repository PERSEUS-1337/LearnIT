    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Closing Loopholes Against Money-Laundering Practices Act\" or the \"CLAMP Act\". It requires an EIN for United States entities. The \"Closing Loopholes Against Money-Laundering Practices Act\" or the \"CLAMP Act\" mandates that every United States entity must obtain an employer identification number (EIN) assigned by the Secretary of the Internal Revenue Service. This applies to any business entity created or organized in the United States or under its laws. The \"CLAMP Act\" requires all US entities to obtain an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS. This excludes tax-exempt organizations and specifies the definition of the United States. The Secretary will determine the process for entities without an EIN to obtain one. Additionally, a civil penalty section is added to the Internal Revenue Code for non-compliance. The \"CLAMP Act\" mandates US entities to obtain an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS. A penalty is imposed for failures related to EINs. Failure to have an identifying number results in a $10,000 penalty for any US entity that fails to obtain an employer identification number. If the penalty is not paid within 60 days, responsible parties are jointly liable. Failure to provide required information under section 6109(c) will result in a $100 penalty for each failure, which increases to $1,000 for intentional failures. A pattern of non-compliance is considered intentional. United States entities failing to pay the penalty are jointly liable. If a penalty assessed under section 6109(e)(2)(A) is not paid within 60 days, any person responsible for the entity during that period is jointly liable for the penalty. No penalty will be imposed if reasonable cause is shown for the failure to satisfy the requirements. Coordination with penalties imposed under subsection (a) is also considered. If a penalty under section 6109(e)(2)(A) is not paid within 60 days, the responsible person is jointly liable unless reasonable cause is shown. A new item is added to the Internal Revenue Code for penalties related to section 6109. Sec. 6720D imposes a penalty for failures regarding employer identification numbers. A new section, SEC. 7218, addresses willful failure to obtain an employer identification number, introducing a criminal penalty. SEC. 7218 introduces a criminal penalty for willful evasion of the employer identification number requirement, with fines up to $100,000 ($500,000 for corporations) and imprisonment up to 5 years. SEC. 7218 introduces a criminal penalty for willful evasion of the employer identification number requirement, with fines up to $100,000 ($500,000 for corporations) and imprisonment up to 5 years. The effective date for the amendment applies to United States entities formed on or after 180 days after the enactment of the Act, while existing entities will have the amendment take effect 3 years after the enactment. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide a method for existing United States entities to obtain an identifying number under section 6109(e) of the Code within 3 years of the Act's enactment. Penalties for failures will apply to entities after the specified date. SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF RESPONSIBLE PARTY IDENTITY FOR ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTERTERRORISM PURPOSES. The amendment allows the Secretary to disclose taxpayer identity information for anti-money laundering and counterterrorism investigations upon written request. The amendment permits the disclosure of taxpayer identity information, including the responsible party's details and business information from the entity's application for an employer identification number, for specific purposes such as anti-money laundering and counterterrorism investigations. The amendment allows disclosure of taxpayer identity information for federal criminal investigations related to specific offenses if the information cannot be obtained from any other source. The amendment allows disclosure of taxpayer identity information for federal criminal investigations related to specific offenses under certain conditions. Officers and employees of Federal law enforcement agencies directly involved in investigations, responses, or proceedings related to specified offenses are included in this provision. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are also made to accommodate these changes. The amendments to section 6103(p) of the Internal Revenue Code allow for disclosure of taxpayer identity information for federal criminal investigations. These changes apply to disclosures made after the enactment of the Act."
