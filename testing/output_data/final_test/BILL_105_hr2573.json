    "content": "The \"Election Reform in Campaigns Act\" requires a majority of House of Representatives candidate funds to come from individuals residing in the district. Additionally, it includes a provision for worker right to know. The Federal Election Campaign Act is amended to include labor organizations in political contributions. Labor organizations must meet specific requirements to be exempt from certain provisions. Employees must receive written notification annually and upon employment. Employees must be informed annually and upon employment that they cannot be required to pay for a labor organization's political activities. They also have the option to pay an agency fee instead of joining the organization. Employees can choose to pay an agency fee to the labor organization, limited to their pro rata share of exclusive representation services. Full members can reduce dues by their share of political activity spending. Costs and spending are based on the previous year. The labor organization must provide an annual examination by an independent certified public accountant of financial statements to verify expenditures for certain expenses. This examination must adhere to auditing standards. The labor organization must maintain procedures to determine costs chargeable to agency fee payors for exclusive representation. If challenged, an impartial decisionmaker must review the costs subject to de novo review by the National Labor Relations Board or court. Amounts in dispute must be placed in escrow. The labor organization must finance expenditures only with funds collected under this Act for its separate segregated fund. The amendments made by subsections (a) and (b) apply to contributions and expenditures made after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4 amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 by eliminating reporting thresholds for campaign spending. SEC. 5 equalizes limits on contributions to candidates by individuals and PACs. SEC. 6 amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to index the limitation on aggregate annual individual contributions. The amount will be adjusted annually based on the price index. SEC. 7 requires the FEC to make reports available on the internet within 48 hours of receipt. Section 311(a)(4) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 is amended to require posting reports on the internet and making them available for public inspection. These amendments will apply to elections after January 1999."
