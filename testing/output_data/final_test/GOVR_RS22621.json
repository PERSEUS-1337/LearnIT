    "content": "The USDA administers farm price and income support programs for various commodities. The current farm bill expires in 2007, with a new bill expected in the 110th Congress. These programs are funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation, with estimated FY2008 outlays of $7.6 billion. The Administration's 2007 farm bill proposal includes counter-cyclical and marketing loan payments, conservation, trade, nutrition, research, and energy programs. The proposal would exceed baseline by $5 billion over 10 years, with $500 million allocated in the CCC account for additional spending in FY2008. The plan aims to cut $4.5 billion from commodity programs and increase funding for conservation by $7.8 billion, among other changes. The Administration requests $1.5 billion for Farm Service Agency salaries and expenses in FY2008, with an increase of about 20% over FY2007. Additionally, a separate discretionary appropriation of $79 million is requested for USDA's Risk Management Agency. The mandatory Federal Crop Insurance Fund is estimated to have a budget authority of $4.81 billion in FY2008, up from $4.37 billion in FY2007. The Administration's FY2008 budget requests $152 million for USDA's Risk Management Agency, with a 1.7% increase in loan subsidy to support $3.4 billion in loan authority. Administrative expenses would increase by 3.3% to $319 million. Discretionary conservation programs are proposed at $825 million, with changes to mandatory programs increasing outlays by $221 million to $4.0 billion. $802 million is requested for Conservation Operations, an increase of about $42 million from FY2007. The Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative is not funded in this request. The FY2008 budget request does not fund the Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative, Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, or Watersheds Surveys and Planning. It reduces funding for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program and Resource Conservation and Development Program. Mandatory conservation programs see an increase in funding, with the NRCS programs increasing by $195 million and the Conservation Reserve Program increasing by $26 million. The reduction in the Resource Conservation and Development Program is based on a proposal to decrease NRCS staff and adjust their responsibilities. The FY2008 budget request includes recommended changes to consolidate various conservation programs into new programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and a private lands protection program. Additional funding of $157 million is requested for conservation activities from the 2002 farm bill. The FY2008 budget request includes a funding of $157 million for conservation activities from the 2002 farm bill. The request proposes reductions for EQIP to $1.0 billion in FY2008, with increases for CRP, the Conservation Security Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. The Administration's budget request for FY2008 would provide a total of $2.31 billion for USDA's research, extension, and economics mission area, including $1.03 billion for the Agricultural Research Service. The Administration proposes termination of over 100 research projects not deemed high priority, reallocating funds to research on avian influenza, bioterrorism protection, and obesity prevention. $1.02 billion is proposed for CSREES in FY2008, with $562.5 million for state-level research and teaching programs. The request includes $256.5 million for the NRI competitive grants program, up from $190 million in FY2007. Formula funds for state-level research in agriculture, forestry, and veterinary science would be reduced to offset the NRI increase. The Administration proposes a $3 million increase in funding for academic programs at the state level, with a $1 million increase for historically black land grant schools. Budget categories supporting research projects at specific land grant institutions face substantial funding decreases. The Extension System's continuing education and outreach activities would receive $431 million, while USDA's Economic Research Service is requested $82.5 million, an increase from $75 million in FY2007. The FY2008 budget proposes increased funding for USDA agencies, including $82.5 million for the Economic Research Service and $167.7 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service. The Food Safety and Inspection Service would receive $1.065 billion, with $135 million from user fees and $930 million from appropriations. Additional funding is allocated for USDA food defense and biosurveillance activities. The Administration also plans to introduce new user fees to offset $96 million in annual appropriations for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The FY2008 budget request proposes increased funding for USDA agencies, with a focus on protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. The budget includes $946 million for APHIS, $77 million for avian influenza efforts, and new user fees for APHIS and GIPSA. Additionally, there is a nearly constant appropriation for AMS and an increase for GIPSA. USDA's international activities are funded through discretionary appropriations and borrowing authority. The FY2008 budget proposes increased funding for USDA agencies, focusing on protecting U.S. agriculture. The total program value for FY2008 would be $4.6 billion, with $1.49 billion appropriated. The Administration requests $173 million for the Foreign Agricultural Service and $1.2 billion for P.L. 480 foreign food assistance. No funds are requested for P.L. 480 Title I loans or the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. The FY2008 budget proposes increased funding for USDA agencies, focusing on protecting U.S. agriculture. The budget assumes $163 million of CCC funds for the Food for Progress program. The request for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program is for a constant $100 million appropriation. Proposed appropriations language would allow the Administrator of USAID to use up to 25% of P.L. 480 Title II funds for local or regional purchases of commodities in food crises. CCC export credit guarantee programs secure commercial financing of U.S. agricultural exports, with an estimated FY2008 program level of $2.4 billion. The U.S. response to the World Trade Organization ruling in the U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute includes short-term guarantees, suspending long-term guarantees, implementing a risk-based fee structure, and eliminating high-risk countries. The Supplier Credit Guarantee Program may receive $200 million pending review, but USDA's farm bill proposal aims to repeal it due to defaults and fraud evidence. The Market Access Program would receive $200 million of CCC funds, while the Foreign Market Development Program would receive $34.5 million. Rural development is overseen by three agencies: the Rural Housing Service, the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and the Rural Utilities Service. The Administration is requesting $14.9 billion for rural development programs in FY2008, including direct and guaranteed loans, grants, and loan subsidies. This is an increase from FY2007 and a decrease from FY2006 funding levels. The request includes separate appropriations for each funding account in the Rural Community Advancement Program. The Administration requests budget authority for various rural development programs in FY2008, including Community Facilities, water and waste water programs, Business Development, Distance Learning and Telemedicine, broadband programs, and Value-Added Producer Grants. Funding for some programs would decrease, while others would remain the same or be terminated. The Administration proposes terminating various rural development programs in FY2008, including direct loans for housing programs and special crop projects. Other programs targeted for termination include the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Program, Community Facility Grant Program, and Economic Impact Grants Program. Funding for Rural Business Enterprise Grants and Rural Business Opportunity Grants would also be eliminated. The majority of the USDA budget is allocated to domestic food assistance programs, such as food stamps, TEFAP, nutrition assistance grants, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. The budget for FY2008 includes funding for domestic food assistance programs such as food stamps, TEFAP, nutrition assistance grants, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. The budget also proposes full funding for programs like the WIC program and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, with contingency funds in case of inaccurate estimates. Total appropriations for USDA-funded domestic food aid would be $59.4 billion, with projected total spending increasing to about $56.4 billion. The FY2008 budget includes funding for domestic food assistance programs, with total appropriations for USDA-funded aid at $59.4 billion. Costs funded from the food stamp account are expected to rise by $1.7 billion, and child nutrition spending would grow by $700 million. The Administration's 2007 farm bill recommendations include changes affecting food stamps, the FDPIR, and child nutrition programs. Major food stamp proposals would loosen eligibility rules and increase benefits, while the FDPIR would receive added administrative funding. For child nutrition programs, new spending is proposed for fruit and vegetables. The WIC program's budget would increase by $200 million to $5.4 billion in FY2007. A proposal aims to limit payments for WIC services and restrict eligibility for Medicaid recipients, resulting in a minimal net spending increase of about $70 million. The Administration's FY2008 budget suggests terminating the CSFP program, with potential savings of over $100 million offset by increased costs for food stamp outreach and benefits for former CSFP recipients."
