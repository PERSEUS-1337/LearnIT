    "content": "A committee chair serves as the leader of a committee, responsible for setting the direction and overseeing staff. They make decisions related to the committee's policy calendar, administrative functions, and member roles. The report discusses the responsibilities of a House committee chair, including their role in committee sessions, relationships with other members and leaders, and key tasks from early organization meetings to March or April. It is divided into sections covering Transition, Administrative Matters, Committee Organization, Procedure, Procedural Tools, Floor Consideration, and Legislative Issues. The report includes citations to House rules and parliamentarian's notes. The Office of the Parliamentarian provides parliamentary advice for House committees, with resources available in the Constitution, Jefferson's Manual, Rules of the House of Representatives, and House Practice. The Congressional Research Service offers reports on legislative processes, budget procedures, and various legislative issues, accessible on their website. Parliamentarians do not assist committee chairs like they do the presiding officer in House meetings. CRS specialists provide confidential assistance and training for committee members and staff. They help with policy framing, legislative options, hearings, and nonpartisan analysis. The House organizes early in November after elections, with activities continuing into December or January. Meetings coincide with orientation for Members-elect. During early organization meetings, the steering committees of the House Democratic Caucus and House Republican Conference select committee members and chairs. Majority party's steering committee may interview candidates for contested chairmanships. Committee assignments are recommended by each party's steering committee, with negotiations sometimes causing delays. The majority and minority parties negotiate committee party ratios or for another reason. The Speaker or minority leader appoint members to certain committees, while the Speaker appoints certain chairs. The Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference confirm recommendations from steering committees and party leaders. The majority party aims to complete chairmanship selection during the transition period. Official election of chairs and committee members occurs after the new Congress convenes, with resolutions adopted without debate within the first few days. During the postelection transition period, committee chairs and ranking minority members are designated, with the Speaker having influence over subcommittee chair selections. The party leader may directly be involved in selecting some subcommittee chairs, such as those for Appropriations Committee subcommittees. The Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference may discuss and amend their internal rules during this time. During the postelection transition period, committee chairs may amend party rules to protect their panel's interests. The House Rules Committee considers modifications to House rules for the new Congress, including potential changes during a lame-duck session. Outgoing chairs, retiring Members, and chair candidates may participate in hearings on rule changes. Committee chairs play an active role in drafting changes to committee assignments, jurisdictions, procedures, and other rules.

During the postelection transition period, committee chairs may amend party rules to protect their panel's interests. Committees must submit an activities report to the House by January 2 of each odd-numbered year, detailing legislative and oversight activities. Committees are not required to publish a calendar, but many do so. The Appropriations, House Administration, and Ethics Committees traditionally do not publish a calendar. Committees are not required to publish a calendar, but it typically includes measures referred to the committee, actions taken, rules, jurisdiction, rosters, and staff information. Committee records must be kept separate from personal office records and transferred to the National Archives at the end of a Congress. Rules allow committees to determine restrictions on public availability of records. The committee chair has control over the selection of committee records.

They negotiate budget allocation with the minority and draft a budget for the committee's expenses. The chair modifies the previous budget to create a funding request reflecting the committee's resource needs. Committees' budget requests show staff salary requirements, expenses for consulting services, printing, office equipment, supplies, subscriptions, and travel. The Committee on House Administration provides information on scheduling and documentation for committees' expense resolutions. Each committee approves its budget request, with committee members able to propose changes before a vote.

The House Administration Committee introduces an omnibus committee funding resolution, called a \"primary expense resolution\" in House rules, which is marked up and reported to the House. The House traditionally acts on the omnibus committee funding resolution in March, with provisions for a reserve fund for unanticipated expenses. The House Administration Committee oversees fund allocations for committees, with monthly reports required on expenses and activities. Chairs are accountable for exceeding allocated funds, except for franked mail expenses. Personal funds can be used for official committee business support. Committee chairs have the authority to decide on staffing for their committees, including subcommittees. House rules require chairs to ensure that each subcommittee has enough staff to fulfill its responsibilities. Chairs may assign staff directly to subcommittees or maintain staff at the full-committee level and assign as needed. The rules also emphasize fair treatment of the minority party in staff appointments. The House rules require committee chairs to ensure fair treatment of the minority party in staff appointments. The minority party is entitled to one-third of the statutory staff, with negotiation possible for additional staff. The ranking minority member is responsible for minority staff, but the committee chair has control in some instances. Minority staff must have acceptable qualifications to a majority of the committee. Staff functions and titles are similar across committees, with a staff director serving as the overall manager. The staff structure of committees includes a staff director who manages the staff, a general counsel who provides legal advice, and professional policy staff who are issue experts. Administrative staff, such as clerks, handle meeting logistics and document management. The committee chairs are responsible for administrative tasks such as payroll certification and signing contracts.

Quorum requirements and party caucus meetings are important aspects of the process. The House committees must adopt rules, publish them, and hold an organization meeting to discuss and amend the rules. The relationship between the majority and minority parties in agenda setting and decision-making, including the authority of the ranking minority member, needs clarification. Terms like \"concurrence,\" \"consultation,\" or \"notification\" will describe this relationship. Committee rules may need amending to align with changes in House rules. Existing committee rules typically outline the role and authority of the chair, the majority's control over the agenda, and the party leadership's push for favored legislation. Committee rules in the House tend to change incrementally from one Congress to the next, with specific items like selecting a regular meeting day addressed. The chamber's rules apply to committees, and a committee's rules must not contradict chamber rules. Committee chairs can influence the environment and staff activities, making decisions on meeting setups and locations. The curr_chunk discusses the standard setup for committee meetings, including the location of tables, management of media coverage, and staff roles. It also mentions the use of templates for routine tasks like requesting attendance of attorneys and notifying Capitol Police.

The committee chair determines procedural strategy, calls hearings, selects witnesses, presides over hearings, chooses markup vehicle, prepares committee report, and discusses matters with ranking minority member. Various tasks are performed in preparation for hearings, including selecting and inviting witnesses. The committee chair plays a key role in determining the order of witness testimony, whether they will appear alone or as part of a panel, and maintaining order and decorum during committee proceedings. They may also decide who will lead questioning and send thank-you letters to witnesses after their appearance. Committee chairs have primary authority for scheduling, selecting a markup vehicle, and conducting markups. House rules require the text of a markup vehicle to be available 24 hours in advance. Chairs often caucus with party members before markups to discuss strategy. During markups, the chair serves as the primary spokesman for or against amendments and decides the voting order on recorded votes. The committee chair has the authority to schedule markups, select a markup vehicle, and conduct markups. They must report measures promptly and secure chamber consideration. The chair is responsible for preparing committee reports and documents, posting recorded votes and amendments in electronic form, and enforcing parliamentary procedures during sittings.

Attorneys from the Office of the Parliamentarian do not attend meetings but provide assistance to committee members. Confidential parliamentary training is available from CRS for committee chairs and staff. Outgoing chairs recommend having a procedural script for markups. During a markup, the committee chair and staff anticipate procedural challenges and prepare responses to ensure the majority party's legislative goals are met. The chair collaborates with committee members to determine the role of subcommittees, including whether they will mark up legislation or hold hearings.

Committees must carefully consider referral decisions to avoid jurisdictional issues over introduced measures. By March 30, 2017, numerous bills and resolutions had been introduced in the House, with referrals made to appropriate committees as per House rules. The creation of a permanent Homeland Security Committee has added uncertainties to referral decisions for measures that overlap with other standing committees. Concerns, disputes, and suggested solutions like re-referral or sequential referral need quick action, potentially involving negotiations between committees and the Speaker. Committee chairs consult party leadership to schedule measures for the floor, with two main routes: suspension of rules or a special rule from the House Rules Committee. If a measure is noncontroversial, it may proceed smoothly to the floor. The committee chair may seek floor consideration under suspension of the rules for noncontroversial measures. If deemed appropriate, the Speaker can choose legislation for suspension consideration. More contentious measures may require a special rule sought through a letter to the Rules Committee. The Rules Committee chair, after consulting with the majority leadership, traditionally testifies first on behalf of legislation during a hearing. They recommend the type of special rule needed for consideration and how it should address certain matters. The chair, acting as the majority floor manager, determines which majority-party Members speak on a measure, the order, time allocation, and who speaks in support or opposition to amendments.

The committee chair has the authority to close debate on amendments, select which amendments will receive votes, and work with party leadership to choose conferees. Committees may look back at previous Congresses for groundwork and ahead to future Congresses for program authorizations. Action in the current Congress can save time and build momentum for the next Congress. Some committees hold retreats to develop legislative strategies. The committees hold retreats with outside speakers to develop their legislative agenda. Presidential initiatives can be announced in the State of the Union address, including new actions, endorsements of legislative proposals, or refocusing existing programs. Executive orders are also possible forms of presidential initiatives. House committees must consider these initiatives in their jurisdiction. The chair and majority-party members of House committees are not obligated to act on presidential suggestions or legislation unless directed by the House or their party. Factors influencing their decision include party control, commitment to the initiative, interests of committee members, House leadership, and minority-party views. Congress decides which chamber should act first on initiatives. The President transmits a budget for the U.S. government containing budget requests, proposed legislative language, and initiatives with budget consequences after the first Monday in January but no later than the first Monday in February. The President's budget contains language related to specific requests and legislative initiatives with budget consequences. The Appropriations Committee only has jurisdiction over less than 40% of new budget authority and no jurisdiction over revenues or debt. Legislative proposals supporting the budget recommendations may be submitted later, and implementation of major initiatives may depend on separate legislation. Committees review presidential initiatives in the State of the Union address related to matters within their jurisdiction. The President's budget impacts House committees immediately, leading to a season of work involving Budget, Appropriations, and legislative committees. Congress aims to reach a budget agreement by April under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The House Budget Committee is expected to complete a budget resolution by April 15, and the House Appropriations Committee is expected to report all annual appropriations bills by June 10. The Budget Committee gathers information through hearings with the President's economic team and receives reports from other House committees. House committees must submit their views and estimates reports to the Budget Committee within six weeks of the President's budget submission. The House committees submit their views and estimates reports on the President's budget proposals, which can take various forms such as letters or detailed reports. Committee chairs lead the drafting process, and sometimes separate views are submitted by majority and minority members. The House committees submit views and estimates reports on the President's budget proposals, including comments on direct spending and authorizations. The Ways and Means Committee's report discusses revenues and debt legislation. Appropriations subcommittees start hearings quickly after the budget is transmitted.

The Ways and Means Committee's report discusses revenues and debt legislation. Appropriations subcommittees start hearings quickly after the budget is transmitted. Once the President transmits the budget, subcommittees will hear from relevant officials, Members of Congress, and public witnesses. The budget resolution establishes spending levels and the allocation of spending among committees. If a budget resolution is not agreed upon, the House may adopt a \"deeming resolution\" for spending allocations. The House may consider annual appropriations bills after May 15 without a budget resolution. A budget resolution may include reconciliation instructions for committees to report legislation changing revenues or spending. Committees must comply with reconciliation instructions if included in the budget resolution. Congress often provides authorizations for federal programs for a specified period. Congress may pass legislation to authorize federal programs for a specific number of years, or temporarily extend programs for a shorter period to allow for completion of new authorization legislation. Reauthorizing existing programs and agencies, as well as authorizing new ones, could be on the agenda for the current Congress. Committees in Congress work on reauthorizing programs and agencies, which is crucial legislative work. This process may involve renewing existing authority, addressing new issues, or enacting new laws. Reauthorizations, even for noncontroversial programs, require significant time and effort from committees. Changes to revenue code and entitlement programs require new legislation to be enacted by Congress. Committees in Congress focus on reauthorizing programs and agencies, requiring new laws to be enacted by Congress to continue temporary provisions. Committees anticipate consequences of inaction, such as loss of control over policy and influence within the House. Committee chairs and members establish legislative priorities based on national needs and interests. Committees in Congress establish legislative priorities based on national needs, political judgments, and hard work to focus on a legislative agenda. The committee chair and allies determine key legislative issues for the two-year timeframe of a Congress, avoiding risks of agenda being determined by external factors. Committees in Congress play a crucial role in overseeing the implementation of laws and gathering information for potential future legislation. They conduct oversight through continuous watchfulness and oversight hearings, determining if laws need to be changed or new laws are necessary. House rules mandate committees to adopt an authorization and oversight plan for a two-year Congress by February 15 of the first session. House rules mandate committees to adopt an authorization and oversight plan for a two-year Congress by February 15 of the first session. The plan allows committees to prioritize critical oversight areas, even though they may include more subjects than they can cover. It is an opportunity for committee members to identify important oversight related to legislative priorities. The committee's oversight function involves identifying critical subjects, making assignments, and utilizing resources like GAO, inspectors general, and CRS to inform Congress. Reporting requirements in statutes provide a wealth of information from the executive branch, enabling committees to establish oversight priorities. Congressional oversight involves a range of activities, including investigations with tools like subpoenas and depositions. Successful investigations require early planning, consistent resource application, capable staff, and perseverance. Congress passes laws to approve or disapprove executive proposals, addressing specific legislation or classes of proposals. The President has trade negotiating authority under the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 until at least July 1, 2018. Congress has procedures to review and disapprove proposed federal agency rules. Committees need to be aware of pending executive proposals within their jurisdiction.
