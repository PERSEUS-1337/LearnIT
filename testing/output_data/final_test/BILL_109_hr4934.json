    "content": "The curr_chunk is about the definition of Indian student count. The definition of Indian student count under Section 117(h) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 is amended to include the total number of Indian students enrolled in tribally-controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institutions. The count is determined based on enrollments at the conclusion of each academic year. The Indian student count for a tribally-controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institution is calculated by dividing the total credit-hours of all Indian students enrolled by the third week of the fall or spring term. The Indian student count at a tribally-controlled postsecondary institution includes credits earned in summer classes and by students without secondary school degrees. The Indian student count at a tribally-controlled postsecondary institution includes credits earned in summer classes and by students without secondary school degrees. Credits earned towards a degree are counted if the institution has admission criteria based on the student's ability to benefit from education or training. The institution is presumed to have established such criteria if it is part of the admission procedures. The institution's procedures include counseling or testing to measure a student's aptitude for completing enrolled courses. Credits earned by Indian students for obtaining a secondary school degree cannot be counted towards the Indian student count. Continuing education programs are also mentioned. Indian students in continuing education programs at tribally-controlled postsecondary institutions can earn credits that count towards their total credit hours, as long as the credits are converted to a credit-hour basis according to the institution's system."
