    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 645.5 of the Penal Code states that a person who removes or disables a monitoring device affixed as a condition of parole, postrelease community supervision, or probation, with the intent to evade supervision, is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months to three years if not surrendered or apprehended within one week of absconding warrant issuance. Section 1203.067 of the Penal Code specifies conditions for granting probation to individuals convicted of certain felonies, requiring the court to take specific actions. This section does not apply to the removal or disabling of monitoring devices by medical personnel during necessary medical treatment or when authorized by the court, law enforcement, or other responsible entities. The defendant must be evaluated by the county probation department. A hearing at sentencing will determine if probation poses a threat to the victim. Psychiatrists or psychologists must consider the threat to the victim in their reports. Probation terms for certain offenses after July 1, 2012, must include specific conditions. Persons placed on formal probation before July 1, 2012, must participate in an approved sex offender management program for at least one year or the remaining probation term. The program length is determined by a certified sex offender management professional, probation officer, and court approval, regardless of when the crimes were committed. Persons placed on formal probation on or after July 1, 2012, must complete a sex offender management program for at least one year, up to the entire probation period, as determined by a certified professional in consultation with the probation officer and court approval. Participation includes waiving privileges for self-incrimination, polygraph exams, and psychotherapist-patient communication. Any defendant ordered to participate in an approved sex offender management program must pay for the expenses, determined by the court based on their ability to pay. No defendant can be denied probation for inability to pay. Section 3008 of the Penal Code is amended. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation must place high-risk parolees on intensive supervision based on SARATSO assessments for sex offenders. Other parolees convicted of sex offenses may also be placed on specialized supervision. The Department of Corrections develops relapse prevention programs for sex offenders to reduce recidivism. High-risk sex offenders must participate in control and containment programming as a condition of parole. Parole conditions for sex offenders include specialized supervision starting July 1, 2012. Persons placed on parole prior to July 1, 2012, must participate in an approved sex offender management program for a minimum of one year or the remaining parole term. The length of the program is determined by a certified sex offender management professional in consultation with the parole officer and court approval, regardless of the timing of the crimes committed. (2) Persons placed on parole on or after July 1, 2012, must complete a sex offender management program for at least one year, up to the entire parole period, as determined by a certified professional in consultation with the parole officer and court approval. Participation includes waiving self-incrimination privilege and undergoing polygraph examinations. Waiver of psychotherapist-patient privilege is also required for communication between the sex offender management professional and parole officer. Defendants ordered to participate in a sex offender management treatment program are responsible for the expenses, with consideration for their ability to pay. No denial of discharge onto parole based on inability to pay. No reimbursement required for local agencies or school districts due to changes in crimes or penalties."
