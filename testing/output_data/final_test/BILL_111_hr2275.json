    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research and Awareness Act\". The Congress finds that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease. Both diseases present symptoms such as severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, joint pain, eye inflammation, and rectal bleeding. Inflammatory bowel disease causes joint pain, eye inflammation, and rectal bleeding. It affects up to 1.4 million people in the US, with 30% diagnosed in childhood. Children with the disease miss school due to symptoms like bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients are at high risk for colorectal cancer and incur over $2 billion in annual medical costs. Delayed diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children leads to more severe disease and complications. The National Institutes of Health issued research goals related to this disease in 2009. SEC. 3. Enhancing CDC's public health activities on inflammatory bowel disease by establishing an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Research and Pediatric Patient Registry Program. The Secretary will conduct epidemiology research on inflammatory bowel disease in pediatric and adult populations and establish a registry of pediatric IBD patients through a cooperative agreement with a nonprofit organization. This includes expanding existing research activities and establishing a population-based registry within one year. The pediatric IBD registry focuses on data collection, genetic factors, demographics, and treatment outcomes for pediatric IBD patients in the United States. The pediatric IBD registry aims to coordinate with existing surveillance systems, establish secure communication for patient contact with researchers, and define IBD as inflammatory bowel disease. $3,500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014. Increasing public awareness of inflammatory bowel disease and improving health professional education. The Secretary will award grants to eligible entities to raise awareness of inflammatory bowel disease among the general public and healthcare providers. Grants must be used for educational materials and programs focusing on Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, testing for diagnosis, differences between pediatric and adult disease, and physical and psychosocial impacts. The Secretary will report to Congress by September 30, 2010, on specific issues affecting pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease, treatment options for both adults and children, early identification of aggressive disease, complications including colorectal cancer, and federal information resources. The Secretary will report to Congress by September 30, 2010, on issues affecting patients with inflammatory bowel disease. An eligible entity is defined as a nonprofit organization with experience in serving adults and children with this disease. $2,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014 for carrying out this section. Sense of Congress on expanding biomedical research on inflammatory bowel disease. The Congress emphasizes the need for aggressive support of research on inflammatory bowel disease, including establishing clinical diagnosis and disease activity criteria. The Congress emphasizes the importance of supporting research on inflammatory bowel disease, including developing individualized approaches based on genetic susceptibility, modulating intestinal microflora, and promoting mucosal health. Additionally, the focus is on modulating the immune system, promoting regeneration, providing clinical tools, and addressing adverse effects on growth in children and adolescents. The Institute should also support training for qualified individuals in this area. The Institute should support training of health professionals in biomedical research focused on IBD, including pediatric investigators. It should also collaborate with medical and patient organizations concerned with IBD to promote research identified in scientific agendas. SEC. 5. BIENNIAL REPORTS amends the Public Health Service Act to include reporting on inflammatory bowel disease."
