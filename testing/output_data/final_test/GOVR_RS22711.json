    "content": "The House of Representatives traditionally considers regular appropriations bills under an open rule, allowing for unrestricted debate and amendments. However, in recent years, the House has started adopting unanimous consent agreements to regulate the consideration of these bills. Amendments can be proposed in the Committee of the Whole under an open rule, as long as they comply with the chamber's rules. The House of Representatives considers regular appropriations bills under an open rule, allowing for unrestricted debate and amendments. Members can offer amendments subject to further amendment, with each Member gaining five minutes to speak on pending paragraphs. Time spent on floor consideration varies based on the number of amendments and debate length. To provide scheduling predictability, the House often adopts a unanimous consent agreement negotiated by the Appropriations Committee. In the House of Representatives, regular appropriations bills are typically considered under an open rule, allowing for unrestricted debate and amendments. However, a practice has emerged where a comprehensive unanimous consent agreement is negotiated to regulate further debate and amendment of the legislation. This practice was uncommon before the 104th Congress but has now become routine, with multiple bills in recent years being regulated by such agreements. In the House of Representatives, regular appropriations bills are usually debated under an open rule. However, a common practice now involves negotiating a unanimous consent agreement to regulate further debate and amendments. This agreement often limits the number of possible amendments and the time for consideration, similar to a structured special rule. Party leaders sometimes plan these agreements before the bill reaches the House floor. Unanimous consent agreements in the House of Representatives allow every Member to have a say in the content of an agreement, dictating its terms after clearance by bipartisan leadership. These agreements provide certainty for the floor schedule, aid the Appropriations Committee in moving bills forward, and allow Members to offer their choice of amendments. Agreements in the House regulate appropriations bills, limiting amendments to those listed in the agreement. Unlike open rules, where members can freely offer amendments, under these agreements, amendments must be offered by the named member or their designee and are considered as read. Under an open rule, any Member can offer any amendment, with the option to waive reading aloud by unanimous consent. Members can demand division of an amendment with multiple provisions. Second-degree amendments are not allowed. Up to three other amendments can be offered: an amendment to the amendment, a substitute, and an amendment to the substitute. The chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee can offer one pro forma amendment each. Under an open rule, only the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations or their designees may offer pro forma amendments during the reading of the bill. Each Member can \"strike the last word\" to debate each amendment, with debate time controlled by committee leaders. Debate time for each amendment is typically 10 minutes, divided equally between proponents and opponents, but can extend beyond that. The UC agreement allows Members to negotiate changes in amendments as long as they address the subject, fostering progress on the bill. Sometimes, the bill manager is granted authority to package amendments en bloc for expedited consideration. Members can insert remarks on their amendments in the Congressional Record. Unanimous consent agreements in Congress sometimes waive points of order against amendments or deem certain amendments automatically adopted. These agreements do not provide complete certainty on the duration of floor consideration for spending measures, as they do not regulate every procedural step that may occur. Other procedural events like points of order, appeals, quorum calls, and motions to rise can also extend floor consideration. Quorum calls and motions to rise can add uncertainty and prolong floor consideration of regular appropriations measures."
