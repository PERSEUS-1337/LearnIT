Research shows that more years of teaching experience positively impact student achievement. Additionally, 32 percent of public schools are in rural districts. Rural school districts face increased transportation costs, leading to less money for instructional costs and salaries. Data shows they have the lowest base salaries for teachers. High poverty high schools are twice as likely to lack certified teachers in their fields. First year teacher rates are higher in high poverty schools, including rural schools. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, established in 1987, sets high standards for accomplished teachers. Over 91,000 teachers nationwide have completed certification through this rigorous assessment process. The National Academies confirmed that students taught by National Board certified teachers show higher achievement test gains compared to those taught by non-certified teachers. A study by the Economic Policy Institute revealed that public school teachers earn 77% less than other college graduates, with the gap widening. The Act aims to incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools through a refundable tax credit and provide additional tax credits for National Board certification.
