    "content": "The act is titled the \"National Park Service Winter Access Act\" and pertains to snowmobiles. The National Park Service Winter Access Act recognizes snowmobile use as a traditional visitor activity in National Parks, with efforts underway to establish cleaner and quieter snowmobiles within five years. This initiative aims to enhance visitor enjoyment while preserving park resources and values. The National Park Service Winter Access Act allows snowmobile use in certain National Parks, with restrictions based on past winter activity levels and existing regulations. This applies to several parks including Acadia, Grand Teton, and Rocky Mountain National Parks. Sequoia National Park, California\nKings Canyon National Park, California\nTheodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota\nVoyageurs National Park, Minnesota\nYellowstone National Park, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming\nZion National Park, Utah\nAppalachian National Scenic Trail, Multi-States\nSaint Croix National Scenic River, Wisconsin, Minnesota\nPictured Rocks National Seashore, Michigan\nCedar Breaks National Monument, Utah\nDinosaur National Monument, Colorado, Utah\nGrand Portage National Monument, Minnesota\nBlue Ridge Parkway, North Carolina, Virginia\nJohn D.

A finding of significant environmental impact must be made before implementing these restrictions. The Environmental Protection Agency will establish national standards for snowmobile emissions within two years of this Act's enactment, with the possibility of negotiating with manufacturers. The National Park Service, in collaboration with snowmobile manufacturers, will establish noise standards for snowmobile use in the National Park System within five years of the Act's enactment. Additionally, the Service will develop management plans and conduct studies to assess the impacts of recreational snowmobile use on park resources, visitor enjoyment, and adjacent communities, including compliance with EPA emission standards. The National Park Service will prepare a Report to Congress on the proper use of snowmobiles in National Park System units, considering the impact of snowmobiles compliant with emission standards on wildlife and the environment. This report must be completed within four years of the Act's enactment. The National Park Service will propose revised regulations for recreational snowmobile use within specified units, ensuring compliance with emission and noise standards. This will not affect provisions of Public Law 96-487."
