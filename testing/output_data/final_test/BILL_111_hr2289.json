    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Juvenile Justice Accountability and Improvement Act of 2009\". Congress recognizes the differences between adult and youth offenders, as highlighted in the Supreme Court decision of Roper v. Simmons. Despite this, many youth are being sentenced to life without parole, a growing national concern. Research shows over 2,500 youth in the US serving such sentences, a practice not seen in the rest of the world. Research indicates that over 2,500 youth offenders in the United States are serving life without parole sentences, with the majority being first-time offenders. Sixteen percent of these individuals were 15 or younger when they committed their crimes, and the rate of this sentence being imposed on children is at least 3 times higher today than 15 years ago. Establishing a meaningful opportunity for parole for child offenders is crucial, especially considering the high number of youth offenders serving life without parole sentences in the United States. Each State must have laws allowing child offenders serving life sentences to have a chance for parole or supervised release, with regular reviews. The Attorney General will issue guidelines within a year of this Act's enactment. In this section, guidelines and regulations are provided for child offenders serving life sentences. The definition of a \"child offender who is serving a life sentence\" is outlined, and the applicability of this section is specified for individuals sentenced before, on, or after the enactment of the Act. States have up to 3 years to comply with these regulations, with a possible 2-year extension granted by the Attorney General for good cause. A State may receive a 2-year extension for compliance efforts. Noncompliance results in a 10% fund reduction under specific programs, with reallocation to compliant States. SEC. 4. NOTICE TO VICTIMS. Each State with laws compliant with section 3 must provide public notice within 1 year, including details on parole opportunities for child offenders serving life sentences and contact information for further inquiries. The legislation requires states to provide public notice about parole opportunities for child offenders serving life sentences and allow victims to request information on parole hearings and decisions. Establishing a parallel system for child offenders serving life sentences at the federal level. Section 3624 of title 18, United States Code is amended to provide an opportunity for release for child offenders serving a life sentence for Federal offenses. The Attorney General must establish a system within a year that aligns with the Juvenile Justice Accountability and Improvement Act of 2009, including similar victim notice provisions. The system must be established by the Attorney General within a year to provide release opportunities for child offenders serving life sentences for Federal offenses, aligning with the Juvenile Justice Accountability and Improvement Act of 2009. SEC. 6. GRANTS TO IMPROVE LEGAL REPRESENTATION OF CHILDREN FACING OR SERVING LIFE IN PRISON. The Attorney General will award grants to States to enhance legal representation for child defendants and offenders facing life imprisonment sentences. This includes providing competent legal representation for individuals under 18 charged with serious offenses or sentenced to life imprisonment seeking appellate or collateral relief. In this section, \"legal representation\" includes legal counsel and necessary services for competent representation. Appropriations are authorized for carrying out this section."
