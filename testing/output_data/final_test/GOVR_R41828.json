He resigned from his position on May 18, 2011, and the First Deputy Managing Director is currently serving as Acting Managing Director. IMF and State Department reviews suggest that Mr. Strauss-Kahn is not entitled to immunity. IMF employees have limited diplomatic immunity for work-related actions. The managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, may not qualify for immunity under U.S. law due to being in New York for personal business. The State Department views him as unlikely to be eligible for immunity. The State Department believes that IMF employees have limited immunity for official acts. Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest poses challenges for the IMF, as he played a key role in increasing funding and global economic cooperation during his leadership. The IMF is involved in various global economic issues, including reforming IMF quotas to increase voting share of emerging economies and providing assistance packages to countries like Portugal and Greece. IMF's role in the current economic crisis in Europe was highlighted during a meeting attended by European finance ministers. The arrest and resignation of Ms. Nemat Shafik, IMF Deputy Managing Director, may impact the selection of Fund leadership. Debate surrounds the tradition of reserving leadership roles for Europeans at the IMF and Americans at the World Bank. Calls for a more transparent and merit-based selection process have been made, but changes have yet to be implemented. The United States, as the largest shareholder of the IMF, has a significant interest in the Fund's management selection process. The United States, as the largest shareholder of the IMF, has increased congressional interest in the Fund's activities. Recent focus has been on IMF lending post-2008 global economic crisis and concerns about fiscal deficits in Eurozone economies. Following Mr. Strauss-Kahn's arrest, Senator John Kerry expressed concerns and some Members called for his resignation. Congressional oversight of the IMF is limited, with U.S. participation authorized by the Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1945. The Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1945 delegates ultimate authority to the President to direct U.S. policy at the IMF. The President appoints individuals to represent the U.S. on the IMF Executive Board, which has authority over operations and policy decisions. Congressional authorization is required for certain decisions, such as changing the U.S. quota or amending the Articles of Agreement. Approval from Congress is not needed for individual loans or selecting the Managing Director. The tradition of selecting leadership at the IMF and World Bank is based on a 60-year old agreement that the World Bank president is American and the IMF Managing Director is European. This reflects the balance of power after World War II, with the U.S. believing the World Bank should be led by an American due to its capital surplus. Fred Vinson, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, established a Deputy Managing Director position in the IMF in 1949 to ensure a non-American would lead the IMF. The IMF Deputy Managing Director position was established in 1949 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 1994, the number of deputy directors was increased to three for regional diversity. The current deputy directors are Naoyuki Shinohara and Nemat Shafik. The IMF governance structure includes a Board of Governors, an Executive Board, and a Managing Director. The IMF governance structure includes a Board of Governors, usually at the Finance Minister or Central Bank governor level, who meet annually. Day-to-day authority is vested in the 24-member Board of Executive Directors, who oversee IMF activities. The five largest shareholders appoint their own Executive Director, while the rest are elected for two-year terms based on geographical or historical affinity. Reforms approved in December 2010 will eventually make the Executive Board consist solely of elected members. The IMF Executive Board selects the Managing Director, who oversees the Fund's operations and staff. The Board reviews policy papers and loan proposals prepared by IMF management or staff. An Independent Evaluation Office conducts objective evaluations of Fund operations and policies. The IMF Executive Board selects the Managing Director for a five-year renewable term. The selection process is outlined in the IMF's Articles of Agreements and By-laws, requiring a 50% majority vote. The Managing Director's contract can be renewed for another five-year term at the discretion of the Board. The selection process for the IMF Managing Director involves a five-year term, renewable at the discretion of the Executive Board. Candidates must be under 65 years old when appointed and cannot hold the position beyond the age of 70. The decision is historically made by consensus rather than formal voting, with informal straw polls used to narrow down potential candidates. The Executive Board has a strong aversion to voting, with the Chairman typically gauging the meeting's consensus instead. The selection process for the IMF Managing Director historically involved consensus rather than formal voting. Table 1 summarizes the process for past Managing Directors, showing increased European influence in recent appointments. The United States had more input in earlier selections, but efforts to agree on a single European candidate have been successful in the last three appointments. The selection process for the IMF Managing Director historically involved consensus rather than formal voting. In 2000, the United States vetoed the first European choice, creating resentment globally. Critics argue that the current leadership arrangement is outdated, as developing countries now contribute half of global output. The global economy is now more diverse, with multiple economic poles. The global economy is now characterized by \"multiple poles\" of economic growth, leading to calls for a more inclusive selection process for the IMF Managing Director. Critics argue that the current system limits potential candidates and undermines the legitimacy of the eventual appointee. There are concerns about the IMF's adherence to best practices in global governance. The IMF created a working group in 2000 to advise on reforming the selection process for Managing Directors. A draft report with five recommendations was endorsed in 2001 but not formally adopted. In 2007, a new procedure was adopted without explicit criteria. Recent discussions at G-20 summits emphasized the need for open, transparent, and merit-based selection processes for international institutions' leadership. The IMF working group advised on reforming the selection process for Managing Directors in 2000. Recent G-20 discussions highlighted the need for transparent leadership selection processes. Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency in the appointment process. Civil society organizations recommend an open process to boost public confidence. Key steps include publicly available job descriptions, widely advertised vacancies, and a fair application procedure. The 2010 report recommended a merit-based and transparent selection process for the managing director and deputies at the IMF. Mr. Strauss-Kahn resigned in 2011, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Geithner stating he was unfit to lead. Mohamed El-Erian compared the IMF to an army. According to Mohamed El-Erian, the Managing Director of the IMF is crucial for coordinating global healing during crises like the debt crisis in Europe. Some analysts criticized the IMF Executive Board for not acting quickly to remove Mr. Strauss-Kahn following his arrest. The Managing Director can be removed by the Executive Board at any time. Some IMF members were hesitant to force Mr. Strauss-Kahn out before more details emerged or he was convicted of a crime. The IMF Executive Board is in the process of selecting the next Managing Director, with nominations accepted until June 10, 2011. Emerging market countries are pushing for a non-European leader, while European leaders are advocating for a European successor to Mr. Strauss-Kahn. European leaders are advocating for a European successor to Mr. Strauss-Khan as the next Managing Director of the IMF, citing the current heavy IMF focus in Europe. However, some argue that the emerging countries also have a claim to fill the position in the medium term. Some analysts argue that calls for a non-European IMF Managing Director from emerging economies could highlight divisions hindering unity. Potential candidates include Gordan Brown, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Kemal Dervis, Christine Lagarde, and Trevor Manuel. Potential candidates for the IMF Managing Director position include Christine Lagarde, Trevor Manuel, Agustin Carstens, Montek Singh Ahluwlia, and Min Zhu."
