    "content": "The \"Interstate Commerce Efficiency and Safety Improvement Act of 1993\" aims to transfer the functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission to the Department of Transportation to promote fiscal responsibility and enhance safety on U.S. highways by consolidating motor carrier safety regulation. Effective October 1, 1993, all functions of the Commission are transferred to the Secretary. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Commission and the Secretary, may determine necessary functions and make incidental dispositions. Unobligated funds of the Commission will not be transferred to the Department of Transportation, and the number of full-time employee positions within the Department will not increase due to the transfer of functions. The Chairman of the Commission will engage in joint planning for the transfer. The Chairman of the Commission and the Secretary will jointly plan for the orderly transfer of functions under this Act. The Secretary may use Commission personnel to facilitate the transfer before October 1, 1993. SEC. 5. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. All orders, rules, permits, contracts, licenses, and privileges issued by any agency or court before the transfer of functions to the Secretary will remain in effect until modified or revoked by the Secretary, court, or operation of law. The transfer of functions will not affect ongoing proceedings. The Act will not impact ongoing proceedings, including rulemaking, applications for licenses, permits, or certificates before the Commission. These proceedings will continue at the Department of Transportation, with orders issued and appeals allowed as if the Act had not been enacted. Orders will remain in effect until modified or revoked by the Secretary of Transportation, a court, or by law. This subsection does not prevent the discontinuation or modification of proceedings as they could have been without the Act. The transfer of functions under the Act will not affect pending civil actions or ongoing proceedings. Actions against Commission officers will not abate due to the transfer. Proceedings will continue at the Department of Transportation as if the Act had not been enacted. The Act ensures that ongoing civil actions involving the Commission will continue with the Department of Transportation taking over. Federal law references to the Commission will now refer to the Department of Transportation. The Secretary will exercise the functions transferred by the Act. The Secretary will have the same authority as the Commission in exercising transferred functions under the Act, with actions subject to judicial review. Statutory requirements for notice, hearings, and administrative review will apply to the Secretary's exercise of functions. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by March 31, 1994, detailing the functions transferred from the Commission to the Department of Transportation. The report should assess benefits compared to costs, recommend eliminating redundant functions, and suggest modifications or eliminations for functions lacking substantial economic or safety benefits to the public. SEC. 7. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Amends title 5, United States Code, by removing references to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Repeals sections 10301 through 10308 of title 49, United States Code. Effective date of amendments is October 1, 1993."
