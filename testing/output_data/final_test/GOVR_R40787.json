    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) lists and protects endangered or threatened species, imposing restrictions on activities that could harm them. Federal agencies must consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service to assess potential impacts on listed species. This consultation process is crucial for ensuring species' survival and habitat protection. The consultation process under the Endangered Species Act involves federal agencies seeking a biological opinion from the appropriate Service to assess potential harm to listed species. If jeopardy is identified, reasonable and prudent alternatives are provided to avoid harm. An incidental take statement may be issued with measures to minimize impacts, and exemptions can be sought in rare cases where jeopardy cannot be avoided. The exemption process under the Endangered Species Act allows for consideration of extraordinary economic circumstances to override jeopardy to a species. Exemptions are sought for federal projects, licenses, or actions, rather than for a species itself. Only six exemption requests have been made in over four decades, with two granted. Appendices provide details on past exemption attempts, which may be useful for future applications. The controversy over California water projects in the mid- and late-2000s led to proposals to seek an exemption from the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The history of the California water conflict is discussed in Appendix E. The exemption process was created by Congress after the controversy over the Tellico Dam in Tennessee in the 1970s, where the ESA prohibited activities detrimental to listed species. The Supreme Court's decision in Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) v. Hill set the precedent for the exemption process. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) commands federal agencies to ensure actions do not harm endangered species or their habitats, with no exceptions. Despite potential project benefits and costs, Congress prioritized species protection. Congress later amended the ESA to allow for consideration of economic impacts and exemptions for government projects. The Tellico Dam controversy highlighted that debates over the Endangered Species Act often revolve around resource allocation rather than species protection. Congress established a committee to balance the national interest in protecting species with the impacts of federal projects. The Endangered Species Act established a committee to balance national interests in protecting species with the impacts of federal projects. The Endangered Species Committee reviews exemptions and makes the ultimate decision, composed of members such as the Secretary of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Army. The basic structure formed after the Tellico Dam controversy remains the same. The Endangered Species Committee, composed of key members including the Secretary of the Interior and Agriculture, reviews exemptions for federal projects. Exemption applications are limited to three eligible entities: the federal agency proposing the action, the state governor, or the permit/license applicant. The term permit/license applicant refers to a person denied a permit or license due to ESA prohibitions. The exemption process is used after a Section 7 consultation has been completed to avoid jeopardy or destruction of critical habitat. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary within 90 days of completing the consultation. The exemption applicant, whether a federal agency or state, must submit an application within 90 days of completing the Section 7 consultation. The application should include reasons for seeking an exemption, relevant documents like a biological assessment and BiOp, and project alternatives. The Secretary may deny incomplete applications within 10 days. If complete, a notice will be published in the Federal Register and affected states notified for ESC member appointments. The State Department will also be informed for treaty conflict reviews. The Secretary evaluates if the federal agency or exemption applicant met criteria for consultation, biological assessment, and resource commitment within 20 days. A denial can be challenged in federal court. This ensures compliance with international treaties and agreements. The statute prohibits initiating consultation from making commitments of resources that could hinder alternative measures, preventing waste of federal resources and harm to species or habitats. The reference to commitments of resources in the exemption process likely pertains to activities after consultation concludes. The ESC may face a fait accompli if an exemption is sought, leading to the loss of a species in violation of the act. A formal hearing must be convened within 140 days of meeting exemption requirements, conducted by an ALJ to collect evidence and develop a full record for the Secretary's report. The report must discuss the availability of reasonable options. The Secretary's report must cover the availability of alternatives, benefits of the agency action, conservation measures, public interest, mitigation measures, and resource commitments. The ESC has 30 days to decide on exemptions and can conduct additional fact-finding if needed. Meetings, hearings, and records of the ESC are open to the public. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) makes decisions based on evidence presented in open meetings and hearings. An exemption is granted if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the costs, the action is of national significance, and no irreversible commitments have been made. Economic impacts are considered in the decision-making process. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) grants exemptions based on economic impacts and alternative courses of action. Five affirmative votes are required for approval, with specified mitigation and enhancement measures. The measures can include live propagation, transplantation, and habitat acquisition. The exemption applicant is responsible for funding the mitigation, with the option to request the Secretary to carry out the measures. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) grants exemptions based on economic impacts and alternative courses of action. Mitigation and enhancement measures must be funded by the applicant and included in the overall costs of the proposed action. The exemption is permanent unless the Secretary determines it could lead to species extinction, in which case it may be revoked. The Endangered Species Committee grants permanent exemptions for federal agency actions based on economic impacts and alternative courses of action. The exemption is not revoked unless it could lead to species extinction. Penalties for taking endangered or threatened species do not apply to exempted actions, but agencies are still obligated to recover the species. If an exempted action harms a species, remaining habitat may receive more intense scrutiny. The Endangered Species Committee grants permanent exemptions for federal agency actions based on economic impacts and alternative courses of action. If the exempted action degrades the species' habitat quality, more scrutiny may be given to federal actions affecting the habitat. Limits exist on the ESC's authority, such as not being able to grant exemptions that violate international obligations. The Secretary of State must determine if an action would violate international obligations within 60 days of an application. The ESC must grant an exemption for national security reasons. It is unclear if the ESC would still need to meet and vote in this case. The Defense Department has not used the exemption provision in the ESA, citing it as too cumbersome and time-consuming. In case of a presidentially declared disaster, the ESA allows for another exemption option for projects to replace or repair public facilities. The President can make determinations that would have been made by the Secretary and the ESC. The ESA exemption provision allows the President to determine the necessity of a project to prevent natural disasters without following ordinary procedures. The ESC must accept the President's determinations, but it is unclear if the ESC still needs to be convened. This provision has not been used yet. If an agency receives an exemption, conflicts related to natural resources may persist, involving various species and interest groups beyond just threatened or endangered species. In a controversy over river and dam management in the San Joaquin River basin and the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, lawsuits have been filed based on federal and state laws addressing irrigation water supply, fish and wildlife management, recreation, and the environment. Federal court decisions leading to the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement agreement were influenced by both the ESA and a state law requiring sufficient water for downstream fish habitat. Water-flow restrictions due to ESA requirements are just one aspect of the regulatory challenges in CVP-related cases. The ESA exemption process can be lengthy, taking up to 280 days, and may lead to conflicts with state laws. Some state requirements may align with ESA regulations, resulting in both sets of rules applying simultaneously. The complexity of the exemption process is necessary to prevent species extinction, although some may find it burdensome. The exemption process for the Endangered Species Act (ESA) can be lengthy and burdensome, requiring funding for mitigation measures that last indefinitely. The exemption applies to the action, not the species, leading to ongoing conservation efforts by FWS or NMFS. This can create challenges for governors balancing state interests and may not advance the action if other statutory obligations still apply. Many parties may be hesitant to publicly support exemptions that could impact species conservation efforts. The consultation process under the Endangered Species Act offers opportunities for federal agencies to modify their actions to avoid harming species or their habitats. Parties involved in a dispute may be reluctant to support exemptions that could impact species conservation efforts. Prospective applicants must weigh the costs and benefits of seeking an exemption. The Endangered Species Act has strong legal protections for listed species, forcing decisions on long-standing conflicts over land and water resource use. Parties involved in debates over resource allocation have struggled for years, with examples including conflicts over water management in California and timber harvest in the Pacific Northwest. When exemptions are considered, potential applicants may be unaware of the process and its benefits and costs. The Endangered Species Act provides strong legal protections for listed species, resolving conflicts over land and water resource use. Potential applicants for exemptions may be unaware of the process and its implications, leading to limited interest in the exemption process. The consultation and negotiation stages in the ESA may help modify proposed actions early on to avoid harm to listed species, explaining why the exemption process is rarely invoked. The exemption process under the Endangered Species Act is rarely used. If a project decides to apply for an exemption, the first step is to determine who should apply and for what action. The Secretary and ESC must make all required findings for an exemption. Even if granted, legal challenges may still arise. An example is the Tellico Dam project in Tennessee, where opposition arose despite arguments for navigation and economic benefits. Opposition to the Grayrocks Dam project arose early due to concerns over fishing, recreation, Native American sites, and loss of agricultural land. Project opponents had to decide whether to focus on the discovery of the snail darter as their main argument. The Platte River in Nebraska is crucial for endangered whooping cranes' migration, and the construction of Grayrocks Dam was deemed to jeopardize their habitat. The Grayrocks Dam project in Wyoming, along with other projects in the Platte River basin, posed a threat to the downstream habitat of cranes. The reduction in instream flow from the dam could have damaged the cranes' resting sites, leading to opposition from Nebraska due to threats to irrigation interests. Federal agencies involved were the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Rural Electrification Administration. In the Pacific Northwest, controversy surrounded timber harvests from federal lands in the 1980s and 1990s involving various stakeholders. The conflict over timber management in the Pacific Northwest involved various stakeholders, including commercial fishermen, Indian tribes, hunters, and motorized recreation interests. Key federal laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Forest Management Act played a role in the debate. The listing of the northern spotted owl as threatened in 1990 brought the Endangered Species Act into the conflict, as the owl depends on old growth forests for its survival, which are also valuable to the timber industry. The Bureau of Land Management manages old growth forests in Oregon, leading to conflicts over resource management. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages old growth forests in Oregon, where conflicts over resource management have arisen, including the presence of the threatened spotted owl. BLM submitted its proposed FY1991 timber sale program to FWS for consultation. The history includes lawsuits and actions based on the Endangered Species Act (ESA), with three completed exemption applications and instances of withdrawn applications. One example is the Pittston Company's plan to build an oil refinery in Eastport, ME, which faced opposition due to environmental concerns. In 1979, Pittston Company applied for an exemption under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for its discharge permit after EPA denied its application to discharge effluent. Environmental groups sued, arguing that the exemption application was premature. The Pittston Company applied for an exemption under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) for its discharge permit after EPA denied its application. The U.S. Justice Department agreed that the law was unclear and that the exemption process should not run concurrently with an appeal. Congress clarified in 1982 amendments that the exemption process should only be invoked after other compliance measures had failed. The applicant cannot simultaneously seek an administrative appeal and an exemption. The Consolidated Grain and Barge Company (CGBC) sought to build a docking area for barges on the Ohio River at Mound City, IL, which was habitat for the endangered orange-footed pearly mussel. CGBC applied for a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers but was denied due to a jeopardy BiOp issued by FWS. FWS then published notice of an exemption application in the Federal Register, with a hearing scheduled in St. Louis, MO. The DOI Secretary agreed that the threshold criteria for beginning the exemption process had been met for the project to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, FL. CGBC did not send a representative to a pre-hearing conference, leading to a request for an extension that was withdrawn before the hearing. The project to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, FL, which provided habitat for endangered manatees, faced permit issues due to the presence of manatees. The consulting engineer's actions were not ratified by the SRA, leading to a request for withdrawal of the exemption application. The California Central Valley Project and State Water Project were also of concern due to federal BiOps affecting their coordinated operation. The effect of ESA pumping restrictions on water supplies in central and southern California has been a concern for many Members of Congress. Water users experienced reduced supplies during a drought, with some receiving no water from the CVP. There are debates about relaxing pumping restrictions to benefit water users, but concerns have been raised about the impact on threatened and endangered species like the Delta smelt and various salmon. Despite other factors affecting water availability, attention has focused on ESA restrictions on project operations. In 2009, there were calls to petition the governor and President for an ESA exemption. In response to RPAs developed during the ESA consultation process on CVP and SWP operations, some parties advocated petitioning the governor and President to begin the ESA exemption process. Legislative activity in the 114th Congress focused on bills addressing ESA restrictions, but none sought exemptions. The WIIN Act, signed into law in 2016, included provisions allowing increased pumping under certain conditions. Legislation in the 115th Congress may also address CVP and SWP operations. Legislation in the 115th Congress may address CVP and SWP operations and implementation of the ESA."
