FINDINGS.\" Congress finds that the decennial census is crucial for apportioning Representatives in Congress, determining district boundaries, and allocating federal and state funds. The 1990 census was the first in history to be less accurate than the previous one, missing over 8,000,000 Americans. The 1990 decennial census was less accurate than the previous one, missing a significant percentage of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Pacific Americans, and American-Indians. Only 2 out of every 3 households returned their census forms, leading to costly and time-consuming enumerator visits. The mailback response rate has been declining over the past censuses, with expectations of further decline in the 2000 census. The 2000 census mailback response rate is estimated to be 61 percent. If it falls below this rate, a contingency plan would be needed, requiring more budget than allocated. The Bureau of the Census aims to recruit 3.5 million applicants for 860,000 positions, a challenging task due to the current labor market conditions. The labor market is tight, making it difficult to hire temporary census enumerators for the 2000 decennial census. Congress needs to ensure additional funding is available to obtain an accurate count, or else it may disproportionately harm minorities, children, and the urban and rural poor. Additional $100,000,000 is appropriated for the 2000 decennial census, contingent on the Secretary of Commerce's determination of necessity. Definitions for the 2000 census positions, temporary roles, census, uniformed services, and voluntary separation incentive payments are provided in this section. Members of the uniformed services are authorized to hold these positions. Members of the uniformed services can be appointed to temporary census positions without affecting their duty status or pay. Accepting a census appointment will not impact their status in the uniformed service or their right to retain a voluntary separation incentive payment. Compensation for service as a temporary census employee will not cause ineligibility or reduction in certain benefits under any Federal program. (e) Applicability.--Subsections (b) and (c) apply to appointments to 2000 census positions accepted after the enactment of this Act and before January 1, 2001. Subsection (d) applies to compensation for service in a 2000 census position during the same time period."
