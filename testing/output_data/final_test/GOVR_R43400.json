    "content": "Congress is currently debating how to promote work within programs that aid poor and low-income families, such as SNAP and federal rental housing assistance programs. This interest has been sparked by concerns about dependency on government assistance, federal spending, work disincentives, and the effectiveness of the current social safety net in addressing poverty. The last major debate on this topic led to the 1996 welfare reform law, which created the TANF block grant. Policies in the 1990s focused on assistance for low-income families with children, particularly single mothers. The welfare reform law led to a decline in cash assistance for families without workers but increased aid for low-income families with wage earners. Despite initial gains, some progress was reversed in the 2000s, with stagnant household incomes and worsening economic circumstances for certain populations. The House Budget Committee proposed work participation standards in SNAP and reforms for need-tested assistance programs in the 2014 budget. Congress retained existing SNAP work rules but funded pilot projects to test alternative employment strategies. This report focuses on work requirements in TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance programs. The report explores the complexities of work requirements in government benefit programs like TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance. Policy makers considering expanding these policies face various considerations regarding their applicability to other social assistance programs. The generosity and conditions of benefits can impact labor markets by influencing workforce participation and wages. Work is a central aspect of US government benefit programs, including social insurance programs like Social Security and Medicare. Social insurance programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Unemployment Insurance provide benefits earned through work. Low-income assistance programs based on financial need can also impact workforce participation. Understanding work-related requirements and incentives in TANF, SNAP, and federal rental housing assistance is important. Four primary rationales for these policies include offsetting work disincentives, promoting a culture of work, rationing taxpayer dollars, and combating poverty. The work incentives and requirements in government assistance programs aim to combat work disincentives by reducing benefits as earnings increase, creating a high implicit \"tax\" rate. Empirical studies confirm the work disincentive effect of social assistance, with work requirements serving to counteract this effect. Work requirements in government benefits counteract work disincentives by mandating recipients to engage in labor market-related activities. Failure to comply can lead to a reduction or loss of benefits. Work incentives aim to reduce the high implicit \"tax rate\" on earnings in low-income assistance programs by disregarding a portion of earnings in determining eligibility. The centrality of work to the nation's economic and social organization is another rationale for these policies. The centrality of work to the nation's economic and social organization is emphasized in policies that counteract work disincentives in government benefits. Dependency on government programs is seen as a threat to the social norm of work, leading to behaviors like out-of-wedlock births, crime, and drug abuse. Work incentives and requirements aim to promote a culture of work over a culture of dependency by addressing concerns through measures like time-limiting public benefits. One way policymakers address dependency concerns is by supporting families to increase their work effort, leading to higher incomes and reduced need for public benefits. Work requirements aim to effectively distribute federal resources by moving families out of assistance programs, freeing up resources for other priorities. Work requirements also help screen out those not truly in need of benefits, ensuring assistance goes to those with limited alternatives. In many communities, there are long waiting lists for assistance programs due to limited funding. States aim to reduce cash assistance caseloads to allocate funds to other benefits. The argument for prioritizing aid for the truly needy is based on the scarcity of federal tax dollars. Without income from work, individuals and their families are likely to be poor, emphasizing the importance of work-related benefits. The importance of work-related benefits in social assistance programs is highlighted as a means to lift families out of poverty. Legislative histories show how employment status became a factor in cash, food, and housing assistance programs, emphasizing the need for coordination among different programs and stakeholders. The federal role in providing cash assistance to the needy dates back to the Social Security Act of 1935, which created social insurance programs and federal grants to help states pay public assistance benefits. Public assistance programs provided benefits based on financial need, with the Aid to Dependent Children program later renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to support needy families with children. The federal government established cash assistance programs for the needy, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). AFDC later became TANF with work requirements, while SSI does not require work. Food and housing aid programs, including the Food Stamp Program, were also created to serve policy purposes beyond just helping the needy. The Food Stamp Program, now known as SNAP, was established in 1964 to support the agricultural economy. The program underwent amendments in 1971 to create uniform federal rules for eligibility and benefits. Concerns arose about its impact on participants' employment, leading to the implementation of work-related rules. The Food Stamp Program, now SNAP, was established in 1964 to support the agricultural economy. In 1971, uniform federal rules for eligibility and benefits were created. P.L. 91-671 required able-bodied adults to register for work, with disqualifications for quitting jobs or refusing employment. Workfare programs were piloted in 1977 and became a state option in 1981. Federal funding for employment and training activities was added in 1985. The 1996 welfare reform law added time limits for nonworking able-bodied adults without dependents. E&T financing was established in the 2002 farm bill. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 created the Section 8 program, which was later reformed in 1998. Work and self-sufficiency policies were added to assisted housing programs in the mid-1980s. The number of nonworking and very poor families in public and assisted housing grew over time due to policy and demographic changes. The 1998 reforms (P.L. 105-276) introduced the first work requirement for housing, requiring certain public housing tenants to participate in community service or economic self-sufficiency activities for 8 hours per month. This report compares the work-related policies of TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance, highlighting the differences in populations served by these programs. The TANF program provides cash assistance to the very poor, with low income thresholds and work requirements for recipients. SNAP and housing assistance help low-income households afford food and housing, with the premise that they should not spend more than 30% of their income on these necessities. These programs serve a diverse population, including elderly, disabled individuals, singles, couples without children, and families with children. The work-related policies in TANF, SNAP, and federal housing assistance include work requirements such as engaging in work activities as a condition of eligibility. TANF requires participants to work and sanctions families that do not comply. SNAP requires able-bodied adults to register for work activities. Federal housing law mandates an 8-hour per month community service or self-sufficiency requirement for public housing residents. The work-related policies in TANF, SNAP, and federal housing assistance include work requirements and time limits. TANF limits cash assistance to five years, SNAP limits benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents, and federal housing assistance has a community service requirement. Benefit programs can be designed to reduce disincentives to work by disregarding participant earnings, providing earned income deductions, and offering work incentive programs. Policies may vary in implementation, with some directly applying federal policy to individual program participants. For example, the Section 8 voucher program may include a community service requirement of 8 hours per month. The work-related policies in TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance programs include a 8-hour per month community service requirement for program participants. Federal policies may set performance standards for states based on their caseload. TANF's work participation rate can lead to rewards or penalties for states. The TANF work participation standard applies to states, requiring a specific percentage of families to engage in activities like job search, community service, or short-term rehabilitative activities. States have flexibility in determining individual requirements. The TANF work participation standard applies to states, requiring families to engage in activities like job search or community service. States have flexibility in determining individual requirements, while SNAP work requirements apply to individuals with varying state options. Housing assistance may have community service or self-sufficiency requirements for individuals in public housing, with some public housing authorities able to impose work requirements under the \"Moving-to-Work\" demonstration. Time limit policies for TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance are compared in Table 3. Assistance programs like TANF, SNAP, and housing may have time limits for certain participants. TANF has a time limit for families with an adult member, while SNAP limits benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents. Housing assistance programs may also impose time limits under certain conditions. The TANF, SNAP, and housing assistance programs have earnings disregards and sometimes disregard accumulated savings. TANF has state-determined earnings disregards, while SNAP and housing assistance have federally-determined ones. TANF also has more robust work requirement and time limit policies compared to SNAP and housing assistance. The TANF program has work requirements for states, not individuals, to meet performance standards. States can achieve these standards by having families engaged in activities or receiving credits. Figure 1 illustrates the trend in families participating in TANF work activities, including unsubsidized employment and other activities. The TANF program has work requirements for states to meet performance standards. The official work participation rate has been around 30%, with most recipients engaged in unsubsidized employment. Fewer families participated in activities like job search and vocational training. In FY1998, close to 700,000 TANF families had members involved in work activities. In FY1998, around 700,000 TANF families had members engaged in work or activities, with 491,000 in unsubsidized jobs and 209,000 in other activities. By FY2014, the numbers decreased to 321,000 families, with 225,000 in unsubsidized employment and 95,308 in other activities. Despite low work participation rates, there was a significant decline in cash assistance caseloads. The AFDC caseload started decreasing in FY1994, before the 1996 welfare reform law. In FY2008, the number of families receiving assistance was one-third of what it was in FY1994. The decline in cash assistance caseloads was influenced by the booming economy of the late 1990s, which reduced the number of needy families eligible for aid. Despite the decrease in eligible families, the percentage of those actually receiving assistance also declined. In 1994, 82% of eligible families received benefits, but by 2001, this percentage had decreased. In 1994, 82% of eligible families received benefits, decreasing to 48% by 2001. The share of eligible families receiving assistance further declined to 32% in 2009 and remained unchanged in 2012. The enactment of TANF followed extensive research on welfare-to-work programs, which did not predict the significant decline in caseloads. Research on the impact of welfare-to-work programs post-TANF found that the decline in cash assistance caseloads was due to families leaving the program faster and fewer families entering. Work requirements and time limits played a role in families exiting TANF quicker, with some being sanctioned for non-compliance. In FY2015, 134,000 families lost TANF cash benefits due to work requirement non-compliance, while 23,000 families lost benefits because of time limits. A study showed that 40% of the decline in cash assistance caseloads was due to fewer entries onto the rolls, possibly influenced by welfare reform policies deterring applicants. States can set eligibility conditions, such as requiring job searches for TANF cash applicants. Some states require job searches for TANF cash applicants before receiving benefits, potentially diverting families into employment or deterring them from completing requirements. The caseload declined from 2000 to the start of the 2007-2009 recession, with a slower rate than in the late 1990s. During the recession, the caseload increased but not as sharply as before. Studies were conducted to track the employment status and earnings of welfare leavers. The majority of welfare leavers found employment after exiting the program, but their earnings were typically low and often unstable. Many continued to receive SNAP benefits even after leaving cash assistance. Studies show that the income safety net has shifted towards supporting work for single parent families with children since 1996 welfare reform. The welfare system has shifted to support work for single parent families with children since the 1996 welfare reform. Cash-welfare work requirements and time limits have reduced reliance on traditional cash welfare and poverty among children. TANF is just one part of the changes made to low-income assistance programs in the mid-1990s. Work requirements, time limits, and work incentives aim to offset work disincentives. The 1996 welfare reform aimed to promote a culture of work and reduce dependency by implementing work requirements and time limits in social assistance programs like TANF. Policymakers are considering extending these policies to programs like SNAP and housing assistance, taking into account program-specific considerations. The 1996 welfare reform aimed to promote a culture of work and reduce dependency by implementing work requirements and time limits in social assistance programs like TANF. Policymakers are considering extending these policies to programs like SNAP and housing assistance, taking into account program-specific considerations. TANF serves very few men, while SNAP and housing assistance serve more men, with TANF focusing on getting single mothers into employment. Historically, men have had higher labor force participation and employment rates than women. However, men's labor force participation rates have declined post-World War II, while women's rates increased until the early 2000s. Disadvantaged men face social and economic barriers, with a large number being imprisoned. Men re-entering society from prison struggle to find employment due to societal stigmas. Researchers are exploring ways to successfully reintegrate men into the workforce. Men's reentry into the workforce faces challenges due to societal and economic barriers, including limited support from SNAP and housing assistance programs. Single mothers have access to the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is not as available to single men and noncustodial fathers. TANF's work requirements aim to reduce welfare dependency, with only a small percentage of AFDC families reporting earnings in the past. Expanding work-related policies in SNAP and housing assistance could benefit men, but further research is needed on their effectiveness. The work requirements in TANF aim to promote workforce participation, not necessarily to increase earnings through education. SNAP and housing assistance programs cater to diverse populations, with higher income thresholds than cash assistance. Many families leaving cash assistance for work still qualify for SNAP. SNAP and housing assistance may serve as income supplements for low-wage workers, with a significant percentage of SNAP households having earnings. In FY2010, 53% of households receiving housing assistance headed by a nonelderly, nondisabled member had some income from earnings. Extending work requirements to programs like SNAP and housing assistance aims to improve workers' employability and upward mobility, but evidence shows limited impact on employment and earnings. TANF has more funding for employment and job training compared to SNAP and housing programs. In FY2015, TANF had $2.1 billion in combined federal and state funding for employment and training activities, while SNAP only had $334 million in federal funding for employment and training. Federal housing programs do not have dedicated funding for employment and training programs. Some HUD housing assistance programs are subject to the \"Section 3\" requirement, which mandates job training and employment opportunities for residents. SNAP and TANF are generally administered in the same state offices, allowing for potential coordination of work requirements. Housing assistance is administered locally and disconnected from TANF and SNAP state systems. Housing assistance programs are administered locally and disconnected from TANF and SNAP state systems, leading to challenges in providing comprehensive employment supports. Implementing new work-related policies would require additional resources and raise questions about the cost of administering requirements for participants who are exempted due to age or disabilities. The cost of administering work requirements for SNAP and housing assistance programs raises questions about the benefit. Extending work requirements could result in large administrative costs, similar to TANF. States or public housing agencies may need to meet federal work participation standards, or individuals may have to meet federal standards. Performance measures would be crucial for program operation. Performance measures for work requirements in programs like SNAP and housing assistance could provide flexibility for entities to design individual requirements based on local needs and factors. This approach may only engage a portion of the caseload, controlling costs and targeting specific populations. It could also increase accountability for providing employment and training opportunities, although there may be unintended consequences. Government assistance programs enforce mandatory work requirements through financial sanctions, such as reducing benefits for non-compliance. Individual mandates may be more effective than performance standards but limit flexibility and increase administrative costs. Cream skimming, focusing on easier-to-employ individuals, can lead to missing the point of rapid job entry goals. The financial sanction in government assistance programs can result in a reduction or complete ending of benefits for non-compliance with work requirements. Despite being a motivation for compliance, sanctions pose a challenge as families rely on aid for basic needs. Little research focuses on the implications of sanction policies, which are based on recipients making rational decisions about program rules. The financial sanction in government assistance programs can lead to a reduction or termination of benefits for non-compliance with work requirements. States have increasingly implemented full-family sanctions, ending benefits for families that do not adhere to state requirements. In July 2014, 46 states ultimately terminated benefits for non-compliant families. In 2014, 46 states ended benefits for noncompliant families, while California and New York reduce but do not end benefits. SNAP and housing assistance have work requirement sanctions, with eviction possible for noncompliance. Implementing time limits and work requirements in these programs may raise unique considerations. If cash benefits are terminated in TANF, other noncash benefits like medical, food, and housing assistance may still be available. Ending benefits for noncompliant recipients of SNAP and housing assistance could lead to concerns about hunger, malnutrition, and homelessness for the entire family, including children, elderly, or disabled members. Sanctioning in housing assistance can result in families losing their homes, either through eviction in public housing or termination of payments in the Section 8 voucher program. Eviction due to nonpayment of rent can be traumatic for families receiving housing assistance. Termination of benefits as a last resort may lead to homelessness. Sanctioning policies can put families in difficult positions, such as risking eviction for fraud or breaking up the family. Welfare reform experiments in the 1960s and 1970s tested negative income tax proposals and mandatory work requirements for AFDC recipients, showing that guaranteed income reduced work effort and expanding aid beyond single mothers did not prevent family breakup. The welfare-to-work experiments conducted over 30 years found that mandatory work programs for AFDC recipients increased employment and reduced welfare receipt. Both \"work-first\" and education-focused programs had positive impacts on job attachment, but did not significantly reduce poverty as participants' incomes remained below the poverty line. The 1996 welfare reform law followed years of research on effective poverty reduction programs, which included government-funded earnings supplements. However, research on SNAP and housing assistance is lacking, and questions remain about the relevance of older welfare research in today's labor market conditions. Work programs in social policy aim to increase anti-poverty effectiveness, as benefits alone are often insufficient to lift families out of poverty. Social assistance programs are not enough to lift families out of poverty; income from work is crucial. In 2015, 13.5% of all persons were in poverty, with 90.8% of those in families without a worker classified as poor. While work or work-based benefits are necessary to avoid poverty, 8.7% of persons in families with workers were still officially poor. Poverty rates were lowest for families with full-year, full-time workers, higher for those with part-time or unemployed workers. In 2015, poverty rates were lowest for families with full-year, full-time workers, higher for those with part-time or unemployed workers. Three out of ten families headed by a single mother who worked had earnings below the poverty level. Welfare reforms in the mid-1990s aimed to \"make work pay\" through policies like expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. In 2017, the maximum EITC for a taxpayer with three dependent children was $6,318, providing a significant income boost for low-wage working parents. The Child Tax Credit also offers up to $1,000 per child for families with earnings. Federal funding for state child care programs, such as the CCDBG, was substantially increased in the 1996 welfare reform law. Legislation in the 1980s phased in health insurance coverage for all poor children, regardless of cash welfare receipt. The Family Support Act of 1988 created \"transitional Medicaid\" for families leaving cash welfare. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was established in 1997 to assist low-income families. Policy changes in the 1990s focused on families with children, particularly single mothers, while childless individuals and couples benefited less. A small EITC was available for childless tax filers in 2017. In 2017, the maximum EITC for childless tax filers is $510, but a single person working full-time at minimum wage would earn too much to qualify. Proposals have been made to expand the EITC for childless filers. The creation of TANF brought work requirements and time limits, leading to reduced caseloads. This has sparked interest in applying similar policies to other programs like SNAP and housing assistance. Lessons from TANF's experience may be useful for policymakers considering policy expansions. The enactment of TANF policies in the 1990s led to increased work for single mothers. It is uncertain if similar policies would have the same effect for SNAP and housing assistance recipients who are not working. Further research is needed to address this question."
