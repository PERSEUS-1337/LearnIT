The uncertainty and shift in strategy and policy goals may be exploited by enemies of the United States. During a presidential transition, there is a heightened risk of national security incidents as enemies of the United States may exploit the uncertainty and shift in policy goals. The current international security environment and recent disruptions in power transfers in other countries have raised concerns about increased risk during the transition period. The intelligence community warns of increased propaganda threats from Al-Qaida targeting the Western audience during the U.S. presidential election. Concerns about potential vulnerabilities during the transition period are highlighted in a report to the Department of Homeland Security. Frances Townsend, former Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor, expresses concern about vulnerabilities during transition periods, citing Al Qaeda's history of influencing elections. Al Qaeda has a track record of attempting to influence elections and gain political power. During presidential transitions, the outgoing and incoming administrations are responsible for addressing risks to national security and taking preventive actions. The new President will face various national security challenges, and how they respond will depend on the transition planning and learning process. During presidential transitions, activities are undertaken to facilitate a smooth transfer of power, including consulting with experts, providing information to the President-elect, offering operational briefings on national security matters, preparing briefings books, and expediting security clearances. Other potential activities include public outreach efforts. During the presidential transition period, efforts are made to discuss national security risks, involve national security representatives of presidential hopefuls, establish advisory councils for addressing risks, support national awareness of risks, reflect new Administration's priorities in the budget, pass appropriations promptly, assign Congress members to security committees, hold hearings with experts on security policies, and determine new Administration's security priorities post-inauguration. The next Administration is likely to face various national security challenges, including current military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan, risks in countries like Iran and North Korea, and contemporary security threats in regions such as Russia, China, and the Middle East. The next Administration will face national security challenges in countries like Iran, North Korea, Russia, China, and the Middle East. Understanding these challenges before inauguration will help the new President make well-reasoned decisions. During the presidential transition period, enhanced cooperation and communication between the current and incoming Administrations is crucial for national security and foreign policy concerns. The need for effective and seamless transitions is emphasized due to the increasing dangers in the world. Outgoing and incoming Presidents must work together to address national security issues. During the presidential transition period, national security-related concerns and opportunities arise for the incoming and outgoing administrations. Collaborative efforts and oversight activities are crucial for recognizing and responding to disruptions in the transfer of power or changes in U.S. policies. Congress may request hearings and reports on threats to the presidential election. During the presidential transition period, national security observers warn of potential dangers from terrorist groups targeting United States interests to influence election results or future policies. Threats may aim to demonstrate power, intimidate voters, exploit perceived weaknesses in candidates' security positions, or alter election outcomes and U.S. policies. During the presidential transition period, national security observers warn of potential dangers from terrorist groups targeting United States interests to influence election results or future policies. Many speculate that enemies may prefer to act just before the election, but the timing of such acts may be based on opportunity rather than manipulation of election results. During the 2008-2009 transition, new national security agencies face challenges with personnel turnover and lack of experience in addressing national security issues during presidential transitions. Older agencies may also need to allocate more resources to transition-related matters. During the presidential transition, federal agencies may not be adequately prepared for the incoming Administration's policy familiarization efforts, potentially requiring personnel and resource reallocation. This could impact national security activities and risk the nation's security. President Bush signed Directives in 2007 focusing on Continuity Of Government and Continuity of Operations during crises. During times of crisis, Directives signed by President Bush in 2007 outlined national essential functions to be continued for the U.S. government's perseverance. These Directives emphasized the need for cooperation among branches of government to maintain the constitutional framework, ensure orderly succession, and support essential functions during emergencies. Coordination between outgoing and incoming Administrations during the presidential transition period is crucial for these activities. During previous presidential elections, officials have planned for potential delays in the election process. Chairperson Soaries emphasized the need for federal, state, and local governments to collaborate on contingency plans in case of a terrorist attack during the election period. Security experts argue that coordination for election-contingency planning should start early. During the presidential transition period, early election-contingency planning and coordination at federal, state, and local levels are crucial to prevent electoral chaos in case of a national security incident. National security experts anticipate heightened risks to U.S. interests, potentially influenced by adversaries. To address this challenge, unity among the outgoing Administration and presidential candidates is recommended. The Homeland Security Advisory Council suggests nominees issue a joint statement addressing potential threats to the nation. Foreign policy experts recommend regular joint statements by the current President and prospective Presidents-elect to show a unified approach to security issues. The federal government may undertake outreach efforts to educate the public on the need for vigilance during the election period. The federal government may provide insight into potential security threats during the election period to reassure the public and prepare them for any incidents. Continuous interaction with the media and public can help identify anomalies that may indicate criminal activity affecting the presidential election process. The DHS HSAC recommends educating the public on potential threats to maximize national security. The DHS HSAC emphasizes the importance of public engagement in understanding the unique vulnerabilities during the presidential transition period. Public education and media involvement are crucial for informing the nation about potential threats and choices faced by individuals and communities. DHS should work with diverse messengers to effectively communicate accurate information to the public. The DHS and Department of State have communication mechanisms to inform the public about threats to domestic and overseas security interests. They use various methods such as public announcements, alerts, and dissemination of information during the presidential transition period. The Department of State issues public announcements, alerts, and information during the presidential transition period. Presidential historians suggest starting transition efforts at least six months before the election to avoid falling behind. The transition period consists of five phases, from campaigning to establishing a national security team and policies. The presidential transition period consists of five phases: Campaigning, selection of party nominees, election day, post-election day to prior to the inauguration, and presidential inauguration to formation of the new Administration's national security team. This period can last from a few months to a year or longer, depending on various factors. During the presidential transition period, activities can benefit the incoming President and ensure continuity in national security matters. Recommendations include clarifying threat levels, notifying partners, and developing contingency plans. During the presidential transition period, activities can benefit the incoming President and ensure continuity in national security matters. This includes providing information to prospective presidential nominees on historical patterns, developing contingency plans, and offering operational briefings on ongoing national security matters. The current Administration may consider initiating information exchanges with major party candidates early in the transition process. The current Administration should involve a limited number of individuals in national security briefings for incoming Administrations. Concerns arise about turnover in key federal government positions, including over 7,000 non-competitively filled roles with national security responsibilities. The federal government may rely on career government employees for continuity in national security activities during presidential transitions. This approach aims to provide in-house expertise and historical context to new agency directors. DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Schneider supports converting national security leadership positions to career civil servants to ensure preparedness during transitions. Concerns exist about the selection process being influenced by political leadership. The current Administration's political leadership may be selecting individuals with like-minded philosophies to maintain control over agencies and pursue counter policies. The National Security Council (NSC) and Homeland Security Council (HSC) serve different purposes. A joint advisory council could be established to assist with transition issues, drawing on expertise from both councils and outside experts. A new advisory council could be formed to assist with transition issues, comprising political and career staff from the NSC and HSC, outside experts, and members of the president-elect's national security team. The council would coordinate transition policies of agencies with national security missions and advise outgoing and incoming Presidents on policy implications of national security decisions during the transition period. If desired, the council could continue into the next Administration. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) plays a crucial role in assessing and reporting on risks to the Nation during presidential transitions. Options include requiring the National Intelligence Council (NIC) to assess risks and establish a presidential transition Mission Manager to coordinate federal intelligence efforts. Enhance federal intelligence and law enforcement efforts during the presidential transition by improving threat information sharing among various agencies and state fusion centers. The Department of Homeland Security has been working on a plan since 2007 to prepare for the presidential transition. The plan includes addressing threat, leadership, congressional oversight, policy, operations, succession, and training issues. Some found the HSAC Presidential Transition Report to be a good effort, while others felt it fell short. Some national security observers criticized the HSAC Presidential Transition Report for focusing too much on outgoing Administration efforts and not enough on preparing the incoming Administration for challenges. They also noted a lack of discussion on how state, local, tribal, and private sector leaders should prepare for the transition. The HSAC Presidential Transition Report has been criticized for focusing on outgoing Administration efforts rather than preparing the incoming Administration for challenges. There is little detail on how training and education activities can better prepare incoming officials for national security responsibilities. It is unclear if other federal agencies are undertaking transition-related efforts, and the role of non-federal entities in the transition planning is also uncertain. The current Administration is undertaking transition efforts for the next Administration's national security leaders, including meeting with experts, preparing briefings, and offering training exercises. Some argue about the usefulness of these activities for the incoming Administration. Some argue that early participation by the incoming Administration's national security team should be included in designing transition exercises. Concerns exist about the selection of issues for these exercises, with suggestions ranging from catastrophic scenarios to more likely non-catastrophic incidents. The training for incoming national security team members focuses on understanding US national security capabilities and coordination in high-risk environments. Congressional support for presidential transitions is seen as crucial for orderly transfers of power. Possible Congressional Activity during the presidential transition includes appropriating resources for national security collaboration, holding hearings with both incoming and outgoing Administrations, and submitting questions for clarification. Congressional involvement is crucial to address security risks effectively. During the presidential transition, Congress may engage in activities such as submitting questions to the outgoing Administration, seeking information on transition planning and national security risks, and emphasizing the importance of collaboration between the departing and incoming Administrations. Congress may also request briefings on agency leaders responsible for national security decisions, potential risks to the transition process, ongoing national security operations, and efforts to engage with new Administration officials. During the presidential transition, Congress may address national security concerns by legislating against actions that could limit the next administration. Vacancies at DHS are seen as a security vulnerability, potentially hindering the government's ability to respond to security threats. Congress may review departments with national security responsibilities early in the transition period. During the presidential transition, Congress may address national security concerns by legislating against actions that could limit the next administration. The executive branch departments and agencies with national security responsibilities review the leadership succession plan and identify individuals authorized to act during power transfer. Leading up to the 2008 election, national security observers anticipate increased scrutiny from Congress on transition plans. Phase 2 of the transition spans from party conventions to the election day, lasting a few months. During the phase leading up to the election, national security experts warn of heightened risks to the nation. The current administration may consider military or law enforcement actions to prevent disruptions or threats to national security. However, these actions are met with skepticism and seen as potentially politically motivated. Security leaders face challenges in protecting national security interests amidst political skepticism. It is recommended to continue the tradition of providing intelligence briefings to presidential nominees and their staff. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act allows major party candidates to request briefings before the general election. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act allows party candidates for President to request security clearances for prospective transition team members before the general election. Background investigations should be completed by the day after the election to assist in understanding national security policies during the presidential transition. During phase 2 of the federal transfer of executive branch power, Congress may provide resources to federal and non-federal security entities to facilitate transition efforts and respond to incidents. Concerns exist about coordination between federal and state security entities affecting election results in case of a national security incident. Congress may also support non-federal entities responsible for homeland security. During the presidential transition, resources may be provided to non-federal entities responsible for homeland security. Local responders will initially manage incidents in the United States. Scholars suggest considering options for a transfer of power in case of a security incident before or on election day. Decision-making paralysis and delays in federal prevention, response, and recovery efforts could occur if key national security personnel depart before the election. This could place a greater burden on local homeland security. During the presidential transition, resources may be provided to non-federal entities responsible for homeland security. Local responders will manage incidents in the United States. Senior federal officials may address risks to the homeland on the day of the presidential election by emphasizing citizen involvement in the democratic process to deter acts of intimidation. The Administration could support voter confidence by providing threat information to state homeland security fusion centers promptly. During the presidential transition, it is crucial to provide information to state homeland security fusion centers promptly. This includes securing polling places, increasing security for suspected targets, and preventing attacks that disrupt voting activities. Timely resolution of the election is essential for the incoming Administration to prepare for national security challenges. Delayed election results can hinder the current Administration's ability to assist the new Administration and create uncertainty in national security leadership. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 gives the current Administration discretion in supporting the incoming Administration for a smooth transfer of power. Congress emphasizes the importance of orderly transitions to ensure continuity in executing laws and government affairs, both domestically and internationally, to safeguard the nation's safety and well-being. Phase 4 of the presidential transition focuses on national security considerations to prevent disruptions and incidents that may exploit confusion in leadership. This includes efforts to create discord between outgoing and incoming Administrations and take advantage of coordination gaps. Some are concerned about the federal government's ability to effectively respond to national security incidents due to political appointees stepping down and new appointees not yet confirmed. Security experts worry about conflicting directions for acting leaders in various departments. Observers debate the cooperation between outgoing and incoming administrations, especially regarding national security interests. The level of animus shown by the outgoing President towards the President-elect can impact the cooperation the incoming Administration receives. Transitions between Administrations of the same party tend to go smoother. The President's statements and actions during the transition, particularly regarding national security, set the tone for current staff to assist the incoming Administration. Any actions undermining the incoming Administration's national security policy views could hinder the transition process and have negative security repercussions. The outgoing Administration's role during the post-election period is crucial for a smooth transition and national security. Providing briefings, exercises, and collaboration activities can help the incoming Administration address security issues effectively. Activities to facilitate an effective national security transition include providing timely information, forming a council focused on security issues, and expediting security clearances for the President-elect's team. Since 1963, Congress has allocated funds to support presidential transitions, with $8.5 million requested for FY2009 to support staffing and training. The requested funds for presidential transition efforts include $5.3 million for staffing and training, $2.2 million for President Bush's accommodations and office space, and $1 million for executive branch briefing and training activities. Funds can only be used from the day after the general election to 30 days after the inauguration, as authorized by the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. The Act allows the GSA to provide support to the President-elect and senior leaders of the incoming Administration. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 allows the GSA to coordinate briefings and provide communication devices to incoming Administration leaders. Efforts should be made to inform the President-Elect and senior national security staff of current and near-term threats that may affect national security interests. The Presidential Transition Act of 1963 allows the GSA to coordinate briefings and provide communication devices to incoming Administration leaders. Efforts should be made to inform the President-Elect and senior national security staff of current and near-term threats that may affect national security interests. Inauguration procedures require the outgoing Administration to prepare a detailed classified summary of operational threats, military operations, and pending military force decisions for the President-elect. Consideration for the establishment of a Presidential Transition National Security Coordination Council is recommended, potentially involving members of the incoming President's national security team. The Presidential Transition National Security Coordination Council could involve members of the President-elect's national security team in interagency discussions and decision-making activities to address current and projected national security issues during the transition period. It would oversee federal departments' national security transition activities, provide training for incoming appointees, collaborate on ongoing national security issues, and share lessons learned from past experiences. Expedited Security Clearance Processing for President-Elect Transition Team Members and Nominated Members of the New Administration allows the President-elect to submit names of candidates for high-level national security positions soon after the election. The FBI or other agencies process security clearances for incoming administration members before the inauguration. During the presidential transition period, the FBI conducts background investigations for key administration officials to obtain security clearances. This phase is crucial for national security, with a tight timeline of eleven weeks between the election and inauguration ceremony. The FBI expedites the process to ensure senior national security officials can access classified information promptly. During the presidential transition period, the focus is on ensuring a smooth transfer of power between incoming and outgoing administrations. The HSAC Administration Task Force has proposed close collaboration to facilitate this process, emphasizing a positive attitude, open-mindedness, and mutual respect. This phase is seen as critical for national security, with concerns about potential actions by enemies of the United States to disrupt the presidential decision-making process. During the presidential transition period, national security experts emphasize the importance of providing information and context to the incoming President and new national security team. The transition cannot be taken for granted, and significant attention is needed to manage it effectively. The incoming Administration has eleven weeks to prepare for assuming the presidency, with various activities needing to occur. During the presidential transition period, the President-elect will announce leaders of the transition team, interview personnel for new Administration positions, and interact with outgoing Administration, Congress, and foreign leaders. The incoming Administration will select cabinet members and non-statutory members for key national security positions. Other senior agency positions remain vacant until Senate confirmation. During the presidential transition period, the President-elect will announce leaders of the transition team and interact with outgoing Administration, Congress, and foreign leaders. Senior political staff with national security responsibilities do not require Senate confirmation. A presidential transition website will seek individuals with national security expertise. Request for current Administration appointees to stay until the confirmation of new national security leaders for continuity. Options exist for temporary overlap in key positions. Select career federal employees with national security expertise. During the presidential transition period, career federal employees with significant national security expertise are selected to be detailed to the transition team. The focus is on members of the military, intelligence community, and diplomatic corps with expertise in the new Administration's policy priorities. Substantive briefings are requested on policies and programs to assess historical challenges before deciding on revisions or eliminations. Concerns about a leadership void during the transition period are noted, but actions can be taken to address any ambiguity in decision-making. Foreign policy issues were debated during the 1992 presidential campaign. During the transition period after the 1992 presidential election, President-elect Clinton emphasized continuity in foreign policy under President Bush. The incoming Administration may discuss national security strategy with Congress and work on new initiatives before the inauguration. During the transition period, the new Administration must revise the budget proposal within two weeks of the inauguration. Agencies like DHS are required to develop transition plans for the incoming Secretary and Under Secretary for Management by December 1st of the election year. This aims to provide guidance for smoother management transitions, although some experts have concerns about its implementation. Some suggest a career civil servant should draft the transition plan for strategic value and continuity. Security experts propose a special congressional session to coordinate national security issues between Administrations. After the election, a special congressional session may be needed to coordinate national security issues between the outgoing and incoming Administrations. Congress should assess collaboration efforts, resource allocation, and policy goals during the transition phase. Additional hearings may be necessary to monitor progress on national security activities. Phase 5 of the presidential transition involves the period from inauguration to establishing new national security policies. This phase can last several months to the first year of the presidency and may include incidents intended to test the new Administration's actions and policies. Congress may need to address resource requests during this phase if a national security incident occurs. During the presidential transition phase, national security leadership positions may be vacant, leaving the new Administration vulnerable to security threats. The outgoing Administration's actions prior to the inauguration will impact the new President's legacy. The President is granted authority to protect the country's property and personnel. Some scholars argue that the President's duty to protect the country extends beyond their term, exposing the nation to risk if there is a failure to alert the incoming President of imminent dangers. The outgoing President should avoid actions that could hinder the new Administration's transition efforts, such as establishing or revising national security organizations. The incoming President may face challenges from efforts to establish or revise national security policies counter to their positions. They may use executive orders to differentiate their policies from the outgoing President, especially if they are from different parties. The new Administration may also aim to quickly implement new national security policies. The new Administration may need to promptly establish new national security policies and strategies, conveying their priorities and allowing for assessment of the President's intentions. It is advised to proceed cautiously, review current policies, and listen to various perspectives before making significant changes. The new President may consider keeping prior Administration officials' security clearances for briefings on national security policy and program successes and failures. Legislative inquiry and support during the transition are crucial for effective oversight. The transition presents an opportunity for reform in organizational structures for homeland security planning. During the transition period, it is important for the new Administration to engage with Congress to discuss national security policies. Failure to do so may lead to frustration and hinder the ability of both entities to fulfill their responsibilities. New appointees are at risk of facing challenges in the initial weeks and months of the Administration. During the transition period, the new Administration should engage with Congress to discuss national security policies. Congress can support national security objectives by prioritizing hearings for nominated senior executive branch leaders with significant responsibilities. This helps the new Administration address security issues efficiently. During the transition period, the new Congress should meet with the incoming President's national security team to expedite confirmation hearings. The 9/11 Commission Report recommends minimizing disruptions in national security policymaking during the change of Administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments. The IRPTA of 2004 also supports expedited consideration of nominees. The Act emphasizes the need for expedited consideration of nominees by the Senate to ensure national security appointments are made promptly. This includes completing the confirmation process within 30 days of submission by the President-elect, balancing the urgency to fill positions quickly with selecting qualified individuals. Congress plays a crucial role in selecting and confirming individuals for national security positions. They should work with the new Administration to align policies and programs in the 2009 budget, pass appropriations promptly, assign Members to relevant committees, hold hearings with security experts, and discuss presidential priorities after the new Administration releases its national security strategies. The first presidential transition post 9/11 raises concerns among national security observers. The transition in the post 9/11 era raises concerns among national security observers. Risks during this period can be minimized with proactive actions from the executive branch and Congress. The new President will likely face national security challenges upon taking office, and their response will depend on preparation and education activities prior to the inauguration. Steps can be taken during the transition to lessen risks to the nation. During the presidential transition period, proactive actions are necessary to prepare for potential risks and mitigate confusion. The actions of the outgoing and incoming Administration can impact the new President's ability to safeguard national interests and affect the outgoing President's legacy. Appendix B lists incidents of terrorism during governmental transitions based on the aggressor's intent to influence elections. During a presidential transition, incidents of national security significance are not typically planned for a specific date before an election. The leader or individuals act when the opportunity for the best outcome arises. The optimal time for an attack may not align with the transition period, leading to potential risks at any phase of the transition. The location of the event, proximity to the election date, and reactions to the incident all play a role in its impact. Many security experts believe that incidents of national significance before an election could impact the outcome or policies. There are concerns that terrorist groups may view such incidents as opportunities to influence power transfers. However, some experts suggest that these actions may not align with the long-term goals of the terrorists. Congressional legislation addresses various national security considerations during presidential transitions.
