    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fair Trade with China Act of 2005\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that the bilateral trade relationship between the United States and China is heavily imbalanced, leading to a significant trade deficit for the US. This deficit has resulted in the US borrowing massive amounts of money from foreign governments, particularly China, which has become a major purchaser of US debt. China's growing ownership of US Treasury bonds and acquisitions of US companies, along with violations of trade commitments and intellectual property rights, have led to significant economic implications for the US. American companies lost over $2.5 billion in sales in 2004 due to China's discriminatory industrial policies, heavy subsidies for its manufacturing sector, and undervalued currency. US policies have failed to protect American workers and farmers. The United States needs comprehensive policies to address China's unfair trade practices, market access barriers, and intellectual property rights violations. It is crucial to address the unsustainable trade deficit with China and ensure they abide by their commitments as a member of the World Trade Organization. SEC. 3.
