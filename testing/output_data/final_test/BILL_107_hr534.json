This includes defining terms related to the grants. The Act defines terms related to violent crimes, serious drug trafficking crimes, and part 1 violent crimes for the purpose of the program established under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The term 'State' in the context refers to various regions including states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. \"Authorization of grants under SEC. 20352.\" The Attorney General provides Firearms Sentencing Incentive grants to eligible States for specific purposes, including supporting law enforcement agencies, courts, and public awareness programs. The Attorney General provides grants to States for various purposes, such as supporting law enforcement agencies, courts, and public awareness programs. States can use these grants to build or expand correctional facilities through direct use or subgrants to local government units. \"SEC. 20353. FIREARMS SENTENCING INCENTIVE GRANTS.\" To be eligible for a grant award under this section, a State must submit an application demonstrating implementation of firearms sentencing laws requiring certain penalties for using firearms in violent or drug trafficking crimes. To be eligible for a grant award under this section, a State must demonstrate implementation of firearms sentencing laws, including a minimum 5-year imprisonment for possessing a firearm after a violent crime conviction. The State must also show plans for a public awareness program and coordination with federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies. The State must demonstrate implementation of firearms sentencing laws, including a minimum 5-year imprisonment for possessing a firearm after a violent crime conviction, to be eligible for a grant award. If a State cannot meet this requirement, it can still be eligible by having an equivalent Federal prosecution agreement in place. For the purposes of paragraph (1), an equivalent Federal prosecution agreement ensures referral for prosecution under Federal law if a person's State conviction is uncertain to result in specified sentences for certain conduct. The person is referred for prosecution under Federal law if their State conviction is uncertain to result in specified sentences for certain conduct. The amount available for grants under section 20353 for any fiscal year is allocated to each eligible State based on the ratio of reported part 1 violent crimes. If data is unavailable or inaccurate, the Attorney General uses the best comparable data from the previous year for allocation of funds. \"Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 20353 is based on reported part 1 violent crimes data, with the Attorney General using comparable data if needed.\" Authorization of appropriations for grants under this subtitle includes specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2001 to 2005, with limitations on fund usage to support designated purposes and prevent supplanting of State funds. Administrative costs are capped at 3 percent. The Attorney General can use up to 3% of funds for administrative costs, research, and data collection. Appropriated funds remain available until spent, and the Federal share of a grant cannot exceed 90% of the proposal costs. The Attorney General is required to submit a report on the implementation of a specific subtitle to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees annually. The report should cover state eligibility under a certain section and the distribution and use of funds. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Act to include a new subtitle on Firearms Sentencing Incentive Grants. Subtitle D--Firearms Sentencing Incentive Grants includes definitions, authorization of grants, formula for grants, and authorization of appropriations for firearms sentencing incentive grants. The Attorney General is required to submit an annual report on the implementation of this subtitle to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees."
