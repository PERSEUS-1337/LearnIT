    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that thousands of computer systems are not capable of recognizing dates after December 31, 1999, which could incapacitate essential systems. Reprogramming or replacing affected systems is a matter of national and global interest. The exchange of Year 2000 readiness information is crucial for public and private entities to improve their readiness and minimize disruptions to the nation's economic well-being and security. Concerns about legal liability are hindering the disclosure and exchange of compliance information. The ability to freely disseminate Year 2000 readiness information without fear of litigation is essential for addressing Year 2000 needs promptly. The Act aims to promote the disclosure and exchange of Year 2000 readiness information to address needs promptly and reduce burdens on interstate commerce by establishing uniform legal standards. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Year 2000 statement refers to any statement related to assessments, projections, estimates, plans, objectives, timetables, test plans, test dates, test results, or operational issues regarding Year 2000 processing capabilities of entities, products, or services. The Year 2000 statement encompasses assessments, projections, plans, test results, and operational issues related to Year 2000 processing capabilities of entities, products, or services. Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure refers to any statement labeled as such, and Disclosure refers to a Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure. Statement denotes any communication conveying information in any form or medium, excluding actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the United States. The term \"Year 2000 processing\" refers to handling date data between the 20th and 21st centuries, including leap year calculations. \"Year 2000 Internet Website\" is defined as a website related to Year 2000 issues. An Internet Website is a service where Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures and information on Year 2000 processing capabilities are made public. Covered action excludes civil actions by public entities, and republication refers to any form of reissuing content. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to consumer protection laws, including \"republication,\" \"consumer,\" \"consumer product,\" and \"maker.\" The curr_chunk discusses protection for Year 2000 readiness disclosures. In any covered action, a Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure must be proven to be material and made with knowledge of being false or misleading, or with intent to deceive. If the Disclosure includes a republication about a third party, it must be disclosed as such and verified by the maker. In a Year 2000 action, the maker of a Statement is not liable unless it is proven that the Statement was material, false, misleading, made with intent to deceive, and not verified by the maker. In a Year 2000 action, the maker of a Statement is not liable unless it is proven that the Statement was material, false, misleading, made with intent to deceive, and not verified by the maker. The posting of a notice on an entity's Year 2000 Internet Website is presumed to be an adequate mechanism for providing notice about Year 2000 processing in covered actions. This does not alter any existing requirements for providing notice about Year 2000 processing. (c) Limitation on Effect of Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures.--In covered actions, Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures cannot be seen as changing written contracts or warranties unless agreed upon in writing. This does not apply if the party has agreed in writing to alter the contract or warranty. In covered actions, Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures can only modify written contracts or warranties if agreed upon in writing. Federal entities can request Year 2000 processing information, which is protected from disclosure and cannot be used in civil actions. The subsection allows Federal entities to obtain information separately through legal authorities for any action, without affecting the Year 2000 processing information protected from disclosure in covered actions. SEC. 5. EXCLUSIONS. This Act does not affect the authority of Federal or State entities to enforce information disclosure requirements under statutes or regulations. It also does not impact contractual rights or statements made in consumer product contracts. The Act does not impose increased obligations on Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures, does not affect intellectual property rights, and does not preclude seeking injunctive relief. This Act applies to Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures made between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001. Written disclosures made before the Act's effective date can be designated as Year 2000 Readiness Disclosures within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Notification can include posting on a Year 2000 Website."
