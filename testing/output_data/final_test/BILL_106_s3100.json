SEC. 2 of the CARE Act amends Section 13(c) regarding agricultural employment, exempting child labor provisions for children working on a farm owned by their parent or legal guardian outside of school hours. The Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to include the employment of employees under 16 years in youth peddling, defined as selling goods or services in various locations. Additionally, the definition of oppressive child labor now includes youth peddling as an occupation. The Fair Labor Standards Act is amended to prohibit youth peddling, adding it to the definition of oppressive child labor. SEC. 4. Civil and criminal penalties for child labor violations are increased under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Civil money penalties are raised to a minimum of $500 and a maximum of $15,000. Criminal penalties include fines up to $15,000, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both for willful violations resulting in harm to minor employees. SEC. 5. Goods tainted by oppressive child labor are subject to regulations by the Secretary for shipment in interstate commerce. SEC. 6. Coordination. SEC. 6. COORDINATION. The Secretary will work closely with non-governmental organizations, State, and local agencies to enforce labor and safety laws. State and local agencies will provide injury and death information to the Secretary for enforcement purposes. The Secretary may reimburse these agencies for their services. The Secretary of Labor will promulgate regulations through notice and comment rulemaking to carry out the Act and amendments. Existing regulations identifying hazardous agricultural occupations for children under 16 will remain in effect until superseded. Children ages 14 and 15 may be employed in non-hazardous agricultural occupations outside of school hours until new regulations are promulgated. Existing regulations apply only to children under 16, while those aged 16 and 17 are not restricted until new regulations are issued by the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor promulgates regulations to identify hazardous agricultural occupations for children under 18, consulting with the Secretary of Agriculture. Children can work in these occupations as vocational agriculture student-learners after completing specific training programs. The Secretary of Agriculture successfully completed an agricultural education training program and will cooperate with the Secretary of Labor during the rulemaking process. Authorization is given to the Secretary of Labor to appropriate necessary funds for carrying out the Act and its amendments."
