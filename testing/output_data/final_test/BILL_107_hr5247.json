    "content": "The \"Livestock Packer and Producer Fairness Act of 2002\" requires spot market purchases of livestock by packers under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as 'cooperative', 'covered packer', and 'nonaffiliated producer'. A covered packer is required to report livestock purchase information to the Secretary, excluding packers with only one processing plant. A nonaffiliated producer sells livestock to a packer without equity interest or with minimal equity interest. The packer must have less than one percent equity interest in the producer, no shared officers, directors, employees, or owners, and no fiduciary responsibility. A spot market purchase involves a firm base price, slaughter within seven days, and no other agreements in place. The covered packer must slaughter a certain percentage of livestock purchased through spot market purchases from nonaffiliated producers. No other agreements can prevent the seller from soliciting bids from other packers. The covered packer must slaughter a percentage of livestock purchased from nonaffiliated producers. Applicable percentages are 12.5% for a cooperative packer and 25% for a non-cooperative packer. Transitional percentages apply for cooperatives with specific captive supply percentages. The applicable percentages for covered packers vary based on their cooperative status and captive supply percentages. For cooperative packers, the percentages are 12.5% for 2008 onwards. For non-cooperative packers with over 87.5% captive supply in 2001, the percentage is the greater of the difference between 100 and reported captive supply, or 5% for 2004 and 2005. The text discusses the percentage requirements for packers in different calendar years, with 15% for 2006 and 2007, and 25% for 2008 onwards. It also mentions that state requirements for packers to purchase livestock on the spot market may exceed the federal percentage. The amendment applies to covered producers starting January 1, 2004."
