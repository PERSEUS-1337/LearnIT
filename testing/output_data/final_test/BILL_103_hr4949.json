    "content": "The Act titled \"Administrative Procedure Reform Act of 1994\" is cited as the short title. Congressional findings are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds that the cost and burden of regulations have reached historic highs, with a significant increase in the number of people writing Federal regulations. The Federal Government currently employs 125,000 bureaucrats working on 5,000 regulations from 59 different agencies. In 1993, the Federal Government produced 69,688 pages of regulations, filling 21 feet of shelf space in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Office of the Federal Register now offers classes to help manufacturers understand new regulations and proposals. The total cost of administering the Federal regulatory apparatus in fiscal year 1993 was $11.3 billion. The cost of regulatory compliance drains funds for research, job creation, training, wages, and employment benefits. Government mandates, including regulations, were identified as the policies that have harmed United States manufacturing employment in the past 5 years. The perception of a hostile climate for manufacturing is due to the vast scope, rigid construction, and costly impact of State and Federal regulatory schemes. SEC. 3. RULE MAKING NOTICES FOR MAJOR RULES. Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require agencies to publish a notice of intent to engage in rulemaking for proposed major rules in the Federal Register at least 90 days before the publication of a general notice. The notice must include information similar to a Regulatory Impact Analysis. Additionally, agencies must include a final Regulatory Impact Analysis and clearly outline all changes in the information for major rules proposed in the general notice. The amendment to Section 553 of title 5, United States Code requires agencies to publish a notice of intent for proposed major rules in the Federal Register at least 90 days before a general notice. The notice must include information similar to a Regulatory Impact Analysis. Agencies must also provide a final Regulatory Impact Analysis with clear delineation of changes from the initial notice. Section 4 requires a hearing for proposed rules and allows for an extension of the comment period. (a) Hearing Requirement.--Section 553 of title 5, United States Code, is further amended to require a public hearing if more than 100 individuals submit comments on a proposed rule. An extension of the comment period is also allowed for major rules. The agency must provide an additional 30-day period for submissions if more than 100 individuals request an extension after the initial notice. The agency is also required to publish responses to all comments received regarding a rule in the Federal Register. SEC. 5. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS. Executive Order 12866 applies to agencies, defining a major rule as one affecting over 100 people or requiring expenditures exceeding $1,000,000. Regulatory Impact Analyses for rules must include specific content. The order for a rule must include an explanation of its necessity, current conditions it addresses, conflicts with other rules, legal precedent, scientific basis, risks to health or environment, and quantification of those risks. The rule must include a demonstration of being the least costly approach, description of alternative approaches considered, estimate of persons affected, costs of compliance, evaluation of costs versus benefits, need for onsite inspections, and paperwork burden on regulated persons. The rule may require persons to maintain records subject to inspection, obtain licenses or permits with associated fees, appear before the agency, disclose information on materials or processes, report incidents, and adhere to design or performance standards. In this section, the rule may require individuals to comply with regulations, potentially involving the need for professional consultants, estimating implementation costs, assessing agency capabilities, and allowing public comments on the Regulatory Impact Analysis. The definitions of terms like \"Order\", \"agency\", \"regulation\", and \"rule\" are also provided. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET. An agency cannot implement a major rule without written approval from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget or a designated individual. SEC. 7. STANDARD OF CLARITY. The head of an agency must have the Director of the Office of Management and Budget certify that any proposed major rule is written clearly, provides adequate notice, follows grammar principles, uses short sentences, and avoids confusing language. The head of an agency must ensure that any proposed major rule is written clearly, provides adequate notice, follows grammar principles, uses short sentences, and avoids confusing language, including terms with multiple meanings. The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs must submit a report to Congress within 12 months of this Act's enactment, analyzing rule making procedures of Federal agencies and their impact on the regulated public and regulatory process. Definitions for terms like \"agency,\" \"rule,\" and \"rule making\" are provided in section 551 of title 5, United States Code, while the term \"major rule\" is defined in section 5(b)."
