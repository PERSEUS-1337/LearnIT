    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Servicemembers Insurance Relief Act of 2014\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. The Congress finds that servicemembers face burdensome processes when changing auto insurance policies due to moving between states. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allows military personnel to maintain a stable domicile for auto licensing and fees even when temporarily relocating. The Federal Insurance Office's report highlights the ease of transferring financial services for individuals on active duty. The purpose of the Act is to reduce burdens and increase protections for servicemembers and their families when changing auto insurance policies due to relocation. Relief should be provided for servicemembers required to move in compliance with duty or station orders, especially in transferring policies across state lines. Interested parties are urged to find a more accommodating approach for service members with personal auto policies. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE OF DOMICILE FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES. Members of a servicemember's household can maintain their residence or domicile for motor vehicle insurance purposes when temporarily moving due to military orders. Insurers must be notified of such moves to provide servicemembers insurance. The Director of the Federal Insurance Office shall create a standard servicemembers insurance choice notice summarizing the right of servicemembers and their households to continue an existing auto insurance policy when temporarily moving due to military orders. The insurer must provide a notice to servicemembers regarding coverage options when moving, including standard language for compliance. Standards for transmitting the notice to household members must also be established. (c) Limitations.--This section does not require a person to keep their auto insurance policy, allow insurers to penalize household members of servicemembers for decisions about insurance, or mandate insurers to continue coverage for such members. The Act supersedes any conflicting State or local laws, including those related to changing auto insurance policies, regulating policies, and prohibiting electronic delivery of insurance documents. Liability limits are subject to the minimum security requirements of the State where a servicemember resides. Enforcement of this Act is the responsibility of the State where the auto insurance policy was issued or renewed. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"member of a household,\" \"motor vehicle,\" \"servicemember,\" \"State,\" and \"temporarily moved.\" These definitions clarify the scope and meaning of key terms used in the legislation. The term \"temporarily moved\" refers to a person who has relocated from one State to another without intending to permanently reside in the new State."
