    "content": "On August 9, 2007, a liquidity crunch hit financial firms and securities markets, particularly those linked to subprime mortgages. The Federal Reserve intervened by injecting reserves to prevent rates from exceeding targets. From September 2007 to December 2008, the Fed aggressively reduced rates to address the crisis, which has persisted over time. The Federal Reserve intervened during the financial crisis by reducing rates and expanding direct lending to the financial sector. Controversy arose when the Fed assisted troubled institutions like Bear Stearns and created lending facilities for non-bank primary dealers. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy without government assistance in September. During the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve provided assistance to troubled institutions like Bear Stearns and non-member bank AIG. The Fed also directly assisted markets for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. Additionally, the Fed guaranteed losses on assets owned by Citigroup, marking the first time in over 70 years that the Fed lent to non-members using emergency authority. The Dodd-Frank Act added conditions to the Fed's emergency lending authority. The government took Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. The Fed announced large-scale purchases of GSE debt and MBS to stabilize the housing market. By 2010, the Fed had purchased $175 billion of GSE debt and $1.25 trillion of MBS. Emergency facilities expired in February 2010, but liquidity swap lines reopened in May 2010. In 2010, the central bank liquidity swap lines were reopened to provide dollar liquidity to foreign countries due to the economic crisis in Greece. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 aimed to prevent financial panics by giving the Fed authority over monetary policy and the payments system. Congressional oversight is required for the Fed's actions, raising questions about its role and Congress's involvement. S. 896, signed into law in 2009, allows limited GAO audits of Fed emergency actions. H.R. 4173 removes GAO audit restrictions on Fed emergency activities, mandates disclosure of borrower identities with a delay, and makes comprehensive changes to the financial regulatory system. It modifies the Fed's role in prudential regulation, consumer protection, payment system regulation, and systemic risk regulation. The legislation also analyzes the effects on the Fed's regulatory role and reviews its actions since 2007. Fed, established in 1913, executes monetary policy through open market operations. The Federal Reserve's primary duty is to execute monetary policy through open market operations to promote price stability and maximum employment. It also regulates financial institutions, issues currency, clears checks, collects economic data, and conducts economic research. A key responsibility is to act as a lender of last resort to prevent financial panics. Open market operations involve buying and selling U.S. Treasury securities to influence bank reserves. The Federal Reserve uses open market operations to influence short-term interest rates by altering bank reserves. The Fed targets the federal funds rate, which is determined by market forces. By buying or selling Treasury securities, the Fed can adjust reserves to stimulate economic activity through lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve implements expansionary and contractionary policies by adjusting interest rates to stimulate or reduce economic activity. Lower rates encourage spending on investments, housing, and consumer goods, while a depreciated dollar boosts exports. In times of crisis, the Fed injects reserves into the interbank lending market to maintain liquidity. The Federal Reserve has taken necessary actions since August 2007 to maintain reserves and reduce the federal funds target rate to address disruptions in financial markets. The Fed aggressively lowered interest rates several times, deciding on changes at meetings every six weeks, with larger increments than usual from September 2007 to March 2008. The Federal Reserve aggressively lowered interest rates in response to financial market disruptions, with larger increments than usual. The target rate was reduced by 0.75 percentage points at an unscheduled meeting in January 2008, and again by 0.5 percentage points in October 2008. By December 2008, the Fed established a target range of 0% to 0.25% for the federal funds rate, implementing a policy of \"quantitative easing.\" After focusing on meeting the financial sector's liquidity needs, the Federal Reserve began providing ample liquidity, causing the federal funds rate to consistently fall below its target. By December 2008, the interest rate target was often close to zero, indicating a shift towards prioritizing liquidity provision over interest rate targeting. Quantitative easing initially involved direct lending and later expanded to large purchases of securities to maintain liquidity in the financial system. The Federal Reserve purchased a significant amount of securities, including Agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, to stimulate the economy. They also provide liquidity to member banks through discount window lending, where loans are backed by collateral. Most lending is done on an overnight basis, with high-rated collateral typically used. The Federal Reserve sets the discount rate directly through fiat, discouraging routine borrowing at the discount window during normal market conditions. In 2003, the Fed changed the discount rate to be 1 percentage point above the federal funds rate. The discount window plays a secondary role in policymaking compared to open market operations. Since 2007, the Fed has lowered the discount rate several times, usually in conjunction with the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve has reduced the spread between the federal funds rate and the discount rate, keeping it positive. Discount window lending increased significantly from 2007 to 2008, peaking at $111 billion in October 2008. By mid-2010, lending had returned to pre-crisis levels. The Federal Reserve has developed new tools to address financial turmoil outside the banking system since 2007. These tools fill gaps between open market operations and the discount window, focusing on parts of the financial system not covered by traditional tools. The Fed's authority outside the banking system is largely undefined in the Federal Reserve Act, except for emergency authority under Section 13(3) which has been frequently used since the financial crisis began. The Federal Reserve has frequently invoked the Reserve Act since the financial crisis began. There is a stigma attached to borrowing from the discount window, seen as a sign of weakness in good times. Despite the Fed encouraging discount window borrowing to avoid liquidity problems, banks were initially hesitant due to fears of sparking a crisis of confidence. The Fed created the supplementary Term Auction Facility (TAF) in December 2007 to address fears of sparking a crisis of confidence. The TAF allows the Fed to determine the amount of reserves it wishes to make available to banks through an auction process, providing insight into demand for reserves. Any depository institution eligible for discount window lending can participate in the TAF. The Term Auction Facility (TAF) was established in December 2007 to provide reserves to banks through auctions. The amounts auctioned exceeded discount window lending, reaching up to $150 billion every two weeks. Loans must be fully collateralized with high-rated assets, and outstanding loans peaked at $493 billion in March 2009. The Term Auction Facility (TAF) was introduced in December 2007 to provide reserves to banks through auctions. Loans must be fully collateralized with high-rated assets, and the amount lent diminishes as the quality of collateral diminishes. Most borrowers borrow less than the posted collateral, and loans mature in 28 days. The TAF aimed to reduce the large gap between federal funds rate and interbank lending rates for longer maturities, which had decreased after December 2007 but reemerged during market stress periods like September 2008. The Term Auction Facility (TAF) was introduced in December 2007 to provide reserves to banks through auctions. During market stress periods like September 2008, the effectiveness of the TAF in reducing the gap between federal funds rate and interbank lending rates is mixed. The TAF program was initially temporary but could become permanent. The Fed has not held a TAF auction since March 2010, and a permanent TAF may contradict the philosophy of relying on the private sector for short-term reserve needs. The Fed established the System Open Market Account Securities Lending Program to help dealers with liquidity needs by swapping Treasuries overnight. This program does not impact interest rates or the money supply but can affect the liquidity premium of the securities traded. The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) was created in March 2008 to provide up to $75 billion to primary dealers, collateralized with Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve Act established the System Open Market Account Securities Lending Program to lend up to $75 billion of Treasury securities for 28 days. Collateral can include private-label MBS, agency CMBS, and agency CMOs. The program was expanded to accept all investment-grade debt securities. Loans are fully collateralized with a \"haircut\" and can be called for substitute collateral if needed. The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) was a temporary program by the Fed that allowed primary dealers to swap illiquid assets for highly liquid assets like Treasuries. The program involved auctions with up to $75 billion of securities and was expanded in August 2008 to include options up to $50 billion. Securities lent peaked at $260 billion in October 2008, but no securities were borrowed after August 2009. The facility expired in January 2010, aiming to promote liquidity in financing markets. The Fed implemented the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) to enhance financial market functioning. Spreads between different types of repos decreased significantly. Critics suggested the program was created to rescue Bear Stearns. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was established to aid primary dealers, similar to the discount window for depository institutions. The Fed established the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) to aid primary dealers by providing overnight loans at the discount rate with acceptable collateral. The program, authorized under the Federal Reserve Act, included various types of securities as collateral. Fees were charged to frequent users, and the program was initially set to last six months but was later extended. Borrowing from the facility fluctuated, with borrowing levels falling to zero by August 2008 and the facility eventually expiring in January 2010. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was established by the Fed to provide overnight loans to primary dealers with acceptable collateral. Borrowing peaked at $148 billion in October 2008 before falling to zero in August 2008. The program ended in January 2010 as the financial system improved and investment banks became eligible for other Fed lending facilities. The program, authorized under paragraph 3 of Section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act, differs from the Fed's normal operations. The Federal Reserve provides reserves, credit, and regulation to the banking system. Banks in the Federal Reserve system have access to Fed credit but are regulated to prevent excessive risks. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was created in 2008 to address issues in the market for asset-backed securities. The TALF was created in 2008 to stimulate the issuance of new securities backed by various assets like auto loans, credit cards, student loans, and SBA-guaranteed small business loans. Data shows a significant drop in non-mortgage asset-backed securities issuance, raising concerns about reduced credit extension to consumers and potential impact on consumption spending. The TALF program was created in 2008 to stimulate the issuance of new securities backed by various assets such as auto loans, credit cards, student loans, and small business loans. The program also includes commercial mortgages, insurance premium finance loans, and may be expanded to include other classes of asset-backed securities in the future. The Federal Reserve provides non-recourse loans to private U.S. companies to purchase recently issued ABS with the highest credit rating, using the ABS as collateral. The TALF program, created in 2008, aims to stimulate new securities issuance backed by various assets. ABS with the highest credit rating can be used as collateral for non-recourse loans provided by the Federal Reserve to private U.S. companies. The minimum loan size is $10 million, with losses borne by the Fed and Treasury instead of the borrower. Loans have a term of up to three years (five for some assets) and interest rates are set at a markup over LIBOR or federal funds rate. Treasury bears the first $20 billion in losses, with the Fed covering any additional losses. The Treasury will bear losses financed through TARP, with interest received in return. TARP has loaned $100 million to the TALF program for administrative costs. Executive compensation restrictions do not apply to TALF recipients as the Fed, not the recipients, is the TARP funds recipient. TALF involves the Fed lending to purchase assets, with assets mostly newly issued. The Treasury's funds will finance loan losses rather than asset purchases, supporting a larger volume of assets through TARP. The Public-Private Partnership Investment Program (PPIP) under TARP allows private investors to receive matching capital to purchase up to $1 trillion of legacy loans and securities. Private partners can use loans from TALF to finance the purchase of legacy securities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs). The TALF program, initially envisioned as a $200 billion initiative, saw slow growth in lending and peaked at $48 billion. Despite Treasury's desire to increase it to $1 trillion, only $30 billion was pledged for PPIP-Securities. The low lending totals reflect the depressed state of the private securitization market, with non-mortgage ABS issuance dropping from $52 billion to $32 billion per quarter. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas suggests that TALF should be reviewed. The TALF program, reviewed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is credited with reducing ABS spreads against Treasury bonds and increasing ABS issuance. The program expired in June 2010 for CMBS loans and March 2010 for other assets. Commercial paper is short-term debt issued by financial firms, non-financial firms, and pass-through entities, with individual investors being major purchasers through money market funds. On September 16, 2008, a money market mutual fund called the Reserve Fund \"broke the buck\" due to losses from short-term debt issued by Lehman Brothers, leading to a run on money market funds as investors tried to withdraw $250 billion. This decreased demand for new commercial paper. The Fed created the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) on September 19, 2008, to address disruptions in the commercial paper markets. The facility provided non-recourse loans to banks to purchase asset-backed commercial paper, with loans peaking at $152 billion on October 1, 2008. The AMLF was later replaced by the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, and lending ceased in October 2009. The temporary facility was authorized under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and extended until January 2010. The Federal Reserve Act authorized the creation of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF) in September 2008 to ease conditions in the commercial paper market. Despite this, the market remained strained, leading to the creation of the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) on October 7, 2008. The CPFF aimed to purchase highly rated U.S. commercial paper to prevent market disruption. The Federal Reserve established the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) in October 2008 to purchase various types of highly rated U.S. commercial paper. The CPFF aimed to provide assurance to firms that they could roll over their commercial paper, encouraging private investors to participate in the market again. The facility charged interest rates based on the type of commercial paper purchased and could buy as much paper as an issuer had outstanding in the year. Any losses incurred by the CPFF would be covered by the Fed, and the SPV's assets were managed by the private company PIMCO. Authorized under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the CPFF was extended until January 2010 and held $351 billion of commercial paper at its peak in January 2009. The CPFF, established in October 2008 by the Federal Reserve, aimed to purchase highly rated U.S. commercial paper to support market stability. At its peak in January 2009, it held $351 billion of commercial paper, which has since decreased. The CPFF improved conditions in commercial paper markets, although they remained challenging. Notably, it was the first Fed facility with a commitment to purchase assets and provided financial assistance to non-financial firms for the first time in 50 years. The Fed established the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) in October 2008 to lend up to $540 billion to private sector SPVs investing in commercial paper from highly rated financial institutions. Each SPV was owned by a group of financial firms and could only purchase commercial paper from that group to prevent runs on money market mutual funds. The facility expired in October 2009 without being used. The Fed's Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF) expired in October 2009 without being used. Money market funds were hesitant to use it due to concerns about leverage intensifying investor incentives to withdraw. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced pressure on their stock prices, leading to fears of illiquidity. The Fed authorized lending to the housing GSEs in July 2008, but the authority was not utilized. Treasury placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship in September 2008. The Fed announced purchases of debt obligations from these institutions in September and November 2008. The Fed announced purchases of up to $100 billion in direct obligations and $500 billion in MBS guaranteed by government agencies. GSE obligations will be bought through auctions, while MBS will be purchased by private investment managers on behalf of the Fed. The assets purchased will be held passively and long-term. The Fed increased the purchase commitment to $1.25 trillion in MBS and $200 billion in GSE obligations in March 2009, with plans to complete purchases by the end of the first quarter of 2010. In November 2009, the Fed decided to purchase only $175 billion of Agency debt securities due to limited availability. The Fed decided to purchase only $175 billion of Agency debt securities due to limited availability, aiming to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for house purchases indirectly. By purchasing existing MBS from the secondary market, the Fed hopes to raise prices and stimulate more MBS issuance, leading to lower mortgage rates. The Fed is accepting MBS issued by GSEs but not by private firms, despite the GSEs issuing more MBS in 2008 than before the crisis. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association noted that mortgage rates have been low during the crisis, but access has been limited to highly qualified lenders. Increasing demand for GSE-issued MBS and GSE debt would reduce mortgage rates and indirectly increase borrower access. Mortgage rates initially fell after the Fed announced its programs, but later rose despite Fed purchases due to economic improvement. Concerns exist that mortgage rates could rise after the Fed's purchases are complete, and the housing market may not have recovered by then. Fed programs did not require emergency authority and transactions involving agency debt are authorized under specific sections of the Federal Reserve Act. The Fed's programs, authorized under Section 13(13) and 14b of the Federal Reserve Act, are similar to Treasury programs like the GSE MBS Purchase Program and GSE Credit Facility. The Fed also established swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss central bank to swap dollars for euros or Swiss francs. Most swaps have been with the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan, with some made unlimited in size in October 2008. Interest is paid to the Fed on swaps. The Fed established swap lines with certain countries, allowing unlimited swaps in size. Interest is paid to the Fed at the foreign central bank's rate for dollar borrowers. The swaps are repaid at the original exchange rate, with no downside risk for the Fed if the dollar appreciates. The swap lines are authorized until January 2010, with no credit risk unless the borrowing country's currency becomes unconvertible. Swaps peaked at $583 billion in December 2008 and are intended to provide liquidity to banks in non-domestic denominations. The swap lines established by the Fed allow foreign central banks to provide liquidity in dollars, benefiting foreign borrowers and indirectly promoting the use of the dollar as the \"reserve\" currency. This results in more seigniorage for the United States. The swap lines established by the Fed allow foreign central banks to acquire U.S. dollars and were later modified to provide foreign currency to U.S. banks. The swap lines were reopened in 2010 in response to the crisis in Greece, but their use was more limited compared to previous years. Banks hold cash reserves to meet daily cash-flow needs and Fed requirements. The Fed faced conflicting goals before reducing the federal funds target rate to zero in 2008. The Federal Reserve sets the federal funds rate to achieve economic goals. To prevent the rate from falling below target, the Fed pays interest on bank reserves. This helps maintain a floor on the rate, ensuring banks hold excess reserves. Paying interest on reserves prevents the federal funds rate from falling below target by incentivizing banks to hold excess reserves rather than lend them out. This policy does not stimulate the economy directly but helps prevent liquidity problems for banks. The Fed's interest on reserves policy did not succeed in placing a floor under the federal funds target rate. Despite reducing the spread between the interest rate on reserves and the federal funds rate, the actual federal funds rate continued to fall below the target. The Fed's decision to set the interest rate paid on reserves at 0.25% in December 2008 meant that paying interest on reserves could no longer support the target rate. Permanent authority to pay interest on reserves was granted by P.L. 110-343, but the liquidity benefits will be less important once financial conditions normalize. The Fed's decision to pay interest on reserves aimed to reduce volatility in the federal funds rate, with liquidity benefits becoming less important as banks can meet reserve needs through the federal funds market. This policy reduces the Fed's profits and remittances to the Treasury, potentially increasing the budget deficit. In the long run, competition may lead banks to pass on the benefit to depositors through higher interest rates on deposits. The Fed's decision to pay interest on reserves aims to reduce volatility in the federal funds rate and minimize resources spent on reserves. However, this policy increases costs without additional liquidity benefits. Concerns about inflation arise from the Fed's balance sheet growth, but paying interest on reserves can help prevent inflation. Financial firms deemed \"too big to fail\" received assistance from the Fed in the form of loans. Financial firms deemed \"too big to fail\" received financial assistance from the Fed in the form of loans, troubled asset purchases, and asset guarantees, going beyond its traditional role as a lender of last resort. H.R. 4173 aims to prevent future assistance to individual firms. Bear Stearns faced liquidity pressures in 2008, leading to JPMorgan Chase providing secured funding with the Federal Reserve's help. The Treasury and Fed expressed a desire to transfer acquired assets from Bear Stearns and AIG to the Treasury but have not taken action yet. On March 16, 2008, JPMorgan Chase agreed to acquire Bear Stearns with the assistance of the Federal Reserve. The Fed provided $13 billion in back-to-back financing to Bear Stearns through JPMorgan Chase. The loan was repaid in full on March 17, 2008. Additionally, the Fed agreed to purchase up to $30 billion of Bear Stearns' assets through Maiden Lane I, a new LLC controlled by the Fed. After acquiring Bear Stearns with Federal Reserve assistance, JPMorgan Chase finalized a loan on June 26, 2008, with the Fed lending $28.82 billion and JPMorgan Chase providing a subordinate loan of $1.15 billion to a Delaware-based LLC. The Fed's loan has a 10-year term at a fluctuating interest rate, while JPMorgan Chase's loan has an interest rate 4.5 percentage points above the discount rate. The LLC used the loan proceeds to purchase assets from Bear Stearns valued at $29.97 billion. The New York Fed provides information on the current fair market value of the assets on its website. At the end of 2008, the portfolio of the LLC consisted of agency and non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), commercial and residential loans, swap contracts, TBA commitments, and cash equivalents. More than half of the non-agency CMOs had a AAA credit rating, while one-fifth had a junk rating. The CEO of JPMorgan Chase stated that riskier and complex securities were kept in the Bear Stearns portfolio. The assets are owned by the LLC and will be liquidated to repay the Fed and JPMorgan Chase. The LLC's assets, purchased from Bear Stearns, are collateral for loans from the Fed and JPMorgan Chase. BlackRock Financial Management manages the portfolio. JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns do not owe the Fed any money. The Fed plans to start liquidating the assets after two years to maximize recovery value. Interest will continue to accrue as assets are sold off gradually. The assets purchased from Bear Stearns by the LLC are collateral for loans from the Fed and JPMorgan Chase. The Fed plans to liquidate the assets to maximize recovery value, with interest accruing on the remaining loan amount. Any profit or loss from the liquidation goes to the Fed, not JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase's loan is subordinate to the Fed's, so they bear the first $1.15 billion of losses. Interest on the loan will be repaid from asset sales, not by JPMorgan Chase. At the end of 2009, the assets acquired from Bear Stearns had been written down by over $3.5 billion, exceeding JPMorgan Chase's maximum losses. The CEO testified that they wouldn't have taken the risk without the $30 billion facility from the Fed. The primary risk was the continued decline in the value of mortgage-related assets. If the transaction had been a typical loan to JPMorgan Chase, they would have borne the full risk of asset depreciation. The Fed's authority for the transactions comes from the Federal Reserve Act. Timothy Geithner stated that the Fed did not have... The Fed, under Timothy Geithner, did not have authority to acquire equity in Bear Stearns or JPMorgan Chase. However, they created an LLC to acquire assets from Bear Stearns, raising policy questions. The Fed typically lends money to institutions with collateral, but in this case, they lent to a controlled LLC instead of a financial institution. On September 16, 2008, the Fed announced a $85 billion loan to AIG due to stock price decline and collateral demands. AIG could borrow up to $85 billion over two years, with an initial $28 billion lent on September 18. The Fed and Treasury acted due to AIG being \"too big to fail\" to prevent financial market disruption. On September 18, the Fed lent $28 billion to AIG at an interest rate of 8.5% above LIBOR. The government received warrants for a 79.9% ownership stake in AIG. Three trustees were appointed to oversee the firm during the loan. The lending facility is backed by AIG's non-regulated subsidiaries' assets. If AIG fails to honor the loan terms, the Fed can seize its assets to reduce the risk of losses. On October 8, 2008, the Fed expanded its assistance to AIG by swapping cash for up to $37.8 billion of AIG's investment-grade securities. AIG needed liquidity from the Fed to cover losses on investments made with collateral as some counterparties withdrew from the lending program. The Federal Reserve provided assistance to AIG by restructuring the intervention to support the company due to cash flow issues and collateral requirements for credit default swaps. The agreement was characterized as a loan of securities to the Fed in exchange for cash collateral, as AIG couldn't use the securities as collateral under New York insurance law. The revised terms aimed to balance deterring future government assistance requests while providing necessary support. The Federal Reserve restructured assistance to AIG to address cash flow issues and collateral requirements for credit default swaps. The November 10 restructuring included a $40 billion capital injection, a $60 billion reduced loan facility, and eased financial terms. This aimed to balance deterring future assistance requests while providing necessary support. The government purchased troubled assets related to AIG through LLCs controlled by the Federal Reserve, similar to the structure used for Bear Stearns. Two LLCs were set up for AIG - one for RMBS and one for CDO. The RMBS LLC was lent $22.5 billion by the Federal Reserve and $1 billion from AIG to purchase RMBS. AIG bears the first $1 billion in losses, with future profits shared between AIG and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and AIG share future gains from troubled assets, with most profits going to the Fed. Assets lost $3 billion in value by March 2009, exceeding AIG's total loss exposure. Maiden Lane II assets lost $1.1 billion by 2009. Maiden Lane III was lent $30 billion from the Fed and $5 billion from AIG to purchase CDOs. AIG has written credit default swaps on CDOs, with a $5 billion subordinated loan from AIG. As of March 2009, assets lost $8.5 billion in value, exceeding AIG's total loss exposure. The Federal Reserve and AIG will share future gains, with most profits going to the Fed. Maiden Lane III assets had lost $0.9 billion in value by the end of 2009. The Treasury purchased $40 billion in preferred shares of AIG through TARP, with additional warrants for common shares. AIG was the first non-bank to receive TARP funds, triggering restrictions on executive pay. The $40 billion in preferred shares pay a 10% dividend per annum. Shares held for the Treasury will be reduced by shares and warrants purchased under TARP. The U.S. government currently holds a total equity interest of 77.9% in AIG, with warrants to purchase an additional 2%. The warrants equivalent to 77.9% of AIG's equity were exercised and transferred to the government on March 4, 2009. AIG announced a loss of over $60 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, leading to concerns about further downgrades by ratings agencies and increased cash demands. The Treasury and Fed revised financial assistance to AIG on March 2, 2009, citing significant challenges due to market deterioration. The revised assistance for AIG aims to improve the company's capital and liquidity for its global divestiture program. It includes exchanging $40 billion in preferred shares for shares resembling common equity, committing up to $30 billion in additional preferred share purchases, and reducing the interest rate on the existing Fed loan facility by removing the current floor of 3.5%. The Fed has reduced the interest rate on the existing loan facility for AIG by removing the 3.5% floor, resulting in a new rate of three month LIBOR plus 3%, approximately 4.25%. The limit on the Fed revolving credit facility has been decreased from $60 billion to $25 billion. AIG will repay up to $33.5 billion of the outstanding $38 billion on the Fed credit facility through asset transfers, including securitizing $8.5 billion in life insurance cash flows and issuing $25 billion in preferred interests in two life insurance subsidiaries to the Fed. This transfer effectively gives the Fed a majority stake in the subsidiaries, which will still be managed by AIG. AIG announced new assistance and formed a holding company for its property/casualty insurance subsidiaries. Sales of subsidiaries have been difficult, but by transferring two life insurance subsidiaries to the Fed and consolidating property casualty subsidiaries, AIG is making progress. Most expected government losses will accrue to TARP, as claims are junior to the Fed's. CBO did not anticipate losses from Maiden Lane asset purchases at the time of purchase. The Fed's purchase of assets at current market value from AIG did not result in expected losses according to CBO. Questions arise about the necessity of the Fed acquiring these assets if they could have been sold in the private market. AIG has been a conduit for government assistance, with funds flowing out to entities involved in financial transactions. If AIG had failed, counterparties would have seen reduced claims, highlighting them as the true beneficiaries of federal assistance. The billions in federal assistance to AIG primarily benefited its counterparties, not AIG itself. AIG disclosed $52.0 billion in support for AIGFP transactions, $29.6 billion for Maiden Lane III CDS transactions, and $43.7 billion for securities lending counterparties. The Fed's assistance to AIG was authorized under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, similar to Bear Stearns. Citigroup also faced a stock price drop in late 2008. Citigroup's stock price plummeted from $23 per share on October 1, 2008, to $3.77 on November 21, 2008, due to investor concerns about its losses. To prevent a potential collapse, the Federal Reserve and federal government intervened by purchasing $20 billion of Citigroup preferred shares through TARP and guaranteeing up to $306 billion of Citigroup's assets. This included mortgages, consumer loans, corporate loans, asset-backed securities, and unfunded lending commitments. Citigroup would bear the first $29 billion of losses on the assets, with any additional losses shared between Citigroup and the government. Citigroup and the government split losses, with Citigroup bearing 10% and the government 90%. Government losses up to $5 billion covered by Treasury using TARP funds, next $10 billion by FDIC, further losses by Fed through a non-recourse loan. Citigroup paid $7 billion in preferred stock and warrants to the government for the guarantee. In December 2009, Citigroup repaid $20 billion in preferred securities and canceled the asset guarantee, paying a termination fee of $50 million. On January 16, 2009, the federal government and the Federal Reserve announced a $20 billion purchase of Bank of America preferred shares through TARP. They also guaranteed up to $37 billion of Bank of America's assets and derivatives with potential future losses of up to $81 billion. The guarantee would last for 10 years for residential mortgage-related assets and five years for all other assets. Bank of America will bear up to the first $10 billion of losses on assets, with subsequent losses split 90% by the government and 10% by Bank of America. The government's share of the next $10 billion of losses will be split between the FDIC and the Treasury, with further losses borne by the Fed. Assets guaranteed were largely acquired during Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Bank of America will pay the government $4 billion in preferred stock with an 8% dividend rate and warrants worth $2.4 billion. Dividends on common stock are prohibited for three years. Bank of America received asset guarantees from the government to prevent them from withdrawing from their merger agreement with Merrill Lynch. Unlike Bear Stearns and AIG, Bank of America did not face management changes or dilution of shareholder equity to limit moral hazard issues. The government may have avoided imposing harsh terms on the agreement to encourage future mergers with troubled firms. Bank of America paid $425 million to exit an uncompleted merger agreement with Merrill Lynch. The agreement to guarantee Bank of America's assets was never finalized. The Fed's primary liability is currency, and its assets include loans, Treasury securities, and private assets. The Fed earns profits on its assets, which are largely remitted to the Treasury. The Federal Reserve finances its loans and asset purchases by increasing its liabilities, mainly Federal Reserve notes. This financing does not necessarily cost the Treasury, as repaid loans increase the Fed's profits and remittances to the Treasury. Most loans are fully collateralized and made with recourse, minimizing potential losses. The Fed's net income and remittances to the Treasury have been increasing in recent years, mainly from interest on Treasury securities holdings. The Federal Reserve's earnings come from interest on Treasury securities holdings, not loans. By the end of 2008, its loans and private assets were larger than its Treasury holdings. Any losses on loans would affect its net income and capital. The Fed had about $52 billion in capital by the end of 2009, with half from member banks and half as surplus. Its balance sheet became riskier in 2008 due to the shift in assets and liabilities relative to capital. The Fed's capital could be depleted if losses on loans equaled 1.9% of its financial assets. Taxpayer dollars would not be used unless losses exceeded earnings and capital. Losses could result in smaller earnings remittance to the Treasury. Fed does not expect losses on emergency actions taken. The Fed's emergency actions, including Maiden Lane LLCs, have raised concerns about potential losses if interest rates rise. Despite some unrealized capital losses, most lending programs have been profitable. In 2009, the Fed earned $5.5 billion from loans, while Maiden Lane assets lost $2.3 billion. Overall, the Fed increased profits and remittances to the Treasury. The Fed earned higher profits and increased remittances to the Treasury through its programs, which could operate at a subsidy to recipients. Subsidies occur when interest rates or asset prices do not fully compensate for risks. CBO estimated subsidies for each emergency program, but did not compare them to broader economic benefits. The CBO found that emergency programs with high collateral requirements and done on a recourse basis did not generate subsidies. Asset purchases involved no subsidy, as they were made at market value. Subsidies were identified for loan facilities without recourse and special assistance to systemically significant firms. Overall, the Fed's emergency actions were estimated to have been done at a cost. The CBO estimated that the Fed's emergency actions had a subsidy of $21 billion, which would likely be lower if re-estimated today. Subsidies were also found for programs like TALF and asset guarantees to Citigroup and Bank of America. Members of Congress questioned the exposure of taxpayers to fiscal risks without approval, similar to actions authorized under TARP. H.R. 4173 requires the Fed to issue policies for emergency lending. The Fed's emergency lending policies require sufficient collateral to protect taxpayers from losses and prohibit lending to insolvent borrowers. The Fed's balance sheet increased significantly during the financial crisis, peaking at $2,312 billion in December 2008. Since then, the balance sheet has remained relatively steady. The Fed's balance sheet has seen significant changes in composition, with increased holdings of mortgage-backed securities and GSE debt, and decreased lending to primary dealers, commercial paper holdings, and swaps with central banks. The Fed's lending power is not limited as it controls its liabilities, the monetary base, to expand or contract the amount of money outstanding. The Federal Reserve can adjust the money supply as needed, but must maintain stable prices to avoid high inflation. In response to rising inflation concerns during the financial crisis, the Fed initially tried to prevent its balance sheet from growing to control the money supply. The Federal Reserve tried to prevent its balance sheet from growing by sterilizing new loans or asset purchases through open market operations, such as selling Treasury securities. This helped keep the monetary base relatively constant before September 2008. Fed's holdings of Treasury securities initially declined as loans outstanding rose, with a shift in asset composition from mostly Treasury securities to loans and private securities by December 2008. The Fed's balance sheet consisted of Treasury securities, loans, private securities, and currency swaps with foreign central banks. The overall increase in the balance sheet peaked at $1.4 trillion, surpassing the amount of Treasury securities held before the crisis. The Treasury introduced the Supplementary Financing Program in September 2008 to help the Fed support the financial sector without increasing the money supply. The Treasury introduced the Supplementary Financing Program in September 2008 to help the Fed support the financial sector without increasing the money supply. The program increased the profits of the Fed, which are then remitted to the Treasury. Treasury deposits at the Fed peaked at $475 billion by December 17, 2008, and Congress authorized this borrowing indirectly by raising the statutory debt limit. In late 2009, Treasury withdrew its supplementary deposits at the Fed to finance government spending as the debt approached the limit. The Fed increased direct loans to meet financial institutions' liquidity needs, but sterilized the loans to control inflation, limiting overall monetary stimulus to the economy. Fed's sterilization of loans raised questions about its utility. The Fed's sterilization of loans raised concerns about inflation. As commodity prices fell in 2008, the Fed shifted focus to stabilizing the financial sector. This led to an unprecedented rise in the monetary base, known as \"quantitative easing,\" which could potentially trigger inflation. The Fed's quantitative easing led to a rapid increase in excess bank reserves, preventing inflation. Banks preferred to hold the reserves to shore up their balance sheets, rather than lending out the money received from the Fed. This disrupted the money multiplier process, resulting in a smaller growth in the overall money supply. The Fed's quantitative easing led to a rapid increase in excess bank reserves, preventing inflation. Banks preferred to hold the reserves to shore up their balance sheets, rather than lending out the money received from the Fed. This disrupted the money multiplier process, resulting in a smaller growth in the overall money supply. Data from the Fed show that most of the increase in reserves has been through excess reserves, with banks holding onto them instead of lending out. The large increase in the monetary base since September 2008 has not been matched by a corresponding increase in the overall money supply. The Fed's balance sheet shrunk due to a decline in direct lending, but was offset by purchases of Treasury and Agency securities. Direct lending decreased while securities holdings increased, keeping the balance sheet size relatively constant. The Fed's asset purchases were completed by 2010, leading to a steady balance sheet size. The Fed's asset purchases have maintained the size of the balance sheet, preventing liquidity from being removed as lending fell. Critics question if the level of liquidity needed during the crisis is still necessary. Purchases of Treasury securities and MBS could stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates. The effectiveness of these purchases compared to direct lending depends on their impact on financial conditions and interest rates. Banks may increase lending once the financial outlook improves, potentially leading to inflationary pressures. The Fed may need to prevent banks from lending reserves to avoid inflation. This could be done by selling assets to reduce reserves in the banking system. However, selling assets quickly may face political resistance. The Fed's balance sheet consists mainly of securities that could be sold in secondary markets, but the Fed has committed to holding them long term. If inflation concerns arise, reducing these holdings quickly could be challenging. The Fed is considering options to prevent banks from lending reserves to avoid inflation. One option is to offer term deposits with higher interest rates to incentivize banks to hold reserves. Another option is to reduce liquidity by lending assets through reverse repos, changing the composition of liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet. The Fed is exploring ways to prevent banks from lending reserves to curb inflation. Options include offering term deposits with higher interest rates and using reverse repos to reduce liquidity on the balance sheet. The Treasury Supplemental Financing Program could also help tie up liquidity, but its size is limited by the statutory debt limit. In March 2009, the Fed and Treasury announced plans to seek legislative action for additional tools to sterilize the effects of lending or securities purchases on bank reserves. This could involve issuing its own bonds. The Fed is considering gaining authority to issue bonds to expand liabilities without increasing the monetary base. This would allow them to allocate credit more directly and stimulate the economy by reducing long-term interest rates. Legislation for this has not been considered yet. The Fed is considering issuing bonds to expand liabilities without increasing the monetary base to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term interest rates. However, economic theory questions the effectiveness of maintaining a large balance sheet in flattening the yield curve, as sterilizing its effects through various actions may offset any positive impact on liquidity. Previous attempts to flatten the yield curve through sterilization have failed to stimulate the economy. The Fed's attempts to flatten the yield curve through sterilization have failed to stimulate the economy. Some commentators believe the Fed's large-scale purchases of Treasury securities signal an intention to monetize the federal deficit, which is projected to reach its highest share of GDP since World War II. Monetizing the deficit involves financing it through money creation rather than selling bonds to private investors, a practice that has led to hyperinflation in other countries. However, the deficit has not been monetized according to the Federal Reserve Act, which prohibits the Fed from buying newly issued securities directly from the Treasury. The Federal Reserve Act prohibits the Fed from buying newly issued securities directly from the Treasury. Treasury securities purchased by the Fed are bought on the secondary market from private investors. The Fed's purchases of Treasury securities are small relative to the overall deficit. When the Fed holds Treasury securities, Treasury must pay interest to the Fed, which is remitted back to the Treasury as profits. The Federal Reserve remits about 95% of its profits to the Treasury, essentially making an interest-free loan. Increasing profits by printing more money to buy assets could hinder its statutory mandate. Fed's focus since 2007 has been on restoring liquidity to the financial system. In the fall of 2008, financial firms faced problems beyond liquidity as losses on mortgage-related assets impacted their capital adequacy. This led to reduced capital, increased capital demands from investors, and difficulties in raising new capital. During the financial crisis of 2008, firms struggled to raise new capital due to poor asset performance and investor reluctance. Uncertainty about future losses, caused by declining asset values and opacity, led to a downward spiral in stock prices for companies like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Washington Mutual, and Wachovia. During the financial crisis of 2008, firms faced a downward spiral in stock prices due to little demand for existing stock and the inability to attract new capital. Insolvency became a risk as market capitalization fell, leading to difficulties in accessing short-term borrowing markets. In 2009, some financial firms successfully issued capital to private investors to address these challenges. During financial turmoil, firms struggle to access short-term borrowing markets, leading to a liquidity problem. The Fed acts as the \"lender of last resort\" by allowing firms to convert illiquid assets into cash through collateral, enabling them to meet short-term obligations without selling assets at \"fire sale\" prices. The Fed provides liquidity to firms through lending facilities, but borrowing does not change a firm's capital buffer. The Troubled Asset Relief Program was created to address capital adequacy by providing funds directly to banks. Fed lends only to creditworthy firms to ensure solvency. The Fed's assistance through Maiden Lane LLCs is similar to TARP, involving purchases of mortgage-related assets to address financial firms' capital adequacy problems. Fed's lending facilities do not change a firm's capital position. Fed lacks statutory authority to purchase corporate bonds, mortgages, or equity directly. The Fed created Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III under its emergency authority to hold assets until markets recover and sell them to repay loans. H.R. 4173 prohibits programs removing assets from specific companies, aiming to prevent broad interpretations of Fed's powers that could lead to legal challenges or congressional backlash. TARP was created within the Treasury through legislation to avoid debates on the Fed's role extension. The Fed's main role is to act as a lender of last resort to the banking system through the discount window and lending facilities. This function helps institutions that are illiquid but solvent during times of financial stress. However, discount window lending was not able to stop bank runs, which only ended with the creation of federal deposit insurance after the Great Depression. The Fed acts as a lender of last resort to the banking system through the discount window and lending facilities. Bank runs lead to widespread failures, creating high costs for the financial system. Fed lending is not for insolvent institutions, except for those deemed \"too big to fail\" to prevent systemic risk. Deposit insurance and access to Fed lending create moral hazard for financial institutions. The failure of financial institutions deemed \"too big to fail\" could lead to systemic risk, causing the financial system to malfunction. This could result in contagion effects, driving creditors and counterparties into insolvency. While these institutions do not have explicit guarantees, they are perceived to have implicit guarantees as the government would likely intervene to prevent a systemic risk episode, leading to moral hazard issues. There is no official classification of too big to fail institutions to maintain uncertainty and reduce moral hazard. The lack of official designation for institutions deemed \"too big to fail\" creates a policy vacuum, leading to uncertainty about which institutions are too interconnected to fail. Despite not being depository institutions under strict regulation, modern financial institutions like Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG have received assistance from the Federal Reserve. This shift in the financial system highlights the dependence on various types of institutions, not just banks. The Federal Reserve was initially created to be a lender of last resort to the banking system but has extended its emergency powers to non-bank financial institutions through Section 13(3). There is a policy debate on whether these functions should be permanent and what regulatory safeguards should be in place. The broader authority granted under Section 13(3) was used during the Bear Stearns acquisition, raising concerns about institutions taking excessive risks under the belief of being \"too big to fail.\" The Fed's role in the Bear Stearns acquisition may strengthen the perception that any financial firm, regardless of its type, will be bailed out if too big or interconnected to fail. The government's handling of Lehman Brothers' failure and subsequent assistance to AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America created market uncertainty. Lehman Brothers' collapse triggered unrest in money markets, interbank lending markets, and the credit default swaps market. The government assistance to Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG reduced shareholder equity value to prevent moral hazard. Creditors and counterparties were made whole, leading to a willingness to transact with firms taking excessive risks. Recent assistance to Citigroup and Bank of America continues the trend of government intervention in too big to fail institutions. The recent government assistance to Citigroup and Bank of America did not include measures to replace management or dilute shareholders, signaling a shift away from avoiding moral hazard. This raises concerns about systemic risk and the balance between curbing excessive risk-taking and promoting financial stability. Some argue that investors are currently too risk-averse, impacting the financial system as a whole. The financial intermediation has shifted from commercial banks to avoid regulatory costs. Increasing regulation on banks may drive more business to hedge funds. Financial markets have become more complex and fast-moving, with new instruments creating challenges for regulation to keep up with innovation. Policymakers need to consider new regulations to limit moral hazard and systemic risk. The financial crisis led to regulatory reform addressing the \"too big to fail\" problem and the Fed's role. The CRS Report analyzes the effects of this legislation on the Fed and the issue. Some Members of Congress argue for more transparency on the Fed's emergency activities due to the ultimate impact on taxpayers. The Fed has not faced the same oversight and reporting requirements as the TARP. The Fed has provided detailed information on its emergency actions, including financial statements published weekly and audited by private sector auditors. Information on borrowers, collateral, and program goals is also made public. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act requires the Fed to report to specific committees on its justification for assistance provided. The Fed provides detailed information on its emergency actions, including financial statements audited by private sector auditors. However, it keeps confidential the identity of borrowers, collateral details, and specific transaction results. Calls for more disclosure highlight the increased Fed involvement in new programs. The Fed's new programs are seen as riskier and more expansive than the discount window, with concerns about disclosing which firms are accessing its facilities. The Fed argues that revealing this information could harm investor confidence and lead to destabilizing runs on institutions. This lack of transparency could deter institutions from participating in the Fed's programs, hindering economic recovery. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in the Great Depression and the disclosure of TARP fund recipients have shown mixed evidence on the impact of publicizing loans. Banks receiving TARP funds initially faced no stigma, but some have repaid early to avoid being perceived as weak. There are debates on expanding disclosure and oversight, including removing restrictions on the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate the Fed for Congress. The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act of 1978 restricts GAO from auditing certain Fed activities, including transactions with foreign central banks, monetary policy deliberations, and transactions under the Federal Open Market Committee. The act also limits GAO's disclosure of confidential information about financial firms subject to Fed policies. If audit restrictions were removed, it could lead to increased oversight and transparency. The Federal Banking Agency Audit Act of 1978 restricts GAO from auditing certain Fed activities, including transactions with foreign central banks and monetary policy deliberations. It also limits GAO's disclosure of confidential information about financial firms subject to Fed policies. S. 896, signed into law in 2009, allows GAO audits of specific partnerships or corporations under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. This includes audits of Maiden Lane facilities and asset guarantees of Citigroup and Bank of America, but maintains restrictions on non-emergency activities and broadly-accessed emergency lending facilities. GAO must maintain confidentiality of accessed private documents but cannot withhold requested information. H.R. 4173 allows GAO to audit emergency actions, lending, and market operations for operational integrity, accounting, internal controls, collateral policies, and third-party contracting. GAO is prohibited from releasing confidential information about transactions until authorized by the Fed. The bill also mandates audits of lending from December 2007 onwards and the selection of Federal Reserve regional bank presidents for conflicts of interest. H.R. 4173 proposes reforms to regional bank governance by requiring the Federal Reserve to disclose specific information such as borrower identities and loan terms to congressional committees within seven days of a loan. This information can be kept confidential if needed. The Federal Reserve is required to disclose borrower identities and loan terms to the public with delays of up to two years for the discount window and one year for other lending. Specific oversight boards or committees could be created by Congress to focus on the Federal Reserve, as current oversight is done through semi-annual hearings with congressional committees. Greater disclosure and outside evaluation could potentially help Congress perform its oversight duties more effectively regarding the Federal Reserve's crisis-response actions. The main argument against increasing Fed oversight is that it may reduce the Fed's operational independence from Congress, as stated by Chairman Bernanke. Most economists believe that the Fed's independence in making day-to-day monetary policy decisions without congressional input strengthens its credibility with the private sector. The Federal Reserve's credibility with the private sector is crucial for effective monetary policy. Its independence in setting interest rates is seen as non-political and technocratic, aligning with its mandate from Congress. However, the Fed's response to the financial crisis has raised concerns about its involvement in more political decisions, such as determining access to Fed credit. Striking a balance between independence and oversight is a key policy challenge. Chairman Bernanke has advocated for finding this balance. Chairman Bernanke advocates for a balance between the Federal Reserve's independence and oversight. He supports legislation for the GAO to audit special credit and liquidity facilities, including operational integrity, collateral policies, and financial reporting. Additionally, he proposes releasing the identities of firms participating in these facilities after a delay to maintain investor confidence. The Federal Reserve's release of information on firms participating in special credit and liquidity facilities is delayed to prevent market confidence from being undermined. The Fed influences economic conditions through the purchase and sale of U.S. Treasury securities, but since 2008, it has increasingly intervened directly in the financial system, impacting the allocation of private capital. The Federal Reserve's intervention in the financial system impacts the allocation of capital by favoring certain assets or firms. Assisting Bear Stearns and AIG may encourage high risk-taking by other \"too big to fail\" firms. Punitive conditions attached to assistance mitigate but do not eliminate these effects. The Fed's efforts to push down yields on certain assets may reintroduce inefficient underpricing of risk. The Federal Reserve's intervention in the financial system impacts the allocation of capital by favoring certain assets or firms, leading to underpricing of risk. The Fed's purchases of commercial paper and GSE obligations create advantages for large firms with high credit ratings and GSEs over private competitors. Access to Fed borrowing gives banks and primary dealers an advantage over other institutions during times of scarce liquidity. This may hinder the process of weeding out bad institutions, as reputation is needed for private liquidity but not for Fed liquidity. Liquidity provided by the government has positive externalities and would be underprovided by the private sector. The Federal Reserve's interventions in the financial system impact capital allocation by favoring certain assets or firms, leading to underpricing of risk. While the Fed's efforts aim to provide liquidity and prevent a downward spiral in conditions, there is a risk of market distortions and economic inefficiencies in the long run. Additionally, the Fed's activities could potentially crowd out private lenders and investors. The Fed's activities may crowd out private lenders and investors in specific markets, leading to less robust private markets. The Fed has suggested methods to keep its balance sheet large even after the economy has returned to normal, which could alter capital allocation and incentives. Some economists argue that monetary policy has contributed to economic stability since the mid-1980s. Some economists argue that despite contributing to economic stability since the mid-1980s, monetary policy may be ineffective due to a credit crunch and banks' preference for safe assets over lending. The Fed has already reduced interest rates to near zero, but this may not be enough to stimulate the economy back to full employment after the deep recession in 2008. Some economists argue that zero interest rates may not be stimulative enough to quickly bring the economy back to full employment. This scenario, known as a \"liquidity trap,\" was seen in Japan in the 1990s after a financial bubble burst. Liquidity traps are more likely during deflation when real interest rates are higher than nominal rates. Despite falling prices in 2008, inflation has been modestly rising since then. Since the end of 2008, prices have been rising modestly. In a liquidity trap, inflation would not be steady. Monetary policy suffers lags between interest rate reductions and economic activity increases. The Fed still has policy options available to stimulate the economy, even after reducing the federal funds rate target to near zero in December 2008. Ben Bernanke and co-authors outlined additional policy options in a 2004 study for stimulating the economy when interest rates hit zero. The Fed has engaged in quantitative easing since September 2008, adjusting the monetary base to meet the financial sector's liquidity needs. Once the federal funds rate hits zero, the Fed can further increase lending for expansionary effects on the economy, or engage in quantitative easing by purchasing securities. Fed purchased $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities, $1.25 trillion in MBS, and $175 billion of GSE obligations from March 2009 to March 2010. Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn estimated that quantitative easing could increase nominal GDP by $1 trillion over the next few years. The large increase in excess bank reserves raises doubts about the effectiveness of quantitative easing. The Fed's actions may lower interest rates in the economy, but this will only stimulate economic activity if interest-sensitive spending responds to lower rates. Research by the New York Fed suggests that quantitative easing can lower interest rates, particularly long-term rates, which some economists believe to be more stimulative than short-term rate reductions. However, the effectiveness of this method is debated, as rate reductions must be long-lasting to have a significant impact on economic activity. Other economic conditions also influence interest rates, making it challenging to assess the overall effect of asset purchase programs on interest rates. The authors use time-series evidence to estimate that the purchase program reduced the yield on ten-year securities by 0.38 to 0.82 percentage points. Another study found small effects of the Fed's MBS purchases on interest rates after adjusting for risk, mainly occurring at the program announcement. It is premature to conclude the economy is in a liquidity trap at this time. Critics argue that the Fed's aggressive easing of monetary policy may lead to stagflation, where economic growth slows while inflation rises. They believe that persistent inflation expectations and excessive liquidity could drive up inflation further. Critics fear that the government's large budget deficit and monetary base increase will lead to higher inflation expectations. They warn that rising commodity prices could further fuel inflation, similar to the 1970s experience. Despite current low inflation rates, economists agree that prolonged monetary policy could disrupt stable inflation. Unemployment and excess capacity currently mitigate fears of stagflation. In the near term, high unemployment and excess capacity have kept inflation low. Japan's example shows that despite a significant increase in the monetary base, inflation remained subdued due to economic weakness. Commodity prices fell in 2008, briefly causing deflation. The Fed's actions to revive the economy could potentially increase inflation. Despite a doubling of the monetary base in 2008, inflation stayed stable due to a greater increase in bank reserves. The key to maintaining stable inflation is finding the balance between disinflationary pressures of the slowdown and inflationary pressures of quantitative easing. The Fed's added liquidity must be removed to prevent inflation without stifling economic recovery. Policymakers face uncertainty in achieving this balance amidst financial market turmoil. The Fed's response to the financial turmoil has been swift and creative, providing unprecedented liquidity to the financial sector. However, the slow economic recovery does not necessarily indicate wrongheaded policy decisions. Congress may need to consider the Fed's role in various emergency interventions, including the Bear Stearns acquisition and assistance to AIG, Citigroup, and Bank of America. The Fed's broad authority allows lending to non-member banks, including creating LLCs to purchase assets of institutions like Bear Stearns and AIG. This raises the question of whether institutions receiving Fed protection should also bear the costs imposed on member banks for safety and soundness. H.R. 4173 aims to limit future emergency lending to collateralized facilities to prevent assistance to non-member banks. Some policymakers question the independence of the Fed in providing significant taxpayer funds to the financial sector through emergency lending. H.R. 4173 aims to increase transparency by removing GAO audit restrictions and disclosing borrower identities with a delay. Treasury borrowing has allowed the Fed to increase lending capacity without inflation concerns. The Fed is the only institution able to manage financial difficulties at too big to fail institutions quickly. TARP's systemic approach is limited, and the Fed has created lending facilities to support various markets. TARP is set to expire in October 2010, and the Fed's actions have led to an unprecedented expansion in its balance sheet and money supply control. The Fed has expanded its balance sheet and money supply control, which could lead to inflation. To prevent this, the Fed is using large-scale asset purchases and paying interest on bank reserves."
