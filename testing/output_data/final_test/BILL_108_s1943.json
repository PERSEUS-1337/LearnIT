It also addresses temporary State authority to waive certain requirements under the Act. Additionally, it covers Railroad Unemployment Insurance. Sec. 301. Temporary increase in extended unemployment benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. TITLE I--TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. SEC. 101. REFERENCES. Amendment references are to the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002. SEC. 102. EXTENSION OF THE TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2002. Extends the program for six months. The agreement under this title applies to weeks of unemployment starting after the agreement is entered into and ending before July 1, 2004. Temporary extended unemployment compensation will continue for individuals receiving it before July 1, 2004, until December 31, 2004. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-147; 26 U.S.C. 3304 note) will be in effect until December 31, 2004 for individuals already receiving it before July 1, 2004. SEC. 103. ENTITLEMENT TO ADDITIONAL WEEKS OF TEMPORARY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. SEC. 103 amends the amount established in an account under subsection (a) to be 26 times the individual's weekly benefit amount for the benefit year. It also adjusts the amount in subsection (c)(1) to be 7 times the individual's weekly benefit amount. These amendments take effect as if included in the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002. The Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 is amended to apply only to weeks of unemployment after the enactment of this Act. Special rules apply to individuals with existing temporary extended unemployment compensation accounts. Amounts deposited before the enactment of this Act are treated as deposited by the individual. The Act treats amounts deposited by individuals under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 as TEUC amounts. Determinations made before the amendments are disregarded, and new determinations are made using the amended section 203(c) of the Act. The Act treats amounts deposited by individuals under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2002 as TEUC amounts. Determinations are made to ensure that accounts are exhausted in accordance with the amended section 203(b) of the Act. If an individual's account was augmented and exhausted of all TEUC-X amounts before the enactment of the Act, exhaustion is determined as if it had not occurred until the date of enactment. SEC. 104. TEUC-X TRIGGER. Section 203(c)(2)(B) is amended to adjust the period for a State under the Act, modifying section 203(d) by changing '5' to '4' and exempting certain weeks of unemployment from paragraph (1)(A) of such section. The average rate of total unemployment in a State must be 6.5 percent or higher for the most recent 3 months before exhaustion to qualify for certain provisions under the Act. The Secretary will determine the rate of total unemployment in each State. TITLE II--EXTENDED BENEFITS UNDER THE FEDERAL-STATE EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 1970. Temporary state authority to waive application of lookbacks under the Act for weeks of unemployment beginning after enactment and ending before December 31, 2004. TITLE III--RAILROAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. Temporary increase in extended unemployment benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. Section 2(c)(2) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to temporarily increase extended unemployment benefits for employees with 10 or more years of service. This includes substituting \"130 days of unemployment\" for \"65 days of unemployment\" and inserting additional provisions. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to increase extended unemployment benefits for employees with less than 10 years of service. This includes inserting additional provisions for 13 consecutive 14-day periods after 7 consecutive 14-day periods. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to extend benefits for employees who received normal benefits between July 1, 2002, and July 1, 2004."
