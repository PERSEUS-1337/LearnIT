The Gasoline Price Stabilization Act of 2003 authorizes the President to issue orders and regulations, including price caps, to stabilize gasoline prices at or below March 1, 2002 levels. Violators face a $1,000,000 fine per violation, and enforcement agencies can seek injunctions against those breaking the regulations. The Gasoline Price Stabilization Act of 2003 allows the President to issue regulations to stabilize gasoline prices. Violators can face fines and injunctions. The Act will expire one year after enactment, but enforcement can continue for violations before the expiration date. SEC. 3. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE DRAWDOWN. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to authorize drawdowns to address state or regional economic harm and combat anti-competitive conduct by reducing energy supply caused by such behavior. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to authorize drawdowns to address significant reductions in energy supply caused by anticompetitive conduct, leading to price increases with adverse impacts on the economy. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allow the sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) when the price of crude oil exceeds $25 for more than 14 days. Proceeds from the sale must be deposited in the SPR Petroleum Account and used for specified purposes outlined in section 167. Reporting and consultation requirements are mandated when such conditions are met. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allow the sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) when the price of crude oil exceeds $25 for more than 14 days. A report is required to analyze the causes and consequences of the price increase, estimate its duration, and assess its impact on gasoline costs. The President's support for drawing down oil from the SPR must be justified. Additionally, a study by the General Accounting Office on the President's drawdown authority with respect to the SPR is mandated within a year of the Act's enactment. The President's drawdown authority with respect to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is being examined, including how it has changed over time, when it has been used, its impact on oil prices, and the potential implications of expanding this authority for oil companies. SEC. 4. MINIMUM INVENTORY LEVELS. The Secretary of Energy will establish minimum inventory levels for producers, refiners, and marketers of crude oil and petroleum products to mitigate the impact of unexpected supply disruptions on prices. Different levels may be set for various industry segments and products, with possible seasonal adjustments and regional variations. The Secretary of Energy will establish minimum inventory levels for producers, refiners, and marketers of crude oil and petroleum products to mitigate the impact of unexpected supply disruptions on prices, considering regional variations in supply and demand, and market structure. The ban on exporting Alaskan oil is repealed, and a prohibition on exports is reinstated. Additionally, there is a sense of Congress regarding OPEC and the WTO. The Congress finds that collusion among oil-producing countries, particularly OPEC, has led to manipulated oil markets, resulting in high prices and volatility. This has negatively impacted consumers, businesses, and the economy. Article XI of GATT 1994 prohibits quantitative restrictions on international trade, aiming to promote economic growth. Oil production restrictions are considered a \"quantitative restriction\" under WTO rules, as clarified in a GATT Panel Report from 1988. Oil production restrictions by OPEC countries are considered a \"quantitative restriction\" under WTO rules. Article XX of GATT 1994 prohibits exceptions that could be seen as disguised restrictions on international trade. Out of the 11 OPEC countries, 6 are WTO members, 2 are observers seeking to join, and 3 have no relationship with the WTO. The Congress strongly urges the President to file a complaint in the World Trade Organization against oil-producing countries for violating their obligations under WTO rules. This action would likely impact the behavior of these countries, including Mexico, Norway, Russia, and Oman, who are either members or seeking membership in the WTO."
