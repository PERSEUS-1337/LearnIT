    "title": "AB 1470",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the threat of harmful algae blooms in California's waters, linked to degradation of watersheds, nutrient loading, water diversions, and climate change. The state's warm climate and stressed waterways make it especially prone to these blooms. Cyanotoxins, including microcystins, anatoxin-a, and saxitoxin, are harmful algae byproducts found in California's waters. These toxins are dangerous to humans, pets, livestock, birds, and wildlife through ingestion, inhalation, or skin exposure. Microcystins can cause prolonged toxicity by cycling between the liver and intestines. Harmful algal blooms of microcystins in California are threatening water supply and health. Cyanotoxin pollution is recurrent in various rivers and lakes, with bird deaths reported in the Salton Sea. An algal bloom in the Pacific Ocean is affecting the Dungeness crab harvest in multiple ports. The Pinto Lake watershed is being evaluated for TMDL regulation for microcystin, with concerns for sea otter deaths from poisoning. Food safety is a public health concern due to microcystin contamination in marine foods. California needs a coordinated effort to prevent toxic blooms and cyanotoxin pollution. Chapter 10 of the Public Resources Code, known as the Safe Water and Wildlife Protection Act of 2016, establishes definitions for terms like \"Board\" and \"Waters of the state.\" It also creates a Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force to address issues related to water contamination. The Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, established under Chapter 10 of the Public Resources Code, includes representatives from various state departments and agencies. Its functions and duties are outlined until January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. The Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, established under Chapter 10 of the Public Resources Code, includes representatives from various state departments and agencies. Its functions and duties include assessing and prioritizing actions to prevent toxic algal blooms, soliciting proposals for research and projects, and developing strategies to mitigate harmful algal blooms in California waters. The Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, established under Chapter 10 of the Public Resources Code, assesses and prioritizes actions to prevent toxic algal blooms. It provides funding recommendations for research and projects that contribute to prevention strategies and sustainable mitigation actions. The Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force is tasked with reviewing the risks and negative impacts of harmful algal blooms and microcystin pollution on various aspects of the environment. They will develop recommendations for prevention and mitigation, organizing meetings and workshops as needed. Recommendations will be submitted to relevant committees and agencies by January 1, 2019, outlining necessary programs and resources for long-term prevention. The Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force will establish a notification procedure for public involvement in ongoing activities and research projects. This section will be repealed on January 1, 2020, unless extended by a later statute. The conservancy, Department of Fish and Wildlife, Wildlife Conservation Board, and board may enter contracts and provide grants for research and projects recommended by the task force. A rebuttable presumption of exemption from Section 510 is established for employees earning over $100,000 annually and performing exempt duties. Total gross annual compensation includes at least $1,000 per week on a salary or fee basis, commissions, bonuses, and other earnings over a 52-week period. Excluded are board, lodging, and medical insurance payments. The presumption of exemption from Section 510 can be rebutted if the employee did not earn at least $100,000 annually or $1,000 per week. The employee must perform exempt duties as outlined in the Wage Orders and their primary duty should involve office or nonmanual work. This section does not apply to nonmanagement production-line workers or employees in maintenance, construction, and similar occupations involving physical skill and energy. This section exempts employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that specifies wages, work hours, and working conditions, including overtime rates."
