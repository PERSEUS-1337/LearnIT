    "content": "Some health care-related statutes in current law include time-limited provisions that will expire without further congressional action. These provisions often involve temporary increases or decreases in funding or special protections, such as bonus payments for certain Medicare mental health services. Examples of funding protections include establishing a floor for Medicare funding provisions. The list covers provisions expiring before the end of the first session of the 114th Congress. Medicare payments are reviewed annually for updates, but not every change in payments is considered an expiring provision. Some Medicare payment provisions are not considered expiring, such as the physician fee schedule update and recent changes in payment policy included in the ACA. These provisions specify adjustments that may result in negative payment updates, allowing rates to be lower than the previous year. The report includes expiring health care-related provisions that would require congressional action to extend once the expiration date is reached. Demonstration projects and pilot programs are excluded, and provisions that expired or were repealed in 2013 are listed separately. The expiring provisions are organized by SSA or PHSA title and section.
