    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.13 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to require electrical corporations and retail sellers in California to annually prepare renewable energy procurement plans to meet obligations under the renewables portfolio standard. The plans must be proposed, reviewed, and adopted by the commission as part of a general procurement plan process. Every electrical corporation owning transmission facilities must annually submit a report to the commission identifying necessary upgrades to meet renewable energy procurement requirements. The report must include a schedule for applying for necessary permits and ensure timely investments are made. Electrical corporations owning transmission facilities must ensure timely completion of project-specific interconnection studies. The commission requires retail sellers to submit an annual compliance report detailing progress towards procuring renewable energy resources as a percentage of retail sales, including necessary approvals and compliance with portfolio content requirements. The commission requires retail sellers to submit an annual compliance report detailing progress towards procuring renewable energy resources and recommendations to remove impediments. The commission shall adopt rules for construction and upgrades to transmission and distribution facilities for interconnecting renewable energy resources. The commission will adopt rules for selecting renewable energy resources based on cost and viability, considering transmission costs, impact on electricity portfolio, and project feasibility. The commission will also consider workforce recruitment, training, and retention efforts, estimating electrical corporation expenses for integrating renewable energy resources, and taking into account statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits. Rules allowing retail sellers to carry over excess procurement from one compliance period to the next starting in 2011. The rules must be applied equally to all sellers and consider the capacity and reliability of renewable energy resources for grid stability. Contracts of any duration can count as excess procurement for electricity products meeting portfolio content requirements. Retail sellers can carry over excess procurement from one compliance period to the next starting in 2011. Contracts for electricity products meeting portfolio content requirements are not counted as excess procurement. If a retail seller notifies the commission of compliance, the provisions will take effect for that compliance period. Standard terms and conditions for contracting renewable energy resources require disclosure of agreement details within six months of commission approval. The renewable energy procurement plan includes assessing annual or multiyear portfolio supplies, determining the optimal mix of eligible renewable energy resources, and addressing potential compliance delays. The procurement plan includes soliciting renewable energy resources with specific characteristics, providing updates on development schedules, considering price adjustments for projects with delayed online dates, assessing construction risks, and offering contracts of at least 10 years duration. (7) Electrical corporations must prioritize renewable energy projects that benefit communities in need and reduce emissions.\n(8) Retail sellers should consider resource types that maintain grid reliability. Beginning January 1, 2021, retail sellers must ensure that at least 65 percent of their electricity procurement for the renewables portfolio standard comes from contracts lasting 10 years or more. The commission will review and approve each electrical corporation's renewable energy procurement plan to ensure compliance with the obligations of this article. The commission requires electrical corporations to submit renewable energy contracts for review and approval. If bid prices are deemed inflated due to lack of competition, renegotiation or new solicitation is mandated. Failure to comply with the commission's renewable energy procurement plan results in enforcement actions by the commission. The commission may authorize a procurement entity to enter into contracts for electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources on behalf of customers of a retail seller to meet renewables portfolio standard requirements. The procurement entity can recover administrative and procurement costs through retail rates of end-use customers benefiting from the renewable energy procurement. The commission authorizes procurement entities to enter contracts for renewable energy resources on behalf of retail customers to meet standards. Costs for contracts and construction work on renewable energy resources are recoverable in rates. The commission will update criteria for selecting renewable energy resources by July 1, 2017, to include the value of maintaining existing baseload resources for a balanced portfolio."
