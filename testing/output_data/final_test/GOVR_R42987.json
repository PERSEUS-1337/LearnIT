    "content": "In the 113th Congress, gun control proposals were introduced following mass shooting incidents in 2012. The Senate debated these proposals in April 2013 but tabled the legislation. The House also introduced similar proposals, but they did not see much action. Committees on Veterans' Affairs addressed veterans, mental incompetency, and firearms eligibility, but the legislation did not progress. Congress extended a ban on undetectable firearms for 10 years in December 2013. The House passed amendments to appropriations bills supported by gun rights advocates. On December 14, 2012, a 20-year-old male in Newtown, CT, used firearms owned by his mother to shoot 20 first graders, 6 adult staff members, and his mother to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The weapons included a 5.56mm Bushmaster rifle, a 10mm Glock pistol, and a 9mm Sig Sauer pistol. The shooter, who had mental incapacity, used the Bushmaster rifle mostly and ended his own life with the Glock pistol. The shooter at Sandy Hook used the Bushmaster rifle with detachable 30-round magazines to kill children and staff. President Obama established a Task Force on Gun Violence and released a plan to reduce gun violence, including background checks and a ban on assault weapons. President Obama's plan to reduce gun violence includes strengthening background checks, reinstating a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, increasing penalties for gun trafficking, and confirming B. Todd Jones as ATF Director. Other proposals focus on funding for police officers and training for law enforcement in responding to shootings. The Administration's plan to reduce gun violence includes funding for research on the nexus between video games, media images, and violence, expanding the National Violent Death Reporting System, improving incentives for states to provide prohibiting records to the FBI, and enhancing school security. The plan also involves 23 executive actions, such as prosecuting firearms-related criminal cases and researching the causes of gun violence. The Administration periodically updates a report on the progress of implementing these actions, focusing on federal firearms laws. The report provides an overview of federal firearms laws and examines three key legislative proposals from the President's plan: universal background checks, increased penalties for gun trafficking, and reinstating a federal ban on certain firearms and ammunition magazines. It also briefly discusses counter-proposals for expanding firearms carrying privileges. In response to the Newtown mass shooting, the Senate considered legislative proposals for universal background checks, increased penalties for gun trafficking, and restrictions on certain firearms. The Senate debated but did not pass this legislation in April 2013. The House did not act on similar measures. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary approved four gun control-related bills in Spring 2013, including the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act and the Fix Gun Checks Act. The Senate considered various gun control bills in response to the Newtown mass shooting, including proposals for universal background checks and restrictions on certain firearms. The votes on universal background checks and assault weapons ban split down party lines. The Senate voted on multiple gun control bills, including the gun trafficking bill (S. 54), school safety bill (S. 146), and the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 (S. 150). Senator Dianne Feinstein offered S. 150 as an amendment to the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 (S. 649), which included other gun control measures. Most amendments were defeated, except for one by Senators Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey. Senators Joe Manchin and Patrick Toomey proposed an amendment requiring background checks for intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons in public fora. The amendment also addressed improving firearms-related background checks and veterans' firearms eligibility. Senator Charles Grassley offered a GOP substitute amendment focusing on standalone gun trafficking and straw purchasing offenses. Both amendments were part of the Senate's discussion on gun control bills. The GOP substitute amendment included provisions to improve background checks, veterans' firearms eligibility, and mental incompetency definitions. Senator Patrick Leahy's amendment on gun trafficking was rejected, as well as Senator John Cornyn's amendment on concealed carry reciprocity. The Senate rejected amendments on gun control, including one to recognize permits issued by other states, expand restrictions on assault weapons, and prevent the VA from referring mentally incompetent individuals for firearm restrictions. The Senate rejected amendments on gun control, including restrictions on large capacity ammunition feeding devices and a reduction in grants for releasing information on gun owners. Senator Tom Harkin's amendment to expand grant programs related to mental health and substance abuse was also discussed. The Senate rejected gun control amendments, including restrictions on ammunition devices and grants for gun owner information. Senator Tom Harkin's amendment to expand mental health and substance abuse grant programs was adopted by a vote of 95-2. The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs approved the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 602) by voice vote. The House Committee approved the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 602) by voice vote, which prevents certain individuals receiving VA benefits from being considered \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" for federal firearms eligibility without a judicial finding of danger to themselves or others. Similar measures were included in Senate amendments but ultimately rejected. The Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 was extended for 10 years by the House and Senate, making it illegal to possess firearms that are not detectable by a metal detector. The law requires a security exemplar made of 3.7 ounces of stainless steel. The current expiration date of the law is December 10, 2023. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) reported to Congress in 1986 that creating an undetectable firearm using materials like carbon fibers or ceramics was possible. Concerns were raised about 3-D printer technology being used to make such firearms easily. An individual built and shared a blueprint for an undetectable firearm online, demonstrating its creation and test-firing. The blueprint for an undetectable firearm was shared online, with a video showing its creation and test-firing. Despite efforts to remove the plans, they were still available on file-sharing sites. The House passed the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, which included provisions related to gun control. One provision aimed to exclude firearms ammunition and sport fishing equipment from the Toxic Substances Control Act. The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to federal manufacturer excise taxes on firearms and sport fishing equipment, including amendments to allocate revenue for target ranges on public lands and prohibiting regulations on possessing firearms at Army Corps of Engineers projects. The Senate also considered a similar bill in July 2014. In 2014, the Senate considered the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014, which included provisions to allocate federal excise tax revenues for shooting ranges on public lands. Supporters of gun rights and gun control filed numerous amendments, but cloture was rejected by the Senate. The House Committee on Appropriations also approved an FY2015 Interior Appropriations bill with related provisions. The House approved an FY2015 Interior Appropriations bill (H.R. 4923) with provisions similar to H.R. 3590 and S. 2363. The bill included a provision to prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from enforcing regulations on firearms on Corps-managed property. However, this provision was not included in the final Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235). Congress included narrower provisions in the final act, instructing the Department of the Interior to notify House and Senate Committees for FY2015. The Department of the Interior was instructed to notify Congress before closing public access to areas for recreational activities. A provision in P.L. 113-325 prohibited the use of funding to regulate lead content in firearms ammunition or fishing tackle. The Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller that a DC law banning handguns was unconstitutional. Since the Heller decision, the DC Council has passed laws to comply with it. Some Members of Congress have sponsored proposals to block the implementation of these laws, such as an amendment by Representative Thomas Massie to prohibit funding for enforcing certain DC gun control laws. The Massie amendment, adopted with a vote of 241-181, was included in H.R. 5016 but not in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015. Federal law, including the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, regulates firearms commerce and possession. State firearms laws can be stricter than federal law, but cannot preempt it. The National Firearms Act of 1934 regulates firearms commerce and possession in the United States. It was designed to restrict access to certain types of firearms, such as machine guns and concealed weapons. Machine guns have been banned from private possession since 1986, except for those registered before that date. As of November 2007, there were approximately 182,600 machine guns available for transfer to civilians in the United States based on the National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record. A machine gun is defined as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot with a single trigger function. To deal in NFA firearms, a person must be a federally licensed gun dealer under the Gun Control Act of 1968. To deal in NFA firearms, a person must be a federally licensed gun dealer (FFL) under the Gun Control Act of 1968 and a special occupational taxpayer (SOT) under the NFA. NFA firearms, also known as Class III weapons, are subject to a $200 manufacturing tax and a $200 transfer tax for each transfer. Transfers require ATF approval and a tax stamp on the transfer document. Private individuals can acquire NFA firearms through approved transfers or by purchasing from a Class III dealer. To transfer a firearm to another person in the same state or to a FFL in another state, an individual can apply to ATF for approval to make and register an NFA firearm. It is illegal to possess an unregistered NFA firearm, punishable by a fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. Legally registered NFA machine guns are rarely used in crimes. Federal firearms regulation aims to reduce crime and violence without burdening law-abiding citizens. The Gun Control Act (GCA) aims to regulate firearms without burdening law-abiding citizens. It defines firearms and restricts their sale, requiring federal licensing for manufacturers and sellers. The GCA prohibits interstate mail-order sales of firearms and sets limitations on handgun sales. The Gun Control Act (GCA) regulates firearms sales, prohibiting certain individuals from purchasing firearms and requiring background checks for unlicensed buyers. The Act also mandates recordkeeping for commercial gun sales and imposes special penalties for firearm use in drug trafficking or violent crimes. Private transactions between non-business individuals are not subject to GCA provisions, which may be covered by state laws. Under current law, there are nine classes of persons prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, mentally ill individuals, unauthorized immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, renounced citizens, and those under restraining orders for domestic violence. The Attorney General reviewed federal law to identify potentially dangerous individuals prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition. It is unlawful to sell firearms to prohibited persons, including those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or under indictment for a crime punishable by over one year in prison. Federal firearms licensees are prohibited from transferring long guns or ammunition to anyone under 18 years old. Since 1994, it has been a federal offense for unlicensed individuals to transfer handguns or ammunition to those under 18 years old. It is also illegal for individuals under 18 to possess handguns or ammunition, with exceptions for certain activities. Federal firearms licensees (FFLs) are authorized to engage in firearm-related activities and must conduct background checks through the FBI before transferring firearms. FFLs can transfer firearms to non-licensed individuals after verifying their identity with a government-issued document. Interstate transfers of long guns to out-of-state residents are allowed if done face-to-face and in compliance with state laws. Handguns cannot be transferred to unlicensed out-of-state residents. Since 1986, there are no restrictions on interstate transfer of ammunition. A federal firearms license is required for manufacturing or importing ammunition. FFLs are authorized to do business at gun shows or events sponsored by organizations dedicated to firearms use in their state. They must submit multiple sales reports for multiple handgun purchases and maintain records of all firearm transactions. FFLs are required to respond to ATF requests for tracing information within 24 hours and may be inspected by ATF agents without a warrant. Unlicensed persons are prohibited from acquiring firearms from out-of-state sources and transferring firearms to non-residents. It is a federal offense for non-licensees to knowingly transfer firearms to prohibited persons. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was activated by the FBI in 1998 to facilitate firearms-related background checks. Firearms or ammunition transfers initiated through the Internet are subject to the same federal laws as transfers initiated in any other manner. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was established in 1998 to conduct background checks on non-licensee applicants for firearm transfers. NICS provides three outcomes: \"proceed,\" \"denied,\" or \"delayed,\" with a three-day waiting period for delayed cases. The FBI can continue the adjudication process for up to 90 days. The FBI continues to work on NICS adjudication for up to 90 days, keeping the transaction in an \"open\" status. If the person is not prohibited, the FBI will notify the FFL with a proceed response. If the person is found to be prohibited, ATF will be informed for a firearms retrieval process. FFLs are not informed of the reason for denial, but denied individuals can challenge the accuracy of the underlying records by requesting the reason from the agency that conducted the NICS check. The FBI allows up to 90 days for NICS adjudication, notifying FFLs of proceed or denial responses. Denied individuals can challenge inaccurate records, with the FBI obligated to correct them. False positives in Brady background checks are addressed through the NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) to prevent misidentifications. Under the permanent provisions of the Brady Act, over 105.5 million background checks were completed, resulting in nearly 1.8 million denials. The FBI conducted more than 60.3 million checks for non-POC states, resulting in a denial rate of 1.4%, while POC states had a higher denial rate of 2.1%. The NICS Voluntary Appeal File (VAF) allows individuals to challenge inaccurate records to prevent future misidentifications. Since FY1993, a rider on the ATF annual appropriations has prohibited funding for processing petitions for \"relief from disabilities\" for prohibited persons. The only ways to regain firearms eligibility are through civil rights restoration, expunging criminal records, or receiving a pardon. Congress provided other relief avenues for individuals \"adjudicated mental defective\" under the NICS Improvement Amendments Act. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 provided relief for individuals \"adjudicated mental defective\" under the law. Private intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons are not subject to background check requirements, which some view as a loophole in current gun control laws. In 1986, Congress amended the GCA to allow FFLs to transfer firearms to unlicensed persons at gun shows within their state. In 1994, the \"Brady Act\" required background checks for unlicensed persons obtaining firearms from FFLs. The FBI implemented NICS in 1998 for background checks, but intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons do not require checks. Several proposals in the 113th Congress aimed to mandate background checks for private, intrastate firearms transfers. Several proposals were introduced in the 113th Congress to require background checks for private, intrastate firearms transfers between unlicensed persons at gun shows or other venues. These proposals would have involved an unlicensed seller using the services of an FFL to conduct a NICS check on the buyer, with FFLs maintaining records of transfers. Senator Frank Lautenberg, Representative Carolyn McCarthy, and Representative James P. Moran all introduced separate proposals for background checks on firearms transfers between unlicensed persons at various venues. The NRA Members' Gun Safety Act of 2013 and the Fix Gun Checks Act proposed background checks for private firearms transfers, requiring unlicensed persons to use licensed dealers for transfers. The Fix Gun Checks Act was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2013. The bill requires licensed firearm dealers to conduct background checks for private party firearms transfers, with exceptions for certain relationships and purposes. Violators could face fines and imprisonment. The Attorney General would set a maximum fee for these background checks. The Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 (S. 649) included language from S. 374, which proposed universal background checks for firearms transfers. The Senate debated and voted on amendments like the Manchin-Toomey amendment, which was ultimately rejected in a 54-46 vote. This amendment would have required private firearms transfers to go through licensed dealers. The amendment proposed background checks for private transfers under specific circumstances, limited to transfers at gun shows, events, or online listings. It also required the Attorney General to issue regulations for voluntary background checks by FFLs on behalf of unlicensed persons. Representatives Peter King and Mike Thompson introduced the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Act of 2013 (H.R. 1565), similar to the Manchin-Toomey amendment. The GOP substitute amendment (S.Amdt. 725) by Senator Grassley included provisions for FFLs to conduct \"voluntary background checks\" for third parties, addressing a gap in federal statute. ATF provided guidance on this in 2013. In response to the Virginia Tech tragedy, the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 was passed by the 110th Congress to encourage states to provide records related to firearm disqualifications. The act offers incentives for compliance, such as grants and waivers, to ensure the availability of relevant records. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 offers grants to states for improving electronic access to firearms-related disqualifying records, with the Attorney General required to report annually on compliance. The Bureau of Justice Statistics administers the program and reports on states' progress in providing records for NICS background checks. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 offers grants to states for improving electronic access to firearms-related disqualifying records. The grant program, known as NARIP, authorizes appropriations for FY2009 through FY2013 and requires grants to be consistent with NCHIP. It also allocates funds for a relief from disabilities program for mentally adjudicated individuals. Additionally, there is an authorization for appropriations to improve state court computer systems for timely criminal history dispositions. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 offers grants to states for improving electronic access to firearms-related disqualifying records, with funds allocated for a relief from disabilities program for mentally adjudicated individuals. States must be certified by ATF to be eligible for grants and provide a reasonable estimate of NICS-related disqualifying records within 180 days of enactment. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 provides grants to states for improving electronic access to firearms-related disqualifying records. States must be certified by ATF and provide estimates of these records within 180 days of enactment. BJS, NCSC, and SEARCH are working on a statistical model to assess these estimates. Section 104 of P.L. 110-180 included reductions in Byrne JAG grants for states that did not provide certain percentages of disqualifying records. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 provides grants to states for improving access to firearms-related disqualifying records. States face funding cuts if they do not provide a certain percentage of these records. The Attorney General can withhold up to 5% of JAG funding from states that do not meet the required percentage. Congress has allocated $58.5 million for this program under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. Congress appropriated $58.5 million for the NICS Initiative in 2014 and $73.0 million in 2015, with a portion allocated for grants under P.L. 110-180. BJS has not provided any NCHIP 10% matching grant waivers or levied discretionary penalties. The House Committee on Appropriations directed grants to be used for improving records added to NICS and prioritized funding for NIAA compliance. The Department aims to ensure all States are NIAA compliant and will penalize noncompliant States. The Senate-reported Fix Gun Checks Act of 2013 would have provided $100 million annually for FY2014-FY2018 to help states and tribal governments improve FBI access to records for NICS checks. Grants could have been used for creating electronic systems for accurate information. The Senate-reported Fix Gun Checks Act of 2013 aimed to provide funding to help states and tribal governments improve FBI access to records for NICS checks, including court disposition and corrections records, mental health adjudications, and domestic violence records. S. 374 aimed to amend P.L. 110-180 by adjusting the timeline of JAG grants for states not providing sufficient access to prohibiting records. The Attorney General could withhold up to 3%, 4%, and 5% of JAG funding based on the percentage of records provided. Additionally, S. 374 proposed amending the Brady Act to include federal courts in the requirement for agencies to provide the FBI with access to records. S. 374 required federal agencies to provide FBI with access to prohibiting records and mandated reporting of missing or stolen firearms. Senate considered amendments for improving background checks, veterans' firearms eligibility, and mental incompetency, but they were rejected. The Brady Act authorized $100 million annually for NCHIP from FY2014-FY2017 and proposed amendments to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007. States would need to provide records on prohibited persons to the FBI or face reductions in JAG funding based on set benchmarks. Non-compliant states would face gradual reductions in funding over four years, with immediate reductions for failure to submit a plan to the Attorney General. The Manchin-Toomey amendment proposed amendments to the NARIP program, authorizing $100 million annually for FY2014-FY2017. Grant funding could be used for assessments, implementing policies, creating electronic systems for record submission, background checks, and disability relief programs. States not implementing a disability relief program would face reductions in JAG grant funding over four years. The rejected amendment proposed changes to JAG grant funding percentages over four years and required states to match grant funding with state funding for assessments. It aimed to improve records accessibility for NICS and reserved funding for Indian tribal governments. In contrast, Senator Grassley's amendment would have authorized $20 million annually for the NARIP program, focusing on mental health records and changing terminology in relevant statutes. The GOP substitute proposed changes to the GCA, narrowing the scope of who can be referred to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS mental defective file. It also included penalties for states that did not provide prohibiting records to the FBI. The proposed amendment aimed to expand the criteria for individuals prohibited from possessing firearms due to mental incompetency or commitment to a psychiatric hospital. It would have required federal courts to provide records to the FBI for inclusion in NICS and mandated federal agencies to report annually on the number of records submitted. Despite some opposition, the amendment was ultimately rejected. Individuals with PTSD are not automatically disqualified from gun ownership under current laws. The Veterans' Medical Administration rarely submits disqualifying records to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS system. Veterans with PTSD who have been involuntarily committed are ineligible to possess firearms, but the VA does not make referrals to the FBI for this. Instead, the state where the court order was issued would submit the disqualifying record to the FBI. Under current laws, individuals with PTSD are not automatically disqualified from gun ownership. The Veterans' Medical Administration rarely submits disqualifying records to the FBI for the NICS system. A provision in the GCA allows for petitions for \"relief from disabilities\" to restore firearms eligibility, but funding restrictions have limited this process. Prior to P.L. 110-180, civil rights restoration, expungement of criminal records, or pardons were the only ways to regain firearms eligibility. Under P.L. 110-180, the VA must inform veterans and beneficiaries about the consequences of having a fiduciary appointed on their behalf, which could result in being deemed \"mentally incompetent\" and losing firearms eligibility. Veterans can seek administrative relief to potentially regain their gun rights if they can prove they no longer have a disqualifying condition. This requirement also applies to other federal agencies and states receiving federal assistance. As of May 1, 2013, the FBI received 170,646 files from the VA for the NICS mental defective file, accounting for 98.9% of all files referred by federal agencies. Some Members of Congress question why other agencies like the Social Security Administration do not refer firearms disqualifying records for mentally incapacitated beneficiaries. Additionally, there are individuals with age-related infirmities or mental disabilities without mechanisms for state or local authorities to report similar cases. Some Members of Congress debate the VA's referral of firearms disqualifying records on veterans, questioning if it is necessary or an unwarranted indignity. Others argue that the VA is complying with the law and enhancing public safety. Opposition to the VA policy decreased between 1998 and 2007, showing that few veterans deemed mentally defective sought firearms. Some Members of Congress debate the VA's policy on firearms disqualifying records for veterans, with concerns about protecting veterans and public safety. The GOP substitute amendment in Senate sought to amend veterans law to require judicial authority before sharing records with the FBI for NICS inclusion. The Senate and House Committees considered bills related to veterans' 2nd Amendment rights, but no further action was taken. The Gun Control Act aims to combat gun trafficking, particularly interstate trafficking. ATF has a strategy to reduce firearms trafficking and violent crime. The ATF has a strategy to reduce firearms trafficking and violent crime by preventing convicted felons, drug traffickers, and juvenile gang members from acquiring firearms from gun traffickers. Gun trafficking cases involve activities such as straw purchasing, trafficking by corrupt licensed dealers, trafficking by unlicensed dealers, trafficking in stolen firearms, and trafficking of secondhand firearms acquired from private venues. ATF works to reduce firearms-related crime through industry regulation and criminal investigation. ATF regulates the U.S. firearms industry by inspecting FFLs to monitor compliance with the GCA and NFA, preventing diversion of firearms to illegal channels. Tension exists between ATF, firearms industry, and gun-owning community. Special Agents and Investigators can inspect FFLs without warrants in certain scenarios. ATF Special Agents and Investigators inspect FFLs to trace crime guns and uncover illegal activities like straw purchases. This helps in generating leads for criminal investigations and preventing firearms diversion to illegal channels. Straw purchases involve a person posing as the buyer for someone else, serving as an illegal middleman. The Gun Control Act requires a Form 4473 to be filled out for firearms transfers, with the purchaser attesting to being the actual buyer. Making false statements in this process is a federal offense under the GCA. Making false statements in the firearms transfer process is a federal offense punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment. This also applies to misrepresentations related to licensure and benefits under the Gun Control Act, with violations carrying up to five years of imprisonment. Straw purchases can be difficult to detect, as the true intent is only revealed when the firearm is transferred to the actual buyer, who may be prohibited from owning a firearm. Straw purchases involve buying firearms for prohibited persons, leading to potential 10-year imprisonment. Illegal transfers can also occur without a paper trail, making detection challenging. Unlicensed individuals can legally buy and resell firearms as long as the recipients are not prohibited. Individuals can buy and sell firearms within the same state without needing a federal license, as long as they are not selling firearms as their primary source of income. Recipients of intrastate firearm transfers do not require federal background checks. Straw purchasers may transfer firearms to another person, but the actual buyer would only be guilty if they sponsored the purchase. Illegal arrangements are often revealed when the straw purchaser admits to buying for a non-prohibited person. The illegality may not be apparent until the actual buyer's true intent is revealed, such as selling across state lines or smuggling across borders. During the ATF Phoenix-based investigation \"Operation Fast and Furious,\" individuals made suspicious multiple cash purchases of semiautomatic firearms from the same FFL, prompting an investigation. FFLs contacted ATF about these transfers, fearing negative attention if the firearms were traced back to their businesses. FFLs have the discretion to refuse suspicious transfers. It is illegal for unlicensed individuals to transport or receive firearms across state lines or deliver firearms to unlicensed individuals in different states. Violations can result in fines and/or imprisonment. Smuggling firearms or any merchandise contrary to U.S. law is also prohibited. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Southwest Border gun trafficking cases often involve straw purchases. ATF Phoenix-based investigations, like Operation Fast and Furious, focused on large-scale straw purchasing schemes. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona faced controversy for reluctance to prosecute straw purchasing cases despite ATF investigations from 2006 to 2010. This reluctance may have been due to differing legal interpretations. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona faced controversy for reluctance to prosecute straw purchasing cases despite ATF investigations from 2006 to 2010. Federal prosecutions for straw purchasing and related offenses nationally have decreased, despite efforts to increase ATF appropriations. An ATF agent testified that current penalties are not harsh enough to deter gun trafficking to Mexican drug organizations. The statute is seen as not carrying significant jail time, and straw purchases are viewed as \"paperwork violations.\" The U.S. Attorney's Office saw a decline in prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. Sections 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A) from FY2004 to FY2010. Convictions under these provisions also decreased, with a notable drop in defendants charged under Section 922(a)(6). Despite some fluctuations, the overall trend showed a decrease in prosecutions and convictions under both provisions. During FY2004 through FY2010, individuals convicted under gun trafficking provisions received varying prison sentences, with some not receiving any prison time. The President's plan to reduce gun violence included increased penalties for gun trafficking, leading to the introduction of the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2013 (S. 54) by Senator Patrick J. Leahy. The bill was approved by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on March 7, 2013. The Senate Committee approved the Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2013 (S. 54) on March 7, 2013. The bill aimed to establish straw purchasing and gun trafficking prohibitions, increasing penalties. It would have prohibited unlicensed individuals from purchasing firearms on behalf of others, both from licensed dealers and other unlicensed individuals. The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2013 (S. 54) aimed to establish straw purchasing and gun trafficking prohibitions, increasing penalties for violations. The bill would have prohibited unlicensed individuals from purchasing firearms on behalf of prohibited persons, with violations punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment of not more than 15 years. S. 54 aimed to establish trafficking in firearms offenses under the Gun Control Act, with penalties of up to 25 years for violations. Exceptions were provided for gifts and raffles. S. 54 aimed to establish penalties for unlawful possession, trafficking, and conspiracy related to firearms, with fines and imprisonment of up to 25 years for certain offenses. S. 54 aimed to establish penalties for unlawful possession, trafficking, and conspiracy related to firearms, including increasing the penalty for unlawful transfer to a prohibited person or possession by a prohibited person to up to 15 years of imprisonment. S. 54 aimed to establish penalties for unlawful possession, trafficking, and conspiracy related to firearms. It would have made it unlawful to receive or transfer a firearm or ammunition if there was reasonable cause to believe it would be used for criminal activities. Violations would result in a fine and/or up to 25 years of imprisonment, to run consecutively with any other sentence imposed. S. 54 aimed to establish penalties for unlawful possession, trafficking, and conspiracy related to firearms. It would have increased penalties for cross-border smuggling of firearms and ammunition, with offenses punishable by a fine and/or up to 15 years of imprisonment. Additionally, it included a limitation on DOJ regarding undercover operations involving federally licensed gun dealers. S. 54 aimed to establish penalties for unlawful possession, trafficking, and conspiracy related to firearms, including cross-border smuggling. It included limitations on DOJ undercover operations involving federally licensed gun dealers, addressing ATF's conduct of Operation Fast and Furious. Senator Grassley offered an amendment to add safeguards to prevent illegal firearm purchases. The language of S. 54 was included in the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013 (S. 649), but a revised version was rejected during Senate consideration. The GOP substitute offered by Senator Grassley aimed to establish standalone straw purchasing and trafficking offenses for firearms, increasing penalties for \"lying and buying\" and illegal possession. It included changes to various sections of the U.S. Code related to firearms offenses, including a federal terrorism crime. The GOP substitute proposed federal terrorism crime and standalone gun trafficking offenses. Senator Gillibrand introduced a bill to amend the GCA for trafficking in firearms. The proposed bill, S. 179, aimed to make it unlawful for individuals to possess firearms unlawfully or facilitate such conduct. Violations would result in fines and/or up to 20 years of imprisonment, with harsher penalties for organizers. A similar bill, H.R. 452, was introduced by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney. Representative Adam Schiff reintroduced a proposal (H.R. 404) to create a two-year mandatory minimum sentence for straw purchasing, amending the GCA to penalize false statements in firearms transfer records. On February 14, 2013, Representative Peter T. King introduced a proposal (H.R. 722) to amend the GCA and create a federal offense for trafficking in firearms, punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment for certain offenses involving the sale or transfer of specified firearms. The bill introduced by Representative Peter T. King proposed creating a federal offense for trafficking in firearms, with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment for certain offenses involving the sale or transfer of specified firearms, including handguns, semiautomatic assault weapons, and machine guns. The bill did not specify whether sentences for the new gun trafficking crime would be served consecutively or concurrently with existing penalties under the Gun Control Act. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned the possession, transfer, or manufacture of semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices for 10 years. Certain firearms were listed as banned, while those legally owned before the ban were grandfathered. The ban expired in 2004. In the 113th Congress, Senator Lautenberg and Representative McCarthy introduced a bill to ban detachable magazines over 10-round capacity. Existing magazines would be grandfathered but non-transferable. Newly produced magazines would require a serial number showing post-enactment manufacture. Senator Feinstein and Representative McCarthy also introduced similar proposals titled the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013. The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 proposals (S. 150 and H.R. 437) aimed to modify the expired federal ban by banning ammunition magazines over 10-round capacity and establishing \"one military feature\" tests for semiautomatic firearms. They would also prohibit the future manufacture and importation of certain firearms and grandfather existing ones. The proposals aimed to modify the expired federal ban by banning ammunition magazines over 10-round capacity and establishing \"one military feature\" tests for semiautomatic firearms. They would require background checks for future transfers of grandfathered \"assault weapons\" and exempt over 2,200 firearms. Senator Reid included the proposals in the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, allowing Senator Feinstein to offer an \"assault weapons\" amendment. In April 2013, Senator Feinstein's proposal to amend S. 649 with a ban on high-capacity magazines was rejected by a vote of 40-60. Another amendment by Senator Blumenthal to ban production and distribution of such magazines was also rejected by a vote of 46-54. Federal law did not address open or concealed carry of firearms until 2004, but recent proposals have addressed carrying firearms on public lands. The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 allows qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms across state lines. However, this law does not override federal laws or state laws that prohibit concealed carry on private property or government property. The Credit CARD Act of 2009 also permits private individuals to carry firearms in national parks. The provision in P.L. 111-24 allows private individuals to carry firearms in national parks and wildlife refuges, following state and local laws. Congress has also considered proposals to facilitate access to federal public lands for recreational activities and prohibit the Secretary of the Army from banning firearms possession at water resources development projects. Congress has considered proposals such as Senator Cornyn's amendment to S. 649 for increased reciprocity among states with concealed carry laws. The Senate rejected the amendment by a vote of 57-43. Currently, 38 states have \"shall issue\" laws for concealed carry permits, while 10 states have more restrictive \"may issue\" laws. Some states allow concealed carry without a permit, while others require a demonstration of need. Some states allow concealed carry without a permit, while others have more restrictive laws. States vary in their reciprocity agreements, with some recognizing any state-issued permit, others allowing non-residents to apply, and some having hybrid statutes. This complex array of state laws can make it challenging for individuals to understand their legal ability to carry firearms. The Cornyn amendment aimed to simplify concealed carry laws for permit holders traveling between states, but it faced challenges due to differences in \"shall issue\" and \"may issue\" state laws. Some \"shall issue\" states impose varying concealed carry laws, such as moral character clauses, training requirements, and age restrictions. Senator John Barrasso's amendment aimed to penalize governments that disclose information on concealed carry permit holders."
