    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"School-Based Health Clinic Act of 2007\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in the findings section. The Congress finds that nearly 8.7 million children in the US lack health insurance, with adolescents aged 13 to 18 having poor health indicators. Over 70% of children needing psychiatric treatment do not receive services, and school-based health centers in 1,700 schools provide care regardless of ability to pay. 45% of children treated at these centers have no insurance. School-based health centers play a crucial role in providing primary, preventative, and mental health services to children and adolescents, with 44% enrolled in public coverage. They promote access to care for those who may struggle to see a provider and effectively decrease school absences for their target demographic. These centers leverage various funding sources to maximize resources. School-based health centers reduce school absences by identifying at-risk students, providing medication for chronic illness, and promoting parental involvement. They also lower Medicaid costs through cost-effective care. The purpose of funding these centers is to offer comprehensive primary health services. The purpose of funding school-based health centers is to provide comprehensive primary health services to medically underserved children, youth, and families, improve their physical health, emotional well-being, and academic performance, and integrate health into the school environment.

SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CLINICS are being added to Part Q of title III of the Public Health Service Act to provide comprehensive primary health services to medically underserved children, youth, and families, improving their physical health, emotional well-being, and academic performance. In this section, \"community\" includes parents, consumers, local leaders, and organizations. \"Comprehensive primary health services\" offered by school-based health clinics include physical and mental health services, with optional services like nutrition, oral health, and case management. \"Mental health services\" encompass assessments, crisis intervention, counseling, treatment, and referrals to various services including emergency psychiatric care. The term 'physical health services' includes health assessments, diagnosis, treatment of medical conditions, and referrals to specialty care. A 'school-based health clinic' is located on school property, provides primary health services to children and adolescents during school hours, and is administered by a sponsoring facility. The term 'sponsoring facility' refers to a community-based organization such as a hospital, public health department, community health center, nonprofit health care agency, school, program administered by Indian Health Service or Bureau of Indian Affairs, Native Hawaiian entity, or urban Indian program. The Secretary can award grants for school-based health clinics that meet specific requirements, including being a school-based health clinic and demonstrating local need for services. Applicants must provide evidence of meeting criteria and an assurance of providing necessary services. The clinic must ensure that school-based health clinic services are provided to children and adolescents with parental consent, collaborate with other healthcare providers, and offer on-site services. The school-based health clinic will provide on-site access during the academic day and 24-hour coverage through an on-call system. It will be integrated into the school environment, coordinating health services with school personnel and other community providers co-located at the school. The school-based health clinic will provide on-site access during the academic day and 24-hour coverage through an on-call system, integrated into the school environment. The clinic sponsoring facility assumes responsibility for administration, operations, and oversight. The Secretary may give preference to applicants serving communities with barriers to primary health care and mental health services for children and adolescents, low-scoring standardized health indicator reports, and high percentages of uninsured or underinsured children and adolescents. The school-based health clinic provides on-site access during the academic day and 24-hour coverage through an on-call system. The Secretary may waive requirements for designated periods. Funds from grants can be used for acquiring buildings, equipment, and training. The school-based health clinic can use grants for various purposes such as acquiring buildings, equipment, training, managing the clinic, paying salaries, and purchasing supplies. The amount of the grant is determined based on financial need, funding from other sources, and other relevant factors decided by the Secretary. The Secretary shall establish a program to provide technical assistance to school-based health clinics to help them meet specific requirements. This assistance may include fiscal and program management support, training, operational help, and information on available resources. Additionally, the Secretary will develop and implement an evaluation plan for clinics receiving funds. Authorization of appropriations for school-based health clinics under this section: $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, $55,000,000 for fiscal year 2010, $60,500,000 for fiscal year 2011, $66,550,000 for fiscal year 2012, and $73,200,000 for fiscal year 2013."
