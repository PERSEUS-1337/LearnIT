The report aims to evaluate DHS's risk assessment methods to prioritize security efforts effectively. The report examines DHS's risk assessment methods and the role of the Homeland Security Grant Program in reducing and mitigating risks. It focuses on how risk assessment evolves through the grant programs, aiming to influence the behavior of State and local public safety officials. The report analyzes the evolution of risk assessment from the Department of Justice to DHS, fundamental questions about risk analysis in homeland security, and possible options for Congress. It discusses strategic questions about risk, defines risk, and explores approaches for Congress regarding DHS risk assessment practices and mitigation efforts using the DHS grant tool. Background information on the grant process is necessary for understanding DHS's risk assessment methodology. The homeland security grant program's allocation in FY2004 sparked debate in states, with Wyoming receiving $14,360,000, and New York and California receiving significantly more. However, when considering per capita funding, Wyoming received $28.34 compared to New York's $4.10 and California's $3.73. The rationale behind the distribution of funds was seen as counterintuitive by many. The disbursement of homeland security funds raised concerns due to recent attacks and ongoing threats in New York and California. Stakeholders sought clarity on grant allocation methods. Risk experts agree on the universal risk of terrorism, but officials acknowledge the impossibility of fully protecting all targets. National perspective dictates the necessity of prioritizing security measures. The evolution of the DHS risk assessment methodology through the Homeland Security Grant Program aims to identify and reduce national security risks. The distribution of funds to enhance state and local governments' preparedness for terrorist acts has evolved over the last six years. Understanding the genesis and reactions to the grant program's development is crucial in comprehending the current risk evaluation methods. The evolution of the homeland security grant program's risk methodologies has been influenced by the changing understanding of 'homeland security' post-9/11. Initially focused on terrorism, the department's scope expanded to include non-terrorism threats like natural disasters. This shift has implications for how threat aspects are calculated in risk formulas for grant allocation. Criticisms have been raised regarding how risk is assessed and DHS grants are distributed. The 9/11 Commission recommended that homeland security assistance should be based on risk assessment, not general revenue sharing. Federal funding should supplement state and local resources based on the level of risk or vulnerability. Congress should avoid using the money for pork barrel projects. The Commission also questioned the criteria used to measure risk and vulnerability. The Commission report suggests developing criteria to measure risk and vulnerability for homeland security grant programs. States receiving funds should provide analysis based on these criteria. The benchmarks for evaluating threats and vulnerabilities will evolve over time. Congressional interest in risk assessment for grant programs is highlighted. The Commission report and legislative initiatives aimed to reform homeland security grant programs by shifting towards a more risk-based approach. Various bills proposed changes to reduce guaranteed allotments and allocate funding based on risk assessment criteria. Congressional efforts focused on enhancing oversight and coordination to address perceived issues with the current risk assessment process. The evolution of risk assessment methodology in homeland security from FY2001 to FY2005 involved three stages. Initially, risk was assessed based on population numbers, then shifted to include critical infrastructure considerations. This period marked a transition from the Department of Justice to DHS handling risk assessment responsibilities. From FY2004 to FY2005, risk assessment in homeland security included variables like critical infrastructure and population density, but probabilities were not a key factor. Risk was calculated as the sum of threat, critical infrastructure, and population density. From FY2006 onwards, probabilities of events were integrated into the formula, and risk assessment began to consider both assets and geographic areas. The appointment of Michael Chertoff as Secretary of DHS in February 2005 led to organizational and strategic changes within the department. Following organizational and strategic changes within DHS, Secretary Chertoff introduced a risk-based methodology for allocating federal funds. The new approach involved assessing risk using a formula that considers threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with variables now being multiplied instead of added. The FY2007 Homeland Security Grant Guidance outlines the DHS approach to risk assessment as a model developed in collaboration with other federal entities. The DHS developed a risk-based methodology for allocating federal funds, considering threat, vulnerability, and consequence as key variables. However, in FY2007, vulnerability was treated as a single variable due to difficulties in differentiation, resulting in effectively only two variables in the formula. Significant changes were made to the elements of each variable for the FY2007 process. In FY2007, the DHS implemented a risk-based methodology for allocating federal funds, with changes made to the elements of each variable. The FY2007 DHS Grant Programs Overview provided transparency into how risk is assessed, with details on weighting and data sets for vulnerability and consequence variables. Threat determination also underwent significant changes in how intelligence and investigative information was analyzed. In FY2007, DHS implemented a risk-based methodology for allocating federal funds, with changes made to how intelligence and investigative information was analyzed. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis conducted a historical analysis of threats to UASI cities from 9/11 to FY2007. Cities were categorized into four tiers based on threat level, but only federal intelligence was considered, not state or local information. The establishment of State and local fusion centers may assist in incorporating relevant threat information into federal risk analysis efforts. Concerns arise regarding the transparency and evolution of the DHS risk assessment process, grant allotments, and risk mitigation responsibilities. The additional information provided in FY2007 aims to enhance understanding of the data and assessment process for DHS grant applicants. Some critics question the effectiveness of the new risk assessment methodology adopted by DHS in FY2006. Concerns exist about the continuous changes hindering the establishment of a baseline for national risks. However, others see the changes as a positive step towards improving the risk assessment process, suggesting that as DHS's understanding of risk evolves, the methodology will stabilize and provide a solid foundation for decision-making. Future changes to the risk-based formula should consider eliminating certain elements according to homeland security observers. Future changes to the risk-based formula for distributing funds to state and local communities should consider eliminating guaranteed funding minimums to all states and municipalities. Some argue that maintaining a minimal level of funds for all states could help address vulnerabilities, while others believe that distributing funds without considering risk levels will impair the capabilities of high-risk cities. Since its inception, DHS's risk-based formula for distributing funds to state and local communities has been a source of frustration for federal, state, and local governments. Some suggest that grant levels may not continue to increase due to U.S. budget concerns. As at-risk jurisdictions address vulnerabilities, they may require less federal funding. Table 1 outlines the evolution of the DHS grant and risk assessment formula from FY2001 to FY2007. This information can inform the ongoing congressional debate on risk assessment in homeland security. The overview of risk assessment in homeland security highlights questions on measuring risk and allocation of grants based on risk and vulnerability. Former Congressman Lee Hamilton suggested using historical data for resource allocation in homeland security spending. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of considering broader questions and a more anticipatory approach in risk assessment for homeland security. It mentions the need to address key questions such as resource allocation based on risk, estimating terrorism risk, and identifying tolerable levels of risk. Additionally, it raises the fundamental question of where the risk originates from. The curr_chunk discusses the need for DHS to refine its risk-based approach for awarding first responder grants and incorporating unique data from state and local officials into the threat element of risk assessment. It questions the sources of risk, whether it is from acts of terrorism or a broader \"all-hazards\" approach, and emphasizes the importance of securing areas and assets that represent the greatest vulnerability to the public. The curr_chunk highlights the underdeveloped methodology for incorporating data into threat assessment at the federal level. It suggests that state and local intelligence fusion centers could aggregate data for federal use in threat assessment, impacting grant allocation based on risk assessment models. The DHS guidance outlines the purpose of UASI, LETPP, and SHSP programs, which provide funds for state and local governments to prepare, protect, respond, and recover from acts of terrorism. The MMRS and CCP grants focus on post-event response preparedness. The DHS Inspector General emphasizes the need for sound risk management principles in catastrophe preparation. The DHS guidance emphasizes the importance of sound risk management principles in preparing for and responding to acts of terrorism and natural disasters. It is essential to measure relative risk, draft a strategy to reduce it, and allocate homeland security grants based on historical effectiveness in reducing risk. Approximately $12 billion has been provided to state and local governments by DHS from September 11, 2001, through FY2008 for this purpose. The DHS has provided $12 billion to state and local governments for preparing and responding to terrorist attacks and disasters. There is a lack of established methodology to assess the rate of return on this investment, hindering the evaluation of risk reduction. DHS is planning to assess the impact of grants on risk reduction but faces constraints in resources and methodology. Currently, DHS uses a method of assessing, measuring, and ranking relative risk due to the complexity of defining, assessing, and managing risk. The DHS differentiates between asset-based risk and geographic-based risk to allocate resources effectively for risk reduction. Risk calculations must be relative due to the dynamic nature of temporal valuations. DHS moved from a risk-like approach to a more probabilistic method of assessing risk in FY2006. Risk analysis includes risk assessment, characterization, communication, management, and policy. It aims to inform decision-making on measures to mitigate risks. Risk management is a continuous process of identifying, measuring, evaluating risks, designing and implementing countermeasures, and monitoring their performance. Feedback loops are used to improve countermeasures and consider tradeoffs between risk acceptance and avoidance. Risk assessment involves quantifying identified risks and assessing the probability and severity of adverse events. It considers threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, ranking risks and establishing priorities for countermeasures. While well-developed in industries like insurance and finance, risk management is still relatively immature in homeland security. Risk assessment and management in homeland security and counterterrorism fields are more complex than in industrial applications. While financial loss is a factor, threats to human health and national missions are equally important. DHS emphasizes the need to consider historical data for risk assessment, noting that terrorism databases are less robust. Risk assessment in homeland security and counterterrorism involves subjective judgment of experts due to limited data sources. Risk can be \"inherited\" from one candidate to another, such as from a port to the city and state it is located in. DHS uses mathematical techniques to control for unique factors, but assessing risk in this context is complex due to various complicating factors. Risk assessment in homeland security and counterterrorism involves defining risks at a micro level, considering dynamic nature of terrorist threats and the challenge of determining an acceptable level of risk. Secretary Chertoff acknowledges the need to accept some level of risk but the threshold for managing risk with federal resources remains undefined. The level of risk in homeland security and counterterrorism is not clearly defined, making it challenging to allocate federal resources effectively. Understanding the interdependence of risk elements is crucial, requiring sophisticated analysis. Stochastic and sensitivity tests can help determine the relationships between variables. The Department of Homeland Security's approach to vulnerability and consequence weighting may limit the effectiveness of risk reduction measures. The importance of identifying primary risk drivers and collecting appropriate data to quantify risks is crucial in homeland security. Allocating resources based on the vulnerability of assets and the potential consequences of an attack is essential for effective risk reduction measures. Data deficiencies should be recognized and controlled for in calculating risk to ensure meaningful and defensible results. Reducing a variable value to zero or one based on data collection difficulties should be temporary as it leads to inaccurate risk assessments. Confidence in data used for decision-making is crucial. Resource allocation based solely on population figures may not always be effective as population density and economic impact vary. Striking a balance between simple and complex risk assessment methodologies is important. The appropriate balance between simple and complex risk assessment methodologies is crucial in the dynamic context of counterterrorism. A long-term risk assessment strategy implemented by a dedicated government center could help achieve this balance. Flexibility in managing risk is necessary due to uncertainties, and historical data on terrorist attacks in the US can inform resource allocation decisions. Risk assessment and management play a crucial role in resource allocation to mitigate risks. Historical attack patterns, informed by reliable intelligence, are essential indicators for assessing risks. Various factors drive risk, and understanding these factors is key to effective risk management. The terms associated with risk assessment have unique meanings, and the most recent data is included in the FY 2007 Homeland Security Grant Program guidelines. Risk assessment at the Federal level involves using a model developed by DHS and other entities, which considers threat, vulnerability, and consequence. DHS distinguishes between asset-based risk, which analyzes an adversary's intent and capability to attack different types of assets, and geographically-based risk, which considers characteristics of a geographic area independent of specific assets. The DHS formula for assessing risk involves threat, vulnerability, and consequence. This formula is central to DHS activities and grant programs, as Secretary Chertoff has stated. It is important to define these variables for a common understanding of the lexicon. The DHS formula for assessing risk involves threat, vulnerability, and consequence. State and local agencies must understand how DHS defines these elements to gather appropriate data for risk assessment. Various DHS elements like the U.S. Coast Guard and HITRAC are responsible for risk analysis and management. HITRAC combines intelligence threat data with DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis assesses threat data and infrastructure vulnerabilities. The threat of enemy attack is determined by studying enemy intent and capability, matching their intentions with their capabilities. This approach helps in understanding terrorists' goals, plans, and desires, and relies on information from the intelligence community and lessons learned from overseas attacks. The DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis assesses threat data and infrastructure vulnerabilities by studying enemy intent and capability. DHS headquarters has adopted a risk methodology, but its pervasiveness outside headquarters is unclear. Assessing risk from manmade actions is challenging due to subjective assessments of enemy capabilities and intentions. Congress has various approaches to consider for translating risk assessments into targeted allocations of funds. An effective risk assessment tool is needed to manage risk, recognizing that risk cannot be eliminated. Quantifying terrorism risk to the U.S. requires sound data, a well-thought-out formula, and consistent methodology application. Clarity and consistency are crucial for influencing state and local partners' behavior in responding to terrorist attacks. Congress has options to consider regarding DHS's risk methodology efforts. Some argue for maintaining current DHS risk assessment methodologies for HSGP allocations, citing the lack of historical effectiveness measures for grant programs. Others suggest that state and local governments, with over $12 billion invested in risk reduction and preparedness, should be capable of negotiating financial burden-sharing for future support. A national assessment of how allocated funds for preventing terrorist attacks or responding to disasters have been spent, but there is no evaluation of how much risk has been reduced. Questions remain about the effectiveness of investments, measuring capabilities against risk, identifying capability gaps, and targeting resources efficiently. A defensible methodology is needed to define and measure risk, track capability development, and identify gaps for future homeland security funding allocation. The methodology for assessing homeland security grants aims to identify capability gaps and allocate resources efficiently. By disclosing the mathematical equation used to determine threat, vulnerability, and consequence, stakeholders can confirm or challenge results before funds are allocated. This level of detail may enhance understanding and improve resource targeting. Allowing transparency in the methodology and equation used for assessing homeland security grants may have risks such as potential reverse-engineering by attackers. However, it could also lead to increased information sharing between DHS and state/local governments, improving resource allocation and confidence in the system. The Department of Homeland Security's risk formula has evolved since its establishment in 2003, but the lack of a coherent, long-term risk strategy could have negative repercussions. A clearly articulated risk methodology based on fundamentals is essential for buying down risk and adapting to changing threats. The Department of Homeland Security's risk assessment process may be vulnerable to budget fluctuations and political influence due to a lack of a coherent, long-term risk strategy. A structured, systematic approach to risk is crucial for meaningful and useful results in homeland security risk management. A structured, systematic approach to risk management is essential for effective homeland security. Common definitions and standards are necessary across all levels of government to ensure a cohesive risk strategy. Collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies is crucial for a comprehensive national-wide risk assessment process. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may create a Risk Assessment Manager (RAM) position to enhance risk assessment efforts and develop a department-wide strategic risk strategy. The RAM would coordinate inter-departmental risk methodology activities and serve as a single point of accountability for explaining future risk management strategies. This position could provide guidance to the Secretary and oversee a permanent DHS Risk Assessment Center. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is considering creating a Risk Advisory Board (RAB) consisting of senior-level risk management professionals to advise the Secretary on refining risk management activities. This board would not have program management responsibilities but would provide expert advice on risk assessment strategies. The Risk Advisory Board (RAB) would advise the Secretary on risk management practices and draft a long-term strategy for DHS. Current efforts may lack resources for proactive risk assessment, data collection, and analysis of past investments' impact on risk. A dedicated group of methodologists may be needed for these complex tasks. A risk center is proposed to be formed within DHS, with a group of professional methodologists solely focused on risk assessment. This center would enhance strategic thinking, develop more effective assessment tools, and leverage expertise from various offices and external entities. The 9/11 Commission recommended that homeland security assistance should be based strictly on risk assessment, not general revenue sharing. Some argue that after significant investments, states should have reached a minimal level of security. There is a debate on revisiting the USA PATRIOT Act formula for DHS grant funding allocation. Some argue that altering the formula for homeland security grants may be premature without a methodology to assess how past allocations have impacted state risk levels. Questions include the intended duration of Congress for DOJ and DHS grants, oversight on resource spending, and discussions on sustainable burden-sharing arrangements. Chertoff emphasized the importance of prevention in homeland security, particularly through intelligence and early warning systems. However, less than 1% of the U.S. government's homeland security budget is allocated to intelligence and warning. While response capabilities are similar for terrorist attacks and natural disasters, only terrorist acts can be prevented. Intelligence for national security differs from meteorological information. The importance of prevention in homeland security, particularly through intelligence and early warning systems, is emphasized. Terrorist threats are dynamic and evolve over time, requiring an agile risk assessment methodology. DHS has an Intelligence Enterprise Strategic Plan and grant guidance for intelligence fusion centers, but the linkages between these documents and the grant process may be considered tenuous. Congress may recommend that DHS provide a specific strategy for terrorism prevention. The importance of prevention in homeland security, particularly through intelligence and early warning systems, is emphasized. Congress may recommend that DHS provide a specific strategy for terrorism prevention, focusing on leveraging intelligence across levels of government to prevent terrorist acts."
