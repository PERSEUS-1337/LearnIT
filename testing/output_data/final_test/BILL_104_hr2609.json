AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF INDEBTEDNESS OF BUREAU OF RECLAMATION PROJECTS IN TEXAS. The Secretary will make an agreement with the current contracting party or a Texas public agency within six months for the purchase of projects.

When the purchase price is paid, the Secretary will convey all rights to the State of Texas or its public agency for the land and improvements of the project. Upon completion of full payment, the State of Texas assumes liability for operation and maintenance of the purchased project. The United States will ensure the project is delivered in a safe and functional condition.
