    "content": "The Act is titled \"State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act\". It includes the \"State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II Act of 2001\" and outlines findings and purposes. The findings of Congress highlight the impact of federal policies on illegal immigration and criminal alien activity along the southwest border. Reimbursement for the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens has increased for local jurisdictions, but remains insufficient in fiscal year 2000. Certain counties near the border face financial challenges due to these issues. The four Arizona counties located on the border with Mexico, Pima, Yuma, Santa Cruz, and Cochise, face a disproportionate impact from criminal illegal aliens. In 1999, these counties accounted for 11% of alien crossings and nearly 40% of illegal alien apprehensions along the border, despite only having a combined population of 1.1 million, or 17.5% of the total population along the U.S.-Mexico border. In 1999, Santa Cruz County spent $1,978,863 (33%) and Cochise County spent $4.6 million (32%) to process criminal illegal aliens, with over half not reimbursed by Federal funds. In Texas, border counties bore unreimbursed costs for criminal aliens in county jails, while nonborder counties also incurred similar expenses. The state has faced substantial additional burdens. The State of Texas incurred unreimbursed costs for law enforcement efforts due to criminal illegal aliens. The Federal Government should reimburse States for related costs, including the imprisonment of illegal aliens. The purpose of the title is to provide financial assistance to States and local communities for expenditures related to illegal juvenile aliens and to ensure equitable treatment for affected States and local governments. Local governments affected by Federal policies on curbing illegal immigration and criminal alien activity on the Southwest border of the United States. Reimbursement of states for indirect costs related to the incarceration of illegal aliens. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include reimbursement for indirect costs related to the imprisonment of illegal aliens or Cuban nationals convicted of a felony by the state. Indirect costs now include court costs, county attorney costs, detention costs, criminal proceedings expenditures, indigent defense, and unsupervised probation costs. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to authorize $200,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 to carry out specific subsections. SEC. 104. REIMBURSEMENT OF STATES FOR COSTS OF INCARCERATING JUVENILE ALIENS. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions regarding juvenile aliens who have been adjudicated delinquent or committed to a correctional facility by a State or locality. The term 'juvenile alien' is defined as an alien who meets these criteria. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include reporting on illegal juvenile aliens committed to State or local juvenile correctional facilities for specific offenses. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to include reporting on illegal juvenile aliens committed to State or local juvenile correctional facilities for specific offenses, including juveniles covered under section 501. SEC. 105 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 is amended to provide reimbursement to states bordering Mexico or Canada for emergency health services furnished to undocumented aliens. Reimbursements will be allotted with special consideration for border states or areas with a high number of undocumented aliens relative to the general population. In fiscal years 2002 through 2005, $200,000,000 is available for allotments to certain States for payments related to undocumented aliens. The Secretary will calculate allotments for the 17 States with the highest number of undocumented aliens based on the ratio of the State's undocumented alien population to the total population. The amount of allotment to a State for a fiscal year not paid out under subsection (c) is available for payment in the subsequent fiscal year. The number of undocumented aliens in a State is determined based on estimates prepared by the Statistics Division of the Immigration and Naturalization Service as of October 1992. The Secretary shall pay amounts to each State for a fiscal year as described in a State plan submitted to the Secretary. The payments will be made to local governments, hospitals, and providers of emergency health services to undocumented aliens. The payments will take into account the eligible entities' payments for emergency medical services under the approved State plan or an alternative proxy for measuring the volume of emergency health services. The government will measure the volume of emergency health services provided to undocumented aliens by local governments, hospitals, and related providers. Special consideration will be given to entities in counties bordering Mexico or Canada, or areas with a high concentration of undocumented aliens. Providers offering emergency health services to hospitals are considered \"related.\" The provider offers emergency health services to individuals, not duplicating payments made under title XIX of the Social Security Act. Definitions include \"hospital,\" \"provider,\" and \"Secretary.\" The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the term \"State\" refers to the 50 States and the District of Columbia. $200,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2005 for this section."
