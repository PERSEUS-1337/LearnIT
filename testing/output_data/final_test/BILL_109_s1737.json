    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iranian Nuclear Trade Prohibition Act of 2005\". Congress finds that Iran has received assistance for its nuclear program, aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons under the guise of civilian power, and expresses concern over Iran's support for terrorism and aggressive behavior towards US allies in the Middle East. Iran previously promised to suspend uranium enrichment but failed to uphold this commitment. In November 2004, Iran agreed to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities as part of the Paris Agreement with EU-3 countries. The EU-3 supported the US in taking Iran's nuclear program to the UN Security Council if Iran resumed its nuclear activities. In line with the agreement, the US dropped its opposition to Iran's application to join the World Trade Organization. Iran is seeking to join the World Trade Organization and allow the licensing of spare parts for its commercial aircraft. The uranium enrichment program in Iran is dispersed, protected, and mobile. The Parliament passed a resolution for Iran to resume developing nuclear fuel to generate electricity. Russia has agreed to provide nuclear fuel to Iran's Bushehr reactor for 10 years. Iran has pledged to return spent fuel to Russia for storage. Russia's nuclear fuel market is closed to outside competition. Iran is the fourth-largest oil producer with plans to invest in natural gas production and increase crude oil production. Congress believes countries should choose between trading with state sponsors of terrorism or maintaining good trade relations with the US. The Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 is amended to prohibit the entry of nuclear fuel assemblies to the United States. The President is required to prohibit the US from buying nuclear fuel assemblies from entities that sell to Iran, with a waiver possible for national security reasons after notifying Congress. The definition of nuclear fuel assemblies excludes low-enriched uranium. The term 'low-enriched uranium' refers to a product made from blended down weapons-grade and highly-enriched uranium provided by the Russian entity Techsnabexport in cooperation with the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. Required congressional committees include specific committees from the Senate and House of Representatives."
