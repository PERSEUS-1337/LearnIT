    "content": "The Energy Information Administration categorizes natural gas consumers into five groups: residential, commercial, electric power generation, industrial, and vehicle fuel. Industrial demand for natural gas has been the largest but has shown a decreasing trend, unlike other categories which have seen increased demand due to benefits like domestic supply security and competitive prices. The decline in industrial demand has implications for U.S. jobs, trade balances, and overall economic performance. The development of nonconventional natural gas resources, such as shale gas, has increased reserve estimates in the U.S., potentially providing a 100-year supply at current consumption rates. Despite declining prices, industrial demand for natural gas has decreased, impacting industries like nitrogen-based fertilizer production. The demand for natural gas has been relatively stable over the past decade, with electric power generation increasing by 32.6% and industrial usage declining by 23.4%. This has resulted in a relatively stable aggregate demand, with data for natural gas consumption from 2000-2009 presented in Table 1. EIA data for 2010 shows total consumption at 19.4 tcf for the first 10 months. In 2010, total natural gas consumption was 19.4 tcf, showing an increase from 2009 and 2008. Industrial demand for natural gas in the first 10 months of 2010 was 5.4 tcf, higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008. Despite a doubling in the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel from 2000 to 2009, it still only accounts for a fraction of total U.S. consumption. U.S. natural gas production remained stable from 2000 to 2009, averaging 19.2 tcf annually with minor deviations. Domestic production and imports data are shown in Table 3. Domestic natural gas production in the first 10 months of 2010 was 17.8 tcf, compared to 17.2 tcf in 2009 and 16.7 tcf in 2008. Imports decreased as domestic production expanded its market share. Most imports come from Canada through pipelines, with some LNG from Trinidad and Tobago. The total production and imports exceed the gas delivered to consumers, with the excess used for re-pressuring pipelines and other purposes. Data from 2008 and 2009 suggest that U.S. production may eventually displace imports. The data shows that natural gas production in the U.S. is increasing, potentially displacing imports in the future. Prices in the natural gas markets have fluctuated, with residential consumers facing the highest prices due to small-volume usage and seasonal demand patterns. Commercial and industrial consumers also play a significant role in natural gas consumption. Industrial consumers of natural gas numbered over 5 million in 2009, with relatively constant demand throughout the year. The decisions for consumer demand are based on prices, while exploration and production decisions are based on wellhead prices. Fluctuations in wellhead prices have impacted exploration and development, leading to rising or depressed prices in the market. The U.S. natural gas reserves, including conventional and nonconventional deposits like shale gas and coal bed methane, are currently well-supplied with low prices. This may lead to increased industrial demand in the future. Demand for natural gas is expected to rise in the future due to its various industrial applications. It is used as a raw material for products like fertilizers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals, as well as in the production of chemicals. Natural gas also serves as a heat source for industrial processes and is used for fueling incineration and in compressing stations for oil and gas production. The decline in industrial natural gas demand is influenced by various factors, with structural changes in the U.S. GDP composition playing a significant role. Energy consumption per dollar of GDP has been decreasing over time, impacting the demand for natural gas in industrial processes. The economy is shifting towards a more service-oriented industry, leading to increased energy efficiency in heavy industry for cost and environmental reasons. The industrial demand for natural gas may shift due to changes in energy sources used by industry. This could either increase or decrease demand for natural gas in various industries. As industries consolidate, factors like cost-cutting and efficiency become important. Consolidation through merger and acquisition in industries can lead to increased efficiency and cost-cutting measures. Efficient natural gas technologies may replace older, less energy-efficient technologies, increasing demand for natural gas in industrial applications. However, high upfront capital investment costs for these technologies can be a barrier, especially for firms involved in recent mergers or acquisitions. The output levels of newly combined firms post-merger can impact energy demand, with industrial demand likely to be proportional to output levels. Industrial demand for natural gas may be affected by the availability of electricity as a substitute. The decision of industrial consumers on energy sources depends on costs and supply reliability. Even if some consumers switch to electricity, a portion of natural gas demand will remain. The industrial demand for natural gas may shift to the electricity generating category due to the use of natural gas in generating turbines. Future environmental regulations could impact industrial demand for natural gas, but its cleaner-burning nature may give it an advantage. This could potentially increase industrial demand for natural gas. Future environmental regulations may impact industrial demand for natural gas by encouraging substitution of natural gas for other fuels. However, some industrial processes may not meet tighter regulations efficiently and could move production overseas to nations with lax regulatory monitoring. This could decrease U.S. industrial demand for natural gas. Carbon reduction regulations could lead firms to invest in new, clean-burning natural gas equipment. Industrial prices for natural gas were high in the 2000s, peaking in 2008, and moderating in 2009 and 2010. Rising natural gas prices are likely to contribute to reduced industrial demand. Rising natural gas prices may lead to reduced industrial demand, depending on economic factors like macroeconomic activity, investment in energy-efficient technologies, and fuel switching. Industrial consumers may struggle to pass on cost increases to final consumers, especially if facing competition from imported goods not affected by higher natural gas costs. The regional nature of the natural gas market limits price movement between regions, impacting industrial demand. One way domestic industrial consumers may react to lower-cost international competition is by closing domestic facilities and moving production overseas to take advantage of lower gas prices in other regions. Another strategy could be acquiring domestic competitors and closing inefficient operating units to reduce costs and expand production capacity. International trade between regional markets could help equalize world natural gas prices, but existing trade is limited to costly liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts. The LNG trade is mostly done through long-term contracts and is of a small volume in the North American market. Pipeline imports must be price competitive with domestically produced supply. Industrial natural gas producers may not be able to pass cost increases to consumers if demand is price elastic. Firms with elastic demand are more likely to pursue acquisition or foreign production strategies. The effects of higher natural gas prices on industrial demand depend on the substitutability of natural gas, cost structure, and fuel switching feasibility. Economic recession likely impacted industrial demand for natural gas. The economic recession starting in December 2007 affected natural gas demand, especially in industrial sectors like fertilizer production. Declining demand for goods led to reduced natural gas consumption, despite increasing domestic reserves and production. The recession also saw a trend towards greater energy efficiency, further decreasing natural gas usage. The fertilizer industry, led by four major firms, consumes a significant amount of natural gas for ammonia production. Between 1999 and 2008, U.S. production capacity and annual production of ammonia declined, leading to increased imports to meet growing demand for fertilizers. Imports of natural gas increased by 383% from 2 million tons to 9.7 million tons between 1999 and 2008. The industry stabilized in 2009 with production capacity, total production, and imports remaining at similar levels as in 2008. Capacity utilization increased over the 10-year period, with consolidation in the industry leading to more efficient operations. Imports mainly came from Trinidad and Tobago, Canada, Russia, and the Middle East, all natural gas exporters with excess production. Trinidad and Tobago were expected to be a major player in North American LNG supply, but the growth potential was reduced by the emergence of unconventional natural gas resources in the United States. The United States' natural gas market growth was hindered by its own resources, while Qatar emerged as a major player in LNG. Imports of nitrogen fertilizers increased significantly from various countries with large natural gas reserves, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, and Russia. These nations export gas in the form of LNG or gas-based products, facing price competition from imports due to high natural gas prices. The high natural gas prices affecting industries facing price competition from imports and where gas is a significant production cost. The strategy of reducing domestic production capacity through mergers and acquisitions has been observed in the fertilizer industry. The industry's rebound depends on various factors, despite an increase in domestic gas supplies. Domestic gas prices are expected to be lower than in the past but may not compete with exporting nations like Russia and Qatar. Price may not be a major incentive for the US industry. The nitrogen fertilizer industry in the United States faces challenges due to high production costs and environmental concerns. Production is easier in nations like Trinidad and Tobago and Russia due to lax regulations. This leads to the industry remaining offshore, impacting the US trade balance and employment. The future of the industry depends on factors like consumer expectations, changing prices, regulations, and competitive conditions. The industrial demand for natural gas sector has declined and consolidated, with a migration of natural gas consuming industries to other countries and an increase in imports of manufactured goods. The changing market for natural gas, with the promise of greater supply and lower prices, may impact these trends. Business conditions are likely to remain attractive overseas, while the domestic natural gas market becomes more appealing for consumers."
