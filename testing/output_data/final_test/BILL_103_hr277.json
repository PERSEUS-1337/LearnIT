    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act\" and requires a waiting period before the purchase of a handgun. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires a waiting period for handgun purchases. An amendment to Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, prohibits licensed dealers from selling handguns to unlicensed individuals without proper verification and documentation. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act mandates a waiting period for handgun purchases, with licensed dealers required to verify the transferee's eligibility before selling a handgun. The transferee must provide a statement to the chief law enforcement officer of their residence, and if no legal violations are flagged within 7 days, the transfer can proceed. The transferee must provide a written statement from the chief law enforcement officer stating a threat to life, possess a valid handgun permit issued within 5 years, and comply with state laws for handgun possession. The State law requires a permit for handgun possession, issued only after verification by an authorized official. The law also mandates a waiting period of at least 7 days before transferring a handgun to an unlicensed individual. The law mandates verification by an authorized official to ensure possession of a handgun is not in violation of the law. Additionally, a report from a felon identification system must indicate no violation of laws for the transfer to proceed. The transferee must provide valid identification with a photograph, confirm they are not under indictment or convicted of certain crimes, not a fugitive, not a drug user, not mentally defective, not committed to a mental institution, and not an illegal alien. The transferee must provide valid identification and confirm they meet certain criteria, including not being an illegal alien, dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, or having renounced US citizenship. The transferor must immediately report any violations of law regarding the handgun transfer to the chief law enforcement officer. Any transferor who receives non-public information in a report under this subsection must not disclose it except to the transferee, law enforcement, or as directed by a court. The transferor must retain a copy of the transferee's statement and evidence of compliance with the law. The chief law enforcement officer must review the statement within 30 days to ensure compliance with laws. The officer must destroy any record of the transferee's statement within 30 days. The term 'chief law enforcement officer' refers to specific individuals. The subsection does not apply to firearm sales in certain circumstances. The Secretary is responsible for ensuring the dissemination of this subsection to dealers and the public. A handgun is defined as a firearm designed to be held and fired with a single hand. The amendment prohibits the assembly of firearms from parts and imposes a penalty of a fine up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to one year for violations. The effective date of the amendments is 90 days after enactment."
