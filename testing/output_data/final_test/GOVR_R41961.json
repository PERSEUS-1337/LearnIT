The National Research Council identified various issues, including efficacy, efficiency, and equity. This report addresses FAQs on fiscal challenges, with recommendations and legislation examples from the 112th Congress. The FAQs are categorized into Appropriations and Backlog. The Army Corps of Engineers manages federal water resources infrastructure in the US, dealing with funding challenges. FAQs on fiscal challenges are categorized into Appropriations, Backlog, Authorizations, and Navigation Trust Funds. The Corps budget funds various activities including dam operations, harbor maintenance, waterway management, and levee construction. Recommendations from government and expert reports are provided to address issues raised in the appropriations FAQs. The Army Corps of Engineers manages federal water resources infrastructure in the US, dealing with funding challenges. They have constructed over 11,750 miles of levees to manage flooding and undertake environmental restoration activities in areas like the Florida Everglades and the Columbia River. Annual Corps appropriations are part of the Energy and Water Development bill, organized by budget account. The Administration presents the budget request to Congress by account, focusing on navigation, flood control, and ecosystem/environment projects. The FY2010 Corps appropriation prioritized funding based on performance metrics for flood, coastal storm damage prevention, navigation, and other business lines like ecosystem restoration. Construction and Operations and Maintenance accounts were mainly focused on flood-related investments in FY2010. The Corps' budget allocation for various business lines has been relatively flat for two decades, with congressional appropriations consistently exceeding executive branch requests. Despite a nominal increase in budget since 1986, the real value has only seen a 10% rise from 1990 to 2010, indicating limited purchasing power due to inflation. The Corps' budget allocation has been relatively flat for two decades, with appropriations not reflecting inflation for construction and services. Supplemental funds are often used for flood control infrastructure and navigation channels, with significant increases in appropriations in recent years, especially through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Corps received supplemental appropriations in FY2007, FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2011, no supplemental appropriations were received, but previously provided funds were used for projects like hurricane storm damage protection in Louisiana. Congress uses continuing resolutions to fund operations when an annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is not enacted at the start of a fiscal year. The Corps has operated under short-term and long-term CRs in recent years. The Corps receives funds for authorized activities based on criteria set by the Corps and OMB. Recent criteria prioritize ongoing projects with high benefit-cost ratios and large-scale ecosystem restoration projects. Congress requires project-level funding information for review. Corps funding is often debated in relation to earmarks and is subject to disclosure rules. The 112th Congress, House and Senate Republican Conferences, and Senate Appropriations Committee have all imposed moratoriums on earmark requests, impacting how Congress directs agency activities. Congressional earmarks have historically funded a significant portion of Corps activities, with Congress adding an average of $533 million annually to the Corps budget from 2000 to 2010 for specific projects. This adjustment reflects Congress's perception of the President's budget request. Congress adjusts the President's budget request for water resources, with earmark opponents viewing geographically specific projects as bypassing performance-based budgeting. Earmark moratoriums are changing Corps appropriations by funding broad categories instead of specific projects, leading to reduced funding for historically supported projects in recent fiscal years. The Administration's budget proposal lacks support for certain projects, such as those with low benefit-cost ratios and projects outside of Corps mission areas. Earmark moratoriums limit congressional funding direction, leading to altered funding levels for some projects. Congress funds broad categories of Corps projects, giving the agency discretion in project selection. Earmark moratoriums also impact Corps authorizations and may contribute to deauthorization of activities. Development Acts (WRDAs) are omnibus bills that historically include provisions for site-specific activities. The consideration of WRDA 2010 (H.R. 5892) in the House was affected by a moratorium on congressional earmarks in 2010. The decline in congressionally directed spending may lead to more authorized projects being deauthorized. The Corps received less funding in FY2011 compared to FY2010. In FY2011, the Corps received less funding overall compared to FY2010, with most business lines experiencing a decrease in funding. Coastal Flood Damage Reduction was the only business line to see an increase in funding. There were significant differences in how appropriations were enacted and implemented between FY2010 and FY2011, including issues with continuing resolutions and earmark moratoriums. Despite receiving less funding in FY2011, the Corps continued to receive more funding from Congress than requested in the President's budget. The President's budget for FY2011 showed a different trend compared to most agencies, with reductions in funding. The Corps received $1 million for environmental infrastructure projects, a significant decrease from the $140 million in FY2010. The FY2011 work plan allocation by the Corps may change due to emergency operations funding needed for flooding in 2011. Money is being shifted from planned activities to emergency operations. The Corps in FY2011 work plan authorized by Congress to assist in emergency operations for flood fighting and repair efforts. The Corps operates the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) to fund repair of flood control works damaged by natural events. Funding for flood fighting and repair generally comes from supplemental appropriations in the agency's FCCE account. Annual appropriations for FCCE account are minimal or non-existent. The FCCE account receives minimal annual appropriations, with recent budget requests proposing funding for flood fighting preparedness activities. Congress has not appropriated these funds, giving the Secretary of the Army discretion to transfer money for emergency work. The Corps has used funds from ongoing projects for emergency actions due to significant flooding in FY2011. The impact on non-emergency projects depends on the duration and level of funds used for emergency operations and repairs. The Corps has received significant supplemental appropriations since 2001, primarily for flood fighting and recovery efforts. Roughly $15 billion was provided after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for repair and improved storm damage protection in Louisiana and Mississippi. Recommendations for project prioritization improvements were made by the National Academy of Public Administration. The Corps backlog and project delivery FAQs discuss the agency's construction and maintenance backlog, factors contributing to backlog expansion, and expert recommendations for addressing it. Estimates of the backlog vary widely depending on project categories. Congress requested a fiscal transparency report in 2007, but it was never funded. The Corps construction backlog, totaling over $62 billion, includes active projects funded by the President's budget or congressional appropriations. This backlog consists of $60 billion for ongoing projects and $2 billion for authorized projects that are no longer active or deferred. It encompasses dam safety, rehabilitation, and repair projects, as well as aging infrastructure investments. The Corps construction backlog estimate exceeds $62 billion, with $60 billion for ongoing projects and $2 billion for authorized projects no longer active. The backlog includes dam safety, rehabilitation, and repair projects, reflecting unmet nonfederal expectations and funding inefficiencies. Frustration arises from uncertainty in project completion and shared costs with nonfederal sponsors. The Corps construction backlog, totaling over $62 billion, consists of flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration projects. Stakeholders have varying opinions on how to address the backlog, with some advocating for increased funding, while others suggest reducing authorized activities or streamlining project completion processes. The Corps construction backlog, totaling over $62 billion, includes flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration projects. Some view the backlog as a reason for pursuing private sector involvement and alternative federal financing for water resources infrastructure. The Corps also has a maintenance backlog, with no current estimate available. Factors contributing to backlog growth include authorizations outpacing appropriations and significant additional work needed for Corps facilities. Funding for Corps coastal navigation O&M in the FY2012 budget request was $2.2 billion below identified potential work. The Corps construction backlog, totaling over $62 billion, includes flood damage reduction and ecosystem restoration projects. Factors contributing to backlog growth include authorizations outpacing appropriations, aging infrastructure requiring more financial investments, and rapid increases in construction costs. For example, 32% of the FY2010 budget request was for dam safety investments. The Corps of Engineers has faced cost overruns in projects, with some exceeding initial estimates. Since 2007, they have implemented guidelines to assess cost and schedule risks in feasibility studies, but only the preferred alternative is usually analyzed. Some projects have seen rapid cost increases, such as dam safety and levee construction projects. Risk analysis is being conducted for multiple alternatives at the individual project level by the Corps of Engineers. A program-wide study to address cost and schedule growth has not been done, but case studies have been used to identify factors contributing to cost growth, such as changes during construction, inaccurate cost estimates, and insufficient federal funding. Data availability to address these issues is limited for some types of Corps projects. The 2007 National Academy of Public Administration report provided recommendations on the Corps budgeting process, addressing backlog and project schedule growth. Corps projects have unique requirements due to being a federal agency, such as compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates. The FAQs on Corps authorization and missions discuss the processes for authorization and deauthorization of activities. The Corps requires congressional authorization for its activities, typically through a Water Resources Development Act. This authorization process is crucial for federal appropriations eligibility and often involves a nonfederal cost-share partner for studies and projects. Congress authorizes Corps construction projects based on feasibility studies recommended by the Chief of Engineers. Some projects are handed over to nonfederal sponsors for operations, while others are maintained by the Corps. Operations for Corps-operated projects are authorized as part of the congressional construction process. The Corps projects are authorized by Congress based on feasibility studies recommended by the Chief of Engineers. Congressional discretion drives the authorization process for Corps studies and projects, with Congress choosing which authorizations are included in legislative vehicles. The appropriations process has selected from an increasing pool of authorized activities, with the rate of construction authorization outpacing available appropriations in recent decades. Congress declared in 1936 that the benefits of Corps projects should exceed their costs, leading to benefit-cost analysis for economic development projects. The Corps follows benefit-cost analysis to determine project recommendations based on economic development benefits. The 1983 \"Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies\" provide project development guidance. Discount rates are used to evaluate present value of benefits and costs, with ongoing debate on the appropriate rate. The Corps planning process uses benefit-cost analysis to determine project eligibility based on financial criteria. The Administration's budgeting process considers various metrics, such as BCRs, to select projects for funding, with cutoffs varying annually. This has led to some projects qualifying for funding in one year but not in subsequent years. Congress ultimately decides which Corps activities to authorize, with projects often receiving congressionally directed spending if they are above the BCR criterion of 1.0 but below the Administration's cutoff. Corps projects must comply with federal laws, leading to input from other agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service. WRDA 2007 increased review requirements for feasibility studies, mandating independent peer review for many projects. The entities involved in Corps studies and recommendations have evolved over time. The entities involved in Corps studies and recommendations have evolved over time, with projects now reviewed internally before a Chief's report is released. Studies and projects are mostly undertaken individually, with limited formal requirements for considering their role in larger water resource systems. Congress authorizes studies and construction activities with few formal requirements. Deauthorization processes exist for incomplete Corps projects, triggered if a construction project lacks funding for five years. Completed projects owned by the agency do not have a deauthorization process in place. If funds are not obligated within a year after a list is transmitted to Congress, a project or element may be deauthorized. In the fiscal year following a list's transmittal, a project or element may be deauthorized if it lacks funding for five years. The Corps publishes project deauthorization lists in the Federal Register periodically. A study deauthorization process also exists, where the Secretary of the Army transmits a list of incomplete authorized studies to Congress annually. If funds are not appropriated within 90 days, the study is deauthorized. There is no general authority for deauthorization or transfer of existing Corps projects. In 1980, the Chief of Engineers lost the authority to recommend discontinuing appropriations for unworthy projects. Project ownership transfer requires Congress authorization. \"Low-priority construction\" lacks a precise definition but includes projects outside Corps primary missions and those not competitive in budget metrics. Environmental infrastructure projects are often considered low priority. In FY2010, environmental infrastructure projects received $140 million in annual appropriations, representing more than 6% of the enacted annual construction appropriations. Additionally, ARRA provided an additional $200 million for environmental infrastructure activities in FY2009 and FY2010; more than 4% of the $4.6 billion in ARRA funding for the Corps was for environmental infrastructure. Funding for these projects was not included in the Corps work plan for the FY2011 long-term continuing resolution. Opinions on the focus of Corps and its federal funding vary widely. In the early 1990s, efforts were made to reorganize the Corps' divisions and districts to reduce administrative expenses. Secretary of the Army White also considered divestiture and privatization of some Corps functions in the early 2000s, but Congress limited this initiative. Opinions on the Corps' focus and funding sources vary widely. In the early 1990s, efforts were made to reorganize the Corps' divisions and districts to reduce administrative expenses. A review of options for civil works missions and activities was underway in 1995, including transferring responsibilities to other federal agencies and private sector participation. The Clinton Administration proposed major changes in the FY1996 budget, but Congress did not adopt these proposals. Discussions about changing the Corps' position in the federal bureaucracy also took place, considering combining the Corps with the Department of. The 2007 National Academy of Public Administration report provided recommendations on the Corps budgeting process, addressing missions, authorization processes, and project development. The report also discussed navigation expenditures, trust funds, coastal harbor funding, inland waterway funding, and challenges for operations and maintenance projects. The Corps faces challenges with harbor maintenance backlog and low channel dimensions at busy ports. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund has a balance of $6 billion, with annual collections averaging $1.4 billion. Proposed legislation would ensure funds are dedicated to harbor maintenance. The proposed legislation aims to dedicate annual receipts to harbor maintenance expenditures, potentially providing over $500 million more annually for eligible expenses. This could decrease the backlog of funds for operations and maintenance activities, benefiting coastal navigation operations. However, it may not change total Corps appropriations as HMTF funds require appropriation and fall within the Energy and Water Development budget. A potential guarantee for over $500 million annually for harbor maintenance could offset other E&W funded activities, potentially affecting the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and Department of Energy budgets. The allocation of funds would depend on Congress's decision on which accounts to cut. The Corps may receive a greater portion of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill for eligible activities, potentially impacting other Corps activities. However, this guarantee would not increase the total funding available for discretionary spending. Congress would need to cut federal discretionary spending in other areas to meet the requirements of the guarantee. The Corps has struggled to maintain federal navigation projects to authorized depths and widths, including harbors and inland waterways. From FY2007 to FY2011, the Corps spent an average of approximately $758 million per year on project maintenance. The Corps estimates that maintaining all channels at authorized depths would require three times the average O&M expenditures. Initial costs for dredging some areas to new depths would be $2.23 billion per year for the first five years, then dropping to $1.81 billion per year after that. This includes $1.93 billion for coastal harbor dredging and $370 million for inland waterway dredging initially, decreasing to $1.5 billion for harbor maintenance and $305 million for inland waterway dredging. The Corps estimates that maintaining all channels at authorized depths would require three times the average O&M expenditures. Administration budget criteria prioritize harbor funding based on commercial tonnage, leading to reduced funding for low-use coastal projects. This raises questions about the federal role in maintaining low-use harbors like Gray's Harbor, WA. The current budget criteria prioritize harbor funding based on commercial tonnage, potentially reducing funding for low-use harbors like Gray's Harbor, WA. The extent to which additional funding under a guarantee would be used on low-use projects is unclear, with criteria focused on economic, defense, and public safety factors. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) partially funds Corps projects on federal inland waterways, including lock and dam construction, derived from a fuel tax on commercial activities. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) is facing a shortfall in funding for inland waterway projects. Various proposals have been made to amend the IWTF and increase funding, including a recent proposal by the user industry. Any proposal to make the trust fund solvent and increase expenditures on inland waterway projects would require new revenue from increased user fees, appropriations from the General Fund of the Treasury, or both. The user industry proposal aims to make the fund solvent and increase expenditures by raising user fees and shifting the cost-share burden for inland waterway projects. The proposal aims to make the Inland Waterway Trust Fund solvent by increasing user fees and shifting the cost-share burden for projects towards the federal government. Some suggest raising fuel taxes or imposing new fees to fund waterway upgrades, while others argue that increased fees may deter commercial shippers from using inland waterways. Table 7 and Table 8 provide recommendations and legislative proposals related to marine transport and the financing of Corps activities. The recommendations address marine transport trust funds, oversight of fund use, and assessments of harbor and waterway needs. Legislative proposals in the 112th Congress offer different responses to Corps fiscal challenges, with some emphasizing certain activities and others providing more financing for different projects. The Corps' role in infrastructure investments and the economy is part of a larger discourse. The discourse on infrastructure investments, job creation, and public services is ongoing. Various legislative provisions and actions are being taken to address Corps fiscal challenges, including specific projects and activities. Earmarks and congressionally directed spending also impact the Corps' fiscal context."
