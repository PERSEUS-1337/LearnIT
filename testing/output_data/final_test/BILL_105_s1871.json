    "content": "Termination of exception for certain real estate investment trusts from treatment of stapled entities. The REIT gross income provisions apply to activities and income of stapled REIT group members related to nonqualified real property interests as if they were one entity. A nonqualified real property interest refers to real property acquired after March 26, 1998, by an exempt REIT or stapled entity. The term \"nonqualified real property interest\" excludes real property acquired after March 26, 1998, by an exempt REIT or stapled entity if the acquisition was pursuant to a binding agreement or publicly announced before that date. The term \"nonqualified real property interest\" excludes real property acquired after March 26, 1998, by an exempt REIT or stapled entity if the acquisition was pursuant to a binding agreement or publicly announced before that date. Any improvement or repair to land or property owned or leased by the exempt REIT or stapled REIT group is considered a qualified real property interest, except for leases of such interests. This exclusion does not apply to improvements placed in service after December 31, 1999, as part of a change in property use. The improvement must not exceed 200 percent of the property's cost or fair market value at acquisition for a change in property use. An improvement is considered placed in service before January 1, 2000, if it is completed before that date. Entities holding real property interests must meet specific criteria to be considered qualified under the regulations, including being stapled entities with a REIT before March 26, 1998. The term \"qualified real property interest\" refers to any interest in real property excluding nonqualified interests. Exempt REITs and stapled entities are considered to hold their proportionate shares of real property interests held by 10-percent subsidiary entities. Interests in real property held by 10-percent subsidiaries of exempt REITs or stapled entities are generally treated as nonqualified. The subsidiary entity of an exempt REIT or stapled entity is treated as a nonqualified real property interest, except for interests held before March 26, 1998. If ownership of a subsidiary increases after March 26, 1998, there is a reduction in qualified real property interests. When an exempt REIT or stapled entity increases its ownership in a subsidiary entity, the additional portion of real property interest held by the exempt REIT or stapled entity is treated as a nonqualified real property interest. Ownership percentage is determined according to specific rules, and interests acquired in any acquisition are treated accordingly. Treatment of changes in ownership proportion due to fluctuations in stock values is not considered. Nonqualified obligations held by an exempt REIT or stapled REIT group member are treated as impermissible tenant service income. The term \"nonqualified obligation\" refers to any mortgage-secured obligation on real property, excluding certain income from a subsidiary entity within a stapled REIT group. The term \"nonqualified obligation\" excludes certain obligations secured by real property held by the exempt REIT or any entity within the stapled REIT group. It also excludes obligations with interest payments that would be considered interest income by a REIT and have an interest rate at arm's length. The rule applies to obligations secured by real property within the stapled REIT group, even after refinancing. Entities not part of the group on March 26, 1998, are subject to a similar rule. An increase in subsidiary ownership leads to an increase in nonqualified obligations. For purposes of this section, the term \"exempt REIT\" refers to a real estate investment trust that is not subject to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The term \"REIT gross income provisions\" includes specific sections of the Code related to REIT income. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 defines a \"stapled REIT group\" as entities stapled to an exempt REIT and its 10-percent subsidiary entities. A \"10-percent subsidiary entity\" is an entity in which the exempt REIT holds at least a 10-percent interest, with an exception for certain C corporation subsidiaries of REITs. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 defines a \"stapled REIT group\" as entities stapled to an exempt REIT and its 10-percent subsidiary entities. A corporation taxable under section 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is not treated as a 10-percent subsidiary of an exempt REIT. The term \"10-percent interest\" refers to ownership of 10 percent of stock in a corporation, assets or net profits interest in a partnership, or ownership in any other case. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 defines a \"stapled REIT group\" as entities stapled to an exempt REIT and its 10-percent subsidiary entities. Ownership of 10 percent of beneficial interests in an entity is required. Terms used in this section have meanings given in section 269B or section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Secretary may provide guidance to prevent avoidance of purposes and double counting of income. This section applies to taxable years ending after March 26, 1998."
