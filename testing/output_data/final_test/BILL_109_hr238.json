The application must demonstrate State certification for teaching in a public elementary or secondary school. To qualify for loan repayment, an individual must be a certified teacher or pass the State teacher licensing exam. For elementary school, a bachelor's degree and proficiency in various subjects are required. For middle or secondary school, a bachelor's degree and high competency in all teaching subjects are necessary. The program requires teachers to demonstrate high performance on academic tests or completion of an academic major in the subject areas they teach. The Secretary will conduct a national evaluation of the program's impact on individuals encouraged by it. Evaluation will be awarded competitively. The program under this section encourages individuals to pursue teaching careers in mathematics, science, or related fields. The evaluation includes determining the number of individuals remaining in teaching as a result, identifying barriers to effectiveness, assessing cost-effectiveness, and tracking the number of years of participation. Interim and final evaluation reports will be submitted to the President and Congress. The evaluation under this section aims to assess the impact of the program on individuals pursuing teaching careers in mathematics, science, or related fields. The final report is due by January 1, 2008."
