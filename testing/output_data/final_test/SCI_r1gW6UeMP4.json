    "content": "Pre-trained word embeddings are crucial for transfer learning in Natural Language Processing tasks. This work focuses on extracting representations from multiple pre-trained supervised models to enhance word embeddings with task and domain specific knowledge. Experiments show benefits in cross-task, cross-domain, and crosslingual settings. In the low-resource setting, embeddings are beneficial for various tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction. Labeling large amounts of data at this level is costly and unscalable. Leveraging high-performance models for language understanding tasks is desirable. Domain adaptation involves transferring knowledge from data-rich domains to low-resource domains. Cross-lingual adaptation is important for expanding personal assistants to multiple languages. In the low-resource setting, transferring knowledge from data-rich domains to low-resource domains is crucial for expanding personal assistants to multiple languages. A simple method is proposed to transfer supervised knowledge from multiple sources using contextual word embeddings extracted from preexisting models. Unsupervised transfer learning methods like ELMo have shown success for various tasks, despite being trained on large corpora with unsupervised objectives. In low-resource settings, leveraging representations from multiple pre-trained supervised models in related tasks, domains, or languages can be beneficial. Unlike traditional supervised transfer learning, our plug-and-play approach does not require labeled data for source models at training time and offers interpretability through the parameters of the convex combination. Our work focuses on unsupervised transfer learning using embeddings like GloVe and FastText, as well as deep contextualized embedding methods like ELMo. We also incorporate domain adaptation for spoken language understanding, along with cross-task and cross-lingual settings. Additionally, we create metaembeddings from multiple sources to enhance deep learning models. Most deep learning models have an encoder E and decoder D, such as in a Deep-SRL model where stacked bidirectional LSTM is the encoder E and softmax layer is the decoder D. Multiple supervised models with different encoders E 1 , ..., E K are used to generate specialized representations for each token in a sentence. These encoders can vary in dimensions, architectures, and vector spaces, requiring a projection layer to align them. To align specialized representations from multiple encoders into one vector space, a projection layer is used. The projection layer parameters are learned along with the target model. Different aggregation schemes like pooling, convex combination, and attention can be employed. A simple convex combination approach is chosen, where softmax normalized weights are used to combine representations, along with a scalar parameter for scaling. This method adds K + 1 trainable parameters to the model and ensures a fixed size embedding. The method involves combining representations from multiple encoders into a fixed-size embedding. These embeddings are then concatenated with traditional GloVe or ELMo embeddings for knowledge transfer in various settings, including cross-task transfer to Semantic Role Labeling task using source tasks like Constituency Parsing, Dependency Parsing, and Named Entity Recognition. The approach adds trainable parameters to the model for scaling and ensures a consistent embedding size. In the cross-domain setting, the method's applicability is studied using NER as the target task with different domains for the source and target models. The target domain chosen is web blogs, aiming to address challenges with data-scarce domains. The approach utilizes the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset for annotations across multiple domains. The study focuses on NER in a data-scarce domain, using web blogs as the target domain and various sources like newswire and broadcast conversation. Cross-lingual transfer is explored with NER datasets in English, Spanish, German, and Dutch. The NER model architecture remains consistent across experiments, including low-resource settings. In low resource settings, experiments are conducted on smaller training subsets of 1,000 and 5,000 samples. The source task models are trained on complete datasets with specific hyperparameters such as using Adam optimizer with lr=0.001, running target models for 50 epochs in SRL tasks and 75 epochs in NER tasks, and maintaining batch sizes at 8 for 1k data and 16 for 5k data settings. GloVe and ELMo embeddings have dimensions of 100 and 1024 respectively, with a projection layer output dimension of 300. Cross-task SRL results are tabulated for different data settings, and cross-domain NER and crosslingual transfer on NER results are also presented. In low resource settings, experiments are conducted on smaller training subsets of 1,000 and 5,000 samples. The source task models are trained on complete datasets with specific hyperparameters. Cross-task SRL results show significant improvements in F1 scores with supervised embeddings. Syntactic tasks like CP and DP benefit SRL greatly. ELMo representations outperform GloVe embeddings, with additional gains seen when adding supervised embeddings. Our model demonstrates a 5% improvement in performance in both the 1,000 and 5,000 sample settings compared to the baseline. The supervised contextual embeddings show further enhancements over strong language model features in low-resource settings. Cross-domain NER supervised embeddings provide a 4% improvement over the GloVe baseline with 1,000 and 5,000 samples. Knowledge from other domains is particularly beneficial in very low-resource settings, but loses its impact when the full dataset is utilized. In low-resource settings, knowledge from other domains is valuable. GloVe models outperform ELMo models in a dataset due to mismatch in training data. Cross-lingual NER shows gains in performance for German and Spanish with 1,000 samples. Supervised contextual embeddings offer an easy way to incorporate knowledge from multiple sources. The study explores the benefits of contextual embeddings in transfer learning across tasks, domains, and languages, especially in low-resource settings. The research suggests the potential of these embeddings in various downstream tasks and aims to expand the taxonomy of transfer learning dependencies in NLP."
