    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5273.1 of the Business and Professions Code allows advertising displays in Inglewood to continue existing and advertising businesses outside the redevelopment project area if certain conditions are met. The display must be within Inglewood's boundary limits, built before January 1, 2012, and located adjacent to Interstate 405 at specific postmiles. The advertising display in Inglewood authorized under Section 5273.1 of the Business and Professions Code will not lead to a reduction in federal aid highway funds. If a federal notice is received indicating a potential reduction in funds, the display owner must remove all advertising copy within 60 days to avoid a civil fine of $10,000 per day imposed by the California Department of Transportation. The California Department of Transportation can impose a civil fine of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per day for failure to remove advertising copy on authorized displays in Inglewood. Liability is not assumed by the department for cessation of operation or removal of the advertising. If the display owner's name is not shown, the notice will be sent to the City of Inglewood. An advertising display in Inglewood must be removed by January 1, 2023, unless it qualifies as lawful with no compensation. The City can request an extension until the redevelopment project area expires if it has a positive economic impact and provides public benefit, with no violations in the past 10 years. The City of Inglewood requires the removal of advertising displays by January 1, 2023, unless they meet specific criteria, including no violations in the past 10 years and compliance with all standards. The City of Inglewood must ensure that advertising displays meet certain criteria and provide a public benefit. They must certify annually that a portion of the advertising copy displays business locations or routes. Displays violating these rules more than three times in 10 years may be removed. The City of Inglewood is responsible for ensuring advertising displays comply with regulations. Failure to do so within 30 days may result in costs incurred by the department. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies if determined by the Commission on State Mandates. \"An exemption from some provisions of the Outdoor Advertising Act is necessary for advertising displays due to unique circumstances and location, as a general statute cannot be applied.\""
