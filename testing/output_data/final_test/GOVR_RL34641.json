    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered species, protect those species, and fulfill related treaties. Federal agencies must work with the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to achieve these goals. The ESA prohibits harming endangered wildlife species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits actions that harm endangered species, such as harassing, pursuing, hunting, shooting, or capturing them. Section 7 consultation ensures federal agencies avoid jeopardizing listed species or their critical habitat. If unavoidable harm occurs, an Incidental Take Statement can be issued to excuse the harm, but the agency must minimize the effects. Failure to consult under Section 7 risks violating the ESA and prohibits irreversible commitments that would hinder alternative conservation measures. The Endangered Species Act prohibits actions that harm endangered species. Section 7 consultation ensures federal agencies avoid jeopardizing listed species or their critical habitat. The regulations in place determine whether a proposed action requires consultation, with informal and formal procedures established in 1986. The 1986 regulations were reinstated in May 2009, and a comparison of versions is provided in Table 1. When an Action Agency realizes its project may affect a listed species or critical habitat, it must consult with the Service at the earliest possible time. The initiation package, based on the best available data, starts the formal consultation process between the Action Agency and Service biologists. This may involve phone calls and minor additional documentation to determine if jeopardy to the species or adverse habitat modification will occur. The Services may request a biological assessment (BA) for formal consultation if more information is needed. There is a 90-day deadline for the Services to respond to a consultation initiation. The consultation process begins when the Service receives a complete BA. Consultation can be a rare event for some Action Agencies, leading to frustration due to repeated requests for data. The workload associated with consultations has increased since 1996, with FWS reporting double the consultations in 2006. On August 15, 2008, proposed revisions to Section 7 consultation regulations were issued, with a final version taking effect on January 15, 2009. A lawsuit challenged the revised regulations, leading to their reinstatement on May 4, 2009. The 111th Congress later allowed for the regulations to be withdrawn or reissued without additional rulemaking. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 allowed for the withdrawal or reissuance of revised regulations without the need for additional rulemaking steps. President Obama directed the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to consider issuing new regulations to promote the purposes of the ESA. Other federal agencies were encouraged to follow prior consultation practices involving the Services. The revised regulations from January 15 to May 4, 2009, allowed agencies more discretion in consultation processes, clarified definitions, and made procedural changes. The goal was to address climate change concerns, stating no requirement to consult on greenhouse gas emissions' impact on listed species. Some argue the ESA isn't suited for regulating emissions, while others point out it has no project exceptions. The revised regulations from January 15 to May 4, 2009, allowed agencies more discretion in consultation processes, clarified definitions, and made procedural changes. Some argue the ESA isn't suited for regulating emissions, while others note it has no project exceptions. The suit against the changes argued that the revisions would severely limit the kinds of effects addressed in consultations and result in harmful actions proceeding without adequate input from the Services. Six substantive changes were made to the regulations, including altering the definition of biological. The revised regulations from January 15 to May 4, 2009, made several alterations, including changing definitions and consultation procedures. One significant change was allowing other documents to serve as a formal Biological Assessment (BA) to promote efficiency. This change aimed to align with the statute's allowance for flexibility in BA requirements. The revised regulations from January 15 to May 4, 2009, made changes to the consultation process, including allowing other documents to serve as a formal Biological Assessment (BA). This change aimed to align with the statute's flexibility in BA requirements. The addition to the definition of cumulative effects had little legal or policy impact on the consultation process. The concept of cumulative effects in consultation was created by regulation in 1986. Federal agencies must consider cumulative effects in their Biological Assessments (BAs) and provide a written analysis during formal consultation. The Services are also required to consider cumulative effects in their BiOps. During formal consultation, a Service must review cumulative effects to determine if the action will harm a species or critical habitat. The added language clarified that federal activities near the project area are not considered in cumulative effects analysis. The definition of effects of the action requires Action Agencies and the Services to consider the past and present impacts of federal actions and the anticipated impacts of all proposed federal projects in the action area. The regulations also require the Action Agency to discuss the effects of an action in its BA, and the Service to include a detailed discussion of the effects of an action in its BiOp. Indirect effects were modified in the revised regulations in response to a court case. The revised regulation made changes to the definition of indirect effects in response to a court case, requiring the proposed action to be an essential cause of those effects. This simplifies the consultation process and makes it less burdensome and time-consuming. The Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that an agency action would not jeopardize a species if it was already in jeopardy. The revised regulation requires the proposed action to be an essential cause of indirect effects, simplifying the consultation process. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to conserve threatened and endangered species, giving priority to saving them. Changes to indirect effects now require clear and substantial information. Species can become threatened or extinct due to various reasons, with habitat loss being a common cause. Habitat loss, along with other threats like competition from invasive species and bioaccumulation of toxins, can lead to species endangerment or extinction. The revised rule allows actions that exacerbate one threat but not another to be considered in conservation efforts. The revised rule allows actions that exacerbate one threat but not another to be considered in conservation efforts, even if the action is not an essential cause of the indirect effect. It may be difficult for Services to determine the effects of an action when a species faces multiple severe threats. The existing regulations require a Section 7 consultation for actions with discretionary Federal involvement that may affect a listed species or critical habitat. The revised regulations in 2009 changed Section 402.03 significantly, providing more criteria for when a consultation did not apply. If any criteria were met, an agency did not have to consult, but it was unclear how this would be documented. The focus has been on the term discretionary since the previous version in 1986. The revised regulations in 2009 made significant changes to Section 402.03 of the Procedure Act (APA), allowing Action Agencies to make decisions without clear standards. Consultation was not required if the action was not anticipated to result in take, a new criterion. This differed from previous standards that focused on jeopardizing species existence and critical habitat modification. The revised regulations in 2009 introduced changes to Section 402.03 of the Procedure Act, allowing Action Agencies to make decisions without clear standards. Consultation was not needed if the action was not expected to result in take, a new criterion that differed from previous standards focusing on jeopardizing species existence and critical habitat modification. The take requirement aimed to reduce the number of consultations and targeted eliminating them by introducing additional criteria. The effects of an action may not be reliably predicted or measured at the local scale, and consultation with the Services may not be required if the action poses only a small local impact or a remote potential risk to species or habitat. Courts have not allowed regulations that eliminate the Services' role in ensuring the protection of listed species or critical habitat. The federal district court found that regulations allowing the EPA to make NLAA determinations without consulting the Services were flawed. In contrast, a different court upheld regulations for the National Fire Plan, stating that the Services still had oversight. The court held that additional procedures for monitoring and training adequately served Section 7 consultation mandates. The revised regulations could be seen as giving more discretion to agencies, potentially putting jeopardy evaluation in the hands of the Action Agency without input from the Services. Consultations are initiated by the Action Agency, with the ultimate decision on whether to consult resting with them. The revised regulations give more discretion to agencies, potentially allowing the Action Agency to determine consultation without input from the Services. Commenters challenged the changes, stating that action agencies cannot decide without consultation that their actions will not harm listed species or critical habitat. The Services addressed these concerns by noting that the statute does not define \"consultation\" or \"assistance\" and that \"shall\" in the statute does not modify consultation and assistance. The revised regulations give more discretion to agencies, potentially allowing the Action Agency to determine consultation without input from the Services. Commenters challenged the changes, stating that action agencies cannot decide without consultation that their actions will not harm listed species or critical habitat. Section 1536(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure actions do not jeopardize endangered species or their habitats. The Services argue that Congress has provided discretion in defining consultation and assistance. In statutory interpretation, the ordinary meaning prevails when terms are not defined. Consultation and assistance require interaction with another party, established by the ESA as one of the Services. The Services argue that the term \"shall\" in section 7(a)(2) pertains to avoiding jeopardy or harm to critical habitat, not mandatory consultation on every action. This implies that Action Agencies must ensure their actions do not harm species or critical habitat, but consultation and assistance are optional. The revised regulations allow Action Agencies to opt out of consultations in certain circumstances, based on a D.C. district court decision. Concerns were raised that the regulations may excuse consultations too easily, but the court did not require consultations on every action, only when there is a \"possibility\" of an effect on a species or habitat. The revised regulations allow Action Agencies to opt out of consultations if they determine their actions have no effect on listed species or critical habitat. It is unclear if small or local impacts would still require consultation. The revised regulations allow Action Agencies to opt out of consultations if their actions have no effect on listed species or critical habitat, promoting efficiency. There has always been a tension between the plain language of Section 7 and its practical application, requiring agencies to ensure actions do not harm protected species. The revised regulations allow Action Agencies to opt out of consultations if their actions have no effect on listed species or critical habitat, resembling NEPA's approach. This addresses the intent to separate climate change issues from the ESA, although not explicitly mentioned. The final version eliminated language about insignificant contributions to effects on listed species or critical habitat. The final revision of the regulations eliminated language regarding effects on listed species or critical habitat and instead referred to global processes, potentially related to climate change. Consultation was not required if effects could not be predicted locally, had a minimal local impact, or posed a remote risk to species. The final revision of the regulations focused on global processes and limited the application of Section 402.3(b) to actions with significant local impacts or risks to species. Concerns were raised about the lack of public notice and comment on the changes, which could potentially violate APA requirements. The revised regulations shifted the evaluation of action effects to a different part of the Section 7 process, potentially requiring agencies to perform consultation work before determining its necessity. This could lead to more actions advancing to consultation than before. The revised regulations aimed to create a narrow exception to consultation, allowing more actions to advance to consultation than before. The Services argued that effects must be considered for global processes produced by one action, but the result of one power plant's emissions could not be measured at a local scale. The revised regulations aimed to create a narrow exception to consultation, allowing more actions to advance to consultation than before. The distinction is between jeopardizing a listed species versus harming a listed species, and adversely modifying or destroying critical habitat versus harming habitat. The revised regulations created a distinction between jeopardizing a species (likely to cause extinction) and harming a species (injuring or killing). Similarly, there was a difference between destroying critical habitat and harming habitat. The amendment aimed to increase the number of consultations required for less harmful actions and limit climate change challenges under the ESA by requiring a clear link between the agency's action and specific harm. Consultation was not needed if the effects of the action could not be meaningfully identified or detected. The revised regulations allowed the Action Agency to determine if consultation was necessary based on whether the effects of the action could be identified or detected. The Consultation Handbook indicated that \"best judgment\" would be used for this determination. Efficiency in the Section 7 process would be promoted by eliminating unnecessary consultations if the action would benefit the species. The revised regulations streamlined the Section 7 process by reducing unnecessary consultations, aligning with the ESA's goals. Consultation is required only for effects of an action that do not fall within specific criteria. The revised regulations streamlined the Section 7 process by reducing unnecessary consultations. Consultation is required only for effects of an action that do not meet specific criteria, potentially allowing agencies to segment projects for consultation based on significant, identifiable effects. However, this approach may raise concerns about compliance with the ESA. The revisions in Section 402.13 required Action Agencies to consider the effects of the action as a whole, potentially addressing aspects not advanced to consultation. Informal consultations aim to efficiently evaluate ESA effects by halting the process for projects not likely to harm listed species or critical habitat. The revised regulations in Section 402.13 expanded the scope of informal consultations to include other relevant projects beyond the agency action. The changes required Action Agencies to consider the effects of the action as a whole and made procedural changes to the consultation process. The consultation process under the revised regulations allows for one informal consultation for related projects, potentially promoting efficiency. However, determining when actions are \"similar\" could be controversial, and it is unclear if the Action Agency or the Service would decide on aggregation of actions. The concurrence required for the \"not likely to adversely affect\" determination is ambiguous, raising questions about the Service's role in determining relatedness of actions. The Ninth Circuit rejected isolating a portion of a project when assessing jeopardy to a species. A change in regulations now requires considering the effects of the entire action on all listed species and habitats in informal consultations, potentially increasing the burden without offering relief. The revised regulations for informal consultations added a deadline for a written response from the Service regarding a project's potential harms. If the Service did not respond within 60 days, consultation could be terminated without their agreement. This could have increased efficiency but may have violated the statute's purpose of determining harms using the best scientific methods. The Service and the Action Agency determine project harms using scientific data. Adequate staff for consultations was a problem. The revised regulations introduced a new document for informal consultations called a request, marking the start of the consultation period. The Action Agency must consider effects when making a request. The revised regulations introduced a new requirement for the Action Agency to consider the effects of an action when making a request for informal consultation, blurring the distinction between informal and formal consultation processes. Formal consultation is not required under certain circumstances, potentially changing the consultation dynamics. The revised regulations introduced changes to the consultation processes, blurring the distinction between informal and formal consultation. There are concerns about agencies providing incomplete information to expedite the process and potentially impacting listed species without an Incidental Take Statement. The proposed rule changes may increase the workload of the Services by requiring fewer concurrences and more projects to undergo formal consultation. The regulations now exclude consultation on greenhouse gas emissions' impact on climate change, separating it from the consultation process focused on listed species and habitats. Agency actions typically indirectly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions through permits or licenses, rather than directly producing them. The Services argue that agency actions authorizing GHG emissions do not require consultation due to the lack of causation between specific projects and their effects on listed species or critical habitat. The best scientific data available does not establish a causal connection between GHG emissions from Federal actions and their impact on species or habitat by climate change. The revised regulations support the Services' position on ESA consultation. The revised regulations for ESA consultation do not consider the effects of GHG emissions from a project, stating that these emissions are not an essential cause of the effects and may be insignificant contributors to adverse impacts. The regulations also argue that GHG emissions may not be detectable for evaluation and pose a remote risk of harm to species or habitat. The term \"global processes\" is used instead of GHGs in the regulations, which is not clearly defined. The revised regulations for ESA consultation do not explicitly mention GHGs but use the term \"global processes\" instead, which is vague. This term is chosen to limit consultation to exclude evaluations involving climate change, which could encompass various factors like El Ni\u00f1o and rising sea levels. Despite the consensus among scientists on GHG emissions driving climate change, the regulations do not consider GHG emissions from a specific agency action as an essential cause of climate change effects on a species. The agency action must be deemed an essential cause for consideration after the consultation process. The revised regulations for ESA consultation do not explicitly mention GHGs but use the term \"global processes\" instead, which is vague. The causal link to affect a species is arguably quite tenuous: GHG emissions must first affect climate change, which then must affect an ecosystem, which then must affect a species. The remaining changes in the rule influence how the Action Agency decides whether consultation applies to an action. Actions that manifest themselves in global processes, which presumably would include increased GHGs, would require consultation under certain circumstances. In the context of GHGs, the aggregation of actions could be key. EPA modeling indicated that emissions from a large coal-fired power plant would have an insignificant impact on global mean temperature. However, a permitting process involving multiple GHG sources may be significant. Projects leading to GHG emissions may not require consultation if the effects cannot be meaningfully identified or evaluated. The decision may be based on the best available scientific information. The Services have indicated changes to regulations that may exclude some consultations on projects with GHG emissions. The decision will be based on best judgment, and the effects must pose a \"remote\" risk of harm to species or habitat. The complexities of global climate modeling make individual project assessments problematic, leading to the consideration of aggregating actions for consultation under the revised regulations. The Services are considering changes to regulations that could limit consultations on projects with GHG emissions. The decision may involve aggregating agency actions for review, with proponents arguing against using the ESA to regulate GHG emissions due to their perceived lack of direct impact on species. Critics believe climate change affects species and should be considered in consultations, but the sheer number of federal actions potentially influencing climate change could overwhelm the Services. The potential impact of climate change on species could overwhelm the Services. Lawsuits argue that omitting climate change from consultation requirements leads to inconsistencies in listing species. Federal courts have required the Services to consider climate change in consultations. The National Fire Plan, part of the Healthy Forests Initiative, addresses the effects of wildfires on listed species through joint regulations issued in 2003. The regulations on consultation for wildfires impact listed species, with some similarities to the National Fire Plan. A joint report in 2008 reviewed the delegation of ESA consultation responsibilities to agencies. The Services reviewed whether the two Action Agencies met ESA requirements in their preparation of BAs for federal actions. FS and BLM documents had to describe the action's environmental effects, area affected, listed species, critical habitat, and use scientific data. NMFS and FWS analyzed the results separately, finding deficiencies in all projects involving species under their management. The NMFS and FWS reviewed projects with FWS species and found deficiencies in all assessments. Of the 53 project BAs analyzed, 66% were deficient in at least one respect. Action Agencies approved measures for improvement involving oversight and training. The BLM and FS have experience in implementing agency mandates and received special training for internal consultation. The start may be challenging for agencies new to endangered species issues. The Desert Rock Energy Project involves a coal-fired power plant on Navajo land in New Mexico, with the BIA as the Action Agency. The proposed regulations impose deadlines on consultation processes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was the Action Agency for the Desert Rock Energy Project involving a coal-fired power plant on Navajo land in New Mexico. On April 30, 2007, the BIA sent a Biological Assessment (BA) to FWS regarding the project's impact on endangered species and critical habitats. The BA concluded that the project would likely affect a threatened species. FWS requested additional information, and a revised BA was submitted on October 26, 2007. FWS noted unanswered questions in their response on January 7, 2008. The revised Biological Assessment (BA) for the Desert Rock Energy Project did not address key issues raised by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), including the potential adverse effects on species and critical habitats. FWS highlighted concerns about the coal's chemical composition, heavy metal contamination, cumulative impacts of multiple plants, and global climate change. Further analysis was deemed necessary before assessing species impacts. The Desert Rock Memorandum from FWS stated that formal consultation would begin once the requested information was received. No additional documents have been exchanged between the agencies, but discussions continue. The proposed regulations could have allowed BIA to terminate consultation without FWS's concurrence due to incomplete information. However, BIA chose to continue the consultation process despite opposition to the Desert Rock project. The consultation process for the Desert Rock Energy Project faces opposition, potentially leading to citizen suits. Without an ITS excusing incidental takes, jeopardy or adverse modification of critical habitat could occur. If informal consultation is terminated to avoid formal consultation, the focus may shift to the courtroom, leaving Action Agencies vulnerable to legal challenges. Quick resolution may not be achievable through the courts, making it a less preferred option. Without an ITS excusing incidental takes, the Desert Rock Energy Project could face legal challenges alleging ESA violations."
