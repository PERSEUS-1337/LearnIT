    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17952.7 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts \"de minimis income\" received by nonresidents in California from being included in their taxable income, starting from January 1, 2017. \"De minimis income\" refers to compensation subject to withholding under the Unemployment Insurance Code, received by nonresidents during the period they were not residents of the state. Nonresident individuals in California are exempt from including certain compensation in their taxable income if they meet specific criteria. This includes having no other income from the state, being present for employment duties for less than 20 days in the taxable year, and if their state of residence has a similar exclusion or no individual income tax. \"Related person\" is defined as a person related to the employer. The term \"related entity\" refers to a stockholder or their family owning at least 50% of a company's stock, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. This includes individuals, family members, and entities with attribution of stock ownership. The term \"related entity\" includes a stockholder or their related parties owning at least 50% of a company's stock, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. This encompasses various entities and ownership structures. Section 18501.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts certain individuals from compensation regulations, including professional athletes, entertainers, prominent individuals on a per-event basis, and key employees. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed after that date. Section 18501.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code exempts nonresidents with only excluded compensation from filing tax returns under Section 17041. They may be required to file an information return upon request. This section does not apply to imposing taxes on taxpayers under Part 10. Section 13020.5 is added to the Unemployment Insurance Code, stating that the sourcing rules for determining taxability of deferred compensation earned in the state will not be affected by this section. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2021, and will be repealed after that date. Section 13020.5 of the Unemployment Insurance Code exempts nonresidents from having compensation deducted or withheld for employment duties performed in California if the income is not subject to tax under Section 17952.7 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Nonresident presence in the state for tax purposes includes all days spent performing employment duties, excluding transit days. An employer will not be penalized for mistakenly applying an exception if they relied on a time and attendance system that records the employee's work location daily and allocates wages to all taxing jurisdictions. The employer's reliance on employee travel records for time and attendance exceptions is outlined, along with the requirement for regular submission of travel expense reimbursement records. This section provides an exception to withholding and deduction requirements and is effective until January 1, 2021. Section 13006 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to define \"gross income\" as all compensation for services, including fees and commissions, with specific inclusions and exclusions related to compensation specified in the Revenue and Taxation Code. This definition excludes de minimis income until January 1, 2021."
