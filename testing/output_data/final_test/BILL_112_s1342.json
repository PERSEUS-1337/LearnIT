    "content": "The \"Grid Cyber Security Act\" is the short title of the Act. It amends the Federal Power Act to include a section on critical electric infrastructure. The \"Grid Cyber Security Act\" defines critical electric infrastructure as systems vital to the US that, if destroyed, would impact national security, economic security, or public health. Critical electric infrastructure information relates to this infrastructure. The \"Grid Cyber Security Act\" defines critical electric infrastructure as systems essential to national security, economic security, or public health. Critical infrastructure information is defined in the Act, along with terms like cyber security threat and vulnerability related to programmable electronic devices and communication networks. The \"Grid Cyber Security Act\" defines critical electric infrastructure as systems essential to national security, economic security, or public health. The Act establishes the Electric Reliability Organization and the role of the Secretary of Energy. The Commission is tasked with determining the adequacy of reliability standards to protect critical electric infrastructure from cyber security vulnerabilities. The Commission will order the Electric Reliability Organization to submit a proposed reliability standard within 180 days if existing standards are inadequate to protect critical electric infrastructure from cyber security vulnerabilities. If deemed necessary, subsequent orders may be issued to address any deficiencies in the established standards. The Commission will order the Electric Reliability Organization to submit a proposed reliability standard within 180 days to protect critical electric infrastructure from cyber security vulnerabilities. The Commission may grant additional time for submission if needed. The Secretary has emergency authority to protect critical electric infrastructure from cyber security threats by requiring actions from relevant parties. Coordination with Canada and Mexico is encouraged, and consultation is required before exercising this authority. The Secretary has emergency authority to protect critical electric infrastructure from cyber security threats by requiring actions from relevant parties. Consultation with entities and cost recovery mechanisms are in place for implementing immediate actions. Orders issued by the Secretary under this authority are effective for up to 90 days. The Secretary has emergency authority to protect critical electric infrastructure from cyber security threats by issuing orders effective for up to 90 days. Entities owning, controlling, or operating critical electric infrastructure are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission for enforcement purposes. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with relevant parties, must prepare a plan within a year to safeguard the electric power supply of national defense facilities in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam from cybersecurity threats. This plan will outline emergency measures to ensure reliability in case of imminent threats. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with relevant parties, must prepare a plan within a year to safeguard the electric power supply of national defense facilities in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam from cybersecurity threats. This plan will outline emergency measures to ensure reliability in case of an imminent cybersecurity threat. The Protection of Critical Electric Infrastructure Information Act applies to critical electric infrastructure information submitted to the Commission or the Secretary, with regulations prohibiting disclosure. The Commission will regulate the non-disclosure of cybersecurity information if it is deemed detrimental to critical electric infrastructure security. Procedures for sharing critical infrastructure information will be established by the Secretary and the Commission to enable entities to comply with rules and orders. The text discusses the regulations for handling classified information, emphasizing the need to prevent unauthorized use, maintain security and confidentiality, protect individuals' rights, and ensure data integrity by removing obsolete information. Access to classified information requires authorization as per Executive Order 13526. The text discusses regulations for handling classified information, emphasizing the need to prevent unauthorized use and maintain security. It mentions the requirement for appropriate security clearances to access classified information related to cyber security threats or vulnerabilities. Limited addition of ERO authority for critical electric infrastructure. Section 215(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act is amended to define the term \"Bulk-power system\" and include facilities used for local distribution. The Commission determines critical electric infrastructure for local distribution of electric energy. Exclusion applies except as provided in subparagraph (A). The Federal Power Act is amended to limit the authority of the ERO to develop and enforce compliance with reliability standards and emergency orders for local electric distribution facilities only if their incapacity would severely impact national security, economic security, or public health and safety. Additionally, temporary emergency orders for cyber security vulnerabilities are addressed. Section 215(d) of the Federal Power Act is amended to allow the Commission to issue temporary emergency orders for cyber security vulnerabilities without prior notice or hearing, requiring the ERO to develop and enforce immediate effective measures until a permanent solution is developed. The Commission can issue temporary emergency orders for cyber security vulnerabilities without prior notice or hearing, requiring the ERO to develop and enforce immediate effective measures. SEC. 6. EMP STUDY. The DOE, in consultation with experts, will prepare a report assessing critical electric infrastructure's susceptibility to electromagnetic pulse events and geomagnetic disturbances. The report will examine risks, assess possible disruptions to power transmission, and aim to reduce uncertainties. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, will assess the need to strengthen infrastructure against electromagnetic events and geomagnetic disturbances, including estimating costs and benefits of hardening options. The budgetary effects of this Act will be determined by the latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, in compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010."
