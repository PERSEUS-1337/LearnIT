    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lead Exposure Reduction Amendments Act of 2015\" and includes definitions for key terms. Section 401 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2681) is amended to redefine the term 'abatement' to exclude renovation, remodeling, or activities primarily focused on repairing, restoring, or remodeling target housing. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to redefine 'abatement' to exclude renovation, remodeling, or activities focused on repairing, restoring, or remodeling target housing, public buildings constructed before 1978, or commercial buildings that incidentally reduce or eliminate lead-based paint hazards. Emergency renovation is defined as a response to an act of God. The amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act redefines 'abatement' to exclude renovation activities and emergency renovation is defined as a response to an act of God or a risk to public health, safety, or property damage. Lead-based paint is defined as paint containing lead in excess of 1.0 milligrams per centimeter. The definition of lead-based paint in the Toxic Substances Control Act includes paint or surface coatings containing lead in excess of 1.0 milligrams per centimeter squared or 0.5 percent by weight in target housing. Postabatement clearance testing is conducted after lead-based paint activities to ensure complete reduction and absence of hazards in the area, involving visual assessment and environmental sample analysis. Renovation is defined as a term related to lead-based paint activities. Renovation is defined as per regulations in title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, and renovation and remodeling regulations apply to activities in target housing, public buildings constructed before 1978, and commercial buildings. SEC. 3. LEAD-BASED PAINT ACTIVITIES TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION. Section 402(c) of the Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to require a study on lead exposure in renovation and remodeling activities in buildings constructed before 1978. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to require a study on lead exposure in renovation and remodeling activities in buildings constructed before 1978. The study should consider the risks of disturbing lead and creating lead-based paint hazards in different building types. The timeline for the study completion is specified as not later than 4 years. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to exempt emergency renovations from regulations and clearance testing requirements. The Administrator will promulgate regulations for owners of residential target housing within 60 days of enactment. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to allow owners of residential target housing to authorize contractors to bypass renovation regulations with written certification. The Toxic Substances Control Act allows homeowners to exempt contractors from renovation regulations if certain conditions are met, such as no pregnant women or children under 6 residing in the home during the project. The regulation exempts contractors from liability for misrepresentation in a written certification submitted by the homeowner, as long as the contractor is unaware of the misrepresentation. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to post-1960 building renovation and remodeling regulations and qualifying test kits. A qualifying test kit is a chemical test that can detect lead-based paint, has low false positive and false negative rates, does not need off-site lab analysis, and is affordable and widely available. The Administrator will recognize a qualifying test kit for detecting lead-based paint, which must be affordable, widely available, and easy to use without special training. If a qualifying test kit is not recognized within a year, certain regulations may be suspended. The Administrator will publish notice of failure to recognize a qualifying test kit for lead-based paint detection. Enforcement of post-1960 building renovation regulations may be suspended for a period starting one year after enactment and ending six months after recognition of a qualifying test kit. The Administrator will publish notice of failure to recognize a qualifying test kit for lead-based paint detection. Enforcement of post-1960 building renovation regulations may be suspended for a period starting one year after enactment and ending six months after recognition of a qualifying test kit. The Administrator shall not suspend enforcement of any post-1960 building renovation and remodeling regulation for the period described in clause (ii)(II) with respect to a qualifying test kit. The renovation and remodeling regulation allows for an exemption from penalties for first-time submissions with minor errors. Accreditation of recertification courses exempts hands-on training requirements for EPA-accredited courses required for renovation and remodeling certification."
