The Trump Administration proposed workforce reductions at the DOJ through attrition and eliminating funded but unfilled positions. The reductions would have affected various agencies within the DOJ, establishing a new staffing baseline. The House-passed bill for DOJ in FY2018 included $29.310 billion, 3.5% more than the Administration's request. The House-passed bill for DOJ in FY2018 included increases in funding for various agencies such as the USMS, DEA, and ATF, while reducing funding for the FBI's Construction account.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed a $29.068 billion budget for the Department of Justice in FY2018, which is 2.6% more than the Administration's request. Most DOJ accounts would be funded at or above the FY2017 enacted level, with increases for agencies like the USMS, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorneys' Offices. The FBI's overall funding would be reduced, mainly due to a decrease in the Construction account, while the Salaries and Expenses account would see an increase. The committee-reported bill for FY2018 increased funding for the FBI's Salaries and Expenses account but reduced funding for State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not fully adopt the Administration's proposal to supplement grant accounts with transfers from the Crime Victims Fund, but did include a $379 million transfer to the Office on Violence Against Women.

The ATF's NIBIN program and safety equipment for US Marshals were fully funded. The Senate Committee on Appropriations provided funding for additional resources at the Office of the U.S. Attorneys for prosecutors targeting violent crime and gang activity. However, they declined to provide $70 million for Project Safe Neighborhoods, recommending $10 million instead. The committee's report did not specify if funding was provided for program increases requested by the Administration. The Senate Committee on Appropriations fully funded the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services, including NICS improvements, but declined $70 million for Project Safe Neighborhoods. Funding for ATF and USMS program increases was provided, with expectations for the FBI to address increased demand for background checks. Congress expects the FBI to address increased demand for background checks for firearms purchases and improve NICS performance.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $37 million for the DEA's Diversion Control Program, including funding for diversion investigators, drug take-back efforts, and enforcement of new synthetic substances. $10 million was designated for the U.S. Attorneys' \"hot spots\" pilot program, but the committee did not approve of using DEA funds for this program, stating it is outside the DEA's mission. The committee supports efforts to combat heroin and illegal opioid abuse but believes prosecution for overprescribing and illegal diversion of opioids should be handled differently. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated $3 million for the Office of the U.S. Attorneys to prosecute illegal prescribing and dispensing of opioids. Additional funding was provided for the DEA to enhance opioid and heroin enforcement efforts, support heroin enforcement teams, invest in the Fentanyl Signature Profiling Program, and combat transnational criminal organizations. Congress also approved direct support to U.S. Attorneys Offices to combat opioid abuse. Congress allocated additional funding to U.S. Attorneys Offices to combat opioid abuse, with the Trump Administration requesting $19 million to target transnational organized crime. This included funding for OCDETF investigations, FBI investigations, and DEA efforts to investigate transnational criminal organizations trafficking drugs into the country. The House Committee on Appropriations provided $15 million for the DEA's heroin enforcement activities and investigations of drug trafficking organizations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations allocated additional funding to combat drug trafficking by supporting interagency task forces targeting high-level criminal organizations. The funding was provided to the DEA to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and cartels, enhance investigations and prosecutions of major drug trafficking organizations, and reduce the availability of opioids. There was no mention of additional funding for the FBI specifically for investigations of transnational organized crime. The Trump Administration requested $145 million for enforcing immigration laws in FY2018, including funds for additional immigration judges, U.S. Marshals, housing, medical, and transportation costs, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, Civil Division personnel, and Environment and National Resources Division for border security. The House Committee on Appropriations provided $4 million more than requested for EOIR, supporting 449 immigration judge teams, an increase of 65 from FY2017.

The House Committee on Appropriations provided additional funding for EOIR, supporting 449 immigration judge teams. The Senate Committee on Appropriations funded the EOIR account at the requested level but did not specify funding for additional immigration judges. The explanatory statement directs DOJ to hire and deploy at least 100 more immigration judge teams nationwide by 2019. The Administration's budget also proposed legislative language related to immigration enforcement and \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions. Section 219 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 would expand information sharing between law enforcement entities and the Department of Homeland Security, specifically regarding individuals' nationality, citizenship status, immigration status, and more. It would also require nonfederal law enforcement to comply with DHS requests related to enforcing immigration laws. Section 219 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 aimed to enhance information sharing between law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. It would have allowed DHS or DOJ to link federal funds to compliance with provisions on information sharing and enforcement of immigration laws. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 did not include the proposed Section 219, which aimed to enhance information sharing between law enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security."
