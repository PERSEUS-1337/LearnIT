The model contextualizes each node with a weighted receptive field to encode diverse local graph structures. The model introduces a learnable receptive field for nodes to encode diverse local graph structures, improving attention layers and learning convergence. It allows different node features and graph structures to interact through multi-head attention, showing promising results in node classification tasks on various benchmark datasets. Real-world data often represented as graphs include citation networks, social media connections, and biological processes like protein-protein interactions. The complexity of graph-structured data makes it challenging to use traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN's) designed for images on uniform grids. Extending CNN to deal with arbitrary structured graphs beyond grids or chains is difficult. Graph neural networks (GNN) were proposed to extend CNN for arbitrary structured graphs, using spectral and nonspectral approaches to localize convolutions either in the graph or spectral domain. Graph neural networks define convolutions directly on the graph within spatially close nodes, accommodating varying node structures through processing steps like fixed-neighborhood size sampling, neighborhood normalization, and learning weight matrices. The introduction of highway connections in residual networks has improved performance on graph data processing. The graph attention network (GAT) combines graph neural networks with an attention mechanism to handle graphs with arbitrary structures, allowing for variable-sized inputs while focusing on the most relevant parts. The GAT model introduces attention module into graphs for node representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It computes attention based on node content, using graph structures to mask attention. However, leveraging rich structural information like topology could enhance learning node representations. The GAT model introduces attention module into graphs for node representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance by computing attention based on node content. To enhance learning node representations, leveraging rich structural information like topology is crucial. A new model called \"adaptive structural fingerprints\" is proposed to contextualize each node within a local receptive field composed of its high-order neighbors, assigning non-negative weighting based on local information propagation procedures. The paper introduces the concept of \"adaptive structural fingerprints\" to enhance node representation in graphs by automatically adapting the receptive field based on local graph structures. This approach allows for interactions between structural fingerprints and node features to compute a final attention layer, benefiting the learning of multi-head attention in complex graph datasets. The paper also discusses the proposed method, limitations of content-based graph attention, construction of adaptive structural fingerprints, and related work in subsequent sections. The paper introduces adaptive structural fingerprints to enhance node representation in graphs by adjusting the receptive field based on local graph structures. It emphasizes the importance of detailed graph structures in determining node similarities, showcasing the significance of structural indicators in determining attention between nodes. The importance of structural indicators in determining node similarities is highlighted in the paper. It is noted that feature-based similarity alone may not be sufficient in computing accurate attention between nodes, as structural details of higher-order neighbors and their interactions need to be considered. Various algorithms such as normalized cut, mean-shift, and low-density separation have been utilized in solving clustering and community detection problems by exploiting structural clues. The paper emphasizes the importance of structural indicators in determining node similarities. It introduces the concept of \"adaptive structural fingerprints\" to extract informative structural clues for improving graph attention, node embedding, and classification. This involves placing each node in its local \"receptive field\" to create a subgraph around it. The paper introduces the concept of \"adaptive structural fingerprints\" to improve graph attention, node embedding, and classification by assigning weights to nodes in a local neighborhood based on their importance in shaping the receptive field. Gaussian decay and RWR decay result in different weight contours, with the latter adjusting weights adaptively to structural details of the local graph. The weight of nodes decays with their distance from the center node, calculated using a Gaussian function. The paper proposes using Random Walk with Restart (RWR) to automatically adjust node weights based on local graph structures, enhancing the adaptiveness of the structural fingerprint in the learning process. Random walk with restart (RWR) quantifies structural proximity between seed nodes and all other nodes in the graph. It starts from a center node and randomly walks to neighbors with a probability proportional to edge weights, with a chance to return to the center node. The solution is expressed in closed form with a tradeoff parameter between random walk and restart. The converged solution for quantifying proximity between nodes in a graph is expressed in closed form. The parameter c controls the decay rate of the fingerprint, adapting to both the graph structure and learning task. Gaussian-based and RWR-based fingerprint weights are illustrated, with RWR considering salient local structures. The RWR method considers salient local structures, biasing contours towards dense subgraphs. This structural attractor effect emphasizes densely interconnected neighbors, improving evaluation of node similarities and graph attention/classification performance. The algorithm utilizes structural fingerprints and content details in the GAT framework to compute attention coefficients between nodes. Features and structural fingerprints are used to evaluate interaction, and scores are incorporated in the attention layer for message passing to update node features. Multiple steps of message passing are applied in the graph with n nodes. The algorithm in the GAT framework uses structural fingerprints and content details to compute attention coefficients between nodes. It evaluates content and structural interactions between nodes using weighted Jacard similarity. The GAT algorithm utilizes structural fingerprints and content details to calculate attention coefficients between nodes, considering smooth versions of min/max functions. Feature similarities and structural interactions are normalized and combined using transfer functions before performing message passing to update node features, especially beneficial for multi-head attention scenarios. Our model calculates two attention scores simultaneously: content-based e ij and structure-based s ij, combining them. Each attention head has parameters for content-based attention (W and a) exploring node features, and structure-based attention (c) exploring structural fingerprint decay rate. By learning an optimal mixture of the two attentions, our model allows different node feature subspaces and local graph structures to interact, useful for exploring complex real-world data. The local receptive field is limited to a k-hop neighborhood around each node, considering both structural and content-based attention when the distance is below a threshold k. The complexity of structure exploration in graph convolutional networks is O(n|N k|), where |N k| is the averaged k-hop-neighbor size. Node representation is updated using the adjacency matrix and embedding matrix. The GAT method replaces the fixed adjacency matrix with an inductive, trainable approach. Summary statistics of benchmark graph-structured datasets used in the experiment are provided in Table 1. Our method introduces a mixed attention mechanism that combines both structural and content information for message passing. Unlike previous approaches, our attention is not solely based on graph adjacency or one-hop neighbors but adapts local receptive fields through learning. Additionally, we leverage structural details such as density and topology of local connections, enhancing graph classification performance. Other works have explored using attention to identify discriminative graph parts like \"graphlets\" or \"motifs\". In this section, experimental results of the proposed method and state-of-the-art algorithms using graph-based benchmark datasets for transductive classification are reported. Baseline algorithms such as Gaussian Fields, Manifold Regularization, Deep Semi-supervised learning, and link-based classification are compared. The codes for the proposed method can be downloaded from a Github link provided. In this section, various graph-based algorithms for transductive classification are compared using benchmark datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. These algorithms include Deep-Semi, Link-based classification, Deep-Walk, Planetoid, GCN, Chebyshev filters with GCN, and Mixture-CNN. Each dataset represents a citation network where nodes are documents and edges represent citation links. Only 20 labeled samples are used for each node in a transductive setting. In a transductive setting with limited labeled samples, the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The algorithm's performance is evaluated based on classification precision on the test split. The network structure follows the GAT method, utilizing two layers of message passing with attention heads for feature transformation. The GAT method utilizes two layers of message passing with attention heads for feature transformation. The number of parameters is 64(d + C), with 8 attention heads used in the second layer for the Pubmed dataset. Optimization is done using Adam SGD with a learning rate of \u03bb = 5 \u00d7 1e \u2212 4. The structural fingerprint range is set to 3-hop neighbors. Various models' performance metrics are listed, with GAT achieving 83% accuracy. Experimental results in table 2 show that the proposed method, with variations ADSF-Nonparametric and ADSF-RWR, consistently outperforms baseline methods on benchmark datasets. The approach uses random walk with re-start to build fingerprints, with slight improvements over other methods. The method has a few additional parameters compared to GAT, which are negligible in terms of computational cost. The proposed method, ADSF-RWR, outperforms baseline methods on benchmark datasets. It adds around 30 extra parameters to the GAT model, which is negligible in terms of computational cost. Experimental results show that ADSF-RWR converges faster and achieves higher accuracy compared to GAT. The method utilizes higher-order neighborhood information through structural fingerprints, leading to more stable performance. The structural fingerprint construction scheme involves selecting k-hop neighbors and adjusting node weights for optimal size. The optimal neighborhood order is two, with significant benefits from considering higher-order neighbors. Systematic exploration of higher-order graph structures can significantly improve learning performance in RWR. The optimal choice of the re-start probability parameter c is around 0.5 for 2-hop neighbors. Back-propagation can be used to optimize c based on the neighborhood range k. The non-parametric decay profile shows higher weights for first and second-order neighbors, with third-order neighbors having almost zero weights. The study explores the impact of neighborhood size in GAT, showing that higher-order neighbors have minimal contribution to computing structural attention. Performance evaluation indicates that using 1-hop neighbors yields the best results, suggesting that gains are not solely due to a larger attention domain. Detailed discussions can be found in the supplementary material. In this work, an adaptive structural fingerprint model is proposed to encode complex topological and structural information of the graph for improving node representations through attention. Future directions include exploring varying fingerprint parameters, applying structural fingerprints in graph partitioning and community detection, extending the approach to graph-level classification, and studying semi-supervised learning tools. The study focuses on the generalization performance of a semi-supervised approach for node embedding and classification. An empirical study on the Graph Attention Network (GAT) performance with larger neighborhood sizes is conducted, showing that GAT performs best when considering only 1-hop neighbors for attention scores. Larger neighborhoods may introduce noisy vertices, leading GAT to prefer smaller neighborhoods. Our approach leverages structural fingerprints to explore a wider collection of higher-order neighbors while removing the impact of irrelevant nodes, leading to performance gains not solely attributed to considering larger neighborhoods."
