The Congress acknowledges that multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease affecting the central nervous system, with symptoms ranging from mild numbness to severe paralysis or vision loss. Those with severe forms of MS may require home care or nursing home placement, but most prefer to receive care at home. Approximately 80 percent of home care is provided by caregivers. Family caregivers, mostly women, provide around $306 billion in unpaid care annually for individuals with MS. The average caregiver is 60 years old, spends over 20 hours per week caregiving, and has been doing so for over 13 years. The pool of potential caregivers is decreasing, with a projected ratio of 4 to 1 by 2050. Employers face a total estimated cost of $17.1 billion for full-time employees with intensive caregiving responsibilities. Adult day programs can provide a range of services to seniors, people with disabilities, and younger adults with chronic diseases, including medical care, rehabilitation therapies, assistance with daily activities, nutrition therapy, and social interaction. Programs geared towards individuals with severe MS offer important benefits such as symptom management, reduced dependency, socialization opportunities, and improved quality of life. MSADP programs offer benefits to people with MS such as improved functional status, reduced medical costs, and social support. However, there are limited MSADPs in the US, making it difficult for many individuals with MS to access these services. MSADP programs offer benefits to people with MS, but they are not typically designed for younger adults with chronic diseases like MS, lacking appropriate services for age-related or disability needs. Establishment of adult day programs. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will conduct a survey of existing adult day programs for individuals with multiple sclerosis, identifying successful programs and their funding sources. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will establish and fund best practices for successful MSADPs and similar adult day programs, including program guidelines, scope of services, and performance goals. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will establish a grant program for awarding grants annually to support MSADPs and similar adult day programs, based on the results of a survey evaluating program success. A competitive grant program is established to award grants annually to eligible entities for funding MSADPs and similar adult day programs. Eligible entities must demonstrate an understanding of the special needs of individuals with multiple sclerosis or similar diseases, as well as the challenges faced by family caregivers. A competitive grant program is established to award grants annually to eligible entities for funding MSADPs and similar adult day programs. Eligible entities must demonstrate an understanding of the special needs of individuals with multiple sclerosis or similar diseases, as well as the challenges faced by family caregivers. The Assistant Secretary for Aging has selection requirements, including the capacity to provide recommended services and limitations on the grant amount relative to the entity's operating budget. The fair market value of in-kind contributions is considered part of the operating budget. Grant recipients will be selected within 90 days of establishing the program. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will award annual grants under a new program, ensuring diverse geographic representation among recipients. A minimum number of entities will be selected as grant recipients for each fiscal year, based on the availability of appropriations. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will award annual grants to a minimum of 15 entities for the fourth fiscal year. A report will be produced annually on the grant program, detailing adult day programs funded, performance goals, and indicators for monitoring progress. The Act aims to address the needs of individuals with multiple sclerosis or similar chronic diseases and support their family caregivers. It also includes plans for improving oversight of the grant program.
