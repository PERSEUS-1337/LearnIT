    "content": "The Act titled \"Combating Lead Poisoning Through Nutrition Education Act of 2018\" establishes a Nutrition Outreach Program to address lead exposure. The Secretary of Agriculture will implement a nutrition education program called \"Well Fed Means Less Lead\" to raise awareness about the harmful effects of lead exposure and the role of nutrition in preventing it, especially in children. Grants will be provided to eligible entities for carrying out campaigns under this program, with priority given to areas with high numbers of children with elevated blood lead levels. The \"Well Fed Means Less Lead\" program requires eligible entities to conduct outreach using culturally competent approaches and campaigns responsive to community needs. They must reach a breadth of eligible households and individuals, with a limitation of 15% of funds per entity per fiscal year. Grants must be used for specific purposes outlined in the program. Grants under the \"Well Fed Means Less Lead\" program can be used for community education campaigns, outreach on foods that reduce lead impact, targeting outreach through community organizations, and implementing strategies to increase awareness. The \"Well Fed Means Less Lead\" program aims to increase consumption of specific foods and nutrients through culturally competent materials and community training. It also promotes participation in Federal nutrition programs to improve nutrition and reduce lead absorption. The \"Well Fed Means Less Lead\" program aims to engage with various local entities to mobilize community partnerships around healthy eating and lead poisoning prevention. It also aims to refer low-income individuals to foods that provide essential nutrients for a lead-protective diet. The term \"food pantry\" refers to entities such as federally recognized Tribes, urban Indian organizations, local education agencies, or federally qualified health centers. The term \"Secretary\" specifically refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2019 through 2023."
