    "content": "The federal government spent $138.9 billion in FY2012 on research and development, with one-third allocated to intramural R&D by federal laboratories. Government R&D has led to innovations like antibiotics, plastics, airplanes, computers, and bioengineered drugs. Proponents of technology transfer believe that technologies from federal labs could have market value if further developed by the industrial community. Technology transfer is the process of moving technology developed in one organization to another for different purposes. It can involve legal rights transfer or informal knowledge exchange. The transfer of technology involves the movement of information, knowledge, and skills through person-to-person interaction. The success of this transfer relies on the actual use of the product or process. Despite the strong research enterprise in the United States, other countries are sometimes better at commercializing research results. The commercialization level of federally funded research remained low in the 1970s and 1980s, with only about 10% of patents being utilized. The successful transfer of technology depends on market needs and commercial applications. Federal laboratory R&D is driven by public sector needs rather than commercial interests, leading to challenges in technology transfer. Barriers include costs and the lack of perceived market demand for certain technologies. Studies estimate that research makes up 25% of costs in bringing new products to market. Despite potential benefits of government-funded research, there are added costs of commercialization. Industry unfamiliarity with new technologies, ownership issues, and complex transfer processes hinder successful technology transfer. Successful transfer often requires direct interaction between committed individuals. Technology transfer is most successful with one-to-one interaction between committed individuals in the laboratory and industry or government. \"Champions\" are essential for completing the transfer process. It should be approached on a case-by-case basis to consider the needs and constraints of all parties involved. The federal interest in technology transfer from government labs to the private sector is driven by the need for goods and services, but the government lacks the mandate and capability to commercialize research results. Federal R&D efforts focus on technology transfer to bring federally generated technology to the business community for development and commercialization, promoting economic growth and increasing productivity. Technological progress plays a significant role in the growth of the U.S. economy and long-term economic growth. Successful technology transfer leads to economic benefits when products or services are brought to the marketplace. Technology transfer from federal laboratories can lead to increased employment and income at the firm level. Collaboration with the private sector allows federal scientists to access advanced technical information. It also helps companies transition from defense contracts to civilian manufacturing. Successful technology transfer efforts have impacted industries like commercial aviation, advanced ceramics, and biotechnology. The evolution of the biotechnology sector is influenced by the increasing demands on state and local governments for improved goods and services. Technology transfer from government laboratories to state and local jurisdictions can help meet these needs and fulfill responsibilities imposed by federal legislation. The concept of \"public technology\" involves adapting new or existing technology to public sector needs, which is a complex procedure. State and local governments are focusing on technology transfer from federal laboratories to boost private sector innovation and economic growth. This involves adapting technology to meet local needs and fostering an entrepreneurial climate through programs supporting high-tech businesses. Collaboration between federal laboratories and state/local personnel is key in this process. State and local governments collaborate with federal laboratories to promote innovation and technology transfer to private sector firms. Various programs, including the Ben Franklin Partnership in Pennsylvania, involve state universities, private companies, and federal laboratories to meet specific needs. Legislative initiatives like the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 facilitate technology transfer from federal to state and local jurisdictions and the private sector. Several laws and practices have been established to encourage the private sector to utilize knowledge and technologies from federal R&D efforts. The Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC) plays a key role in coordinating technology transfer among government levels and to the private sector. The Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC) was established in the 1970s to facilitate the transfer of DOD technology to state and local governments. It later expanded to include other federal departments, with a membership of over 600 laboratories. The FLC's mission is to promote the use of technical knowledge developed in federal agencies by networking member laboratories with various entities, including state, local, and private industry. The Federal Laboratory Consortium for Technology Transfer (FLC) facilitates the transfer of technology from federal laboratories to private industry for commercialization. The FLC does not directly transfer technology but assists in improving technology transfer efforts. It serves as a clearinghouse for requests for assistance and is funded by a set-aside of 0.008% of each agency's R&D budget. In 1980, the U.S. Congress enacted the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 mandated technology transfer from federal laboratories to state, local governments, and the private sector, legitimizing and formalizing the transfer efforts previously not required by federal departments and agencies. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 mandated technology transfer from federal laboratories to external entities. It established mechanisms for federal agencies to transfer technology, requiring each department with a laboratory to allocate funding for transfer activities. Laboratories must have an Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA) to identify technologies with potential for application elsewhere. The Federal Technology Transfer Act, through various amendments to Stevenson-Wydler, allows government-owned laboratories to enter into cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with universities and the private sector. CRADAs are specific legal documents that define collaborative ventures and are developed at the laboratory level with limited agency review. The laboratory director can make decisions to participate in CRADAs to expedite technology transfer. P.L. 106-398 allows labs to approve CRADAs themselves. Work under a CRADA must align with the lab's mission. Labs can receive funds, personnel, and services from collaborators and provide support, but direct funding to partners is prohibited. Under CRADAs, labs can allocate funding from R&D accounts to support technology transfer. The Energy Department used to rely on competitive selection processes for funding, but now programmatic funds are used. The laboratory director can grant title to inventions to the collaborating entity and waive government ownership rights. This differs from other patent laws that require small businesses to have ownership of inventions made under federal R&D funding. The law requires inventions made under federal R&D funding to be given to small businesses, not-for-profits, and universities, with the government retaining a license. Conflict of interest restraints apply to federal employees, and preference is given to cooperative ventures with small businesses or companies manufacturing in the US. Between FY2005 and FY2009, there were approximately 3,700-4,200 traditional CRADAs active each year in the United States. P.L. 99-502 allows for cash awards to federal laboratory personnel for advancing scientific or technological developments with commercial value. Federal employees involved in inventions are entitled to at least 15% of royalties from patent licensing. The Stevenson-Wydler Act allows federal employees to obtain title to inventions, with provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act and the Technology Transfer Improvements and Advancement Act facilitating technology transfer to small businesses. The latter act guarantees industrial partners the option of an exclusive license for resulting inventions made solely by them. The 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act included provisions to promote technology transfer, establishing the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and programs like the Advanced Technology Program and Regional Manufacturing Technology Transfer Centers. The 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act established programs like the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and Regional Manufacturing Technology Transfer Centers to promote technology transfer. The ATP provided seed funding to accelerate the development of generic technologies with broad applications, with 824 projects funded by $1.6 billion in federal dollars matched by $1.5 billion from the private sector. NIST, in response to increased federal funding, identified key areas for long-range support including information infrastructure for healthcare, DNA diagnostics, software tools, manufacturing composite structures, and more. The ATP competitions were general until FY1999 when NIST dropped focused areas in favor of one open competition for all technology sectors. The America COMPETES Act created the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) to replace the Advanced Technology Program, promoting high-risk R&D for economic benefit. TIP awarded grants to small and medium-sized businesses, unlike ATP which was open to companies of all sizes. Joint ventures in ATP required two separately owned for-profit firms, while TIP allowed for-profit companies to collaborate. A joint venture under the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) could involve two separately owned for-profit companies or a small/medium-sized firm and a university. ATP provided up to $2 million for three years with no cost-sharing requirement for small/medium-sized companies. In contrast, the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) offered up to $3 million for three years with a 50% cost-sharing requirement for eligible small/medium-sized businesses. ATP had no funding limits for joint ventures, while TIP limited funding to $9 million for five years. The Advisory Board for ATP included industry and government representatives. In January 2009, nine awards were announced for new research projects to develop advanced sensing technologies for monitoring the structural health of infrastructure. $42.5 million in federal money was expected to be matched by $45.7 million in private sector support. In December 2009, twenty more awards were announced totaling almost $71.0 million in NIST financing with approximately $145.7 million in funding from other sources. Thirteen projects focused on monitoring and inspection of civil infrastructure, while four were in advanced repair. In December 2010, nine projects in various areas received awards of over $22 million, with federal funding expected to be matched by $24 million in private sector support. No new TIP awards were made in FY2011, and the $44.8 million appropriated for the program in P.L. 112-10 was used for ongoing projects. No FY2012 funds were allocated for TIP, but the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act created regional centers to assist small manufacturing companies with technology. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act created regional centers to assist small manufacturing companies with technology developed by federal agencies like the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Seven Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology were selected and are operational in different regions of the United States. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) was created in 1994 to meet new community needs, expanding from the original program. It involves large centers, smaller organizations, and the NIST State Technology Extension Program to transfer technology from the federal government to the private sector. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) was created in 1994 to transfer technology from the federal government to the private sector through centers in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. NIST awarded approximately 400 regional offices for extension activities, with additional funding from the Department of Defense. The America COMPETES Act authorized a new NIST program for partnerships between industry and educational institutions to develop manufacturing processes, techniques, or materials. NIST also announced $9.1 million in cooperative agreements in October 2010. In October 2010, NIST awarded $9.1 million in cooperative agreements for 22 projects aimed at enhancing U.S. manufacturers' productivity and global competitiveness. The funding was granted competitively to non-profit organizations working with MEP centers on critical manufacturing areas. This effort differs from traditional MEP activities by focusing on new manufacturing research and technology application for small and medium-sized firms, aligning with the patent system's goal of promoting innovation. The patent system grants inventors exclusive rights to their creations, encouraging innovation and competition. Originally providing a 17-year lead time for development, the term has now been changed to 20 years from filing date. Obtaining a patent discloses the idea to the public, stimulating further inventions. Ownership of patents from federally funded research affects technology transfer to the private sector. The transfer of technology from federal laboratories to the private sector involves the government retaining title to inventions and issuing licenses to companies. There is debate over whether companies need title or an exclusive license to invest in commercialization. Only about 10% of federally patented ideas are used in the private sector. Some argue that title should remain in the public sector where it is accessible to all interested parties. The Congress has accepted the proposition that vesting title to contractors will encourage commercialization, especially for small businesses, universities, and not-for-profit institutions. President Reagan ordered agencies to treat all contractors equally in terms of title vesting, but this lacks legislative basis. Changes in patent laws were made by the enactment of P.L. 98 - 620. The enactment of P.L. 98 - 620 brought changes in patent laws that affect technology transfer from federal laboratories to the private sector. Title V allows decisions on awarding licenses for laboratory patents at the laboratory level, with contractors receiving royalties for additional research, inventor awards, or education. A cap on royalties ensures alignment with the agency's mission, while discretionary funds provide incentives for technology transfers. The Federal Technology Transfer Act (P.L. 98 - 620) allows private companies of any size to obtain exclusive licenses for government patents for the full patent life. Government laboratories run by universities or nonprofits can retain title to their inventions. Large company-operated federal laboratories are not included. The Act also grants all companies the right to retain title to inventions resulting from research under cooperative R&D agreements with government labs, with the government retaining a royalty-free license. The Federal Technology Act allows government agencies to retain a portion of royalty income from patents, with the majority going to the laboratory where the invention was made. Laboratories can keep up to 5% of their annual budget plus 25% of excess funds for expenses, personnel rewards, education, and training. The remaining excess funds return to the Treasury. The Technology Transfer Commercialization Act, signed into law in 2000, made it easier for federal agencies to license inventions by decreasing the time needed to obtain exclusive or partially exclusive licenses on federally owned patents. The law shortened the period for publicizing technology availability and intent to license to 15 days, recognizing the Internet's ability for widespread notification and industry's time constraints. Certain rights are retained by the government, and licenses for existing government-owned patents are allowed. The CREATE Act, P.L. 108-453, amended patent laws to promote cooperative research and development among universities, government, and the private sector. It allows licenses for existing government-owned inventions to be included in CRADAs. P.L. 102-564 created a pilot program to facilitate commercialization of R&D by small companies through the Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR). The Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR) provides federal funding for research and development projects. Phase I funding of up to $100,000 is available for one year to test concepts, while Phase II awards of $500,000 can be granted for two years of research. Funding for commercialization comes from a set-aside of R&D budgets of departments spending over $1 billion annually. The program has been reauthorized multiple times, with the latest extension through September 30, 2017. The Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR) provides federal funding for research and development projects. Phase I funding increased to $150,000 and Phase II to $1 million under the new law. Federal laboratories have a mandate to transfer technology but not to assist the private sector in commercialization. The missions of federal laboratories are under review. The missions of federal laboratories are under review due to budget constraints and changing world situations. National security is being redefined to include economic well-being. Discussions are ongoing about expanding the responsibilities of federal R&D establishments to assist the private sector. Various initiatives may facilitate technology transfer under the current responsibilities of government laboratories. The federal laboratories are exploring augmented cooperative R&D, increased private sector involvement, and expanded commercialization activities. Concerns arise about transferring defense technologies to commercial companies, fairness in selecting partners, and foreign access to scientific information. Congressional laws aim to facilitate technology transfer for U.S. success. Over the past 30 years, Congress has enacted laws to promote cooperative R&D between government, industry, and academia. These laws include tax credits for industrial payments to universities, changes to antitrust laws, government patent policies, and technology transfer from federal labs. The goal is to encourage collaboration, reduce R&D risks and costs, and develop new technologies and manufacturing processes. Perspectives on joint R&D and technology transfer are mixed. The legislative activity surrounding cooperative research and development agreements is open to discussion. Both national political parties have supported measures to facilitate technological advancement. There are indications of a potential refocus on federal support for basic research and indirect measures to encourage technology development in the private sector. CRADAs are a means to transfer government-funded basic research to the industrial community for commercialization. The Advanced Technology Program faced opposition but continued to receive funding until it was replaced by the Technology Innovation Program with reduced support. The Technology Innovation Program replaced the Advanced Technology Program with reduced support, and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership had its budget cut but funds were restored the following year. The role of the federal government in technology transfer and commercialization may be further explored as Congress decides on R&D funding."
