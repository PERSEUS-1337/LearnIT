    "title": "AB 2218",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 19855 of the Business and Professions Code states that individuals required to hold a state license must obtain it before engaging in the relevant activity. Section 19858 is also amended regarding licensing regulations. Section 19858 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to deem a person unsuitable for a state gambling license if they have a financial interest in any gambling business prohibited by Penal Code Section 330. Exceptions include publicly traded racing associations, qualified racing associations, and individuals licensed before February 1, 2013. The amended Section 19858 of the Business and Professions Code states that a person may be deemed unsuitable for a state gambling license if they have a financial interest in a prohibited gambling business. Exceptions apply to publicly traded racing associations, qualified racing associations, and individuals licensed before February 1, 2013. Additionally, a person may be disqualified if they have a financial interest in a gambling establishment located on or near a racetrack where horserace meetings were authorized before January 1, 2012. The gambling establishment described in paragraph (3) may be owned by a racetrack limited partnership owner, which is defined as a limited partnership primarily capitalized by institutional investors, employee benefit plans, or investment companies managing state university endowments. Within six years of reopening, a person with a financial interest in a closed business engaging in prohibited gambling must divest their interest or in the gambling enterprise. They must inform the commission within 30 days if the business starts prohibited gambling activities. During the six-year divestment period, cross-promotion or marketing between a gambling business and a prohibited gambling establishment is prohibited. Cross-promotion includes offering customers anything of value related to visiting or gambling at the prohibited gambling business. During the six-year divestment period, funds for capital improvements of prohibited gambling establishments cannot come from gaming revenues. If individuals do not divest their interests after this period, the prohibitions of Section 19858 apply. The City of Inglewood must submit a report on the progress of the City of Champions Revitalization Project by July 1, 2018. The report should address the impact on the divestment requirement outlined in the Business and Professions Code. The report must comply with Government Code Section 9795 and this section will be repealed on July 1, 2022. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the City of Inglewood due to unique circumstances surrounding the City of Champions Revitalization Project and its impact on the divestment requirement in the Gambling Control Act. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. However, if the Commission on State Mandates finds other mandated costs, reimbursement will be made to local agencies and school districts."
