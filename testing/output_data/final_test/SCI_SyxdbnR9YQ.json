    "content": "In this work, the problem of concept drifts for time series data is addressed, specifically focusing on analyzing temporal inconsistency in streaming wireless signals for device-free passive indoor localization using WiFi CSI data. A robust system for room level localization is proposed, tackling the challenge of data distribution shifts over time. By introducing a phase and magnitude augmented feature space and a standardization technique, the system shows improved learning accuracy and requires less retraining, mitigating the impact of concept drift on predictive performance. The predictive performance of passive WiFi-based localization systems relies on a static relationship between input and output in machine learning models. Concept drift causes degradation in model accuracy over time, requiring frequent retraining with new labeled data. Changes in patterns can be abrupt or gradual, necessitating automatic adaptation of deployed solutions. Concept drift in WiFi-based localization systems poses a challenge that needs to be addressed. The problem of concept drift in WiFi-based localization systems was first mentioned in BID2, which utilizes off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled devices for passive sensing. An online semi-supervised approach is applied to detect shifts in the feature space and propose an adaptive learning strategy. Both sudden and gradual drifts can occur in streaming WiFi data, affecting model performance. Existing WiFi-based indoor localization systems are device-based, requiring the user to carry a WiFi-enabled target device at all times. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of device-based approaches in WiFi localization and the potential of device-free and passive solutions. Existing research has focused on addressing drifts and inconsistencies in WiFi fingerprints for stationary subjects, but most experiments were conducted in controlled environments. The need to account for concept drift over time due to real-world conditions like WiFi channel switches or environmental factors is highlighted as a gap in current methods. The paper introduces feature augmentation using phase and magnitude of CSI data to create a more robust model for WiFi localization. It addresses the limitations of existing methods in handling drifts and inconsistencies in real-world conditions. Sections discuss the nature of WiFi CSI data, drift effects on feature space, sanitization procedures, training strategies, and model performance. In wireless communication, Channel State Information (CSI) is crucial for understanding signal propagation. The CSI reflects variations in the channel due to factors like scattering and fading. A WiFi channel at 5GHz was considered, implementing an OFDM system with 56 subcarriers. The receiver and transmitter each have 4 antennas. The CSI measurement involves 16 links or streams with 4 antennas each for the receiver and transmitter. The channel frequency response is a complex number defined for each subcarrier and stream. The system generates a 3-dimensional complex gain matrix. WiFi mesh variations are shown for an empty capture and one with walking in a room, illustrating the effect of drift on the WiFi mesh over time. The methodology discussed involves constructing a new feature space less affected by concept drift in the data distribution. Starting with sanitizing raw CSI data, methods include incorporating phase and magnitude, filtering RSSI drops, and addressing interference and fading effects. Multiple subcarriers and streams are considered to mitigate drift impacts. The process involves extracting phase information from CSI data, normalizing amplitudes, and calculating L2 norm for rescaling values. Previous research on phase extraction from CSI highlighted extensive preprocessing. Stability of phase for consecutive antennas in a 5GHz OFDM channel is utilized for feature augmentation. In an OFDM channel, phase difference between successive antennas is stable. Phase correction is performed for stream 1-2, stream 2-3, and stream 3-4 to lie within the range (-\u03c0, \u03c0). A Hampel filter is used with a large sliding window of 300 samples and a small threshold of 0.01 to remove DC component and detrend phase data. Another Hampel filter with a smaller sliding window of 15 samples and threshold of 0.01 is used to remove high frequency noise from phase data. In OFDM channels, phase correction is applied to stabilize the phase difference between successive antennas. A Hampel filter is used to remove DC component and detrend phase data, with different window sizes and thresholds. The raw phase information is compared to phase difference data between antennas in Figure 3. Feature augmentation and standardization techniques are discussed to create a robust feature space for WiFi CSI data. The feature space includes CSI magnitude for 8 streams and phase difference data from the first four streams. The text discusses the creation of a robust feature space for WiFi CSI data by combining magnitude and phase information. The feature space is standardized to remove mean and scale to unit variance. Figures 4 and 5 show the impact of drift on the feature space. The next section explores the results of different learning algorithms on this augmented feature space. The training strategy involves using classical machine learning algorithms on an enriched feature space. Offline training and online prediction methods are discussed, with models trained on un-drifted data and tested on drifted data. Performance comparison of learning algorithms is done on magnitude data, phase data, and combined data for stability. We train data offline using Support Vector Machines (SVM), BID3, and Random Forest algorithms. An incremental learning framework is utilized for streaming data and concept drifts. Performance analysis is conducted for different frameworks to determine suitability for real-time localization. Data collection starts from apartments of varying sizes and layouts, using Tx and Rx devices for experiments. The experiment involves capturing data in different rooms of two apartments. For Apt 1, 5 rounds of data are collected with a channel switch before the 5th round to induce drift. For Apt 2, 6 rounds of data are collected, with 3 rounds taken 12 hours apart. For Apt 3, 3 rounds of data are captured with varying time intervals between each round. The layout of the three apartments where the experiments were conducted is shown in FIG3. Despite a high-dimensional dataset, dimensionality reduction using PCA resulted in poor classification accuracy, so no reduction was performed. For experiments, learning algorithms are trained on rounds with no drift and tested on rounds with gradual and abrupt drifts. Unsupervised clustering analysis was done to evaluate location partitioning based on WiFi propagation. Elbow analysis showed that WiFi mesh distortions can be categorized based on walking or physical activities in different areas of the apartment. FIG4 displays the elbow analysis for Apt 1 with 6 labeled locations. Increasing clusters from 6 to 8 did not significantly reduce distortion. The increase from 6 to 8 clusters did not reduce distortion significantly, indicating that labeling the data accurately represents the different distributions due to motion. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers were used for offline training, with SVM chosen for its effectiveness in high dimensional spaces and memory efficiency. SVM was implemented for non-linear classification using RBF kernels, while Random Forest creates decision trees for sub-samples to improve performance. In this section, an incremental learning algorithm is presented based on a proposed feature space. The algorithm allows the model to continuously extend its knowledge and adapt to new data without forgetting existing knowledge. The performance of classifiers trained on rounds with no drift and tested on rounds with drift is compared, along with the training time of the base learners for real-time indoor localization. The incremental learning algorithm presented adapts quickly to changes in data distribution by using an SVM with hinge loss and L2 regularizer. Model parameters are updated for each round with augmented feature space to minimize drift. Testing shows that the proposed stable feature space outperforms using only phase or magnitude features for multi-class classification. The augmented feature space consistently performs better and is more resistant to drifts in streaming data scenarios. In the case of streaming data, the incremental SVM shows better performance with augmented feature space for representing WiFi CSI in localization. A comprehensive study was conducted to address drifts in WiFi CSI data for indoor localization. The proposed combined feature space is robust to drifts and allows for stable online prediction without the need for retraining models. The proposed feature space allows for applying deep convolution neural network to capture vital information in an RGB image for future work."
