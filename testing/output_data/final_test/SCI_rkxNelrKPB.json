    "content": "Various gradient compression schemes have been proposed to reduce communication costs in distributed training of large-scale machine learning models. Sign-based methods, like signSGD, are gaining popularity due to their simplicity and connection to adaptive gradient methods. This paper presents a general analysis of sign-based methods for non-convex optimization, focusing on success probabilities without relying on specific noise distributions. The theory is extended to a distributed setting with a parameter server framework, showing exponential variance reduction with increasing nodes while maintaining 1-bit compression in both directions. Experimental validation of the theoretical findings is also conducted. The success of modern machine learning models relies on large training data. Deep learning models in industry use datasets too large for a single computer, so data is split across compute nodes. Stochastic gradient descent is a popular algorithm for training these models. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for training machine learning models using large datasets split across compute nodes. Workers compute random approximations of gradients, which are aggregated at a master node and broadcast back for parameter updates. Communication bottleneck is addressed by compression schemes for gradient updates. Sign-based compression schemes, like signSGD, are used to reduce the number of communicated bits in distributed machine learning. Biased schemes, such as those based on communicating signs of update entries, often outperform unbiased schemes. SignSGD, a simple sign-based method, constructs update directions from component-wise signs of stochastic gradients. Sign-based compression schemes like signSGD reduce communicated bits in distributed machine learning. ADAM, a popular adaptive optimization method, has convergence and generalization issues. Investigating signSGD behavior can enhance understanding of ADAM convergence. Key results are summarized in Table 1. Bounded variance assumption is stronger than bounded second moment assumption. The bounded variance assumption is stronger than the bounded second moment assumption. The entropy of probability distribution under the bounded variance assumption is bounded, while under the SPB assumption it could be arbitrarily large. Gaussian distribution has the maximum differential entropy for a given variance. Two methods for 1-node setup are studied for minimizing a smooth non-convex function. The key novelty lies in a substantial relaxation of the requirements on the gradient estimator. The text discusses the relaxation of requirements on the gradient estimator \u011d(x k) for sign descent methods to converge. A key assumption is that the signs of \u011d(x k) entries must match the signs of \u2207f(x k) entries with a probability greater than 1/2. Additionally, a mixed l1-l2 geometry is uncovered, and complexity analysis shows improved dependence on smoothness parameters for convergence. The text discusses signSGD for non-convex functions without mini-batching, introducing a novel \u03c1-norm function. Results are extended to distributed settings with sign-based compression. An assumption on gradient estimator \u011d(x) is crucial for method success. The text introduces the concept of success probabilities \u03c1 i in sign-based methods, emphasizing the importance of Assumption 1 on gradient noise. This assumption can be relaxed by replacing bounds, but if Prob(sign\u011d i (x) = 0) = 0, then the bounds remain identical. The paper discusses extending theory to more general sign-based methods with a stochastic sign oracle, without the need for unbiasedness or uniform boundedness of variance. It presents a counterexample to signSGD in a least-squares problem scenario. The paper presents a counterexample where signSGD remains stuck along a line despite having a unique minimizer at the origin. The cause of divergence is investigated, showing that the problem violates Assumption 1 due to low success probabilities in an entire conic region. The paper discusses a counterexample where signSGD gets stuck along a line despite a unique minimizer at the origin. It is shown that the issue arises from low success probabilities in a conic region, violating Assumption 1. The stochastic gradient's sign is ineffective in this region, leading away from the minimizer. The SPB assumption is justified under general gradient noise conditions. In this section, a norm-like function called \u03c1-norm is introduced, induced from success probabilities, to measure gradients in convergence rates. It serves as a technical tool for the analysis. The \u03c1-norm is a technical tool used to measure gradients in convergence rates, derived from success probabilities. It is not a norm but is positive definite under the SPB assumption. The \u03c1-norm can be lower bounded by a weighted l 1 norm with positive constant weights. Additionally, it can be lower bounded by a mixture of the l 1 and squared l 2 norms, which are positive definite, continuous, and order preserving. The properties of the l 1,2 norm are important for measuring convergence rates under the SPB assumption. The norm is equivalent to scaled l 2 norm squared when iterations are near a minimizer, and scaled l 1 norm when they are away. These observations are supported by Figure 1 and previous research. The l1,2 norm properties are crucial for measuring convergence rates under the SPB assumption. The general convergence results for signSGD under the SPB assumption are presented, along with results in the distributed setting under specific noise assumptions. The convergence result for Algorithm 1 under the SPB assumption is stated, showing convergence to a neighborhood of the solution with specific step sizes. This is the first general result on signSGD for non-convex functions without mini-batching and with step sizes independent of the total number of iterations. The convergence rates under the SPB assumption for signSGD can be slow depending on probabilities \u03c1 i. Extreme cases include completely random gradient noise leading to divergence, and no gradient noise resulting in a rate of \u00d5(1/ \u221a K) with respect to the l 1 norm. The presence of the \u03c1-norm in the convergence rates of signSGD suggests no specific geometry associated with the method. The rates support the practice of using a constant step size for a period of time before halving it. Theorem 2 provides a general convergence rate for Algorithm 1 with Option 2 under the SPB assumption. Option 2, Theorem 2 under the SPB assumption, Algorithm 1 with step sizes \u03b3 k = \u03b3 0 / \u221a k + 1 converges. A small modification in Algorithm 1 can remove the log-dependent factor from (6), bounding the average of past gradient norms. Option 2 is useful when function evaluations are feasible and rough estimates about gradients are available, within derivative-free optimization. The convergence result of distributed signSGD (Algorithm 2) with majority vote is presented in this part. The distributed signSGD algorithm with majority vote in a parameter server framework is discussed, showing convergence under certain assumptions. The algorithm involves nodes sending signs to the server, which then returns the majority sign. Convergence rates are analyzed for different step sizes in distributed training with a new norm introduced. The distributed signSGD algorithm in a parameter server framework shows convergence with majority vote. Convergence rates are analyzed for different step sizes, with variance reduction proportional to step size \u03b3. The expected sign vector at the master remains the same with M = 2l \u2212 1 and M = 2l nodes, indicating exponential variance reduction in terms of number of nodes. The distributed signSGD algorithm in a parameter server framework shows convergence with majority vote. The addition of more nodes does not improve convergence in distributed training, as verified experimentally with the MNIST dataset and Rosenbrock function. Increasing the number of nodes does not lead to significant improvement in expectation. The distributed signSGD algorithm in a parameter server framework shows convergence with majority vote. Increasing the number of nodes improves the convergence rate, supporting the claim that there is no improvement from 2l \u2212 1 nodes to 2l nodes. The robustness of SPB assumption in convergence rate is demonstrated with different noise levels, showing the correlation between success probabilities and convergence rate. Performance of signSGD with variable step size under different noise levels is also analyzed using the Rosenbrock function. The experiments analyze the relationship between success probabilities and convergence rate under different noise levels using the Rosenbrock function. Varying step sizes reveal oscillations in low success probability regimes and improved convergence in high success probability regimes. Different step sizes are tested to observe divergence and convergence to the minimizer. The study demonstrates the impact of noise levels on the performance of the distributed signSGD algorithm in a parameter server framework. The text discusses Gauss's inequality on unimodal distributions and its application to symmetric distributions. It also mentions improving the bound with a second-order term and defining the l1,2-norm in a more complex form. The content is related to sufficient conditions for success probabilities and convergence rates in the context of the distributed signSGD algorithm. The text presents sufficient conditions for success probabilities in the distributed signSGD algorithm, focusing on gradient estimators and variance reduction. Three lemmas are introduced to establish success probability bounds based on mini-batch size, with a condition on mini-batch size ensuring the SPB assumption. The proof involves Chebyshev's inequality and assumes non-zero mean, positive variance, and finite 3rd central moment for i.i.d. random variables. The error function erf is defined, and the proof approximates the average of random variables by a normal distribution. The proof involves using the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the distribution of i.i.d. random variables with a normal distribution. Success probabilities are computed using the error function erf, and the approximation error in CLT is taken into account. The Berry-Esseen inequality is applied to analyze the rate of approximation in CLT, with considerations for high randomness and small randomness scenarios. The variance and third moment play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the ratio \u03bd/\u03c3, which can lead to a trivial inequality when \u03bd/\u03c3 approaches infinity. The Central Limit Theorem is utilized to analyze the rate of approximation, with implications for success probabilities and mini-batch size conditions. The lemma establishes conditions for i.i.d. random variables with non-zero mean and finite variance, highlighting the importance of the SPB assumption. The SPB assumption holds if \u03c4 \u2264 2\u03c3^2/\u00b5^2. The convergence analysis of Algorithm 1 (Option 2) shows that the function value does not increase in any iteration. The proof of Theorem 3 follows similar steps as Theorem 1, with the derivation (16)-(19) replaced by a lemma involving stochastic signs aggregated from nodes."
