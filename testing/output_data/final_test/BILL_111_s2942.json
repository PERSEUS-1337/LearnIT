The Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010 mandates the establishment of a program within the FDA for investigating nanoscale materials in FDA-regulated products. The program aims to assess the toxicology and effects of nanoscale materials on biological systems, as well as their interactions with biological systems. The Administration is tasked with developing information on nanoscale materials' behavior with biological systems, promoting collaborative efforts for understanding toxicity and measurement methods, collecting and disseminating scientific data on interactions, and building scientific expertise on nanoscale materials. The Administration ensures ongoing training, dissemination of new information, participation in consensus standards activities, and other necessary activities. A program manager supervises planning, management, and coordination of the program. The program manager is responsible for developing a strategic plan, coordinating with other agencies, and establishing cooperative arrangements to achieve technical goals. The Secretary is required to submit reports to the Committee on Health, Education by specific dates. The Secretary must submit a report to relevant committees on the program goals, funding levels, and coordination with other agencies. Authorization of $25,000,000 is provided for the program. The Secretary must submit a report to relevant committees on program goals, funding levels, and coordination with other agencies.
