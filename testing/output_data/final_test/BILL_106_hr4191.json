    "content": "The Act titled \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act of 2000\" requires ballast water treatment regulations. The \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act of 2000\" mandates regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species within the Great Lakes, specifically focusing on ballast water discharge from vessels. The Secretary of Transportation is required to issue regulations ensuring that ballast water does not contain aquatic nuisance species and that the safety of vessels, crew, and passengers is protected. These regulations apply to all vessels capable of discharging ballast water. The regulations for ballast water discharge in the Great Lakes require vessels to conduct discharge or exchange of ballast water before entering the area, or within the Great Lakes in compliance with regulations. Environmentally sound treatment methods like sterilization are mandated to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species. Different vessel operating conditions are taken into consideration. The regulations for ballast water discharge in the Great Lakes require vessels to conduct discharge or exchange of ballast water before entering the area, or within the Great Lakes in compliance with regulations. Measures include sterilization to prevent infestations of aquatic nuisance species, certification by vessel masters, compliance assurance through sampling procedures and record inspections, sanctions for non-compliance, use of best scientific information, and not superseding any discharge requirements in the United States. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act requires the sterilization of ballast water to remove all living organisms through filtration, biocides, ultraviolet light, or thermal methods. The Secretary of Transportation shall maximize public participation in the issuance of regulations required by the amendment made by subsection (a) by publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, reaching affected persons through electronic means, providing the text of the proposed rule electronically, and allowing at least 120 days for public comment. The Secretary must issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking within 30 days and final regulations within 180 days after the enactment of the Act, allowing for public comment and setting an effective date at least 30 days after publication."
