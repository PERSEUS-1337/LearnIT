    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations acts, primarily for rental assistance programs like Public Housing and Section 8. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low- and moderate-income families. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) is a formula grant program administered by HUD and funded through contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It received its first annual funding in 2016. The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) is funded by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The program received its first annual funding in 2016 and is expected to receive funding in 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 allocated $48.1 billion for HUD, representing a $1 billion increase from FY2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 allocated $38.8 billion for HUD, a $1 billion increase from FY2016. The funding increase is mainly for tenant-based rental assistance and project-based rental assistance, maintaining services for low-income families. The largest relative increase is for HUD's lead hazard reduction programs. Additionally, $400 million in disaster assistance was provided through the CDBG program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 allocated $38.8 billion for HUD, with a $1 billion increase from FY2016. The funding increase is mainly for tenant-based rental assistance and project-based rental assistance, maintaining services for low-income families. The largest relative increase is for HUD's lead hazard reduction programs. Additionally, three continuing resolutions provided funding for most federal agencies through December 9, 2016, and then through April 28, 2017, with appropriations for disaster relief grants through HUD's Community Development Block Grant program. The House Appropriations Committee approved a FY2017 THUD appropriations bill (H.R. 5394) on May 24, 2016, with $38.7 billion in net discretionary budget authority for HUD. This includes approximately $48 billion in new gross budget authority for HUD's programs and activities, along with over $9 billion in savings from offsets and receipts. The FY2017 THUD appropriations bill included over $9 billion in savings from offsets and receipts, with about $1 billion more in new gross budget authority compared to FY2016. The Senate considered the bill before House action, using the House-passed version of the FY2016 THUD bill as a basis. The FY2017 THUD appropriations bill, including the text of the FY2017 THUD appropriations bill as reported by the committee (S. 2844) and the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill, was approved by the full Senate on May 19, 2016. The bill proposed $48.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD's programs, a 3% increase from FY2016. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget request included $48.9 billion in gross discretionary funds. The FY2017 budget request for HUD included $48.9 billion in gross discretionary appropriations, a 4% increase from FY2016. Congress approved $47 billion in appropriations for HUD in FY2016. Table 2 compares funding information for HUD between FY2016 and the FY2017 President's budget request. The FY2017 President's budget request for HUD included $48.9 billion in gross discretionary appropriations, a 4% increase from FY2016. More than three-quarters of appropriations for HUD supports three programs: Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance, Section 8 project-based rental assistance, and the Public Housing program, serving over 4 million low-income households. The tenant-based rental assistance account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, renewing over 2 million vouchers annually. The tenant-based rental assistance account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, renewing over 2 million vouchers annually. The cost of renewing existing vouchers is a contentious issue due to changes in market rents and tenant incomes, making it difficult to estimate. The President's budget requested a $766 million increase for renewing existing Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers in 2016. Both the House committee-passed bill and the Senate bill proposed less funding than requested, with the House bill including $135 million less and the Senate bill proposing $92 million less. Both bills would have allowed the Secretary to reallocate unused prior-year funding to supplement FY2017 allocations. The FY2017 allocations for the Housing Choice Voucher program were deemed sufficient to support all vouchers in use, with the final appropriations level for renewals falling between the Senate and House proposals. PHAs receive fees based on the number of vouchers leased, but Congress has not always fully funded these fees, leading to reduced payments. The President's budget requested a $427 million increase for the program. The President's budget requested an increase of $427 million in administrative fee funding for the Housing Choice Voucher program. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications stated that the funding level would be sufficient to fund fees under a new formula being developed. The final FY2017 appropriations law maintained administrative fees at FY2016 levels. Incremental vouchers are distributed by HUD to PHAs to serve additional families, with the primary source being the Veterans Affairs Supported Housing program. The primary source of new vouchers in recent years has been the Veterans Affairs Supported Housing (VASH) program, providing vouchers and supportive services for homeless veterans. The Family Unification Program (FUP) also receives funding for additional vouchers for families in the child welfare system and youth aging out of foster care. The President's budget requested funding for new vouchers for homeless families with children and to renew tribal VASH vouchers. The Senate-passed bill proposed funding for FUP and VASH vouchers. The FY2017 appropriations law allocated $20 million for FUP vouchers and $57 million for VASH vouchers. The bill prioritized new FUP vouchers for youth and extended the time limit to 36 months. $7 million was designated for tribal VASH vouchers. The final law funded $10 million for FUP vouchers and $47 million for VASH vouchers, including tribal renewals. The Housing Choice Voucher program allows families to move with their vouchers. Mobility moves can lead to better opportunities for families. The President's budget requested $15 million for a mobility demonstration to support families with vouchers. The funds would provide counseling and evaluation services. The House committee-passed bill did not include funding for mobility. The final FY2017 appropriations law does not fund the $11 million mobility demonstration proposed in the Senate-passed bill. The Section 8 project-based rental assistance account administers and renews existing contracts between HUD and property owners for subsidized housing. Newly subsidized units have not been added to the program since the early 1980s. The Section 8 project-based rental assistance account funds contracts between HUD and property owners for subsidized housing. Renewing contracts requires new annual appropriations once old contracts expire. Some contracts lack sufficient funding, necessitating amendment funding. This account has grown to become the second-largest in HUD's budget, funding performance-based contract administrators. The President's budget request includes $10.581 billion for contract renewals and $235 million for administrators. The President's budget requested less funding than needed for PBRA contract renewals and PBCA funding. The budget assumed savings from transition to calendar year funding and policy changes. Both Senate and House bills proposed more funding for PBRA contract renewals than requested. Neither bill included the proposed change to medical expense deductions. The final FY2017 appropriations law funds PBRA at $10.816 billion, less than requested by the President and included in the Senate and House committee-passed bills. It funds PBCAs at the requested level and permits the use of recaptures and carryover to supplement the appropriated funding level for the Public Housing program. Created in 1937, the program provides publicly owned and subsidized rental units for very low-income families. Public Housing receives federal funding under two primary accounts, making it the third-highest funded program in HUD's budget. The operating fund helps fill the gap between tenants' rent contributions and maintenance costs, while the capital fund supports capital projects and modernization. Choice Neighborhoods is an initiative to revitalize distressed public and assisted housing. Choice Neighborhoods is an initiative that provides competitive grants to revitalize distressed public and assisted housing properties and their surrounding communities. It expands eligibility beyond public housing to include other HUD-assisted properties. Operating fund dollars are allocated to PHAs based on property characteristics, with appropriations sometimes being insufficient to fully fund PHAs' formula eligibility. The President's Budget for FY2017 would cover an estimated 87% of PHAs' formula eligibility. The FY2017 appropriation law funds the Operating Fund below the President's request, leading to a lower proration level. The President's budget requested less funding for the Capital Fund and a new set-aside for the \"ConnectHome\" initiative to expand broadband access in public housing. The President's budget proposed to eliminate funding for the Resident Opportunities and Supportive Services (ROSS) set-aside in public housing. The House committee-passed bill included more funding for set-asides than FY2016, slightly reducing the amount available for formula grants. The Senate-passed bill proposed a $25 million increase for the Capital Fund, with a decrease in formula grants but funding for the ROSS set-aside at the FY2016 level. It did not include funding for \"ConnectHome\" but allocated $25 million for competitive grants to address lead-based paint hazards in public housing. The final FY2017 appropriation law includes more funding for the Capital Fund than requested, with an increase in formula grants and new funding for competitive lead-based paint hazard mitigation grants. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) allows units funded through HUD-assisted housing programs to convert to project-based Section 8 rental assistance or Housing Choice Vouchers. RAD has never received funding before. The President's FY2017 budget request included $50 million to fund the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) program, allowing units that cannot undergo a cost-neutral conversion to participate. Proposed program changes include eliminating the cap on the number of units that can convert under RAD and prohibiting the rescreening of tenants. Additionally, RAD may be expanded to allow for the conversion of units with Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) assistance under the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program. The Senate-passed bill proposed expanding the RAD program to include the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program, with $4 million allocated for PRAC conversions. It also suggested raising the cap on public housing units participating in RAD from 180,000 to 250,000 and prohibiting rescreening of residents. The final FY2017 appropriations law increased the cap to 225,000 but did not include the President's request for PRAC unit expansion. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is a key source of financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization and economic development. It provides grants to various communities to address housing and development needs. The President's budget for FY2017 requested $2.88 billion for this program. The President's budget for FY2017 requested $2.88 billion for the Community Development Fund, including $2.8 billion for grants under the CDBG program and $80 million for grants for Indian tribes. The proposed funding levels differed from FY2016, with a decrease for CDBG and an increase for Indian tribes. HUD planned to advance a legislative package of CDBG reforms, including reducing small grantees and streamlining program cycles for grantees. The Administration proposed increasing the percentage of CDBG funds allocated to states near the border with Mexico for use in colonias. The House committee-passed bill would have funded CDBG at FY2016 levels, while the Senate-passed bill would have maintained funding at $3 billion. Additionally, $60 million would have been allocated for the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG). The bill proposed funding the Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program at $60 million for FY2016. It included provisions to create a new Indian Block Grant account and prohibited the exchange of CDBG funds. The final appropriations law allocated $3 billion for CDBG entitlement communities, states, and insular areas, with an additional $60 million for ICDBG activities. The final appropriations law allocated $3 billion for CDBG entitlement communities, states, and insular areas, with an additional $60 million for ICDBG activities. The law does not include provisions to increase the percentage of CDBG targeted to colonias or transfer ICDBG funds to a new Indian Block Grant. FHA insures private mortgage lenders against losses on certain mortgages, making mortgage credit more widely available and at a lower cost. The HUD budget administers programs through two main accounts: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) for single-family home loans and FHA-insured reverse mortgages, and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund (GI/SRI Fund) for mortgages on multifamily buildings and healthcare facilities. FHA insurance funds cover costs of federal loan guarantees. Federal loan guarantees are reflected in the budget as the net present value of expected future cash flows from insured loans. If cash inflows exceed outflows, the program has a negative credit subsidy, resulting in offsetting receipts that can offset other costs in the HUD budget. The MMI Fund historically has a negative credit subsidy, with offsetting receipts being a significant source of offsets in the budget. The President's budget request estimates the amount of FHA offsetting receipts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that FHA programs will generate nearly $8 billion in offsetting receipts in FY2017, compared to nearly $7.8 billion in FY2016. The MMI Fund's single-family mortgage insurance programs are projected to earn $7.4 billion, a slight increase from the previous year. FHA historically has a negative credit subsidy, so appropriations are not needed to cover loan costs. The President's budget requested $160 million for FHA's administrative contract expenses, $30 million more than FY2016. The House and Senate bills proposed $130 million for administrative expenses, with no authority for FHA to charge lenders a fee. Senate committee report included resources for Information Technology. The Senate committee report included resources in the Information Technology account for specific purposes, but the final FY2017 law did not grant the requested fee authority. The President's budget requested the authority to insure up to $400 billion in new mortgages under the MMI Fund and up to $30 billion in new mortgages under the GI/SRI Fund in FY2017, which was approved in the final appropriations law. HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control administers programs to reduce lead hazards. The Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration program and Healthy Homes Initiative received increased funding in FY2017, with the final appropriations law allocating $145 million. The Senate bill included policy changes for HUD's oversight of lead-paint regulations in HUD-assisted housing. HUD is aligning its blood-level standards with CDC, implementing enhanced inspection, monitoring, and reporting requirements for lead-based paint hazards in HUD-assisted housing. Increased funding for PHAs to address lead-based paint hazards in public housing is included, along with a GAO study on HUD's oversight. The final appropriations law maintains some directives from the Senate bill, requiring a GAO report with an expanded focus and HUD to report on its activities. The Fair Housing Act mandates certain grantees to comply, including communities receiving CPD formula grants and PHAs. In July 2015, HUD issued a final rule changing how CPD grantees and PHAs comply with the requirement to affirmatively further fair housing. The rule has been controversial, with over 1,000 comments received when the proposed rule was published in June 2013. Commenters raised concerns about the requirements. In June 2013, HUD received over 1,000 comments expressing concerns about the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule. Commenters questioned the authority of local jurisdictions, raised cost issues for small jurisdictions and PHAs, and were uncertain about enforcement. Amendments in the FY2016 and FY2017 appropriations bills aimed to restrict funds for enforcing the rule but were not successful. The Senate adopted an amendment, S.Amdt. 3970, to prohibit funds in the appropriations bill from directing specific changes to zoning laws for the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule. The final appropriations law includes this provision. Another amendment, S.Amdt. 3905, would have prevented funding in the bill from providing housing assistance to individuals convicted of a broader range of crimes than currently restricted under federal law. The amendment aimed to restrict housing assistance for individuals convicted of aggravated sexual abuse, murder, human trafficking, and child pornography. The Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) is a key policy for flood risk management established by President Obama. Section 236 of the House Appropriations Committee-reported FY2017 THUD appropriations bill would have prohibited funding for implementing the FFRMS. The FY2017 appropriations bill aimed to restrict funding for implementing the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS) until specified reports were made to Congress. HUD appropriations are part of the annual Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, which complies with budget resolution limits influenced by the Budget Control Act. The budget resolution sets spending and revenue levels for Congress, enforceable by a point of order. It allocates funds to House and Senate committees, which then distribute them to subcommittees for appropriations bills. While it doesn't determine specific funding amounts, it provides parameters for decision-making. The House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution for FY2017. The Senate did not adopt a budget resolution for FY2017, so the Senate Budget Committee chair filed budgetary levels in the Congressional Record. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported initial 302(b) suballocations, including $56.474 billion for the THUD subcommittee. The House Appropriations Committee adopted interim 302(b) suballocations, with $58.190 billion for the THUD subcommittee in H.Rept. 114-606. The Budget Control Act was enacted in 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the budget deficit through spending limits and reductions. It imposed statutory limits on discretionary spending each fiscal year from FY2012 through FY2021, with separate limits for defense and nondefense spending. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked to develop a deficit reduction plan by January 15, 2012, but when a plan was not enacted, a one-time sequestration of nonexempt discretionary spending occurred in FY2013. (Sequestration involves automatic, across-the-board spending reductions.) The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed spending limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021, with separate limits for defense and nondefense. Sequestration was triggered in FY2013 due to the failure of a deficit reduction plan. Amendments to the BCA have altered the scheduled spending reductions, with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 lessening reductions for FY2016 and FY2017. Sequestration will be imposed if discretionary funding exceeds the limits in each fiscal year. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposed spending limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021, with sequestration triggered in FY2013. Amendments extended sequestration through FY2024 for nonexempt programs."
