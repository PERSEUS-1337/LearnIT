    "content": "The Act titled \"Veterans Timely Access to Health Care Act\" establishes a pilot program within the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve access to medical care for veterans. During a five-year pilot program, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs will ensure that veterans seeking primary care at specified medical facilities receive care within 30 days of contacting the Department. The program will be conducted in Veterans Integrated Service Network 8, and the Secretary will review facility performance regularly. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will provide an annual report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives assessing the Department's performance in meeting care standards. If unable to meet access standards for a veteran, the Secretary can authorize care at non-Department facilities under certain conditions. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can authorize care at non-Department facilities for veterans if access standards are not met. Payments by the Secretary must not exceed the reimbursement rate for similar outpatient services under the Medicare program, and the facility cannot bill the veteran for any difference in charges. Veterans can choose to receive care at a Department facility after 30 days of receiving care at a non-Department facility. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can authorize care at non-Department facilities for veterans if access standards are not met. Veterans can choose to receive care at a Department facility after 30 days of receiving care at a non-Department facility. The Secretary shall develop a form for veterans to authorize the Secretary to obtain records from non-Department facilities. Quarterly reports on waiting times for veterans seeking appointments at covered facilities must be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. Quarterly reports on waiting times for veterans seeking appointments at covered facilities must include the total number of veterans waiting in different categories based on waiting periods, along with distinctions between these categories. The pilot program for reporting waiting times for veterans seeking care at Department of Veterans Affairs facilities will terminate five years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the reports must include distinctions between waiting times for primary care and specialty care, as well as for newly enrolled veterans versus those enrolled before October 1, 2001. The reports should also detail the number of veterans who have enrolled but have not sought care at a Department medical facility."
