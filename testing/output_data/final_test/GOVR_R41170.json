The United States is a member and donor to five major MDBs, including the World Bank and regional banks like the African Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Congress plays a key role in shaping U.S. policy at MDBs through funding and oversight. This report gives an overview of MDBs and highlights key issues for Congress, such as their operations, organizational structure, and effectiveness of financial assistance. The second section discusses Congress's role in MDBs, including legislation authorizing U.S. contributions and oversight. The third section covers policy debates on MDB effectiveness, aid trade-offs, and U.S. commercial interests. MDBs provide financial assistance through loans and grants for various projects and initiatives. Policy-based loans are provided by MDBs to developing countries in exchange for policy reforms. These loans can also offer budgetary support. Concerns have been raised about the increasing budgetary support from MDBs, traditionally provided by the IMF. MDBs have two major funds for financial assistance, including non-concessional assistance through loans, equity investments, and loan guarantees. The MDBs provide non-concessional assistance through equity investments and loan guarantees to middle-income and creditworthy low-income governments, as well as private-sector firms in developing countries. Concessional assistance, in the form of loans at below-market interest rates and grants, is offered to low-income countries. The World Bank Group consists of three subinstitutions that provide financial support to developing countries: IBRD, IDA, and IFC. The World Bank Group consists of three subinstitutions: IBRD, IDA, and IFC. The IBRD was the first affiliate created in 1945 with near universal membership. IDA provides concessional loans and grants to the poorest countries, while IFC extends loans and equity investments to private firms. The IFC, created in 1955, provides loans and equity investments to private firms in developing countries. The IDB, established in 1959, focuses on social projects and policy-based loans, with a history of both non-concessional and concessional lending. The IDB Group also includes the Inter-American Investment Corporation. The AfDB, established in 1964, initially focused on African countries but later opened up to non-regional members. It created the African Development Fund in 1973 for concessional lending. The AfDB provides loans to private-sector firms through its non-concessional window and does not have a separate fund for private-sector projects. The AsDB, established in 1966, focuses on financing private-sector projects in the region. It has a concessional lending facility, the Asian Development Fund (AsDF), created in 1973. In 2017, concessional lending was transferred to the AsDB. The AsDB makes loans to private-sector firms through its non-concessional window. The EBRD, founded in 1991, aims to ease the transition of former communist countries to free-market economies. The EBRD, established in 1991, supports democracy-building activities and focuses on the private sector in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It does not have a concessional loan window and provides financial assistance to governments in the region. The World Bank Group accounted for half of total MDB financial assistance commitments to developing countries in 2017. The MDBs provided financial assistance to developing countries on non-concessional terms, with stable funding until the global financial crisis. In response to the crisis, the IBRD and regional development banks increased lending. Non-concessional assistance fell post-crisis but has been rising again in recent years. The MDBs have been providing concessional financial assistance to developing countries since 2000. The World Bank's IDA has grown steadily over the decade, while regional development bank concessional lending facilities have remained stable. Top recipients of MDB financial assistance in 2017 include Brazil, India, China, Turkey, Nigeria, Vietnam, Nepal, and Afghanistan. MDBs provide financial assistance to developing countries through various forms of support, funded by member countries' contributions. They use non-concessional loans to cover operating costs and transfer surplus income for concessional aid programs. MDBs borrow from international capital markets with member governments' guarantees, backed by ownership shares. The MDBs' capital shares consist of paid-in capital and callable capital, with only a small portion paid upfront. Callable capital serves as a guarantee for additional funds if needed. MDBs have not used paid-in capital for loans but have kept it in reserves. They can borrow from capital markets due to member countries' financial backing. The MDBs can borrow money at low market rates and lend it at lower rates to borrowers. Donors increase capital subscriptions to meet growing loan demand. During financial crises, MDBs may undergo general capital increases (GCIs) to boost members' shares, unlike selective capital increases (SCIs) which adjust voting shares. GCIs are rare, with all MDBs experiencing one post-2008 crisis. U.S. holds the largest share in IDB at 30% of subscribed capital. The United States is the largest donor to MDBs' non-concessional facilities, with significant contributions to various regional banks. Other top donor states include Western European countries, Japan, and Canada. Regional members like China, India, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Russia also make substantial contributions to different MDBs. The funds for MDBs' lending windows come from member countries, with more prosperous countries contributing the most. Net income from non-concessional windows is transferred to concessional lending windows. Replenishments of resources occur every three to five years to ensure continued aid to low-income countries. Failure to replenish on time may lead to reduced aid levels. The United States has been the largest donor to MDB concessional lending facilities, particularly to IDA. Other top donor countries include Japan, Canada, and Western European nations. The World Bank and regional development banks operate independently and are not affiliated with the United Nations. The MDBs must comply with U.N. Security Council directives but are not subject to decisions by the U.N. General Assembly. Each MDB is run by its own management and supervised by a Board of Governors and a Board of Executive Directors. The Board of Governors, representing member countries, meets annually to make key decisions. The United States is represented by the Treasury Secretary. The Board of Executive Directors in MDBs have authority over operational policy and decision-making, with each institution having its own smaller board. Members, including major donors like the United States, are represented on the board. Meetings are held regularly to consider loan proposals and policy decisions, with voting based on financial contributions. The United States has significant voting power in MDBs, allowing it to veto major policy decisions. However, it cannot unilaterally veto day-to-day decisions like individual loans. Congress authorizes and appropriates U.S. contributions to MDBs, with oversight from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the House Committee on Financial Services. Legislation is required for U.S. contributions to MDBs. The Foreign Operations Subcommittees of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations manage MDB authorization legislation, which has historically been included in other legislative vehicles. The Administration's budget request for MDBs includes funds for concessional lending windows, non-concessional lending windows, and targeted funds for initiatives like climate change. The Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) receive funds for concessional and non-concessional lending windows, as well as targeted initiatives like climate change. MDBs increased non-concessional windows in response to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The President delegates authority over U.S. participation in MDBs to the Secretary of the Treasury, who appoints U.S. Governors and Executive Directors with Senate approval. Senate oversight is exercised through confirmation. The Senate exercises oversight through the confirmation process for U.S. participation in Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). Congress has enacted legislative mandates to regulate U.S. involvement in MDBs, including directing how U.S. representatives can vote on policies. Examples include mandates related to financial assistance for specific countries and projects. The U.S. Executive Directors are directed by legislative mandates to support financial assistance for specific projects and countries, such as those contributing to efforts against international terrorism. They are also instructed to advocate for policies within Multilateral Development Banks, such as increasing loans for population, health, and nutrition programs. The U.S. Executive Directors are mandated to communicate procurement opportunities for U.S. firms and advocate for specific policies within Multilateral Development Banks. Congress has also passed legislation requiring reports on MDB issues, including governance and anti-corruption measures. Congress has influenced policies at Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) by withholding funding or attaching stipulations on the use of funds to combat corruption. The United States has historically played a strong leadership role at MDBs, shaping policies and lending to developing countries to promote U.S. foreign policy and economic interests abroad. The Trump Administration proposed cutting U.S. funding for Multilateral Development Banks by $650 million over three years compared to previous commitments. In the FY2019 budget request, a 20% cut ($354 million) was requested for Treasury's international programs, including MDBs. The FY2019 budget request includes a significant reduction in funding for Multilateral Development Banks, with a proposed cut of $650 million over three years compared to previous commitments. The bulk of the Treasury international programs request would fund U.S. commitments to concessional lending facilities at the MDBs, with specific allocations to IDA, AsDF, and AfDF. Additionally, a capital increase for the IBRD was endorsed in April 2018, requiring congressional legislation and appropriations for implementation. Congress determines U.S. funding for MDBs as part of the State and Foreign Operations authorization and appropriations process, amidst ongoing debates about the effectiveness of foreign aid provided by MDBs. Many studies on foreign aid effectiveness analyze total aid given to developing countries, including bilateral and multilateral aid. Results vary, with some studies showing aid promotes economic growth, while others suggest it is ineffective. Critics argue Multilateral Development Banks focus on disbursing funds rather than delivering aid effectively. Many Multilateral Development Banks prioritize disbursing funds to developing countries over delivering effective aid. Critics point out that MDBs focus on short-term outputs like reports and frameworks, neglect long-term project evaluation, and impose heavy administrative burdens on recipient governments. Concerns also arise about MDB financing crowding out private-sector investment in developing countries. Despite these criticisms, proponents argue that MDB aid plays crucial economic and political roles. Foreign aid serves vital economic and political functions by providing basic necessities like food supplements, vaccines, nurses, and education to the world's poorest countries. Proponents argue that it is essential for human dignity and survival, despite criticisms about its effectiveness in raising economic growth. Analysts suggest reforms to increase the effectiveness of Multilateral Development Banks. Reforms proposed for Multilateral Development Banks include adopting more flexible financing arrangements, clearer guidelines for countries to \"graduate\" from receiving financial assistance, and debates on prioritizing bilateral or multilateral aid for better control over fund allocation. Bilateral aid offers strategic importance by building a clear link between donor and recipient countries, garnering goodwill. Multilateral aid allows donors to share development project costs and enforce policy reforms through organizations, serving as a scapegoat for politically sensitive conditions. In 2017, 14% of U.S. foreign aid for economic and social development went through multilateral institutions, while 86% was bilateral. The BRICS countries established the New Development Bank (NDB) with a $100 billion capital base in July 2015. The New Development Bank (NDB) was launched in July 2015 with a $100 billion capital base. China also established the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in October 2014, focusing on infrastructure development in Asia. The AIIB has 66 members and 21 prospective members, including advanced European and Asian economies, but not the United States and Japan. The AIIB's initial total capital is expected to be $100 billion. Proponents argue that new MDBs are necessary to meet the financing needs of developing countries and address governance issues in existing institutions like the World Bank and the IMF. The NDB emphasizes equal voting rates for participant countries. Some analysts are concerned about the impact of new MDBs on existing institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, questioning if they will diminish their influence. They also worry about mission creep, lack of clear division of labor, and whether the new institutions will adopt best practices. Emerging markets are top recipients of non-concessional financial assistance from the World Bank. The Obama Administration lobbied allies to refrain from joining the AIIB, but efforts were largely unsuccessful. Key allies in Europe and Asia, including the UK and South Korea, joined. During Chinese President Xi's visit to Washington in September 2015, the US welcomed China's contributions to financing development. Xi committed that the AIIB would adhere to international standards and pledged increased financial contributions to the World Bank and regional development banks. The Trump Administration continues to support existing institutions like the World Bank and regional development banks. Congress may oversee the administration's policy towards new MDBs. Billions of dollars in contracts are awarded to private firms annually for projects funded by MDBs. U.S. commercial interest in MDBs, especially in infrastructure projects, may be a focus for Congress. Foreign Commercial Service representatives play a role in protecting U.S. interests in MDBs. Foreign Commercial Service (FCS) representatives at MDBs protect and promote American commercial interests. Concerns arise over possible budget cuts to U.S. FCS, as other countries may increase support for their businesses bidding on MDB-financed projects."
