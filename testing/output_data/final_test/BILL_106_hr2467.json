    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Worker Paycheck Fairness Act of 1999\" and includes findings related to worker pay fairness. The Congress finds that workers should not be required to pay dues supporting non-essential activities of labor organizations, which often use dues for purposes unrelated to representing employees in labor-management issues. Workers paying dues or fees lack information on their rights and how labor organizations use the funds. It is essential for individuals to have the right to make informed choices about the causes they support. The Act aims to ensure workers have information about their rights regarding dues and fees to labor organizations and the use of funds. It also protects workers' right to make informed choices about the causes they support. The Act requires labor organizations to obtain prior written authorization from employees for any dues or fees used for non-essential activities. Employees must agree to this authorization, ensuring they are informed and have a choice in supporting causes. The Act mandates labor organizations to secure written authorization from employees for dues used in non-essential activities, which can be political, social, or charitable. The authorization remains valid until revoked with a 30-day notice. Violations result in liability for damages to affected employees. The Act allows employees to recover damages and seek equitable relief against labor organizations in court. Employees can file a lawsuit individually or on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The court may also award attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other costs to the plaintiff. Employees can bring an action against a labor organization within 2 years of discovering dues or fees misuse, extending to 3 years for willful violations. SEC. 5. NOTICE: Employers with union-represented employees must post a notice informing them that any union collecting dues must have written authorization for non-essential activities. SEC. 6. DISCLOSURE TO WORKERS. (a) Expenses Reporting.--Labor organizations must report expenses in detail to allow members to determine if they were necessary for representing employees in labor-management issues.\n(b) Disclosure.--Members and employees paying dues to the organization must be informed about expenses, and written requests must be made. The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 requires labor organizations to report expenses in detail for transparency. Written requests can be made to the Secretary for complete copies of any filed reports or documents. SEC. 7 prohibits labor organizations from retaliating against employees for exercising their rights under the Act. SEC. 8 pertains to regulations. SEC. 8. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Labor must issue regulations to implement section 5 within 60 days and the amendments from section 6 within 120 days of this Act. The Federal Election Commission will assist in providing analysis comparing this Act with related provisions under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPLICATION. This Act will take effect immediately upon enactment, with sections 4 and 5 on worker consent and notice becoming effective 90 days later, and section 6 on disclosure becoming effective 150 days later."
