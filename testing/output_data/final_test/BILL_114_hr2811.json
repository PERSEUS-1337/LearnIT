    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Save Oak Flat Act\". Congress finds that Section 3003 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 authorizes the transfer of approximately 2422 acres of Forest Service land known as \"Oak Flat\" in the Tonto National Forest in Southeastern Arizona to a mining company called Resolution Copper. This transfer will result in the destruction of tribal sacred areas, prevent American Indians from practicing their religions and ceremonies, and have significant negative environmental impacts. Resolution Copper plans to use destructive block cave mining method to extract ore from Oak Flat area, causing surface subsidence and collapse, destroying a sacred place of worship. Tonto National Forest, where Oak Flat is located, was established in 1905 from ancestral homelands of Tonto Apache and other American Indians forcibly removed by the United States Army. The Tonto National Forest was established in the 1880s by the United States Army, with Apaches held as prisoners of war at the San Carlos Apache Reservation near Oak Flat until the early 1900s. Section 3003 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 bypassed proper legislative process, going against the will of the majority of House Members. Section 3003 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 was included without majority support from either the House or Senate, and an amendment to remove it was not allowed to be considered. American Indian tribes have ceded millions of acres of land and continue to practice their religions despite Federal assimilationist policies. The United States has a trust responsibility to protect tribal sacred areas on Federal lands, requiring consultations with affected Indian tribes. However, section 3003 of the National Defense Authorization Act mandates the conveyance of tribal sacred areas on Federal lands without considering tribal input, leading to strong opposition from Indian tribes nationwide. Section 3003 of the National Defense Authorization Act mandates the conveyance of Federal lands with significant religious, cultural, historic, and anthropological significance for Indian tribes to a private company, circumventing standard environmental review procedures. This will result in the destruction of tribal sacred areas and potential pollution of drinking water supplies. The inclusion of section 3003 in the National Defense Authorization Act sets a negative precedent for legislative process and Federal Indian policy. Repeal of section 3003 in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015."
