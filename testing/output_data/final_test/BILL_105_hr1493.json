It includes detailing Immigration and Naturalization Service employees to selected facilities, providing necessary funds for their full-time presence, access to relevant records, and pre-arraignment reporting to the court for removal intentions. The Attorney General selects incarceration facilities based on government ownership, location in areas with high alien concentrations, and submission of a request for participation in the program. The Attorney General selects incarceration facilities based on government ownership, location in areas with high alien concentrations, and submission of a request for participation in the program. The facility must incarcerate or process individuals before their arraignment on criminal charges. The total number of qualifying subdivisions meeting the standard varies each fiscal year, ranging from 10 to 100 or as specified in appropriations Acts. For any fiscal year, at least 20 percent of qualifying local political subdivisions must be in non-contiguous states. Incarceration facilities in Orange and Ventura counties in California owned by local governments and meeting specific requirements will be chosen for the program. The Attorney General must complete a study within 1 year of this Act's enactment to assess the feasibility of expanding the program to more locations by assigning one employee to multiple facilities and implementing off-site verification of immigration status for incarcerated individuals. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
