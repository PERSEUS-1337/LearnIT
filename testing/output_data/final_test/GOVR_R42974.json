    "content": "In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused severe damage on the East Coast, leading to disaster declarations in 12 states and the District of Columbia. The destruction raised constitutional concerns about federal assistance to religious organizations, with ongoing congressional interest in the issue. This report examines the rules governing federal funding for religious buildings and analyzes relevant court decisions. The report discusses the constitutional concerns surrounding federal funding for religious buildings, including recent court decisions and proposed legislation such as H.R. 3066. The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment prohibits government sponsorship of religious activities, but the analysis of public aid to religious organizations varies depending on the form of assistance provided. The Court has addressed the constitutionality of providing aid directly to religious organizations, including funding for construction and maintenance of religious facilities. Recent Establishment Clause jurisprudence suggests a shift in standards, with some courts allowing public funding for church renovations. In the 1970s, the Court examined the constitutionality of public funds for religious schools' facility construction and maintenance, limiting funds for buildings used for religious worship. In Tilton v. Richardson (1971), the Court upheld a federal program providing grants to colleges, excluding buildings for religious instruction or worship. The Court applied the Lemon test, analyzing if grants had a secular purpose, neutral effect on religion, and avoided government-religion entanglement. The Court upheld a grant program for school construction, stating it had a legitimate secular purpose and did not primarily advance religion. Financial aid limited to secular aspects of religious education was deemed acceptable, and grants for non-sectarian buildings controlled by religious institutions were not seen as entangling government and religion. The Court differentiated between aid to higher education institutions and elementary/secondary schools. The Court upheld a grant program for school construction, stating it had a legitimate secular purpose and did not primarily advance religion. Financial aid limited to secular aspects of religious education was deemed acceptable, and grants for non-sectarian buildings controlled by religious institutions were not seen as entangling government and religion. The Court differentiated between aid to higher education institutions and elementary/secondary schools, noting that the provision of funds for non-sectarian use did not violate the Establishment Clause. The Court also highlighted that the prohibition on religious use of facilities would expire after 20 years under the statutory authorization. The Court upheld a grant program for school construction, stating it had a legitimate secular purpose and did not primarily advance religion. In 1973, the Court issued decisions related to construction and maintenance funds for religiously affiliated buildings, upholding a state revenue bond program that financed construction at institutions of higher education. The program excluded buildings used for religious instruction or worship, and was found to have a secular purpose similar to the grant program previously upheld. The Court applied the Lemon test to a state program for construction funding, finding it had a secular purpose and did not advance religion. The program included clauses forbidding religious use in lease agreements to ensure no primary effect of advancing religion. This decision narrowed the possibility of public funding for religious institutions, following previous cases involving construction and maintenance funding for post-secondary religious schools. The Court found a state program unconstitutional as it provided funding without restrictions to religiously affiliated schools, leading to the direct subsidization of religious activities. The grants lacked appropriate restrictions on expenditures, allowing for the support of religious activities within the schools. The Supreme Court ruled against a state program that directly subsidized religious activities in sectarian schools, highlighting the constitutional prohibition on public funds for religious purposes. The Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence has evolved since the 1970s, with the Lemon test being a traditional standard for such cases, although alternative standards have been proposed by some Justices. The Supreme Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence has evolved since the 1970s, with Justice O'Connor proposing modifications to the Lemon test. The Court has also used a neutrality test to determine government actions' neutrality between religions and between religion and non-religion. Recent Court decisions show disagreement among Justices on the applicability of the Lemon test, with varying standards being used in Establishment Clause cases. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the provision of public funds to religious institutions for building repairs, citing a city's program to boost economic growth. The court found that the program's neutrality in administering grants indicated a secular purpose, allowing for reimbursement of costs incurred to refurbish building exteriors and parking lots without consideration of religious nature. The 6th Circuit court upheld the constitutionality of a city's program that provided grants for building repairs to a wide spectrum of religious and nonreligious groups, emphasizing the importance of neutrality in eligibility requirements and assistance provided. The court found that the program's secular purpose and neutral criteria met the Lemon test principles, allowing for the reimbursement of costs without consideration of religious nature. The court upheld the constitutionality of the city's program, emphasizing the importance of neutrality in eligibility requirements for grants to various religious and nonreligious groups. It stated that excluding churches from receiving public assistance would send a negative message of disapproval of religion, and highlighted that churches are eligible for emergency services and maintenance like other community groups. The court upheld the constitutionality of the city's program, emphasizing neutrality in grant eligibility for religious and nonreligious groups. Public funds were used for exterior renovations on downtown buildings, excluding items with religious content. The 6th Circuit differentiated the case from previous Supreme Court decisions, noting the limited one-time grant for cosmetic repairs in Detroit's program. The 6th Circuit upheld Detroit's program, allowing public funds for exterior renovations on buildings, including those with religious significance. The court emphasized that religious groups can participate in open-access programs without exclusion, highlighting the importance of historic preservation. Questions on funding for religious buildings arise in emergency assistance and historic preservation contexts. Federal assistance for disaster recovery and historic preservation has been controversial when aid is sought for religious facilities. FEMA has faced questions on providing aid to religious institutions after natural disasters. In 2002, FEMA sought an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel regarding providing disaster assistance to a religious school in Seattle. The Establishment Clause does not prohibit religious schools from participating in federal disaster assistance. The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) determined that the Establishment Clause does not prevent religious schools from receiving federal disaster assistance. FEMA distributes aid based on neutral criteria and providing aid to the school is similar to aid programs constitutional under Supreme Court precedent. OLC distinguished aid for public services like fire and police protection from construction and repair aid, concluding that religious institutions are entitled to generally available government benefits. OLC concluded that FEMA assistance to religious institutions should be analyzed under neutrality principles, not educational assistance principles. In a 2003 opinion, OLC found no Establishment Clause violation in using federal funds for a historic preservation grant to the Old North Church in Boston, noting concerns about government judgments on the value of religious enterprises. The OLC found no Establishment Clause violation in providing grants for historic preservation to religious institutions, as it serves a powerful interest in preserving sites of historic significance without regard to religious or secular character. The grants are available to a broad class of beneficiaries, including public and private institutions, without favoring religious institutions. OLC's opinions provide legal interpretations for the executive branch and may offer a plausible legal argument reflecting Supreme Court jurisprudence. The 114th Congress is considering legislation that would provide eligibility for FEMA recovery funds to houses of worship, following previous funding opportunities for religious institutions in federal aid programs. The 114th Congress is considering legislation to allow FEMA recovery funds for houses of worship, following past funding opportunities for religious institutions in federal aid programs. Funds from the SFSF program can be used for public school and higher education facility modernization, but not for religious purposes. This restriction mirrors previous limitations on funds for religious activities in education and social programs. The 114th Congress is considering legislation, H.R. 3066, to provide FEMA assistance for religious facilities damaged by Hurricane Sandy. This bill aims to expand the eligibility of facilities to receive FEMA assistance to include tax-exempt houses of worship. The 114th Congress is considering legislation, H.R. 3066, to expand FEMA assistance eligibility to include tax-exempt houses of worship and clarify that religious institutions' facilities are eligible for funding regardless of their religious character or primary purpose. Private nonprofit facilities damaged by disasters may receive financial assistance for repair, restoration, or replacement, but houses of worship are currently not explicitly included in the definition. H.R. 3066 aims to expand FEMA assistance eligibility to include tax-exempt houses of worship and clarify that religious institutions' facilities are eligible for funding regardless of their religious character or primary purpose. This legislation would allow federal funds to be used for repair, restoration, reconstruction, or replacement of churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other houses of worship, as well as private nonprofit facilities operated by religious organizations. H.R. 3066 would allow federal funds to be distributed to religious institutions for building and repair of facilities damaged by natural disasters without restrictions on the use of the funds for facilities with religious purposes, potentially violating the Establishment Clause. H.R. 3066 may violate the Establishment Clause by providing federal funds to houses of worship for building and repair without restrictions on religious use. The 6th Circuit and OLC opinions justify this departure based on the Court's shift towards neutrality in Establishment Clause jurisprudence, but it is uncertain if this shift applies to cases involving direct government aid. The Court's shift towards neutrality in Establishment Clause jurisprudence may not apply to cases involving direct aid to religious organizations for repair of facilities used for religious purposes. Previous cases have focused on equal access to public resources for religious groups, rather than direct government funding. These cases involve questions under both the Free Speech Clause and the Establishment Clause, not strictly under the Establishment Clause. The Supreme Court and the 6th Circuit have ruled favorably on one-time grants for building and repair funding for religious institutions. However, additional considerations must be satisfied, such as ensuring that the funds are not used to support religious worship. Reconstruction grants for disaster recovery are likely considered one-time grants, which do not establish a long-term relationship between the government and the religious institution. The 6th Circuit emphasized that renovation funds for houses of worship should be limited to exterior, cosmetic repairs and not used for religious content. There are concerns that FEMA funds provided to religious organizations after Hurricane Sandy could be used for reconstructing sacred parts of buildings, which may go beyond the court's lenient analysis. Congress has allowed religious organizations to participate in federally funded programs, such as receiving funding for social services. Congress has authorized funding for rebuilding a church after the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, allowing for the repair and reconstruction of religious institution facilities damaged by the explosion. The authorization for funding religious organizations in publicly funded programs does not imply constitutional permissibility. Congress has imposed restrictions on the use of funds for worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. The proposed expansion of the definition of private nonprofit facilities by H.R. 3066 includes providing essential governmental services to the general public. Including houses of worship in the list of examples broadens the scope of the definition of private nonprofit facilities that provide essential governmental services to the general public. Houses of worship that offer such services, like operating a food bank, may be eligible for assistance. However, eligibility may be questioned for facilities used solely for worship services. The eligibility of facilities used solely for worship services for FEMA assistance under H.R. 3066 is uncertain. The bill may need clarification on whether all houses of worship provide essential governmental services to qualify for funding. If not, it may face challenges in passing. The bill H.R. 3066 may face challenges in passing due to uncertainties regarding the eligibility of facilities used solely for worship services for FEMA assistance. The current language of the bill does not restrict houses of worship that qualify for funding from using the funds for sectarian purposes. Government funding for sectarian elements of religious facilities must include restrictions on the use of funds for sectarian purposes, as upheld by courts."
