    "content": "Alleged violations under the religion clauses require government action and standing. To enforce rights under the religion clauses, an individual must show government interference with those rights and have standing. Standing indicates an individualized harm under the law, such as being barred from religious services. Special exceptions to standing rules may apply in some Establishment Clause cases. The Court has recognized special exceptions to standing rules in Establishment Clause cases. Taxpayers generally do not have standing to sue the government over tax money use, but the Flast exception allows challenges under the Taxing and Spending Clause. The Establishment Clause calls for separation of church and state, with differing views on the extent of this separation. Some argue for strict separation of church and state, while others believe in a more intertwined relationship. The Lemon test is used to evaluate claims under the Establishment Clause, focusing on secular purpose, non-advancement of religion, and avoiding entanglement. Critics of the Lemon test suggest different applications, such as assessing government endorsement of religion. The Lemon test evaluates government actions regarding religion, focusing on neutrality and avoiding endorsement or disapproval of religion. It also includes the coercion test, which prohibits government coercion in religious practices. The government may not limit religious speech without a compelling reason or in a manner that is not viewpoint-neutral, but it may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. The Court has held that regulations that broadly prohibit religious speech are not permissible. The Court has ruled that restrictions on religious speech, such as banning distribution of religious literature or requiring permits for door-to-door canvassing, are unconstitutional. Privately donated monuments in public parks are considered government speech and not limited by the Free Speech Clause. Denying religious groups access to public facilities in a discriminatory manner violates the Establishment Clause. Equal access to benefits offered by public institutions, like student activity funds at universities, must be provided regardless of religious affiliation. The Court has ruled that restrictions on religious speech are unconstitutional. Displays on public property must be diverse in religious context to be upheld. For example, a display with Christian, Jewish, and nonreligious elements is constitutional, while a display of a Christian symbol alone is not. Displays with historical secular context are also upheld, such as the Ten Commandments among other secular monuments. The Court has ruled on the unconstitutionality of school-sponsored religious activities, including prayer in schools and mandatory displays of the Ten Commandments. Government aid to religious organizations is permissible depending on the purpose and manner of distribution. The Supreme Court allows government aid for non-religious purposes in public and private religious schools, focusing on the purpose of the aid and the programs funded rather than the type of organization receiving the funds. The Supreme Court has upheld aid programs where individuals use federal funds for sectarian services, as long as the aid reflects the individual's choice and is distributed on a religion-neutral basis. In the past, the Court prioritized religious interests in the constitutional scheme, requiring any government act infringing on religious practices to serve a compelling state interest. In 1990, the Supreme Court changed its interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause, abandoning the compelling state interest test for neutral statutes. The Court ruled that individuals must still comply with neutral laws. The strict scrutiny standard still applies to cases involving religious exemptions in programs with individualized assessments or deliberate targeting of religion. Congress reinstated the compelling interest test in response to the Court's reinterpretation. Congress reinstated the compelling interest test with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993, broadening legal protection for religious exercise by prohibiting government actions that substantially burden religious practice. RFRA required any law to further a compelling governmental interest and be the least restrictive means of doing so. Initially applying to federal, state, and local government actions, RFRA aimed to supplement constitutional protections for religious exercise. In 1997, the Court ruled that RFRA's strict scrutiny standard only applies to actions of the federal government due to federalism concerns. To address this, Congress passed RLUIPA in 2000, which applies a strict scrutiny test to state and local zoning and landmarking laws that burden religious exercise. RLUIPA's scope is limited to situations involving Congress's spending or commerce power, or individualized assessments in land use cases. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of state and local actions on religious practices in public institutions like prisons, mental hospitals, and nursing homes."
