The EAS is significant for regional trade and as an indicator of China's growing geopolitical influence. It has the potential to lead to the formation of an East Asian Community, allowing for collective agreements on trade and security without U.S. involvement. The United States has not been involved in the EAS process. The United States has not been involved in the East Asia Summit (EAS) process, raising concerns about potential challenges to American involvement in the region. Some analysts fear that shifting emphasis from APEC to the EAS could diminish America's overall influence and exclude the US from preferential trade agreements. APEC includes Taiwan, unlike the EAS, which could impact strategic considerations. Some countries in the East Asia Summit (EAS) view India, Australia, and New Zealand as a counterbalance to China's influence. China prefers a future East Asian Community with ASEAN Plus Three states, excluding Australia, New Zealand, and India due to their alignment with the US. China favored a draft joint declaration for the summit portraying ASEAN Plus Three states in dialogue with India, Australia, and New Zealand, while Japan opposed this. India insisted on implying that the EAS would be the basis of a future East Asian Community. The EAS is seen as an extension of the East Asian Economic Caucus concept proposed by Mahathir Mohammed, excluding non-Asian states. Japan opposed this exclusive grouping, while Australia promoted the inclusive APEC grouping. The East Asian Community concept evolved with the formation of the ASEAN Plus Three grouping. The United States expressed concerns about the East Asia Summit being inward-looking and exclusive. Criticisms were raised against the US for not paying enough attention to Southeast Asia, highlighted by Secretary of State Rice's absence at important meetings. Some viewed this as a sign of the US ceding the region to China. The United States' perceived lack of attention towards Southeast Asia led to concerns about ceding the region to China. Despite this, the US and ASEAN announced a Joint Vision Statement on their enhanced partnership, which was seen as a positive step towards meeting future challenges. China's approach to multilateral institutions involving ASEAN has also evolved, impacting Southeast Asian states' perceptions of China. China's evolving perception in Asian states has shifted from viewing multilateral institutions in Southeast Asia as potentially constraining to seeing them as useful for promoting its foreign policy objectives. Southeast Asian states' views of China have changed as China has abandoned support for communist insurgencies, been less assertive in the South China Sea, and engaged in diplomatic and trade initiatives. President Hu Jintao's extensive travels in the region since 2003 have also influenced this shift. The current drive for an East Asian Community is believed to stem from the perceived failure of the United States to effectively respond to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, where China's actions were favorably viewed compared to the US response. Additionally, China's development of defense capabilities is also a factor in shaping perceptions. China is strengthening defense cooperation with regional states like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The region is crucial for China's energy security, with a significant portion of its oil imports passing through the straits of Malacca. Trade between China and ASEAN exceeded $100 billion in 2004, showing a 30% increase from the previous year. The economic ties between China and regional states may lead to broader political and security relationships. China and ASEAN have signed a Free Trade Agreement aiming to reduce tariffs on certain goods by 2010. The combined GDP of Asian countries accounts for approximately 22% of the world total. Asia's GDP accounts for 22% of the world total, with higher growth rates than the US and Europe. ASEAN countries have varying perspectives on China's role in the East Asian Community, with Singapore advocating for a balanced approach. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasizes the importance of not being exclusively dependent on China and avoiding choosing sides between major powers. Singapore supports India's inclusion in the East Asia Summit and bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The country also seeks continued US engagement in the region. China's influence is felt not only in Southeast Asia but also among loyal US allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Australia changed its policy on the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation to attend the East Asia Summit. Tensions between Japan and China may impact future relations. The tensions between Japan and China may hinder the future development of the East Asia Summit. China has postponed discussions involving Japan, leading to enthusiasm to include India, Australia, and New Zealand in the group. Recent developments in America's relationship with India may be influenced by a desire to build ties with a regional state not aligned with China. China's gaining observer status in the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation is significant. The Kuala Lumpur Declaration established the East Asia Summit as a forum for dialogue. The East Asia Summit aims to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the region through strategic dialogue, cooperation in political and security issues, economic integration, and poverty eradication. It will be an inclusive forum with ASEAN as the driving force, focusing on community building and reinforcing the ASEAN Community. The East Asia Summit highlighted evolving geopolitical dynamics in the region, projecting ASEAN's political centrality amidst China and India's economic influence. Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia worked to include India, Australia, and New Zealand in the group to balance China's influence. The United States, although not participating, still holds influence through regional allies. Conflicts like the Sino-Japanese conflict may hinder future regional cooperation. The East Asia Summit highlighted geopolitical dynamics in the region, with concerns about the Sino-Japanese conflict potentially limiting future regional cooperation. Some analysts suggest the EAS may define Asian rivalry and geostrategic divisions. Russia aims to become a full member at the next EAS meeting. The United States is urged to consider the EAS's impact on its influence in Asia, as it could affect its ability to promote its values and interests. The East Asia Summit focuses on evolving geopolitical dynamics in Asia, with concerns about APEC losing momentum and disintegrating into regional blocs. Australia will chair APEC in 2007, raising questions about the United States' role in strengthening APEC and preventing Taiwan's isolation. The key question regarding the EAS is whether China's leadership will be perceived as benign or aimed at limiting US influence. China's actions through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) are seen as challenging America's regional presence, with potential opposition to US forces in Asia. Developing a constructive relationship with China is a significant foreign policy challenge for the United States. The United States is responding to China's efforts to increase its influence in Asia through the East Asia Summit (EAS). It is important for the US to show that its policies are not aimed at containing China, but rather at promoting a peaceful rise and constructive integration of China into regional and global affairs."
