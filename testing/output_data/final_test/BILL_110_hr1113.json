    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Enhancement Act\". It includes findings related to the Act. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease mainly affects the lower part of the small intestine and the large intestine, while ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and ulceration in the colon. Both diseases, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease, share similar symptoms such as severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and rectal bleeding. There is no known cause or medical cure for these conditions. Up to 1,400,000 people in the US have inflammatory bowel disease, with 30% diagnosed in childhood. Children with the disease miss school due to symptoms like bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients are at high risk for colorectal cancer and incur over $2 billion in annual medical costs. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is expanding research on Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The Director of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is intensifying research on inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on genetic susceptibility, causes in children, animal models, clinical studies, and treatment trials. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is expanding its Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centers program, particularly focusing on pediatric research. Research initiatives outlined in scientific documents will also be pursued. $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 are authorized for these purposes, with a portion reserved for training health professionals in biomedical research related to inflammatory bowel disease. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is expanding its Inflammatory Bowel Disease Centers program, with a focus on pediatric research. $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 are authorized for training health professionals in biomedical research related to inflammatory bowel disease, including pediatric investigators. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section, 317T, for a Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Registry. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish the National Pediatric IBD Registry for collecting data on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The National Pediatric IBD Registry aims to collect data on pediatric IBD cases in the US, including incidence, genetic and environmental factors, demographics, treatment outcomes, and other relevant information. The Advisory Committee on Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease will be established to connect patients with scientists studying the causes of pediatric IBD and conducting clinical trials. Members of the committee will be appointed by the Secretary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Advisory Committee on Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease will be appointed by the Secretary through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It will include representatives from a national voluntary patient organization focusing on pediatric IBD, a professional pediatric gastroenterology organization, the National Institutes of Health, and potentially the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institute of Allergy. The National Pediatric IBD Registry will involve collaboration with various organizations and experts, including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pediatric gastroenterologists, epidemiologists, geneticists, and other individuals interested in maintaining the registry. The Advisory Committee will conduct a study on the National Pediatric IBD Registry, including recommendations on data collection, storage, and use. A report will be submitted to the Secretary and Congress within 6 months of the Committee's establishment. The Secretary may award grants to public or private entities for data collection on pediatric IBD. Coordination with existing registries and data repositories is required for the National Pediatric IBD Registry. The Secretary ensures information from data collection on pediatric IBD is shared with the National Institutes of Health. Definitions for terms like Advisory Committee and pediatric IBD are provided in this section. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned. Authorization of appropriations totaling $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and additional funding for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 is provided for pediatric IBD research. SEC. 5. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in consultation with the inflammatory bowel disease community, will prepare a comprehensive plan called the \"National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan\" to address the burden of the disease in both adult and pediatric populations. Within 12 months of the enactment of this Act, the Director will submit the plan to relevant congressional committees. The National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan will focus on determining unique characteristics of the disease population, increasing awareness, and preventing disease progression. The National Inflammatory Bowel Disease Action Plan aims to prevent disease progression and complications like colorectal cancer. $750,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008."
