    "content": "The use of financial derivatives in American industry began in agriculture in the 19th century and later expanded to foreign exchange and bond markets. The introduction of a heating oil futures contract in 1978 at the NYMEX marked the start of their use in energy markets. Over the years, contracts on various energy products and spreads have become an important part of the energy business. The NYMEX traded and cleared a record number of contracts in 2004 and 2005, including energy derivatives and over-the-counter contracts on various financial instruments. The notional value of OTC contracts grew significantly by the end of 2005. The Bank for International Settlements estimated the notional value of outstanding OTC contracts worldwide at $284 trillion by the end of 2005, with $3.6 trillion being commodity-based. Issues with financial derivatives emerged in 1993, leading to significant losses for entities like Orange County, Metallgesellschaft, Long Term Capital Management, and Enron Corp. The use of financial derivative contracts in the energy industry, particularly in the petroleum and natural gas sectors, has raised concerns following major financial scandals. Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of these contracts and their potential impact on energy markets, companies, and the economy. The report aims to provide a systematic guide on this issue, highlighting the historical context before 1973 when derivatives were not widely used in risk management in the energy industry. Before 1973, oil prices were stabilized through production restrictions and managed by international oil companies. However, after the oil price shock of 1973/74, price volatility became a major concern in the U.S. oil market. By 1981, when oil price regulation ended, the effects of oil price volatility were significant for producers and consumers. Figure 1 illustrates the volatile nature of oil prices, influenced by OPEC actions and changing economic and political circumstances. This volatility spilled over into product markets. The volatility in oil prices post-1973 had a significant impact on product markets like gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel, affecting consumers and firms. Risk management involves using the standard deviation to measure and manage the spread of possible outcomes around the expected value of oil prices. Energy companies are now focused on managing price risk through various activities. Managing price risk for energy companies does not always require financial derivatives. Vertical integration, incorporating all stages of production from exploration to retail distribution, allows firms to control price risk by owning their oil or gas reserves. However, fully implementing this strategy is unlikely due to the need for capital and the industry's diversity in integrated and specialized firms. The oil industry can manage price risk through mergers, acquisitions, and inventory control. Maintaining substantial stocks of natural gas or oil can help smooth out price movements, but storing oil is expensive. Long-term fixed price contracts can reduce exposure to price volatility, but carry their own risks if market prices fall below contract prices. Long-term fixed price contracts in the oil industry can reduce price risk but increase default risk. Parties may diversify purchases, buy insurance, require collateral, or deal with established firms to mitigate default risk. Managing price risk involves various strategies such as mergers, acquisitions, and inventory control to smooth out price movements. Storing oil is costly, and if market prices fall below contract prices, there is a risk of competitive disadvantage or default. Managing price risk in the oil and natural gas industries is crucial for profitability and competitiveness. A recent report by the Energy Information Administration found that most large energy firms use derivatives to hedge risk. With volatile energy prices expected to continue, firms are likely to adopt cost-effective, flexible, and reliable strategies such as financial derivatives. Derivatives are financial contracts used by energy firms to manage price risk. They are based on an underlying asset, such as oil futures contracts. The value of a futures contract is determined by the difference between the contract price and the spot market price at settlement. This allows firms to hedge against price fluctuations in the energy market. Cash settlement is common for futures contracts on markets like NYMEX, allowing for purchases at current market prices. This method expands market participation but may lead to the perception of contracts being purely financial bets. NYMEX offers standardized energy derivatives for fixed amounts of products, with specified delivery dates, prices, and locations. The NYMEX offers standardized energy futures contracts for fixed amounts of products with specified delivery dates, prices, and locations. These contracts create basis risk due to differences in physical goods' characteristics, leading to the need for custom-designed OTC derivatives to hedge effectively. During the 1990s, energy trading companies like Enron became active in the OTC derivative market, acting as both brokers and counterparties. OTC contracts offer customization but come with increased risk compared to NYMEX contracts, which are more liquid. OTC contracts are less liquid than NYMEX contracts. NYMEX contracts can be canceled at any time by buying or selling an opposite contract. This cancels the firm's obligation and nets out its position. OTC contracts can only be terminated through mutual negotiation. The financial performance of exchange-traded derivatives is guaranteed, while OTC contract holders are exposed to default risk. Exchanges rigorously evaluate traders' creditworthiness and use margin accounts to ensure sufficient capital backing for every contract. Marking to market calculates gains or losses daily, maintaining minimal levels of margin equity. This process assures traders of contract performance. In organized exchanges, contracts have capital backing and are guaranteed for performance. OTC contracts lack this guarantee, leading to default risk if one party suffers large losses. Exchanges ensure creditworthiness and use margin accounts for capital backing. Anonymously traded contracts offer cost efficiency and price transparency for traders implementing strategies. OTC contracts are one-on-one arrangements with closely related parties, involving substantial fees paid to managers or brokers. They are privately negotiated and lack the competitive process of market-traded derivative contracts. While market-traded contracts offer limited risk management, OTC contracts provide flexibility but may not cover all risks effectively. The firm can use OTC derivatives to eliminate basis risk and hedge price risk effectively. In some cases, the firm may have to choose between OTC contracts and doing nothing if their strategy is incompatible with exchange-traded derivatives. A forward contract is a basic type of derivative where delivery and ownership transfer of the commodity occur in the future, helping to avoid price risk or storage costs for the refinery. The credit worthiness of parties in futures contracts is crucial due to default risk from oil price changes. Futures contracts are traded on exchanges with standard terms, specifying trades of a set quantity of a commodity at a specific price and time. Liquidity is low as contracts are one-on-one and require mutual consent for changes. Options contracts are settled in cash through the exchange and give the owner the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a fixed price. Calls allow buying at the contract terms, while puts allow selling at the contract terms. The contract is exercised if it is financially beneficial and expires if not, enabling participation in favorable strategies. Options based strategies allow owners to participate in favorable outcomes while minimizing negative effects, but they are more expensive than futures based strategies. Options are available on futures contracts and critical spreads, such as crack spread options and calendar spread options, which protect against price fluctuations and lock in profits over time. Swap contracts allow parties to exchange returns derived from underlying assets. Swap contracts allow parties to exchange streams of returns derived from underlying assets without exchanging ownership rights. Settlement payments are made in cash at pre-determined points to balance out differences in the value of the swapped return streams. The goal is to ensure predictable and stable costs and revenues for both parties involved. Derivative contracts, such as swaps and options, are commonly used to manage risk and stabilize profits in companies. However, these tools can also be used to hide debt, inflate profits, and make financial reports unclear. This section will explain how derivative contracts manage price risk, using natural gas transactions as an example. Various participants in the natural gas markets can benefit from using derivative contracts. Marketers, producers, pipelines, local distribution companies, and end users can benefit from using futures and options contracts to manage price risk in natural gas transactions. These contracts allow for price floors, ceilings, and hedging of costs, enabling participants to lock in prices for future requirements and remain competitive in the market. The firm can manage gas purchase costs by buying futures contracts on natural gas to protect itself from rising prices. This strategy allows the firm to offset higher spot market prices with profits made on the futures contract. The manufacturer can hedge natural gas needs by buying futures contracts to offset higher spot market prices. If gas prices decline, the manufacturer loses on the futures contract but gains by purchasing gas at a lower spot market price. This leaves the manufacturer purchasing gas at the futures contract price. If uncertain about a price decline, a different strategy like purchasing a call option might be appropriate to protect against price increases and benefit from possible reductions. The firm can use a call option to hedge against price increases and benefit from possible reductions in natural gas prices. If the gas price falls, the firm can let the option expire and purchase gas at the spot market price. If the price goes up, the firm can exercise the option and buy gas at the agreed-upon price. The premium paid for the option would be added to the total cost of the gas purchased. The firm can use an out-of-the-money call option to hedge against price increases in natural gas. By purchasing a $5.45 call for 7 cents, the firm reduces the cost of insurance from 15 cents to 7 cents, while still allowing for participation in price declines. This strategy offers less upward price protection but at a lower cost compared to an at-the-money call. The firm can hedge against price increases in natural gas by purchasing an out-of-the-money call option. The purchase price would be higher by the cost of the call up to the strike price. At a futures price of $5.35, the firm would break even. Prices above $5.35 would result in the firm being better off due to the hedge. The breakeven point between different strike prices is $5.28. If prices are likely to be below $5.28, the firm can choose the $5.45 call for protection against sharply higher prices. The strategies described involve using market traded contracts for hedging natural gas price increases. The value of these contracts is transparent and easily closed out at predictable costs. The focus is on protecting and facilitating the underlying energy business. Transactions without gas holdings or business interest in the physical gas market are more speculative. The use of market traded contracts for hedging natural gas price increases involves speculation, with speculators likely involved in transactions. Derivative traders shifting focus from managing business assets to financial assets can lead to problems. For example, a natural gas company signing prepaid forward and cash-settlement contracts for gas supply. The firm signs a cash-settlement forward contract with another firm to purchase an equal amount of gas for delivery in one year for a price of $1.06 million. However, both forward contracts have the same counterparty, effectively canceling out the gas obligations and creating a $1 million loan at 6% interest for one year. This financial engineering can obscure the firm's leverage on its financial statements, mislead investors, and create inefficiencies in capital markets. The derivative instruments used in transactions can have different motivations and outcomes. The examples show that hedging may not always be the underlying motivation for a transaction. The time frame of the contracts can also be important. Derivatives are tools that help firms achieve their business objectives, and their value to industries and economies has been recognized. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversees the organized markets like NYMEX to ensure fair prices. The question arises about regulating OTC transactions like those linked to financial debacles. The value of derivative transactions lies in reducing price volatility in the energy commodity market. The existence of derivatives is based on significant price volatility in the underlying market. Derivative contracts would become irrelevant if they reduced volatility. OTC derivatives have seen growth, with a notional value of $370 trillion in 2006. Interest rate swaps dominate the market, while commodity-based contracts are a small but growing portion. The availability of derivative trading has mixed effects on market price volatility. Some economists believe speculation reduces volatility by stabilizing prices, while others argue it increases volatility by reinforcing price movements. Overall, key energy prices remain unstable due to exogenous, geo-political events. The availability of derivative trading makes speculative strategies cheaper and more feasible, with highly leveraged instruments offering higher potential payoffs. Efficient capital markets attract global capital for investment and technological improvement, leading to economic growth. Damage to these markets could have significant implications for domestic and international economies, raising concerns about potential problems in the energy-related OTC trading sector affecting the reputation of U.S. capital markets. The collapse of Enron's trading operations had a chilling effect on OTC energy trading and led to calls for specific reforms. While the U.S. financial system has not been paralyzed by past failures in derivative trading, there are concerns about systemic risk and the need to protect market integrity. The ability of U.S. markets to innovate and embrace new risk profiles attracts capital, but this may come with trade-offs. The use of derivatives can reduce the cost of capital for firms, enhance their investment, and increase their value by hedging risk. Economists have mixed views on whether reducing risk enhances a firm's value. The use of derivatives in a firm's financial structure may affect its value due to market imperfections. Actions like implementing futures contracts can reduce risk but come at a cost. Owners may not see an increase in firm value from managerial actions if they can achieve the same risk profile through lower-cost personal transactions. Limited empirical data suggests extensive use of derivatives. The EIA's analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission 10K filings for 2002 revealed that derivatives were widely used by firms in the energy sector, with varying values of derivative holdings. Marketing firms utilized derivatives more than producers or refiners, while vertically integrated oil companies used them less. Despite limited evidence of increasing firm value, the near universal use of derivatives by energy firms suggests that managers see value in using them for risk management. Energy managers find value in using derivatives to manage risk, despite limited evidence linking derivatives to market effects. The size of the traded market and OTC contracts suggests potential consequences if problems arise. The critical nature of underlying commodities could lead to major disruptions in the economy if a derivative-related financial crisis occurs. The increasing importance of derivative trading raises questions about its impact on commodity market prices. The futures market consists of dealers, merchants, and financial investors, with speculation potentially influencing price variability in the underlying commodity. Speculators in the futures market can impact the price of underlying commodities by establishing long or short positions. They must resolve their positions by purchasing the opposite position. Studies have examined the relationship between derivative and commodity prices, focusing on contracts traded on exchanges like NYMEX. The EIA study analyzed the relationship between natural gas futures and spot market prices over three winter heating seasons from 2002 to 2005. The findings provided mixed support for the theory that futures prices should equalize with spot prices as the contract expiration approaches. Prices for futures contracts were found to vary over time, which is consistent with the fluctuation of fundamental factors affecting expected spot prices. The study found that futures prices do not always equalize with spot prices as contract expiration approaches. Futures prices were not always a reliable predictor of spot prices due to systematic bias and unpredictable price patterns. NYMEX conducted a study on hedge fund participation in energy trading to address concerns about their influence on futures prices. The NYMEX study on hedge fund participation in energy trading found that hedge funds were not exerting undue influence on energy futures prices. Hedge funds accounted for a small percentage of trading volumes in crude oil and natural gas, but held a larger number of contracts, providing stability to the market. The study also showed that hedge funds held their positions longer than other traders, suggesting they are a non-disruptive source of liquidity and not a cause of price volatility. The CFTC study analyzed hedge fund positions in crude oil and natural gas markets to determine their impact on price volatility. Using advanced econometric techniques, the study found that hedge funds tended to reduce price volatility, providing stability to the market. Dealers and merchants in the natural gas market were found to influence prices, while hedge funds were not seen as exerting undue influence. The study found that commercial participants influenced prices in the market, while managed money traders provided liquidity and aided price discovery without contributing to price volatility. Information on price changes flowed from the commercial sector to speculators, who reacted rather than generated price changes. Mark N. Cooper conducted a study on energy derivative trading in the natural gas market for the Attorneys General Natural Gas Working Group. Cooper's research on natural gas market inefficiencies and speculative activity found a correlation between derivatives trading and price volatility. He identified the 2001 natural gas price spike as linked to Enron. Cooper's analysis links the 2001 natural gas price spike to Enron's entry into the trading market and the subsequent fall in prices in 2002 to their exit. The peak prices of 2003-2006 are attributed to investment bankers entering the OTC market and increased hedge fund activity. However, his analysis lacks statistical correlation or causality, failing to consider other contributing factors. Legislative proposals for increased regulation of OTC energy contracts followed Enron's bankruptcy. Legislation concerning OTC trading was considered in the 108th and 109th Congress. Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Peter DeFazio introduced bills to increase regulatory reach and transparency in OTC transactions. The 108th Congress rejected amendments for more oversight, while the 109th Congress focused on data reporting and transparency. Bills like H.R. 1638 and S. 509 aimed to bring natural gas transactions under CFTC control and increase penalties for market manipulation. H.R. 4473 would have expanded the CFTC's data collection and monitoring activities. After the Enron bankruptcy, the OTC market shifted towards dealer-driven energy trading firms that acted as counterparties for OTC contracts. These firms hedged their risk by purchasing market-traded derivative contracts, leading to high leverage relative to their capital base. Both parties in the OTC transaction were subject to each other's actions. One suggestion to address the OTC market proposes that energy trading firms be more connected to the physical side of the energy market to reduce credit risk. Critics argue that firms have shifted away from the physical side to energy trading for higher returns. Major financial institutions, including investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch, have become key market makers in OTC energy transactions. The capitalization of counterparties and counterparty risk are crucial issues for market makers and financial markets. Profit incentives drive OTC market participation and the structures of participating firms. Reforms in OTC energy transactions include proposals for a clearing house like NYMEX to reduce counterparty credit and performance risk. This could lower operating capital needed and increase confidence in OTC transactions post-Enron collapse. The use of a clearing house in OTC transactions post-Enron collapse could potentially restore market faith and increase liquidity. Price transparency and confidence in OTC contracts are key concerns, with some suggesting structured derivative product companies as a solution. Derivative product companies were structured to act as intermediaries with triple-A credit ratings, managing market and credit risk through mirror transactions and collateralized hedges. They had higher capital costs but minimized credit risk, with a transparent workout structure in place for risk mitigation. The derivative product company must be liquidated due to market participants not valuing the benefits they provide. Price transparency is crucial in documenting and reporting transactions and derivative holdings to prevent illegal and deceptive financial strategies. Derivative contracts were used for illegal and deceptive financial activities, leading to calls for more transparency in pricing and documentation. The complexity of derivative trading can create opaque transactions that pose systemic risks, prompting suggestions for organized reporting of OTC contracts. However, the opaqueness of OTC derivative trading serves a purpose in a market with few large firms, as revealing strategies could have significant costs. The OTC energy derivative market is still evolving and finding its place in the energy industry. It has shown growth and value but has also been misused for illegal activities. Balancing participant interests while maintaining the market's business purposes is a key challenge for reform proposals. Deregulation and oil demand volatility in the 1980s led to the establishment of the energy derivatives market, which continues to be influenced by these factors today. The energy derivatives market has evolved with the growth of organized exchanges and over-the-counter trading. Commercial energy firms use hedging strategies to manage price risk efficiently. Speculators, such as hedge funds and investment banks, play a key role in transferring risk from the commercial sector. While organized exchanges are regulated, the OTC market remains unregulated and opaque. Legislative proposals aim to increase transparency and prevent manipulative practices in the OTC market. The energy derivative markets have evolved with organized exchanges and over-the-counter trading. Market manipulation can disrupt the market and lead to the development of alternative mechanisms. Regulation and oversight can reduce distortions and enhance market efficiency, benefiting energy firms and consumers. However, overregulation may distort the purpose of derivative markets."
