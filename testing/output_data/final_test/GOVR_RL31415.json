    "content": "This report provides an overview of how the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) may apply to military training activities of the Department of Defense (DOD). Military activities can harm protected creatures or destroy habitat, even if unintentional. Recent legislation has addressed the applicability of these acts to military readiness activities, with a focus on exempting the Armed Forces for incidental taking of migratory birds during military activities. The MBTA does not apply to incidental taking of migratory birds during military readiness activities. The Secretary of Defense must minimize adverse impacts on birds. Judicial review is expedited for challenges to regulations. Legislative proposals have been sent to Congress regarding environmental statutes. H.R. 1588, related to critical habitat designation under the ESA, was amended by the Senate and became P.L. 108-136, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The new law precludes critical habitat designation on Department of Defense lands with integrated natural resources management plans under the Sikes Act, if the plan benefits the species. Defense agencies still have duties to consult and comply with ESA provisions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, P.L.108-136, requires consideration of national security impacts when designating critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA aims to prevent extinction of endangered and threatened species by providing special protections and promoting conservation efforts. The act applies to federal activities and will be updated as needed. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) applies to federal government activities, defining \"person\" and \"federal agency\" within its scope. Federal agencies are required to prevent the \"taking\" of endangered species, which includes harming or harassing them. Additionally, agencies must ensure their actions do not jeopardize endangered species' existence or habitat. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service to avoid harm to endangered species or their critical habitats. Agencies must utilize their authorities to further the Act's purposes, including conservation of species. The Act defines conservation as bringing a species to a point where it no longer needs protection, going beyond just avoiding jeopardy. Exceptions are provided for federal activities that may impact listed species. The Endangered Species Act allows for exemptions in cases of irreconcilable conflict between agency activities and species protection, with a rigorous process involving an \"Endangered Species Committee\" to consider exemptions. This process is rarely utilized and is time-consuming. The process for granting exemptions under the Endangered Species Act involves a rigorous review by the Secretary of State to ensure compliance with international obligations. Exemptions for military readiness activities may be affected if they would harm migratory birds. An exemption must be granted for national security reasons, but only as part of the Committee process and for specific activities. The MBTA, enacted in 1918, is a criminal environmental statute that prohibits pursuing, hunting, capturing, or killing migratory birds without permits. Unlike the ESA, it is less clear on its applicability to federal activities. No exemptions have been sought under this act for on-going or recurring activities. The MBTA prohibits pursuing, hunting, capturing, or killing migratory birds without permits. The act does not define key terms such as \"harm\" and \"person,\" leading to ambiguity in its application. Courts have debated whether the MBTA applies to federal agencies, with conflicting decisions in circuit courts. The MBTA does not apply to federal agencies according to some circuit courts, citing the criminal penalties language. However, the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of federal-agency coverage in a case involving a Department of Agriculture goose management plan. The MBTA can be enforced against federal agencies through means other than criminal penalties, such as injunctions. Recent court cases have found the United States in violation of the MBTA for activities that resulted in the killing of migratory birds without a permit. The availability of relief other than criminal penalties, like injunctive relief, was highlighted in these cases. The court requested additional briefing on liability issues, including injunctive relief. The MBTA's application to habitat destruction is unclear due to the lack of \"harm\" or \"harass\" in the definition of \"take.\" Confusion exists between \"unintentional\" and \"incidental\" takes under the act. The distinction between \"intent\" and \"incidental\" actions is important in military readiness activities under the MBTA. Courts may focus on the defendant's intent or knowledge of the harm caused, regardless of whether the harm was intended. Intent is often considered immaterial in misdemeanor violations under the MBTA. The MBTA prohibits acts that kill protected birds, with felony charges for knowingly taking or selling migratory birds. The Pirie case highlighted that unintentional acts can still violate the MBTA, regardless of intent. The Navy's actions were found to be reviewable under prosecutorial discretion. The Ninth Circuit addressed claims regarding MBTA liability for direct vs. indirect bird deaths, ruling that habitat destruction leading indirectly to bird deaths is not considered a \"taking\" under the MBTA. The court emphasized the difference between the MBTA and the ESA in terms of including \"harm\" and habitat modification regulations. The court ruled that physical conduct similar to that of hunters and poachers, a concern at the time of the statute's enactment in 1918, may not constitute direct harm under the MBTA. Cases have found no takings for activities like tree harvesting during nesting season, which could directly harm birds. Some courts have interpreted the MBTA to exclude timbering from its coverage. Permits are required for takes not allowed under MBTA regulations. The Pirie case criticized the Navy for conducting live fire training operations. The Pirie case faulted the Navy for conducting live fire training operations without a permit. DOD activities have been permitted in the past under special purpose permits, but there are no current standards for permitting military readiness and training activities. The FWS denied a permit for the training exercises in question, stating they lacked the authority to issue permits for unintended conduct. The court ordered the Navy to apply for a permit from the FWS for training activities. The Navy has applied for a special purpose permit, and the court stayed its injunction, allowing training activities to continue. President Clinton's executive order imposes additional obligations on federal agencies. President Clinton's executive order imposes additional obligations on federal agencies to protect migratory birds by defining \"take\" as intentional or unintentional actions that harm birds. Agencies must minimize intentional take and lessen unintentional take through agreements with the Fish and Wildlife Service. The order's definition of \"take\" does not determine its meaning under the MBTA. Section 311 of H.R. 4546 as passed by the House would have amended the MBTA regarding military training activities of the Navy on an island in the Marianas that violated the MBTA. Initially, the FWS lacked authority to issue permits for incidental taking of protected birds, but later concluded it did have the authority. The training activities are crucial to the Navy, frequent, and recurring, posing challenges under the current system. The FWS concluded it had the authority to issue permits for incidental bird take during military readiness activities. Section 311 of H.R. 4546 would have made all incidental bird take during military activities lawful without requiring harm minimization or a permitting process. Section 312 of H.R. 4546 proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act, aiming to eliminate critical habitat designation on military lands with integrated natural resources management plans. This provision was not enacted but is similar to the Administration's proposal in the 108th Congress. Section 312 of H.R. 4546 aimed to eliminate critical habitat designation on military lands with integrated natural resources management plans. S. 2225 contained provisions related to the Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act, including considerations for national security issues during designation processes. New definitions for \"military readiness activities\" and \"combat\" were proposed in the bill. The proposed bill, S. 2225, included provisions regarding the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). It stated that completion of an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP) under the Sikes Act that addresses endangered species would eliminate critical habitat designation on military lands. The bill also introduced new definitions for \"military readiness activities\" and \"combat use.\" The Senate provision in the proposed bill S. 2225 aimed to authorize DOD military readiness activities without needing approval from the Secretary of the Interior, with a requirement to minimize the taking of migratory birds. The language of the provision raised concerns about the potential impact on migratory bird populations and military training capabilities. The bill raised concerns about the impact on migratory bird populations and military training capabilities due to unclear wording regarding takings resulting from military activities. The enacted version of H.R. 4546 is silent on the ESA but provides new interim MBTA provisions allowing incidental taking of migratory birds during military readiness activities authorized by the Secretary of Defense. The interim provisions allow incidental taking of migratory birds during military readiness activities authorized by the Secretary of Defense or the military department concerned, excluding certain activities like routine operations and construction. These provisions will be in effect until new regulations are prescribed and all challenges are exhausted. The regulations for incidental taking of migratory birds during military activities must be developed within one year of enactment. Judicial review is expedited with challenges to be filed within 120 days of regulations appearing in the Federal Register. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, has authority during the interim period. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, must identify measures to minimize adverse impacts of military activities on migratory birds. New regulations proposed in 2004 allow for the taking of migratory birds incidental to military activities with limitations. If a specific activity is not compatible with migratory bird treaties, the authorization for taking birds must be suspended. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, must identify measures to minimize adverse impacts of military activities on migratory birds. If an activity may harm the sustainability of a migratory bird species, the authorization for taking birds may be withdrawn. This is defined as an effect that could lead to a population no longer being maintained at a biologically viable level for the long term. Failure to implement conservation measures or provide information may result in a proposal to withdraw authorization. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, must identify measures to minimize adverse impacts of military activities on migratory birds. A proposal to withdraw authorization must be made in writing and provided to the Secretary of Defense. DOD may notify the Secretary of the Interior of any objections and possibly also meet with the Secretary. Withdrawal proposals or suspensions may be cancelled if DOD modifies the proposed activity to alleviate significant adverse effect on the sustainability of a population, or the additional circumstances no longer exist. The term Secretary of Defense includes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with respect to military readiness activities of the United States Coast Guard. Some provisions of the proposed regulations may need clarification for applicability to DHS. ESA issues are not addressed in P.L. 107-314, but the conference report mentions the importance of ESA considerations. The conference report emphasizes the need for compliance with environmental laws by federal agencies, including the Armed Forces. It highlights the challenges faced by the military in balancing habitat protection with necessary activities. The report calls for recommendations on legislative proposals to avoid critical habitat designation on bases that could impact military training. It also suggests a cooperative approach in managing natural and cultural resources within the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces must comply with federal environmental laws, but face challenges in balancing this with military readiness. Concerns arise over potential impact on training ranges from critical habitat designations. The consultative process with the Fish and Wildlife Service is endorsed for protection of species. The conferees urge cooperation between the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior in managing natural and cultural resources at military installations to avoid future critical habitat designations that could impact training. The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide legislative recommendations to achieve these goals. The Administration's legislative proposal to the 108th Congress addresses the designation of critical habitat on Department of Defense lands. An Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan completed under the Sikes Act Improvement Act for DOD lands provides special management considerations for endangered species, precluding critical habitat designation but still requiring consultation on actions that may harm listed species. The Resources Management Plan under the Sikes Act Improvement Act addresses endangered species and their habitat on Department lands, providing special management considerations required by the Endangered Species Act. H.R. 1588, passed by the House, adds a requirement to consider impacts on national security when designating critical habitat. The Endangered Species Act requires the designation of critical habitat based on scientific data and consideration of economic and other impacts. The Secretary may exclude areas if the benefits outweigh the designation, except if it would lead to species extinction. The Sikes Act mandates a planning process for military installations to conserve natural resources, separate from the critical habitat designation process under the ESA. The Act requires the Secretary of Defense to implement a program for natural resource conservation and prepare an integrated natural resources management plan for each installation. The Sikes Act mandates a planning process for military installations to conserve natural resources, developed in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior and state agencies. Plans must provide for fish and wildlife management, land management, and habitat enhancement with \"no net loss\" in military mission support. No specific requirements for endangered species are outlined, with the ESA presumed to overlay existing regulations. The Sikes Act mandates conservation planning for military installations in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior. Plans focus on natural resource conservation with no specific requirements for endangered species outlined. H.R. 1588 would have precluded critical habitat designation if an INRMP addresses special military needs. Clarification on reconciling endangered species protection and military readiness is suggested. The provision allows for the exclusion of critical habitat if an INRMP addresses special management considerations or protection under the ESA. There is broad discretion in determining the level of detail required in the plan to address listed species, making it difficult for courts to review. Designation of critical habitat may not provide additional protection beyond the requirement to avoid jeopardy. The FWS regulation regarding the definition of \"destruction or adverse modification\" has been deemed unlawful. The agency has conflated the duties of consulting on actions that might jeopardize a species or harm critical habitat, leading to the conclusion that designation of critical habitat adds little beyond the jeopardy concept. The FWS has given low priority to designating critical habitat, but courts have ruled that the agency must do so. The regulation in question has been found unlawful, as it equates destruction of critical habitat with jeopardizing a species, leading to a more generous standard for habitat conservation. The FWS interpretation of critical habitat has been found to be incorrect, as it assigns it a minor role in species protection. This could raise important issues, especially regarding critical habitat protections on military lands. The ESA defines critical habitat as areas essential for species conservation and requiring special management considerations. If a management plan already provides these measures for an area, it may no longer meet the criteria for critical habitat designation. Special management and protection measures for an area may disqualify it from being designated as critical habitat if adequate conservation measures are already in place. Factors considered include the presence of a current plan with sufficient conservation actions, assurances of implementation, and long-term conservation strategies. The presence of a current plan with sufficient conservation actions, assurances of implementation, and long-term conservation strategies may disqualify an area from being designated as critical habitat. A recent district court case criticized the interpretation of the ESA definition of critical habitat by the FWS, stating that it would eliminate a crucial part of the law. The court criticized the FWS interpretation of the ESA definition of critical habitat, stating it would eliminate a crucial part of the law. H.R. 1588 would have incorporated this interpretation, but recent court cases have deemed it untenable and in contravention of the ESA. The court criticized the FWS interpretation of the ESA definition of critical habitat, stating it would eliminate a crucial part of the law. H.R. 1588 required consideration of national security impact when designating critical habitat, preserving consultation duties under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 7 of the ESA. S. 1050 would have precluded critical habitat designation on DOD lands if an INRMP effectively conserves listed species with adequate funding. This language could impose a stricter requirement than the current FWS interpretation. The Senate language in S. 1050 addressed the general duty to conserve species under the ESA, focusing on management activities in an INRMP to effectively conserve listed species. It would have been an addition to Title 10 of the United States Code, not an amendment to the ESA, and only applied to the Secretary of Interior. This provision did not impact the consultation requirement under \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 7 of the ESA but did not add a requirement to consider national security impacts. The enacted language on critical habitat differs from both the House and Senate bills. Section 318(a) of P.L. 108-136 precludes the designation of critical habitat on lands owned or controlled by the Department of Defense, if an INRMP provides a benefit to the species proposed for designation. This approach allows for a low threshold for the Secretary to demonstrate benefit. The conference report emphasizes the need for the Secretary of the Interior to assess the potential contribution of an INRMP to species conservation, particularly for species for which critical habitat would be proposed. Criteria would be established to determine if an INRMP benefits listed species. The statutory language requires a formal proposal of critical habitat before findings on INRMP coverage can be made. The new language in Section 318(a) of the ESA clarifies that consultation is still required on actions likely to harm listed species, even if critical habitat is not designated on DOD lands. The prohibition on takings also remains in place. The consultation process under the ESA still applies to actions likely to harm listed species, even without critical habitat designation on DOD lands. The prohibition on takings also remains in effect, including harm through habitat destruction or behavioral changes. Section 318(b) of P.L. 108-136 requires consideration of national security impacts when designating critical habitat. The new provisions on ESA compliance are not explicitly linked to military readiness activities. Section 320 directs a study on the impact of compliance by the Department. P.L. 108-136 prohibits critical habitat designation on DOD lands if an INRMP benefits listed species. INRMPs prioritize military objectives over ESA objectives, which some view as necessary for military readiness."
