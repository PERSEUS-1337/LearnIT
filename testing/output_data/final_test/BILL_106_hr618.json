    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf War Veterans' Iraqi Claims Protection Act of 1999\". Adjudication of claims is addressed in the Act. The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq. Claims must be submitted within a specified period. The Commission will certify the payable amount to each claimant. Decision rules include applying substantive law and principles of justice. Priority is given to certain claims before others are decided. The United States Commission is responsible for deciding non-commercial claims related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the USS Stark attack. The International Claims Settlement Act applies to these claims, with certain exceptions. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury can establish the Iraq Claims Fund for payment of certified claims. Proceeds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated by the President between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for US Government claims against Iraq, with limitations on the amount allocated. The subsection limits the payment of US Government claims against Iraq from the Iraq Claims Fund based on the total certified claims. The Secretary of State determines valid claims outside the UN Commission's jurisdiction. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims under section 2(a) and administrative expenses. Additionally, reimbursement for administrative expenses is provided. SEC. 5. REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. The Secretary of the Treasury deducts 1.5 percent of funds in the Iraq Claims Fund for administrative expenses. Amounts deducted are deposited as miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury of the United States. The United States Commission certifies awards to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment from the Iraq Claims Fund in order of priority. Payment includes $10,000 or the award's principal amount, additional $90,000 for certain claims, and ratable payments towards unpaid balances of all awards. After payment of principal amounts of awards, pro rata payments for accrued interest are made. Payment of awards under this Act does not extinguish unsatisfied claims against the Government of Iraq. The Executive agency can transfer records to the United States Commission for claims under the Act. There is a statute of limitations and unused funds are disposed of. The statute of limitations for certified awards under the Act bars any demand for payment one year after the publication of a notice by the Secretary of the Treasury. The notice must be published in the Federal Register after the 9-year period specified, identifying unpaid claims. Unused funds are disposed of as well. At the end of the 2-year period from the notice publication, the Secretary of the Treasury will deposit any unused funds from the Iraq Claims Fund into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including \"Executive agency,\" \"Government of Iraq,\" \"United Nations Commission,\" and \"United States Commission.\""
