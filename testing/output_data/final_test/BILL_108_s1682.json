    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Census of Americans Abroad Act\". Congress finds that an estimated 3,000,000 to 6,000,000 Americans living and working overseas contribute to the US economy by buying, selling, and creating business opportunities for American companies. Additionally, with the growing threat of terrorism, accounting for Americans residing abroad is crucial for national security. Congress supports counting all Americans residing abroad by the Bureau of the Census, with major organizations backing this initiative. It is recommended that a test census be conducted for Americans in selected countries, with funding allocated for this purpose. The Bureau should then assess how to include Americans abroad in the 2010 decennial census based on the test census results. The Bureau of the Census should test methodologies for counting Americans residing abroad and ensure their inclusion in the 2010 decennial census and future censuses. The Bureau of the Census should ensure the inclusion of Americans residing abroad in the 2010 decennial census and future censuses.
