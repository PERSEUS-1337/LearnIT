    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Benefit Authors without Limiting Advancement or Net Consumer Expectations (BALANCE) Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that copyright law aims to balance the interests of authors and society, encouraging creative efforts while allowing for fair use to promote progress in science and useful information. Advances in technology have prompted changes to copyright laws to maintain balance, such as player pianos before the Copyright Act of 1909 and cable television reforms to section 111 of title 17, United States Code. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted to address the challenges posed by digital technology and the Internet. It aims to protect copyright holders from digital piracy by allowing them to use technical control measures. The DMCA was intended to combat digital piracy by implementing technical restrictions. However, it has also restricted the rights of legitimate consumers by prohibiting them from circumventing these restrictions, even for fair use purposes. The DMCA was meant to combat digital piracy but has also limited consumers' rights to make fair use of copyrighted works. The balance between copyright holders and society needs to be restored as intended by the 105th Congress. Copyright laws should target digital pirates without treating every consumer as one. PROTECTING FAIR USE AND CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. The amendment to section 107 of title 17 allows for digital transmissions as a means of fair use.
