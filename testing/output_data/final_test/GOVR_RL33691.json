    "content": "The animal agriculture sector has seen significant changes in recent decades, leading to larger confined production facilities that raise concerns about environmental impacts. Animal waste can be beneficial as fertilizer but improper management can harm water quality and soil. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported in 1997 that many farms had excess nitrogen and phosphorus, leading to potential environmental issues such as runoff and nutrient leaching. Federal environmental laws do not fully regulate agricultural activities, allowing farms to escape many regulatory provisions. Certain large animal feeding operations (AFOs) are subject to environmental regulation under the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. Livestock and poultry operations may also be regulated under CERCLA and EPCRA, which has been a controversial issue drawing congressional attention. This report describes the provisions of CERCLA and EPCRA, and enforcement actions. The report discusses provisions of CERCLA and EPCRA, enforcement actions, and congressional scrutiny. Bills to exempt animal manure from these laws have been introduced. CERCLA and EPCRA have reporting requirements for certain substance releases, administered by the EPA. CERCLA includes reporting requirements and provisions for federal cleanup of hazardous substance releases. The focus is on how these laws apply to poultry and livestock operations, with liability for cleanup costs assigned to facility owners. EPCRA requires notification of hazardous substance releases to the National Response Center, with reporting obligations for facility owners under CERCLA and EPCRA. The definition of \"release\" includes various forms of substance discharge into the environment. The release of hazardous chemicals or substances into the environment triggers reporting obligations under CERCLA and EPCRA. Livestock facilities may release reportable substances like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and phosphorus, with specific reportable quantities for each. Failure to report releases can result in civil penalties imposed by the EPA. The CERCLA and EPCRA require reporting of hazardous substance releases, with potential penalties for non-compliance. These laws allow citizens to take legal action against violators or the EPA for failing to fulfill duties. CERCLA also includes provisions for federal cleanup and imposes strict liability for damages from hazardous substance releases. The applicability of these provisions to animal agriculture is gaining attention. EPA oversight is increasing in this area. EPA enforces CERCLA and EPCRA reporting requirements on animal agricultural sources. Settlements were reached with large pork producers like Premium Standard Farms and Seaboard Foods for violations of environmental laws. The citizen suit provisions have been used to sue poultry producers and swine operations for violations of environmental laws, including failure to report ammonia emissions, leading to lawsuits and court rulings supporting broad interpretation of reporting requirements for livestock operations under CERCLA and EPCRA. The court rulings in Sierra Club v. Seaboard Farms Inc. and Sierra Club v. Tyson Foods, Inc. determined that the entire farm site should be assessed for CERCLA and EPCRA reporting requirements, considering facilities operated together for a single purpose as one entity. This broad interpretation includes continuous releases subject to reduced reporting and exemptions for reporting. The court rulings in Sierra Club v. Seaboard Farms Inc. and Sierra Club v. Tyson Foods, Inc. determined that the entire farm site should be assessed for CERCLA and EPCRA reporting requirements. Despite exemptions for reporting releases in routine agricultural operations, these exemptions did not apply to the facts of the case. EPA declined to file an amicus brief in the Seaboard Farms case, raising questions about whether animal wastes containing phosphorus are hazardous substances under CERCLA. In 2003, a federal court in Oklahoma ruled that phosphorus in poultry litter is a hazardous substance under CERCLA. This decision was later vacated, but it may still influence other courts. Another case, City of Waco v. Schouten, involved 14 dairies facing legal action for waste disposal. In 2005, State of Oklahoma v. Tyson Foods, Inc. was brought by the Oklahoma Attorney General against 14 poultry operations for waste disposal in the Illinois River Watershed. The case sought response costs and natural resource injuries under CERCLA but was dismissed in 2010. This has raised concerns in the agriculture community about potential legal actions and enforcement of federal laws on whole farm sites. In 2005, poultry producers requested an exemption from EPCRA and CERCLA emergency notification requirements for ammonia releases from poultry growing operations. EPA proposed a rule to exempt routine animal waste air releases from emergency notification requirements in response to the poultry industry petition in 2007. The EPA proposed an exemption from CERCLA and EPCRA notification requirements for releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms. The exemption would apply to air releases from manure, digestive emissions, and urea, including animal waste mixed with bedding and compost. The proposal aimed to reduce the resource burden on the agriculture industry and received significant public response during the comment period. The EPA proposed an exemption from CERCLA and EPCRA notification requirements for releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms. The exemption pleased agriculture industry groups seeking liability limits, but environmental advocates opposed it, citing concerns about emissions from animal wastes. Critics argued that the exemption was premature, as EPA was still researching emissions levels. State air quality officials recommended a narrow exemption based on farm size thresholds. In September 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report evaluating EPA's activities in regulating air quality. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that EPA lacks data on pollutants released by CAFOs, hindering assessment of their impact on human health and the environment. GAO recommended EPA develop a national inventory of CWA-permitted CAFOs and improve air emissions monitoring protocols. EPA's current monitoring activities are criticized for being limited in scope and sample size, potentially hindering future regulation decisions. GAO also questioned the basis for the CERCLA/EPCRA exemption proposed by EPA in 2007. The EPA finalized a CERCLA/EPCRA exemption in December 2008 for hazardous substance releases from animal waste at farms, exempting livestock operations from reporting requirements. Large animal feeding operations are still subject to EPCRA reporting. EPA's lack of data on pollutants from CAFOs hinders assessment of their impact on health and the environment, as recommended by the Government Accountability Office. The EPA finalized a CERCLA/EPCRA exemption in December 2008 for hazardous substance releases from animal waste at farms, exempting livestock operations from reporting requirements. Large animal feeding operations are still subject to EPCRA reporting. Environmental advocates and industry groups have criticized the rule, with concerns about emissions of chemicals like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Litigation has ensued, with challenges to the rule in federal court. In June 2010, the federal government requested to remand the final rule for EPA to reevaluate. EPA did not announce a schedule for proposing a new rule but stated they would require reporting of emissions. The 2008 exemption rule is currently in effect. In September 2015, a federal court granted a petition to reopen a lawsuit challenging the reporting exemption rule. In a renewed case, environmental groups and pork producers argue against the exemption rule, citing conflicts with CERCLA and EPCRA. EPA urges dismissal of the case due to lack of standing. Large CAFOs are still subject to EPCRA reporting requirements under the rule. The Humane Society has taken legal action against swine facilities for alleged EPCRA violations. A lawsuit against a company with swine operations in North Carolina is pending as of June 2016. Congressional interest in the applicability of CERCLA and EPCRA to poultry and livestock operations was sparked by court cases. Senators requested clarification from the EPA on reporting requirements to limit the impact on poultry operations due to unclear regulations and lack of scientific information. The House Appropriations Committee urged the EPA to address the issues in their FY2006 appropriations report. Conflicting court decisions and inadequate scientific information are causing confusion regarding reporting requirements under CERCLA and EPCRA for emissions from poultry, dairy, or livestock operations. Producers seek clarification from the EPA on the applicability of these laws. In 2004, Congress considered amending the definition of \"release\" in CERCLA and EPCRA to exclude releases from biological processes in agricultural operations. Some Members proposed amending the FY2006 Agriculture appropriations bill to exempt these operations. Proponents sought to amend the FY2006 Agriculture appropriations bill to exempt livestock manure releases from CERCLA and EPCRA. The proposal was not accepted by House conferees, leading to objections from environmentalists and criticism from EPA's congressional affairs office. The House and Senate approved H.R. 2744 in November 2005 without the provision to exempt livestock manure releases from CERCLA and EPCRA. Legislation was introduced in the 109th Congress to clarify that manure is not a hazardous substance under CERCLA. H.R. 4341 proposed a broad definition of \"manure\" in the FY2006 Agriculture appropriations bill. Witnesses at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing discussed the need for policy direction on the issue of animal agriculture and CERCLA. EPA was considering ways to reduce paperwork burdens for large AFOs to report emissions. Legislation was introduced in the Senate and the 110th Congress to reduce paperwork burdens for large AFOs reporting emissions. The House Agriculture Committee approved an amendment regarding farm manure not being considered toxic waste, but it was not included in the final legislation enacted in 2008. Some Members of Congress criticized EPA's 2007 proposal to exempt routine animal waste air releases from reporting requirements. At a September 2008 House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing, Members questioned EPA's authority to authorize a blanket exemption under EPCRA's reporting requirements. EPA and USDA witnesses supported the proposed rule, stating that the air release waiver would only impact reporting for emergency response situations, not emissions from other farm sources or hazardous substances from manure into soil, ground water, or surface water. Legislation on this topic was introduced in the 112th Congress with companion bills, H.R. 2997 and S. 1729. H.R. 2997 and S. 1729 aimed to clarify that manure is not a hazardous substance under CERCLA and to remove emissions reporting liability. EPA expressed concerns that the bills would limit their response authority to manure-related releases, even in cases of public health and environmental risks. The legislation aims to exempt manure from being considered a hazardous substance under CERCLA and EPCRA, which could hinder the Agency's ability to issue abatement orders for damaging releases. Supporters argue that manure has been safely used for centuries, while opponents believe that responsible management of manure does not conflict with CERCLA requirements. Animal waste from large feedlot operations can release various polluting substances to the environment, including nutrients, pathogens, antibiotics, and gases linked to climate change. Proponents of legislation argue that current laws were not meant to apply to agriculture, while opponents claim there is little evidence to support this. Opponents argue that there is limited evidence regarding the exemption for \"normal application of fertilizer\" in CERCLA, with no clear definition provided by the EPA. The only court decision on this issue lacked sufficient evidence for a fact-based determination. Additionally, opponents point out that animal manure contains various substances from animal feed. Substances in animal feed, including trace elements, antibiotics, and nutrients, result in releases due to inadequate waste disposal. Proponents argue that enforcement mechanisms exist under the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, making reliance on CERCLA or EPCRA unnecessary. Enforcement of permit requirements is crucial for addressing environmental concerns in animal agriculture activities. Opponents argue that CERCLA fills critical gaps in other environmental laws as not all pollutants are covered. Opponents argue that environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act do not cover all pollutants, such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, which are listed under CERCLA but not regulated under the CAA. They also point out that CERCLA allows for cost recovery and natural resource injury compensation, unlike the other laws. Additionally, CWA and CAA permit requirements only apply to a small percentage of animal feeding operations, leaving gaps in regulation. If animal manure is classified as a hazardous substance under CERCLA, farm operations could face costly liabilities and penalties. The proposed exemption in legislation would eliminate reporting requirements for hazardous chemicals, cleanup liability, and natural resource injuries related to manure application. Some argue that liability is necessary to improve waste handling practices in large AFOs. Enacting an exemption for animal agriculture operations would hinder government response to hazardous substance releases and pollution. Penalties under CERCLA are not available for removal actions, but civil penalties can be imposed for reporting violations. The applicability of CERCLA and EPCRA to animal agriculture activities is a key issue. The controversy surrounding the applicability of CERCLA and EPCRA to animal agriculture activities has garnered attention. Bills introduced in Congress aimed to clarify that manure is not considered a hazardous substance or pollutant under CERCLA, but faced opposition. The Obama Administration expressed intentions to reconsider the 2008 rule exempting air releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms from CERCLA and EPCRA reporting."
