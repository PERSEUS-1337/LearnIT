NATIONAL BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. National Ballast Water Management Demonstration Program authorized under Public Law 101-646 to test technologies and practices for preventing the spread of nonindigenous species through ballast water. The National Ballast Water Management Demonstration Program aims to prevent the spread of nonindigenous species through ballast water by using vessels documented under US law, including those on the Great Lakes. The program allows for the installation of ballast water management technology by US shipyards or repair facilities and may accept donations of property and services. The National Ballast Water Management Demonstration Program allows for the installation of ballast water management technology by US shipyards or repair facilities and may accept donations of property and services. The Administrator of the Maritime Administration, in consultation with the Task Force, is required to submit a report on the results of the demonstration program to the appropriate Committees. The National Ballast Water Management Demonstration Program authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 to carry out evaluation and demonstration programs."
