    "content": "Recent data breaches at major U.S. retailers have raised concerns about the security of personal information stored electronically by corporations. A breach occurs when sensitive data is lost, stolen, or accessed without authorization, potentially compromising confidentiality. Federal laws impose security and breach notification requirements on specific industries and types of data, such as health information under HIPAA and HITECH Act, and financial institutions under GLB. 47 states, D.C., and three territories have laws mandating breach notification. Several data security and breach notification bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress, aiming to impose requirements on businesses regardless of industry sector. Some proposals seek to maintain existing federal requirements and exempt institutions covered by those laws. However, there are also bills that aim to supersede state laws and establish a uniform federal standard. Legal issues surrounding federal preemption of state actions regarding data security and breach have been a point of contention during bill consideration. This report discusses the legal implications of data security and breach notification legislation on federal agencies like the FTC and FCC. It examines federal preemption principles and how proposed laws may affect the jurisdiction and enforcement authority of these agencies. Several bills on data security and breach notification have been introduced in the 114th Congress, each taking different approaches. Some bills outline specific criteria for data security programs, while others empower the FTC to create rules. Violations of data security requirements would be considered unfair or deceptive practices enforceable by the FTC. Covered entities are generally required to provide notification in the event of a breach. Covered entities must notify individuals, the FTC, and credit reporting agencies in the US when unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information in electronic data occurs. Notification deadlines are set within a specific number of days or as soon as possible after discovering the breach. Forms of notification include written notice by mail or email. Notification of a data breach may be done through written notice by mail or email, or through a website posting. The notification must include details of the breached personal information, a contact phone number, and information on free credit reporting services. Notification may not be required if the breach poses no risk of identity theft or fraud, or if notice is already mandated by federal laws like HIPAA or GLB. Violations of notification requirements may be considered unfair or deceptive practices and enforced by the FTC. Some bills propose empowering the FTC to enforce security and breach notification requirements, with some allowing state attorneys general to also enforce violations. Additional provisions in some bills address data privacy and telecommunications common carriers. Close inspection of each bill is necessary to understand its specific effects. Forty-seven states and several territories have laws mandating businesses to notify individuals of data breaches. California, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of data breaches. The notification must be provided in a timely manner and include specific information such as the type of personal information involved, the date of the breach, and contact information for the reporting entity. Law enforcement may delay the notice if it hinders a criminal investigation. In California, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, businesses must notify individuals of data breaches promptly, including details like the type of information compromised. If the breach affects over 500 California residents, the state attorney general must also be notified. Several states, including Massachusetts, have laws mandating comprehensive information security programs for businesses handling personal data. These programs must assess risks and implement safeguards based on business size and resources. Businesses must develop security policies to prevent unauthorized access to data and conduct regular monitoring. States may have consumer protection laws to address harm from data breaches, such as Illinois law prohibiting deceptive practices. Individuals affected by data breaches can seek remedies under these laws. Federal legislation addressing data security and breach notification raises questions about preempting existing state laws. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution establishes federal preemption as a potential solution to create a uniform standard for data breach requirements. The Supremacy Clause allows Congress to override state and local laws within its authority. The key issue is determining when federal law preempts state and local laws, based on Congress's intent and traditional state powers. The historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless Congress clearly intends to do so. Federal preemption can be express or implied, with express preemption occurring when a federal statute explicitly states its intent to preempt state and/or local action. A saving clause may also be included to preserve some role for state or local action. The express preemption clause in federal legislative proposals aims to displace certain state and local actions related to the security of data in electronic form. This clause must be read together with a saving clause to determine the scope of actions superseded under express preemption principles. The express preemption clause in federal legislative proposals aims to displace state and local actions related to data security in electronic form. State actions falling within the subject matter of the clause will be preempted if adopted, maintained, enforced, or imposed by the state. Courts use statutory interpretation principles to determine preemption. In analyzing an express preemption clause, courts consider the language of the statute and the legislative intent. Congress can displace state actions, including statutes, regulations, and common law claims like breach of contract or negligence. Express preemption clauses in federal data security and breach notification bills are likely to preempt state laws and regulations. Clauses mentioning \"requirements\" or \"prohibitions\" would also preempt state laws. It is unclear which bills would preempt common law causes of action. Courts have ruled that clauses covering duties imposed by common law could preempt common law claims. The Supreme Court has ruled that express preemption clauses in federal data security and breach notification bills could preempt common law causes of action. The word \"rule\" in the phrase \"any provision of statute, rule, or regulation\" may encompass common law claims. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal data security and breach notification bills with express preemption clauses could preempt common law causes of action. The interpretation of the phrase \"statute, regulation, or rule\" likely includes both positive law enactments and common law rules, potentially preempting common law claims. Federal courts have treated common law claims as provisions of state law that could be preempted. However, the case law does not provide clear answers on this issue. The interpretation of express preemption clauses in federal data security and breach notification bills is complex. The Supreme Court has not provided clear answers on whether common law actions can be preempted. Courts must closely consider the presumption against preemption and the broader statutory scheme when interpreting these clauses. Not all common law actions may be considered state laws, as some may derive from self-imposed obligations. For example, in American Airlines v. Wolens, the Court distinguished between common law claims enforcing state-imposed obligations and those based on voluntary agreements. The Supreme Court has not provided clear answers on whether common law actions can be preempted under express preemption clauses. A breach of contract claim would not be superseded as it represents privately ordered obligations, not state-enacted provisions. Common law claims enforcing self-imposed obligations are unlikely to be preempted. Courts need to analyze the elements of the common law action to determine if it satisfies an express preemption clause. For example, in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, an express warranty claim regarding a pesticide label was not preempted. The common law rule for express warranty claims does not require the manufacturer to make an express warranty, only to fulfill the commitment voluntarily undertaken. A saving clause, when present, must be considered alongside an express preemption clause to determine which state actions will be superseded. An express preemption clause that covers \"any law, rule, regulation, duty, requirement, standard, or provision having the force and effect of law\" would likely preempt state statutes, regulations, and common law causes of action. A saving clause, when present alongside an express preemption clause, can change the scope of preemption by exempting certain state common law causes of action. It is important to consider the plain text, express preemption clause, and the purpose of the statute as a whole when interpreting the impact of a saving clause. Existing federal proposals vary in defining the subject matter of preempted state actions, with some bills defining it narrowly. Some bills narrowly define preempted state actions, focusing on statutes, regulations, and common law claims that specifically require certain actions related to data security and breach notification. This provision is unlikely to preempt general state consumer protection statutes. Several bills use the term \"relating to\" in express preemption clauses, which broadens the scope of preempted state actions. The Supreme Court has interpreted this term to have an expansive reach, preempting not only direct state laws but also laws of general applicability. The term \"relating to\" in express preemption clauses broadens the scope of preempted state actions, including not only direct state laws but also laws of general applicability. The Supreme Court has cautioned against interpreting this term too broadly, stating that it does not mean the sky is the limit and should not be read with an uncritical literalism. Express preemption clauses regarding carrier prices, routes, or services do not preempt state laws in only a tenuous, remote, or peripheral manner. A bill preempting statutes and regulations related to data protection or breach notification would supersede state laws directly addressing these issues. Some bills preempt state laws related to data security and notification requirements, including responsibilities to protect consumer information, safeguard it from unauthorized access, investigate breaches, and mitigate potential misuse. The courts have provided limited guidance on the interpretation of phrases like \"with respect to\" in preemption clauses. Federal courts have considered similar clauses in the past, such as in the Federal Election Campaign Act, which was interpreted narrowly by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The court's analysis on preemption clauses in federal laws like the Federal Election Campaign Act is unclear, as it is uncertain if it was based solely on plain language interpretation or also on the legislative scheme's text and purpose. If a federal law preempting state statutes on data security is interpreted narrowly, it would likely preempt state data security standards but not general consumer protection laws. A broader interpretation could encompass both direct data security laws and general consumer protection laws, with congressional intent guiding the court's interpretation. The Supreme Court's interpretation of express preemption clauses in federal laws may not definitively determine the scope of potential preemption under a federal data security and breach notification statute. State actions that are not expressly preempted may still be subject to implied conflict preemption principles. Conflict preemption can arise when compliance with both state and federal laws is impossible or when state actions obstruct federal objectives. Impossibility preemption occurs when a state law conflicts with a federal law by prohibiting what the federal law requires, or vice versa. This requires conflicting legal obligations between state and federal laws. For example, in Florida Lime & Avocado Growers v. Paul, the Supreme Court illustrated that a state law prohibiting avocados with less than 8% oil would be preempted if a federal law prohibited avocados with more than 7% oil. Impossibility preemption occurs when state and federal laws conflict by prohibiting what the other requires. It is relatively rare, and examples include a hypothetical federal law preempting state data breach notification laws to set a minimum standard. The federal law requires prompt notification of breaches, with exceptions for criminal investigations or national security. State laws with stricter requirements could still be preempted under express preemption analysis. Impossibility preemption can occur when state and federal laws conflict, prohibiting what the other requires. In a scenario where a data breach triggers both state and federal notification requirements, a covered entity may face a dilemma. The state statute allows for delayed notification in cases where it could impede a civil investigation, while the federal law mandates notification within 30 days, regardless of ongoing investigations. Compliance with both laws would be impossible, leading to a likely conclusion by a reviewing court. Impossibility preemption can arise when state and federal laws conflict, making compliance with both impossible. On the other hand, obstacle preemption involves determining if a state law obstructs the purpose of a federal statute. This analysis considers congressional intent and the overall objectives of the federal law. Obstacle preemption can be challenging to apply as it requires a nuanced interpretation of Congress's intentions. Proposals aiming to establish a uniform national standard for data security and breach notification are more likely to override state laws under obstacle preemption. Determining if a state common law cause of action would be superseded under obstacle preemption can be complex. The Supreme Court faced this issue in Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. v. Bartlett, where they had to decide if a New Hampshire tort design-defect claim was preempted by federal law under impossibility preemption. The outcome may hinge on how the claim is interpreted under state law and the purpose of the federal law. In a case involving a state tort cause of action, the majority of Justices determined that the claim imposed a duty on the defendant, leading to preemption. However, dissenting Justices argued that the claim only created an incentive for the defendant to make changes. This highlights the complexity of analyzing state common law claims and the potential for differing judicial interpretations. The debate on federal data security and breach legislation involves questions about whether state common law negligence claims impose legal requirements on defendants to improve data security practices or simply seek compensation for injuries. This raises concerns about potential conflicts with federal laws aiming for uniformity nationwide. The debate on federal data security and breach legislation includes discussions on which federal agency should enforce the new requirements, primarily focusing on the roles of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FTC has broad authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to address unfair or deceptive acts affecting commerce. The FTC has broad authority to address unfair or deceptive acts affecting commerce, but there are exemptions including banks, credit unions, common carriers, air carriers, and entities subject to the Packers and Stockyards Act. This limits the FTC's enforcement actions in certain cases. The FTC uses its authority to address unfair or deceptive acts in data breach cases, focusing on companies' claims about data security and failure to safeguard consumer data. Telecommunications common carriers are not subject to FTC authority but must follow FCC rules. The FCC rules require telecommunications common carriers to protect customer information and ensure fair and reasonable practices related to data security. This applies to entities classified as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. Common carriers, including broadband Internet access service providers, are classified under Title II of the Communications Act. They must protect customer information, specifically customer proprietary network information (CPNI), and ensure it is not disclosed to third parties without customer approval or as required by law. CPNI is customer information that includes call records, location data, service features, and billing records. FCC regulations outline when carriers can share CPNI without customer approval. The FCC regulations require carriers to obtain customer approval before sharing CPNI, including call records and billing information. Carriers must notify customers and law enforcement in case of a CPNI breach. The FCC does not exempt Internet service providers from Section 222 regulations, emphasizing the importance of consumer privacy in broadband services. The FCC chose not to apply CPNI rules to Internet service providers, stating that the rules are not well-suited for broadband services. However, providers must still comply with Section 222 regulations. The FCC can enforce data breach actions using its Section 201(b) authority, ensuring common carriers' practices are just and reasonable. In 2015, AT&T entered a consent decree following an FCC investigation. In 2015, the FCC entered a consent decree with AT&T for failing to protect CPNI, leading to a data breach. The FCC found AT&T's lack of encryption for customer data stored on public servers violated Section 222 and was unjust and unreasonable under Section 201(b). This highlights the FCC's ability to hold carriers accountable for data security breaches. The FCC can use tools to hold carriers accountable for data security failures, with statutory provisions imposing requirements on cable and satellite TV providers. Cable operators are prohibited from collecting personally identifiable information without consent and must prevent unauthorized access. Similar rules apply to satellite TV carriers, including protections for subscriber viewing history. Several bills in the 114th Congress address these data security requirements. Several bills in the 114th Congress propose changes to the FTC and FCC's enforcement authority regarding data security and breach notification. Common carriers under the Communications Act may not be subject to new requirements, while cable and satellite providers would be. Some bills aim to expand agency enforcement structure. Some bills in the 114th Congress propose changes to the FTC and FCC's enforcement authority regarding data security and breach notification. H.R. 1704 would expand the FTC's jurisdiction while leaving the FCC's existing authority intact. Common carriers and cable/satellite providers would be subject to both new FTC requirements and existing FCC requirements. Some bills aim to expand the FTC's jurisdiction and limit the FCC's authority in regulating data security. For instance, H.R. 1770 would remove the FCC's power to enforce certain sections of the Communications Act of 1934, except for regulations related to 9-1-1 calls. This would mean that common carriers and cable/satellite providers would be under the FTC's enforcement for data security measures. Some bills propose to limit the FCC's authority in regulating data security, shifting enforcement to the FTC. This change could impact the types of data subject to security and breach notification requirements. Opponents of limiting the FCC's authority argue that it weakens consumer protection by removing clear rules. They believe that the data protected under new federal requirements would be more limited, reducing consumer data protection. These issues will continue to be debated in Congress."
